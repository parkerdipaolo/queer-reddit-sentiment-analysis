Hello! I recently joined Miss Trans Global Philippines! Here’s my National Costume inspired by “Babaylan” or a Filipina transgender Goddess / High Priestess to remind our community’s place in the society #HappyPride 🌈 🏳️‍⚧️		"Yesssss ! 👌🏻👏🏻 gorgeous!!

This made me go ""holy shit"" out loud because of how impressively good it looks on you

I'm jealous of how it looks, but not from the same culture so I shouldn't replicate it. You rock the look though!!
Stunning!
😍😍😍😍
You absolutely do look like a trans goddess... 😍 -Supriya, intern at LemmeBe
Superbe Good luck
Your costume looks amazing❤
You look like a fucking goddess
G o r geous 😍😍😍💜
Be a woman! 🏳️‍🌈✨
Omg thank you! 😅
This means a lot! 🥰
Aww thank you!!
Ooh heellooo
Aww thank you 😭
Hi sis!! I’m so glad you came across my post! I will always fight for our visibility!! 🌈 🇵🇭 🏳️‍⚧️
Yay!!! 🌈
Thank you! I made the costume myself! I represent the province where this kind of traditional beadwork is taught in every school! 😄
Aww thank youuu!! 😍🤟🏽
It’s not in the best condition but if you want it I’ll send it to you! 😄
Trans and Asian! Perfect combination 😌😌 🌈
Woooow! Thank you! 🌈
I’m sure you are too! 😍🥰
I’m actually part of a tribal community that revered Babaylans! It’s in my blood!
I might be wrong but I think that shows up as a placeholder if someone uses a flag emoji that doesn't exist on Reddit or possibly even on your phone.
It’s the flag of trans community. Baby blue represents traditional color for boys, and pink for girls. White is for the folks in transition.
Hugs!! 🥺😢 You’re so nice I appreciate it!!
🥰
Thank you! 😍
Awwww lovee I’m blushing 😊
Thank you!!
😍🥰
Thank youuu!! Means a lot 😭
Thank you!!! 🥺
It is not that heavy hehehe 😄
Ooh thank you!
Babaylan is one of my faves , you served it baby !!!
I'm half Filipino aswell hehe :)
agree 200% 🙌🏽
Thats so great to hear! I am also from a tribal community but in Canada. I love seeing our cultures embrace our own ideas of gender. 

I saw from the other comments you made your own regalia too. That's so amazing you are very talented! 

Also you are so finnnnnnne in these pictures. Keep on shining bright and thanks for sharing!
Oh yeah this, I thought he was referring to the blue and pink trans flag
Yeah, basically the trans flag is a combination of the white flag unicode symbol and the trans unicode symbol, so if it isn't supported your computer/phone will just show those two next to each other.
huh strange it shows up as just white for me. Other emojis that I can’t see show up as a question mark in a box
you look gorgeous btw
Wooow awesomee hey there!!
Hey urself :)
Filipina transfem from Mindanao here! You are amazing!
Love it :)"	o5mgjv	trans	5370	0.96	2021-06-22 12:53:11

I have a question, if someone is a trans male then does that mean they were a woman that transformed into a man or they were a man that transformed into a woman?
>assuming this, you managed to get on hrt within 6 months of being out

what in the fucking fuck what
You are really pretty!
Congratulations. I hope you find nithing but happiness.

I'll take that as a compliment 🙂 I'm wearing Nars natural radiant foundation
Good angles and lighting help, also, many of us don't see ourselves the way others do.
I just looked at your profile and you're cute af, there's definitely changes :) I think we find it hard to see because we see ourselves so often that we don't notice the small gradual changes
Tell me you're repressed without telling me your repressed.

It's ok sweetie, you'll get there one day 😋
It is up to transphobes to be honest and upfront, not force us to out ourselves unless we want to , when being outed can lead to direct discrimination and violence, up to and including murder.
What do you mean? 🙊
OP accidentally replied as a top level comment. This is what OP said 

> Hii, a trans man is a person who identifies as a man but was assigned female at birth and a trans woman is the opposite, never worry about asking questions, as long as you are tactful and ask with the genuine purpose of understanding many people will be happy to answer 😊
I hope its not your intent, but the fact that ""bliss"" is superscripted makes it seem like theirs a more hostile tone to your message.
It’s just a mistake calm down
That's true, thank you, I just really want titties 🙃
They're backhandedly implying that we trans folks might try to deceive potential dates. I'm pretty sure they made the comment in bad faith.

Hair takes forever to grow out, but this month I'm taking PRIDE in my current length.		"Omg you’re stunning. You’re giving me like young Sandra bullock and / or Penelope Cruz.
Kinda giving me gothic vampire hunter and fem fatale vibes and I’m looooving it!!!!
God you're so gorgeous like holy cow you could be a goddess 😳
so i am definitely a lesbian
Stunning! I totally get wanting more hair length, but you are definitely making it work as it is
How are you so pretty omg (also what do u uses for ur hair, it looks great😅 not trying to be weird)
i see what you you did there. that was good very good. you look good to btw
Yes girl I'm LIVING for those bangs!
So beautiful
You are breathtakingly pretty! That hair length suits you so well :)
You are sooo prettyy
Okay this is probably a really weird complement, but girl, you got some beautiful teeth

(I think a normal person would have said beautiful smile, but I’m a gay disaster 😭)
GORGEOUS.
Oh my god you’re so pretty
You are wonderful I love your sweet smile so much so cute 🥰💖
I dunno you look REALLY GOOD with that length. Try it long, but honestly? This is stunning.
I love your hair, it's such a pretty color. It's also super cute.
God I wish having passing with short hair, even with long hair people still call me a man ;-;
Your hair is going to look **amazing** when it's long.
Short haired girls are just as cute and just as valid
Not every girl can pull off short hair, but your eye shape and delicate jawline make it totally work! Super pretty :)
Holy godamn! I’m starstruck!
Ann Hathaway vibes all the way 😍
AAAA!!~~~ YOU'RE SOOO GORGEOUS!!! JSSJDHDDHHSKSODH *hugs cutely*
You should. You look great.🥰
I love your hair!
I wish I could do lovely soft makeup like that 😍 you are beautiful.
You literally have the haircut that I want! I have a pixie right now and I can't WAIT to get my hair to your length. Ya look gorgeous!
Short hairstyles are pretty!! 
This one is no exception babe
Ooooo very 40s (I think, might be getting my eras wrong)

Anyways I love it !!!!!
Funny, I’m getting Molly Ringwald vibes, you’re adorbs! 🖤
Im jealous of how good you look

I mean omg 😳🤩 you look so amazing🥺
And your hair is beautiful!!!
This hairstyle is so pretty on you omg
You're stunning and the haircut suits you so well! You look great!
Short hair always looks so cute tho oml! And the way you styled ittt, so pretty!!
you can use rice water to help with hair growth
Wow, you made good use of your shorter hair there! gives me hope :)
Yo holy shit is that a panda

Also you look really good
That hair style suits you so nicely!
just watched tangled and you're kinda reminding me of rapunzel after her hair gets chopped, looking good! :D
Biotin and caffeinated shampoo. They work wonders on growth.

I went from ear length to middle of back in 6 months
Im saving this cause I love your hair - and Im currently for the first time growing my hair out longer than usual, mine looks like such a mess right now. Hope I can get it out to look similar to this!
you are so pretty! best of luck of your hair growing journey :) (sorry if that sounds weird lol)
Looks good! Keep taking care of it. Condition, brush when dry, and get a micro trim or a split end repair treatment if you get split ends. :)
Mane and tail shampoo great for growing hair
Omg I love your bangs!! And your eye liner is looking SHARP
You're SO very pretty...
kinda looks like a cosplay of Makoto Niijima
Beautiful haircut

Bonita😍😍😍, feliz meS.

Hair really is slow.  But omg you look lovely!
Looks great that length like a badass rogue
Beautiful

You look super cute!!!!!
If nobody knew, they’d think you’re cis 


If this isn’t clear it’s a compliment, you look great
That length is so cute!! I'm no hair expert but isn't that called a bob? Very cool style
YOU ARE SO FRIVKIN CUTE omg 😭😻
Looking gorgeous with that hairstyle!!!
You are very good at eyeliner!! You should be proud that you're so damn gorgeous!!!
You'll make it there soon <3   
I have one thing to thank my past self for. And that is wanting to grow out my hair 3-4 years ago. And I have one thing I will never forgive my past self for. And that is not standing up for myself when my mom tricked me into cutting my hair off 2 years ago.
Love your makeup!!
I love your hair. It looks perfect. Also, your smile? Is from the angels.
Your killing it Gorgeous!
You look like a young molly ringwald
Hair takes so long to grow but yours is looking great!
Looks cute, and I'm sure it'll only get better as it grows.
Sooo pretty 😍
Congratulations, you pass!!
Fucking gorg
a tip for growing it out is to trim it when the moon is in a water sign! this has nothing to do with astrology but it works. i cut my hair when the moon was on a fire sign and it hasn’t grown a single inch when it usually grows fast! just search up a moon calandra
I'm waiting for the impending moment when your hair is too short to wisp behind your ear and too long so it gets in your eyes. 😆 Hair clips are your friend. 

You look amazing.
Wow!
I have an aunt who looks just like you, you look amazing! I wish I had hair half as good as yours.
I have the same issue. Which is why I don't volunteer to have my hair cut
I mean it does look pretty cute short too
Ungh absolutely stunning 💖💖
you’re absolutely gorgeous!
Ahhh! You look awesome! :>
And yeah, hair takes an awful long time to grow out >:/
Stunning
Keep it growing, lady! You look so lovely
I love it. It's so chic
That's a good length!  Very pretty.   Happy Pride!
Omg your eyes AND your hair! 🥰
You look incredible!
It looks amazing
Omg girl youre so cute😭😭😭😭
You're very cute
I have hair down to my butt, but I would cut it immediately if I knew that it would end up looking as awesome as yours!
so cute!💗
You are so gorgeous!  I'm still in the midst of trying to learn how to style longer hair
You look awesome!
Aren't you like YouTube famous? 🤔I think I have seen short tiktok reuploads on Youtube. 🤔🤔

Wow, you are gorgeous! And your hair is fabulous :)

You damn well should.  You look great and your current style is cute as hell.
Pretty woman
Oh yes! She looks like Sandra Bullock.
I’d say Anne Hathaway. Amazing!
Omg because you mentioned vamp hunters, that hair looks almost identical to Alice's in twilight 😍
[removed]
My hair is bone straight. I use mousse and scrunch like crazy after a shower, and once that loses its volume (usually a day or two) I like to go at it with a curling iron for a beachy curled look. Usually I curl a lower half of my hair (where my ear / eyeline starts) in 4-5 partitions on each side from face to back for volume (always curling away from my face), then go for another 4-5 on each side of the hair above my ear.
🤣 my dentist calls me bigtooth, thanks 🥰
I came to the comments to say the same thing. Unusually stunning teeth/mouth. I am jelly of that smile /u/Hailey-June
En la primera foto te pareces a Molly Ringwald en el club de los cinco, pero me gustas más tú.
Isn't she I need a date for the prom she's ready!
That ain't me! I've thought about twitch streaming though!
Ohhh yeah now that you mention it.
Your dentist doesn’t deserve you!

Unless they cute, in which case, girl why you not hooking me up with this fine dentist?!
Oh nice. 👍👍👍
Im also on twitch😊"	nulktg	trans	4759	0.96	2021-06-07 19:42:58
It really tested my confidence to go out to celebrate pride on Saturday where the bars and streets were just packed with people, wearing this ultra short dress that was basically the trans flag. Aside from having to pull it down every two steps, I didn't regret it though		"Girl where did you find that dress?! I would love to get one for myself.
OMG this is sooooo cute 🥰
You look very pretty! Pride is about holding your head up high! Dont let anyone else get you down!
omg where did u get that dress??? 😍
So proud! I’m jealous of your shaving game 😂 I can’t seem to ditch the red bumps
Oh hey! I follow you on insta. I really admire your bravery, considering this is Texas.

looks real good on you... glad that you didn't change your mind and go conservative (i'm thinking i'dhave got to the front door mirror and felt like ""well, looks great, but... no... you can't"" ;) ).

its good when any of us post wearing great stuff... i had to see posts of trans women wearing bikinis before i had confidence to do it myself :)

obtw, the store now has size S of the dress back in stock... i'm... sorely tempted (specially cos on sale)
Judging by your looks it shouldn't have taken much of a boost in confidence to wear that out.
Omg! Where did yoh get this dress? I neeeeeeedz it!

It looks great on you
Cute dress
Love the dress xx
You look great! Although I feel like saying that it's ""basically"" the trans flag is underselling it a bit lol
You look ravishing. Shame you couldn't show off your ""clitty"".🥰😅

Yeah it 100% is the trans flag lmao but they look good

Uh oh
DON'T BUY DOLLSKILL
Awesome!! You look amazing in the dress. Now I just need to figure out my size so I can get one for myself
Hey uh, just so you know that's a really bad brand.

wow! its actually so cheap atm!
omg that site is dangerously awesome!

Yeah i saw you said it was dollskill but i had na issue finding it. ❤️
What did they say?
For the uninformed, and definitely not me as I am super well informed and aware of these things...why?

They may just have extra small right now though. It's pretty stretchy, I wear a medium and I'm 155 lb.
they said (literal quote) >!WHERE ARE YOUR GENITALS!<
https://www.quora.com/Why-is-Dollskill-a-bad-brand
Lots of reasons but they steal art and are anti blm
Thanks im a bit heavier maybe theyll get a large soon ❤️☺️
They also pay their models extremely low wages even though the store makes an insane amount of money. Overall, it seems the owner is an awful person :(
I had other sizes but I think they're sold out. :(
Well thanks for the link i can keep my eyes out ☺️❤️ have a great day
Wait, nobody wanted an extra small trans flag dress? And now it's on super discount? Hahaha.
I know right? I actually have a trans friend and she is fortunate enough to fit into an extra small!"	ntwmes	trans	4617	0.98	2021-06-06 21:51:31
Happy pride 🏳️‍⚧️ 2 months hrt and spiro		"Gorgeous
I love your look, the hair, nails and dress all really work!
2 months! You look so incredible! Congratulations! 🤩
No. Way. In just two months, HRT does NOT work that fast.
[deleted]
Wow you're gorgeous🥺😩 goals for sure💝
*Two months?!* You look incredible!
All the folks decrying ""two months HRT"" may not realize that she may be on the back end of years of *social transition*. You don't need a prescription for laser or electrolysis, or any feminizing surgeries if you have enough money.
Stunning <3
I deeply envy your sense of fashion
Your dress is from Zaful right? Is the material comfortable?
beautiful 😊😍😊
Those legs tho! ❤
Oh my gosh you're gorgeous  
How are you this far when I'm still boymoding with 2 months HRT?  


Love the dress and shoes, super cute

EDIT: I am dumb and mixed up words, fixed now
Wow. That dress is stunning. And your waistline is to die for ❤️❤️
omg cute dress where’d u get it :-D
Only 2 months??  Are you serious?!  I would have guessed 5 years+!
Did you do something before the 2 months of Spiro and hrt? If not you have had incredible results!
Happy pride sweetheart.
Your so hot
Hey not to be rude but I will be stealing your entire look now. Thank you.

Very lovely!
I love your dress. Where did you get it?
Thanks 🥰
Stunning and brave!
Thank you bestie 💖
100% agree..but why not Google search ""lilibanana yupoo"" for more fashion ideas?😍
2 months!!!!
Thank you! Sis is feeding y’all the wrong info lol
Honestly this. HRT is truely amazing, but it's impossible to do everything in such a short timespan. A friend of mine has a really good transition with fast changes, and after 14 months she looks amazing. But at 2 months, she didn't have any physical changes apart from the reduced libido, change of smell, and sore nips xD
YMMV
I have a feeling that she was using puberty blockers before this and is really young.
It's a dragon that comes and eats all of your testosterone.
Blocks the testosterone in my body
I’m sure you look stunning as well 💖💖💖
Thank you 🥰🥰🥺
From forever 21, and very comfortable...
🥰🥰 thank you
As much as I want to believe it, I find it HIGHLY unlikely. HRT is amazing! But it doesn't work that fast :p though makeup, and other stuff can make you look amazing as well :)
Damn, how the hell are you already stealthing at 2 months? It took me a year and a half just to pass and present - and whilst I never really want to stealth for my own moral reasons, You're really lucky if you can do it at as little as 2 months!
Forever 21, I think it was $17
Just laser really... and let my hair grow
Yesss go off queen 🥰❤️
Its called Unclockable tape
It's a form of testosterone blocker. Not 100% sure if it also classifies as a DHT blocker though.

The hrt was a bonus for me, I have always looked feminine. I’ve transition two years ago but wasn’t on pills. I take care of myself, I did competitive cheer and my body serves looks. So yes that’s only 2 months
And I’m brazilian, definitely have the genes

It looks pretty and your nails are nice too! You are am absolute queen i hope to be atleast as much out of ten as you are 11? 13? I dont knoe but a lot
youre welcome thanks for share 💕

Yes, you’re absolutely right I got my terminology mixed and meant the exact opposite. I’m very sorry ._.

It was a long day for me yesterday
Heh, yeah I wish 

Turns out I was using that word wrong for quite some time 😅

What I meant was basically the total opposite. I can pass, with a lot of effort, until I speak or forget to put on enough makeup so I hide me being trans in public most of the time. 

Sorry I had a rough day and was tired and mixed up my terminology
Nice. I usually just roll with OG Duck Tape.
Oh!

Sorry, I should have figured it out from context but I guess I was just oblivious at the time :p

Happy pride month from the Prettiest Platypus on webtoons!		"I am sending hugs for the author, the last few chapters hit me hard emotionally, and I can't imagine how hard it was for you to remember these moments
Link to the comic: https://www.webtoons.com/en/challenge/the-prettiest-platypus/list?title\_no=463063
A platypus??? THE PRETTIEST PLATYPUS???!!!!
I'm... Livid. My mom said similar stuff to me, she is begging me to not call for attention and ""go slow"" with my transition. I'm not a child, I'm 27 but she is treating me like one. Many things said in this comic sound exactly like her and that gets me very mad.

I love you Sophie, I'm sorry you went through all this. What wrong with parents? Why are they always the most stubborn and offensive? My 80 yo grandma took it perfectly and probably loves me even more for it, but my mom lost her shit. *Sigh*
Love this! Awesome
Welp I just saw this post and binge read the entire thing.
AWWWWWW!!!!! Also, the trans girl's outfit totally reminds me of one of my own, yay for skater skirts XD

Love this!

 i love this !!
Hell yeah!!💜

Happy pride month!!!!!!!
Never heard of this comic before but this adorable artwork combined with the invocation of our equally adorable friend the platypus has piqued my interest!

(I was about to make a *very insightful* comment about how did you ever think that the platypus is kind of like nature's trans animal...and then I immediately realized that's undoubtedly why you used it. 😅)
love this comic so much.

my heart goes out to you u/PrettiestPlatypus
Amazing work. This was really touching. Relatable even. Thanks for the hard work in making this comic, something I can deeply understand but would never be able to put in the same light or same way.
Oh my god it's so pretty
Had never heard of this comic, just binged through every episode and can’t get enough.
happy pride month <3
One of my favorite webtoons! Happy Pride Month!!!
Hiii PrettiestPlatypus, just wanted to say I really like you webtoon! Chapter 10 was... wow intense. Its a emotional chapter and thank you for the beautiful comics.

Also you are amazing and please have some digital internet hugs it <3
Ahh I love them all

Does it get better? It seemed cheesy and heavy-handed about basic stuff before and I’m like ahh ok 👍
Yeah. I have to wait until I’m in the right headspace to read chapter 10 I think after that lead-in. Gonna be an emotional one. Hope there is light at the end of the tunnel for Lillie.
I read everything already! Great comic, it hurts how real it can get. Thank you!
Wow how dare you link this just so I can cry omg thank you aaaaaaaaaa
I love the series so much and it’s been great watching your art style progress throughout the chapters
PERRY THE PLATYPUS??!?!?!!?!?!?!?
ah yes. concludes that from a webcomic with a trans character. very good reasoning, very well educated. /s
Picrews are love,

Picrews are life.
i mean i think two of them are sisters, but other pairings among them could totally happen
I just read it too and it went almost the same way for me except swap the mom and father's perspectives on her being trans and you've got how it went down for me

So cute!
You both have lovely curls! 😍

Both beautiful!
Thank you! U look amazing as well!
This is really sweet. A lot of people have commented since childhood that I look like my mother, and I always took pride in that. Now you’ve inspired me to look through the massive treasure trove of family photos I have and see if there’s anyone else I resemble.
So classy and cute! I LOVE it 💙💗🤍💗💙
Strong genes. You're both beautiful ladies with great hair
Naw, you got your own nailed down.
I recommend you check out r/curlyhair!
Generations came for you and gave you beauty
Back then women would frequently visit the salon to get these types of dos, so don't feel so bad.
love a throwback. it's in your heritage mama!
You look so much like her! You're both gorgeous, and that hairstyle looks so pretty on you!
Wow! You really do look just like her!
She was so pretty and so are you

Yea my grandma isnt trans but i thought i had a cool resemblance!
The top few things I learned from there: no sulphates ever, shampoo every few days but condition every day, pat hair dry (don’t ruffle it up) and like lean over and push your curls into your hair with a towel. Those were a total game changer for me.
You definitely do ☺️"	nx4yb2	trans	3748	0.98	2021-06-11 02:18:52
My boss / coworker has a trans daughter, and I absolutely ADORE his enthusiasm about the subject.	"I was working yesterday with this guy - a super kind dude - and he was telling me about his kids.

He explained, ""I got two kids. And, I'm still learning, but one of them is transgender. And she always teaching me stuff. I really support that stuff, I really wanna support my kids.""

So, I looked at him, held up my pride lanyards (one gay flag, one trans flag) and said, ""Well, if you have any questions you can ask me, because I'm trans, too."" Enter in the shock and the 'I had no idea's, as I pass 100%, nowadays.

Then, to my surprise, he started absolutely *gushing* about his daughter to me, showing me pictures, talking about the hormones he's buying her, about how he's always learning, she's always teaching him. Because, as he explained, there were three main reasons he is so adamant about support:

* He used to be very homophobic, as he said he was in a gang and that's just how people thought. He said that's the old him, and the new him ain't like that.
* In the black community, he said it's real dangerous and frowned upon - ""and it shouldn't be, it shouldn't be at all"" he told me - so he wants to make sure his daughters are loved and safe.
* Because he has complete custody over them, alone, he wants them to grow up safe and strong and knowing that they're loved.

It made me want to cry. I kept telling him, ""You're such an amazing parent. You're such a good person."" Since there are so many of us that are alone, or feel alone, especially when it comes to family, I wanted him to understand how much I appreciate what he's doing. This guy just made me *so damn happy.* He cares so *much* about his kids.

Of course, he's trying his best, and he apparently texted his daughter something like, ""I met a transgender at work!"" To which she told him, ""Actually, dad, use transgender PERSON. But awesome!"" Or something like that, you know?

And he was so *excited* to show me his mistake, saying, ""Education is so important. It's so important to keep learning.""

When I told him that I'm happy he supports this trans girl, he asked, ""So when you say 'trans girl' you mean...someone like my daughter?""

I explained, ""It's just like when you have 'boy' and 'girl', only you're tacking on 'trans'. They're still boys and girls."" Right?

He was *elated,* like, ""Oh I get it! See, that's so important to know!""

I adore this man. He's trying his best, of *course* he isn't perfect, but just seeing him trying and wanting to keep his daughters happy and safe gave me fucking *life.* In a world where I always fear trans kids have to grow up alone, knowing this teenager is loved and accepted by her father is the greatest thing.

Anyways...I just really wanted to share this. It was so wholesome.

**EDIT: Aw man, I'm so glad I ain't the only one who was just** ***hype*** **with happiness / near crying at this! Hope everyone is doing okay! <3**"	"this is so wholesome
That's so wholesome It makes me want to cry. I wish the world had more parents like him in it
this made me cry lol
I'm actually crying. Tell this blessed man he gives hope to all the tiny trans people in your phone haha
I really enjoyed reading that, thanks for sharing!
[deleted]
It's awesome to read something so positive, thank you for sharing!
I squealed when reading this post. This is so freaking cute!!
That dad is a Saint! 

I'm so afraid of my environment if I eventually do decide to transition, they will react badly. But maybe I'm the real transphobe...
Lord, this is more wholesome than a quart of fresh milk! 🤗🤗🤗🤗🤗
Thank you for sharing! That was incredible.
This post is turning so many people into waterfalls…this post is so bitter sweet to a lot of us. I hope we all can find someone as encouraging as this father.
This needs to go on r/wholesome and r/mademesmile
That’s so amazing!
Oh I needed to see this today, glad to see there are amazing people out there!
Man, I wish my parents or brother were half as enthusiastic. Anything that's hard or they don't like, they'll just say, ""I'm old"" or ""I love you so you shouldn't be upset,"" instead of trying to learn about the community, our experience, or change behavior when told something it's harmful or phobic. 

Nonetheless,  I'm still happy for her - her father is a blessing and may they stay close 💜🏳️‍🌈
Bless him.
Oh my god this is so cuteeeeeee
What an awesome person, if only everyone could think like him!
Hes a legend and the kind of parent any LGBTQ kid needs
chills and tears welling rn tbh
This is just the most wholesome thing. Thank you for sharing!
This is so wholesome it made me want to cry
My heart is going pitter patter pitter patter and it’s getting really warm in there. We need more parents like this, that are excited to learn more, get educated and more open. Not a lot of parents are like that, most of the time they tend to draw back and be more closed off even if they consider themselves open. In my experience it’s not easy to teach a parent when they live by the idea that “I was born first and am older so I know more than you” or “well it’s not like that back in my day and I never knew about it so I don’t think it’s that great. It’s just a trend anyway and you don’t know who you are.” I appreciate parents like him who are so ready to actually care for their kids and learn from them to make it better for them. Bless his soul and his entire heart and family
This is my motivation for the day. I'm glad there are parents out there like this. It makes me so happy!!!
You've got a great friend! I adore how wholesome this is!
I’m crying on the bus now. This was so lovely
We need more people like this
Damn.

This post made me want a good dad. I didn’t know they existed like this 😢🥺
Can he be my dad? 🥺
I

Am

Crying
Thank you, thank you, thank you for sharing this.
I have not been feeling great and I needed this. Please more of this on this sub.
This is so sweet ahhh Im tearing up omg
What I'd give to have my parents be like this...
I needed this today. My mom chewed me out for forty minutes straight last night about disliking my transition and this was after a half hour of right wing covid propaganda... I'm 23, I'm an adult, I hate that she feels she has the right to do that. So seeing someone actually be a supportive and caring parent for their trans child is refreshing. Thank you for the dopamine hit today. Wishing you and his family the best.
I love that omg what a brilliant dad
Thank you so much for sharing this!!! I’m a ‘new mom’ of a 23 year old daughter and this is making me so so happy. Thank you
i love this sooo much.  i love that he is sooo happy about learning and he cares and wants to make sure he does the right thing.
Hey, who's cutting onions? 😭
I have a coworker similar to this! He's an older white man, and while he doesn't have a trans child, he does get attached to younger coworkers in a really supportive ""fatherly"" way. Two trans people work there, one being me, and he's always trying to research and learn about trans stuff. Always trying to make sure he's referring to us in ways that we're comfortable with, and apologizing for any mistakes, though his mistakes don't hurt as bad because he actually puts genuine effort towards it. He's a serious sweetheart! ♥️
Fuck, now I’m crying
There’s nothing more uplifting than a person telling you they support the trans community before they know you’re a part of it. Because people will obviously tell you how they’re supportive after they know, almost to the point that it can seem insincere.  But your boss realistically didn’t know how you would respond to hearing about his trans daughter and he told you how proud he was of her anyway.  Great guy.
Aww he sounds like a great parent. If he’s on FB, there’s an educational group called “You Might Wanna Learn More About Trans People” that he might benefit from joining. Everyone is welcome there and he can ask questions if he has any and get answers from trans and nonbinary folks with lived experience.
We need more parents these like these
🎼💕🎶❤
Awww 🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰

Definitely not crying...
I was really worried about my boss at work, who is an opinionated older white woman (who could easily be a terf, she gives off those kinds of vibes) but when I came out to her she literally said ""that's great! My granddaughter is trans. Do you need any help finding places that stock cute shoes in your size?"" 😍

Enthusiastic trans ally bosses are the best!
All the hugs for this guy!!
I *love* parents like that!

He may not know all the terms yet, he may not know the best way to say things yet, but he’s enthusiastically supportive, and willing to learn and fix his mistakes.

What a wonderful ally and support his daughter has!
omg 🥺🥺🥺 good dad alert 🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺

this is something I emphasize to any of my cis friends when they ask questions or are confused: it's always okay to grow. if you don't know something, then you just don't know, but as long as you're open to learning and growth then you'll do alright in this world
this is one of the sweetest stories I've read ever ;u;
I love parents who are accepting of thier LGBT+ kids
What a great person!  That's true love and curiosity at its best and made my day!
I'm crying reading this. I have never met this man but I would die to keep him safe. What an absolute gem.
whatever smiling and weeping at the same time is called that’s me
Someone so enthusiastic to learn and grow who cares so much. Oh it makes my heart soar.

His daughter is so, so lucky.
Omg, reading this made me cry. This beautiful person, bending in the wind as he learns, and being so enthusiastic about learning about his daughter’s transition, and walking with her…I want to hug him. I want to hug his neck and tell him that he’s the parent we all deserve. Mine are supportive, but not enthusiastic like this. And for him to cone from the background he came from…he is a truly beautiful person. Thank you for sharing.
My kiddo (13) came out to my wife and me as non-binary recently. While it was a bit of a shock, we are doing everything we can to support them because they’re our child and we love them more than anything in the world. I don’t understand a parent who would do otherwise, it makes no sense at all.

That being said, love you all here and if you need a dumb gen X dad to tell you that you’re wonderful just as you are, I’m here for you.
Holy moly that’s some serious love. We love to see it
Omg I'm in tears that's so adorable and great! I wish every trans*person could have a dad like him <3
I really love this. ❤️
I fucking love this. Give your boss my regards, and tell him this trans girl would love to have him as a father.
Aww that’s so wonderful ❤️ trans kids need parents like that it touches my heart 😭
This is so so so amazing, hearing him so excited to learn and being so proud and excited for his daughter is just amazing! She's one lucky kid and I'm glad he's your boss!!!
“No man is an island entire of itself”, and this man makes the whole so much more wholesome.

I hope this man lives another 50 years at least, because the minute he’s gone it’ll be like an entire continent sank into the sea.
I want to hug this precious man. I'm so happy for his daughter, and his children in general that they have such a good father, and I'm so happy for you that your boss is so amazing.
I'm going to cry this is so wholesome
literally my mum
I wish my dad was this enthusiastic about me being Trans🥺
I absolutely adore hearing about awesome parents like this!
i LOVE the fact that hes so excited to show that he made a mistake and learned from it. most people (especially transphobes) are just too scared of making a mistake, so when they do make one, they pretend that they are right and really just make the situation so much worse. the fact that he is willingly talking about his mistakes and how he evolved from them is just so heartwarming
Dude show him all these lovely responses he got on this post, he gotta know that what he’s doing is not taken for granted and that he’s fucking acing this parenting thing!
I wish I had a Dad like that and not one on the complete opposite end. It woulda helped me transition at a way younger age and/or at least be confident in who I am.
Parents like this really give me hope. Supportive and proud parents of trans kids, you're fighting against the tide and doing amazing.
Hi hornies
ugh

wholesomeee
Such wholesome tears running down my face!

His curiosity and love are so beautiful to exist at all, and to have been able to read about and experience it; it is so lovely to know that there are people out there so utterly loved and cared for.

I wish we could have all of such curiosity to withhold judgment about things we do not *yet* understand and the empathy and love to fully take them all in.

May they all have as much happiness as they can hold.
This makes me so incredibly happy. Shit, I'm crying.
Please tell this amazing man, that he's giving many of us so much hope that it's to meet people who are supportive.
my dad couldve really learned something from that guy😭thats so sweet
A late comment but please keep us updated on him if something else happens, I wanna learn about what he learns!!
This is how it should be.
Now you see, it's people like him, he's why we CAN have nice things!

\+1 Faith in Humanity
Well now I’m crying. I wish I had parents like this.
This is so adorable I actually teared up a bit. I would've given anything for a dad like that.
Yo can we clone this guy?
I'm glad he is so big on it.  Even accepting parents can have their negative moments and that sticks with you, so seeing that he's both positive and willing to learn is awesome.  I've had to remind people a time or two that their child/cousin/sibling/whatever is still their child/cousin/sibling/whatever no matter their gender.
This is literally all we want. 99% of days I deal with my mom’s transphobia I say I want to cut her out of my life completely but on the 1%, I’m just so sad and lost and I realize… God I wish my mom would just love me. I wish her love wasn’t so transactional in that I have to be everything she wants me to be for her to smile at me and love me and be there for me. I wish she would help me and support me and realize that I’m just happier this way and be happy for me. It’s so fucking hard, so so so fucking hard to go through it by myself without a parent’s reassurance. Sure, you can have a partner, a best friend, a good support system in spite of all estrangement but sometimes not having a parent support you just hits different…
Lowkey dad of the year... I applaud that he's trying to learn and be more accepting and mature than his former self.
This made my day
If we were all like this man the world would be a better place. I hope he's doing well :]
Meanwhile my parents:

Look, I know you won't get it right 100% of the time right away and that's okay, just put in an effort, okay? That's all I'm asking for.

What? No we can't POSSIBLY do that, this is asking WAY too much, this is all so complicated oh by the way deadname, why do you seem to never talk to us?
Wholesome parent posts really are a bright shining light these days
Protect this man at all costs
I cry every time I hear a story like this. It makes me so happy that fewer and fewer trans kids have to go through what I did.
Awwww this makes me so happy!!🥺 Wish more people were like him!
I wish I had parents like these so I don’t need to continue to hide in fear
He sounds so sweet!
I want to hug him and his daughter🥺🥺
* waves and points to himself* I'm trying to be like him.
It's so wholesome it DID make me cry 😭
Dude, I was getting all teary-eyed in the middle of my shift haha.
same lol made my day
Same here and I seldom cry from positive feelings. This makes me so incredibly happy!
I absolutely *will* tell him! <3
Of course! :D
Right? I'm thinking of telling him, the next time I see him, that I made an anonymous post about him. Show him everyone's comments and stuff. Because I think it may make him happy to know just how *awesome* he is in everyone's eyes, now.
Absolutely, no problem!
No, no, that's a valid fear. I know so many people that are terrified to come out or begin transitioning, even in adulthood and living on their own / away from parents, because the fear of abandonment or being hated by those who supposedly love you just *hurts.* So, you have every right to be afraid, in my opinion.

Hope things get easier for you. <3
Of course! It was absolutely amazing, so I just really wanted to share it with everyone!
Hopefully that's a good ""ugh""? I'm sorry, I hope this didn't upset you. I just really wanted to share some positivity.
I mean, homie, I perused through your posts. I know you're seemingly for right-wing political values. You don't need to disguise your trolling as actual concern, you can come out and say, ""I'm transphobic."" It's totally okay, sweetie.
Same here!!!
You're a great parent then!
Same here same 😂
❤️
And he’s helped a mom too
And you did, to use your words that gave me fucking *life* :D

LGB with the T! 🏳️‍⚧️🏳️‍🌈		"I want to show this to my mother who insists that the idea that some people are transgender is some newfangled phenomenon that never happened before Caitlyn Jenner. 🤦🏻‍♀️
we should bring back trans power thats cool as hell and ive never heard anyone use it
I cannot believe people are trying to remove major community founders because they don't like including trans people 🙄

Stone wall literally happened because of trans people.
I LOVE the pin that says homophobia can be cured…with education. Same with transphobia. 

The sad part? These pins are over 40 years old. The Trumpers and Thumpers had 40 years to educate themselves…and yet we’re regressing even further with new laws
Hell yeah. I need the gays against nazis and queers bash back pins
really anyone who thinks that trans isn't intertwined with it needs to go read about what actually happened at Stonewall and how it started 🧱
Worth noting that the Stonewall Inn was a favoured place for trans people. We were there from the very beginning of Pride
I just hate looking at LGBT be listed without the 'T'  being inherent to the fucking 4 letters.

Like.

It has literally always be LGBT, and it's only been expanded to include more and more.

The concept of shitty people every suggesting we can drop  letters is a direct insult from members in our community.
These are great pins, and I agree that our struggles have long been intertwined, but this photo doesn't actually prove that. Could just as easily throw in a random button and make the same basic argument (that X and pride have always been intertwined).
I sadly have to say that these trans pins are almost certainly fakes. ""Retro Styled"" but modern made.



I was there in the 80s, and to even describe the past, I have to use a lot of very out of date language.

We didn’t have the word “Trans” or even ""Transgender"". Back then (and into the 90s) there was a strict divide between what was then called Drag Queens, Crossdressers, Transvestites, and Transsexuals. And as far as everyone knew, ""Female to Male Transsexuals"" seemingly only existed in theory. Unicorns. Complete Erasure.



The language, even among members of 'the community', struggled with the heavy medicalization of things, as even the medical community struggled to understand that some “born as male” individuals might want to socially transition to “live as female”, while not wanting “sex reassignment surgery”. Concepts of sex and gender being words for different things were fringe at the time. Concepts like ""Gender Identity"", ""Gender Roles"", ""Gender Presentation"" were still years off from becoming mainstream.



As I say, the language surrounding these “in-between, permanent, lifestyle transitioners” struggled a lot against popular terms of the era like “female impersonator”.. and one term that many settled on was “Transgenderist”. The medical community struggled to name and even accept what they’d later call “non-op transsexuals” and in the era, you often couldn’t get legal access to hormones without convincing providers that you eventually did want SRS. Forget about gender markers on legal documents. 



Communities in the San Francisco area, largely influenced by the number of computer enthusiasts within the community, started using ""Trans*"", to try and bridge the Transsexual, Transgenderist, and Transvestite divide. (Though in truth, the cross dresser community, as the term “transvestite” was used as a largely derogatory term even among the Ts, Tg, and Cd communities, as it was almost universally targeted at people who cross dressed for purposes of sexual arousal).

One thing that really highlights a lot of the issues, is that sexual orientation was strongly coupled to these terms.. so for example, if you were born male, and you were into guys, and wanted to dress like a girl, they called you a ""Drag Queen"" even if you weren't into the flamboyant performative schtick. And if you WERE into that flamboyant performative stuff.. but you liked girls.. you were ""a Crossdresser.""

And if you were Bisexual... they didn't know what to do with you.

Similarly, lesbianism and bisexuality among transsexuals and transgenderists was largely not talked about, as particularly within the medical field, a 'towards females' sexual orientation was seen as a reason to deny access to medical and legal transition, medication, and surgeries.

It was a very ugly time, and the communities largely defined themselves by what they weren’t, how they were different.. rather than what we had in common. 

Nowadays we’re almost drowning in choices of terminology, so it’s hard to think of a world where the terms you used depended on your sexual orientation, and that you access to medical care and legal support for name and sex marker changes depended on a knife.

We've come a long way since then, and for all the rose-tinted nostalgia for John Hughes films, I wouldn't go back to the way things were for the trans community. We still have a long way to go, but look how far we've come from the mess back then.
How do these show that LGB and T issues are intertwined? /genq

I believe they are, but if anything this tells me that racism and queerphobia have always been intertwined. And to be an extra-asshole these seem to be from the late 90's/early 2000s as suggested by the bottom left and potentially bottom middle pins. Those flags weren't around in the 80's afaik.
I don’t think the Trans Pride/Trans Power pin is from the 1980s. The term *trans* (not one of the several precursor words which activists either coined or used to describe themselves and their communities) wasn’t really used until the 90s, when the older concepts and terms were being replaced by a new wave of thinking and activism. I can’t find one archival publication reflecting the use of *trans* from the 80s. Just a tiny nitpick, keeping history accurate is important for all of us. Great set of pins here, regardless!

I want that bi pin so fucking hard!!!
I NEED these.
May I know where I can get those pins? If I still can get them though.
I AM NOT EVEN BI AND I WANT THE BI PIN FKSVDIWB
TRANS RIGHTS ARE HUMAN RIGHTS 🏳️‍⚧️🏳️‍⚧️🏳️‍⚧️🏳️‍⚧️
Damn I want some of these pins now they look rad
love the middle one. Also gays against nazis. Awesome
Thank you i needed this
I need gimme
Anywhere still making these pins? I want the bisexual one that's sick
That bi pride one looks dope
I'm not bi but I love the bi pride pin so much it looks so nice
The bottom left one looks like the Pepsi logo :3
I love that Bisexual one. I wonder if there's any like it still sold.
Love the pink triangle crushing a swastika
I love the look of some of these. I should make a trans rights are human rights one. Does anyone know the font name?
Does the person realize Che killed a lot of homosexuals...?
Also tell her that Hinduism has trans deities, and same with Ancient Greek mythology

Can’t be bothered to look it up but I’ve seen it quite a lot of times
Part of the problem is a large chunk of that age bracket, when it comes to transfolk, are dead.  Between AIDS and <redacted>.  So their bsence erases their presence in the memory of the past.
Show her this article written in 1952. 

https://www.wired.com/2010/12/1201first-sex-change-surgery/
Well, in the new propaganda video that Tr*mp posted, in typical fashion, he hyperbolically said, “No serious country should be telling its children that they were born with the wrong gender, a concept that was never heard of — in all of human history, nobody’s ever heard of this, what’s happening today. It was all when the radical left invented it, just a few years ago. Under my leadership, this madness will end.”

And it’s that sentence (along with all of the YouTube comments I waded through) that’s been fucking me up so badly today. The fact that his base will believe every word of what he says is what terrifies me. They don’t realize that people who don’t feel at home in their own bodies have existed for thousands of years.
Hell nah if people think Caitlyn Jenner invented transgenderism I will fucking-
Intersexed people are in the Bible (as ""eunuch from birth""). I mean, Jesus also calls us to accept those who are eunuch by choice (I know this isn't a direct comparison to trans people today as many historical eunuchs were involuntary but they are the closest I could find and really Jesus is quoted as we should accept them.

Matthew 19:12
For there are eunuchs who were born that way, and there are eunuchs who have been made eunuchs by others—and there are those who choose to live like eunuchs for the sake of the kingdom of heaven. The one who can accept this should accept it.”

She might retort that which that God made man and women, but you can counter with what the devil she thinks eunuchs from birth means (intersexed likely) and if Jesus is cool with eunuchs from birth (and eunuchs in general) then why is she so transphobic.
Hey, someone should show this to trump, cuz according to him “trans ideology” has only existed for 5 years!
The only reason people can think trans people is “newfangled” is because during WW2, the Nazis burned the greatest collection of trans research and history in the world - the Institut Für Sexualwissenschaft

Trans people have always existed. And in many non-European cultures have had a place of reverence and respect.

In Indigenous peoples throughout the world we have been seen as people with closer ties to the spiritual world. There’s the Two Spirit people in many Native American traditions, the Hijra in India, and in so many other people.

In European history, despite many purges there are still known historical figures of great importance - up to and including a Roman emperor named Elagabalus who was trans.
If you ever have the opportunity, you can tell her about Christine Jorgensen, a big trans star in the US just after WW2

https://www.nationalww2museum.org/war/articles/christine-jorgensen
We need to bring back STAR! (Street Trans Action Revelutionaries). One of the original trans groups to stick up for themselves. Created by Johnson and Rivera, two icons in the community.
Abigail Thorn used it at a [pride rally last year](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYC1QEhVMNI) but yeah I've never really heard it before that.
Hot topic was selling these pins few years ago
I'm actually wearing a shirt with ""trans pride trans power"" on it right now lol
It happened because of trans women of color.
And (iirrc) a group of (as far as I knew) cis gay men excluded them both from the first anniversary stonewall march.
As someone who lived through that era this is very accurate.

Gay culture didn’t really understand being Trans back then.

I know more than a few gay people who would privately express  that they wished the Trans people would be less a part of the gay movement because it made it harder for people to accept the “normal” gays because they were lumped in with “them”.

These people would be horrified by that opinion now.


People grow.

 This unified front thing is a bit of a myth/overstatement.
Ngl I like the look of the Bi-angles from the late 80s
[deleted]
It's not using the trans flag though, just the current trans colors. I think it's perfectly reasonable to suggest that people were using those colors to represent trans people for a long time before they made an ""official flag"" but I was a baby in the 80s so I can't say one way or another.
they don't really show the flags tho, and it's not a far stretch to assume they included pink+blue as those are often used for 'girls+boys' 

without any more info I'd just as easily chalk it up to coincidence.
He wasn't in Cuba when that happened and Fidel apologized many times about that event. It was horrible that the oppression ocurred, but I think they made up for it. Nowadays Cuba is the most advanced country in LGBT rights
Source?
Odin was trans-adjacent as well
If you're looking at Hinduism, there is Ardhanarishvara, which is the intersex combination of Shiva, one of the principal deities, and his consort Parvati, which is the goddess of Love (among other things)

This, by the way, is from like the 1st or 2nd century I forget which.

Greeks literally have Hermaphroditus, which is where the word hermaphrodite came from. Not to mention all of the times the gods changes people's sex as a reward for some who were trans and sought it, as a punishment for those who didn't want it, and if I remember correctly there was even a story where Zeus and Hera had an arguement and someone got changed just to settle their dispute.
Don’t forget indigenous Americans have had people who identified as “[Two-Spirit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Two-spirit)”
Doesn’t matter. His supporters have already taken what he said and cemented it in their minds as 100% fact. If Tr*mp said trans people haven’t existed in any point in history before a few years ago, then by God, that means trans people haven’t existed in any point in history before a few years ago.

It’s not like even the Bible has a name for what we would now consider trans people or anything. No, not at all.
Not to gatekeep, but to totally gatekeep, if someone is racist and/or transphobic they don’t get to celebrate pride month, because it was brought to us by trans poc.
I'd agree if there was a pin talking about trans and LGB issues, but they're just a collection of pride pins with no stated association. Are they from the same event? Or just someone's collection from various locations? There is plenty of hard evidence showing the two issues are linked without using a random photo of a collection of pins.

Also, the trans one is most definitely the trans flag. Not just the colours, but the thin white line between pink and blue is too coincidental IMO.
I've heard people argue Jesus was trans.
And here I was going to that time Loki turned into a mare then got pregnant.
**[Two-spirit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Two-spirit)** 
 
 >Two-spirit (also two spirit, 2S or, occasionally, twospirited) is a modern, pan-Indian, umbrella term used by some Indigenous North Americans to describe Native people in their communities who fulfill a traditional third-gender (or other gender-variant) ceremonial and social role in their cultures. The term Two Spirit (original form chosen) was created in 1990 at the Indigenous lesbian and gay international gathering in Winnipeg, and ""specifically chosen to distinguish and distance Native American/First Nations people from non-Native peoples"".

Parthenogenesis (virgin birth in nature) always results in a clone of the mother. BUT, since Jesus was assigned male at (before) birth, that would make him cis regardless of biology.
Do we know he was amab? I mean, he is known for having a scar in the chest region...
He is only referred to as a man in the Bible, which are the majority of texts we have about him.

""And you shall call HIS name Jesus.""
Are y’all really trying to make Jesus trans now?

I had an amazing time at the pride rally today!!		"Overalls make people illogically cute! 💗🌈
Ok girl I'll need to make a list for this one.


I absolutely adore ...:

-Your hair (its color, the cut and the slight waviness of it)

-Your makeup (looks like I'll need to practice more!)

-Your smile

-Your outfit (not only do the tones match perfectly, but the individual pieces are super cute as well!)

-Your relaxed, authentic vibe

-And last but not least, your pride about being who you are and willingness to carry that openly! Cause truth be told, you pass super well, and without seeing the subreddit and the flags in the picture, I would never have guessed that you're trans. You could easily just stealth around, but instead you take pride in your identity, and that's super powerful.

Thank you for inspiring me. Go you!
You look amazing!!
I remember my first pride parade. I met up with a group of friends and we hung out all day in the city, one friend dared me to wear their rainbow fluffy tutu. 

I wore that tutu for the rest of the day and on the train home
I still haven't gone to a pride event yet. I've kinda always wanted to, but never felt like it was a place for me.
Cute
Too much fun!  Love your outfit its super cute!
Girl, you're beautiful, i absolutely adore the energy you pass
Wow! You are Goals <3
So beautiful!!
Wish I could go to one
I’ve always wanted to go to Pride because my sister goes every year but I never felt like I was allowed to until the last few years.
😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍
My pride isn’t until august 😩
You're so pretty and I love your outfit!!
I love your outfit!! Happy pride to you

That's a really pretty design, it suits you! 💕
everything about that tattoo is awesome :)
Love it
That is beautiful.
Shit, that’s great!  I was gonna get a cutie mark tattoo before I got everything filled in with the rest of my suit (wouldn’t match) and I was wondering about the colors to use. I think that the trans colors are the way to go since it would work with just three colors.
That looks awesome, glad you found a good artist!
The tatoo looks absolutely gorgeous😍😍😍
That's really cute I am thinking about getting a 2nd one night be a team butterfly or a trans turtle
+1 for guitar related tattoo

+1000 for trans pride tattoo!

I have a sailor jerry hula girl rocking a strat for one tattoo but got another one for my transition.
That is a well done tattoo!

Why are so many of us guitar players lol??

Welcome to the tattoo club!
I love this a lot!  It looks really good. 

I'm getting so much more subtle trans pride colors in my first tattoo. I haven't posted any pictures of it yet because I haven't had color added yet. I get color on Friday.
wow! that's awesome, you go girl!🏳‍⚧
I looooove it!!!
Love it
So amazing!! I’ve been racking my brain for years now about a trans related tattoo and you damn well nailed it 🖤
I always feel ashamed when I see posts like these, because I will never have courage enough for a tattoo liek this. My ideal transition goal is to be seen as a tomboyish cis woman, rather than a perfectly passing trans woman. I really hope I'm making sense and not being offensive to anyone, I'm still struggling with whether such thoughts are motivating or self-destructive.

&#x200B;

Rambling dysphoria rant over. You're gorgeous, your tattoo is beautiful and I absolutely love your hair <3
Awesome tattoo! Don't they usually have them facing the other direction tho...? (the guitar is upsidedown to other people)
That looks like a six-string trans-colored version of the bass guitar that Bill Wyman played with the Rolling Stones in the '60s.
Girl that is absolutely gorgeous!  I love the flowers with it too
Wow, that's bold, essentially outing yourself to everyone. Stay safe there are people who want to hurt us. 

Glad that you're proud to be trans though, we need more representation like this for it to not be stigmatized. 

Even though I probably live in one of the better areas to be trans (Bay Area, CA), you always have to be watching out for the crazies.
accidental trans pride from mask and hair dye???
Awesome.
Awesome!! I went for the Rainbow for my first tattoo in June [imgur.com/a/JOjJFdd](https://imgur.com/a/JOjJFdd)

THAT'S SO COOL
that is fucking awesome!
Pro tip! Stay out of the sun or at least use sunscreen. I might even use a higher grade sunscreen on the tatoo to keep the color lasting longer.
I love the guitar motif, keep being you!
thats amazing!
so pretty!
That is an amazing tattoo!
Why’s it missing 4 strings?

You never have to out yourself, it's not a requirement as a trans person. I personally have one as I want other trans people to recognize they're safe around me, and I enjoy the look.
[OP answered a similar question](https://www.reddit.com/r/tattoos/comments/pkwpgo/first_tattoo_done_by_louis_barak_at_barak_studio/hc6d4ly/?context=10000) on a different post:

> I have it in that spot specifically because when I'm playing guitar, the tattoo will line up with the guitar!
Honestly, your tattoo is gorgeous! I personally didn't want anything complicated, but seeing yours I am just a tiny bit jealous. If nothing else I may ask the tattoo artist to try adding the white anyways as he didn't want to add it since it typically has an issue with wearing out quickly when on the back of the hand.
<3 Well thanks! I really appreciate it! I can definitely recommend doing it as it wasn't nearly as painful as people think, and it looks just so cool
Oh, well thank you! I didn't really want to do something complicated, so it worked out well in that regard. That and it fits nicely on the back of my hand.
it's worth it if its gonna be on your body for the rest of your life!
You're very welcome ;)


Bad flirting aside, I freaking LOVE your tattoo though. Great design and it looks VERY well done. Especially the colours look so vibrant :D
I didn’t really like them when I was lying about being a man all the time.  I had sort of shut off the part of brain that likes nice colors. 

I do feel a little bad for trans people looking for something a little more inherently metal or aggressive to identify with.  Same thing with the pride flag. By themselves “Ice cream pink/blue” and a rainbow don’t scream “tough”. Although I think the reality is that they’re the most metal and prideful colors you can wear.

Good job.
🥰💝
Well thank you so much! Nothing wrong with a simple concept tattoo, I just had an idea that my artist made even more gorgeous than I pictured!
I had to beg for the artist to use the white on my tattoos, I don't take my shirt as I get sunburn so easy."	pkwo31	trans	3399	0.96	2021-09-09 12:18:33

What's a transbian relationship?
congratulations to the both of you.
Same actually, only my gf isn't trans it's just me
Thank you so much! I definitely feel lucky to be with her 😊
Thank you!! 😊
She’s the awesome one! I just stand there and try not to embarrass myself 😅
She’s like the sweetest person this planet has to offer 🥹
Thank you thank you! 🙆‍♀️🙆‍♀️🙆‍♀️
Thank you so much I appreciate that ☺️
Dawww thank you so much 🥺🥺🥺
Daww she’s the one who’s bringing all the cuteness! Thank you 😊
Thank you so much!! ☺️
Thank youuu 🥹💕
I hope the meeting goes well!!
Honestly, piercings hurt much less than you expect! The worst part is the anxiety and tension about getting it done, the pain is very manageable and is over quick, at least in my experience!
Thank you sooo much I hope so too!! ☺️
Definitely just you
- Hard? Yeah, that's the best Christmas movie😊
Yay!! would you be willing to give me a tour then?😊
Because openly celebrating aspects of your identity can be incredibly validating.

Because it's her choice how she describes it.

I'm gonna be honest, this is a weird point to bring up and it kinda makes you look, to me in this specific instance, like a transphobe.
Why call yourself any particular culture, people are people, right, no need to categorize? Why call yourself neurodivergent, brains are brains, no need to categorize? 

Maybe it's important to them, maybe they're happy about it, maybe we should celebrate diversity and respect people's chosen labels instead of hyper-valuing homogeneity or telling them what to call themselves for some reason?
One day this will be true, we're not there yet.
Trans girls who are into girls
Time for hot girl pride summers! Make sure you both put on sunscreen! 💚🏳️‍⚧️
Thank you 😊
Can confirm, bites were uncomfortable at the most … nipples did hurt a Frick ton though
People are people. Being neurologically different doesn’t make you a non person. Nice try though 👍🏿
Honestly I’ve had my nipples pierced twice each and they’re sore but not the worst. Worst by far for me was my second time getting the same nostril piercing - think it went through very thick and crunchy scar tissue from when I had one years ago and never managed to heal it!
... I'm literally neurodivergent, and I didn't say being neurodivergent makes someone not a person?? It just makes us different from people that are neurotypical?? 👍🏽??"	v38uej	trans	3052	0.97	2022-06-02 13:26:06
Had a panic attack while getting ready for a pride parade and ended up not going. Nevermind, there's always next year ⚧🏳️‍🌈		"Pride can be super overwhelming for a lot of reasons. It’s okay if it’s something you need to build up to. Getting dressed and ready and into the car is like 60% of the way there. Be gentle with yourself and you’ll get there.
Sorry to hear that, but you did great to get where you got to, so dont be too hard on yourself.
Is this a thing that a lot of trans people find? I find I get very anxious sometimes when dressed, even at home. And I makes me so close to a panic attack. Sometimes I have to stop and get everything off me.
Does that happen to others?
If you can (and it wouldn't stress you out too much), find some supportive friends who know about your anxiety and are accommodating, to have fun with. Sometimes we can share anxiety, and we can also share confidence. 

I used to get panic attacks a lot, came back when I got a chronic illness. I wish I'd had people that understood what was happening back then.

Know that you're not weak or overreacting or missing out, you're a brilliant little light who the world is missing out on.
This makes me feel a lot better.  I essentially did the same thing, except you went a couple of steps further.
I'm so sorry.
If you would like them, I can give internet hugs. There is always next year too.
I like your top.
Girl it’s ok! I get that. I have super horrible anxiety sometimes. I was even agoraphobic for an entire year and almost couldn’t leave bed. On top of normal social anxiety, It’s super nerve wracking for me to leave the house in full girl mode I get so nervous someone will be mean to me or attack and harass me. The only time I ever left the house AND car that way was pride a few years ago because I had some friends with me to watch my back, even then the two blocks between my car and the parade made me scared for my safety. Go at your own pace, be it because you have a similar anxieties as mine, or maybe just being nervous in crowds, it’s okay to feel that way and it’s ok to cancel plans. For what it’s worth you look absolutely stunning! Very cute outfit and gorgeous hair and makeup! 😊
You are absolutely stunning
Not a problem at all Dm if you ever wanna chat
lemme just say, your incredible style would be a blessing at any event you feel is worthy of your attention. you look cool af
“If you don’t do it this year, you’ll be one year older when you do.” - Warren Miller.

Take your time and do what is comfortable. We have all been there.
No problem have a great day
Pride can be stressful to go to but you look beautiful!!💓💙❤️
You should have! 

But I totally understand social anxiety.
Oof 😥
Been there.  Glad you know yourself and trust yourself enough to get out of that situation, and look forward to another opportunity :)
Aw, yeah it can be really stressful at first, definitely not for everyone too, but you look great! Your outfit is so cute!
This is so relatable. But you're right! There's always next year ❤️
I'm so sorry to hear that. 

But I get it. So many years of being trapped inside a persona that you neither wanted nor understood sometimes gangs up on your new, fragile, out self  to remind you that you weren't born the beautiful woman you are. 

But you ARE a beautiful woman. Stunning, as a matter of fact. 

I've been transitioning for two years now, and I'm really comfortable in my new body and my new out-chick persona. MY best friend just told me last night that he thought I had feminized a lot in just the past month, and I almost started to cry. I've worked so hard to get to where someone would tell me that--unsolicited.

We are on a journey to outlive our old selves; to disestablish the tropes of our maleness, and to find all of the joy we deserve in our new presentations to the world. But we are all still the same inside--the same souls, with the same little sparks of being we have always been. 

Our beings don't change. They simply can't.  I don't want to try to forget that essential self. I spent a lot of years with ""him"", and much of that time was precious to me. 

So as I walk out of my condo every day as Stephanie, and NOT Steven, there's almost always  a little sense of trepidation. But I'm now at a point where I'm so excited about my life that I can't let old terrors keep me in  hiding any more. 

I am Stephanie, goddammit, and I am here to make room for myself and anyone else who found  the strength and bravery to say their new names out loud. To anyone. To everyone. 

Every day. 

So Verin, please continue to do battle with your demons of fear and anxiety. Every day. And then, next time, when a Pride Parade starts marching  up YOUR street, join in. Joyfully!!

My city, Sacramento, will be one of five cities in the U-S to hold a Trans Recognition Day parade next month. I am going to be there: Around it, in it, of it, sobbing my fucking eyes out, because I will finally be home. 

With my family. And yours.
I love your top and your hair is amazing
You would've killed it! You look amazing!
Hey! I would like to say that this is ok. Pride can be so overwhelming.  Im 35 and I have been to pride multiple times.  It has ALWAYS been hard for me to go.  Im quite introverted and have never really had a huge group to go with. I have always felt on the outside a hit because I am kind of non binary and it was like, im not trans but im not twink or masculine, lol.  Im also brown which dosnt help in either category 🤎😉😄. BUT! I say this to say.  We all have our own stuff on top of stuff as queer people.  Dont let people make you feel like you should or have to go.  Pride is there and should be there for those who enjoy it and for us shyer bunch to admire.  It does not make you less because you are not ready or may decide you dont want to go?  Feel better and maybe try again another day ❤️🧡💛💚💙💜🖤🤎🤍💖
Omg I did the same thing!!!
I used to have major panic attacks, but after therapy and learning mindfulness techniques I'm now able to prevent panic attacks happening and also minimize anxiety. I promise it's not forever. You are a survivor and a strong powerful human. Best wishes and lots of love for your journey.
I am sending hugs your way!

Having said that, there is nothing to race towards. Do what you are comfortable with and enjoy the journey along the way.
Had one of those in a grocery store once... Ran to the car and ripped all my clothes off in a dysphoria panic.
that has happened to me lots of times. just keep trying. it gets better
take your time, sweetheart, pride isn’t going anywhere!
You can do it! Never give up and don't don't feel bad because you were 90% there! Be happy that you got dressed up and ready and next time, you'll be ready and prepared!
Unrelated, but you're really pretty and pass very well! <3
Aw sweetie, I hope you'll manage to go next year 💖 I went today to Nottingham Pride, it was quite overwhelming and it was my first pride parade. I felt connected and disconnected from everyone at the same time. I suffer with OCD too. 

My DMs are open if you want to talk 💕💞
Idk why you dont look trans just a raging lesbian 🙃
Sorry you got overwhelmed. Hope you enjoy it next year. Remember you are amazing. And no one else can be you like you.
I'm so sorry. You look good. I Hole you're feeling better now.
Me too. I’ll have my best friend drag me there next year :)
I looked at your old posts and I just want to say this current hair really suits you! You look beautiful (before as well) but this hairdo just POPS on you 💕
If you are near NC, durham pride is on the 25th! You only missed one of them!
The fact that you shared this shows that you have awesome potential. You have the strength within you, just listen to your inner voice and you will know when you're ready. By the way, you are very pretty.
[deleted]
You look amazing there's always next year
Hey it’s okay don’t worry about it 🥰 proud of you x
Panic attacks are awful. Regardless, you chose really great stuff. I'm sorry you weren't feeling well and couldnt go. Getting ready and trying was already a huge step. Next year ♡
Am cishet but ur hot tho
i feel ya

my area's pride parade was canceled this year and i was almost relieved because i was feeling a lot of pressure to go all out for my first pride, despite barely being ready to even see people in person. ended up going to a pride-themed baseball game with a friend instead, which was a blast, and much less pressure!

sidenote: you are exactly what i imagine [Scorpia](https://external-preview.redd.it/bFDkbXaK5UP7ipcMLYk_GR30njWZAYcVcW4OM4SVezU.jpg?auto=webp&s=1c3672c15f0ef3522c8052275cc9566c8ab8bfb2) from She-Ra (which i *highly* recommend if you haven't seen it already. it's so good) would look like irl
I am IN LOVE with your top! That looks wonderful on you! 🧡
This was taken going to the shop instead, didn't even get out the door first try 😅 just one of those days I guess
I can't speak for others but I definitely get anxious getting ready sometimes. I have OCD though so that has a lot of influence on my state of mind
Thank you very much for the advice ❤️ my partner is my rock and helped me through it, I'm currently playing on a local trans minecraft server too to relax. For me today, the best decision was to not go I guess
That makes me feel better too ♥️ we're not alone
Not your fault at all ❤️
Thank you very much ❤️ yeah hopefully there's more events in my area next year too
Thank you very much ❤️ I do too, my mum got it for me
I'm sure I'll get there, just today wasn't my day. Started bad when I couldn't sleep last night sadly. Also thank you very much ❤️
Thank you so much ❤️
Thank you for the offer
Awwww thank you so much ❤️
I like that :)
Thank you very much ❤️
Not quite social anxiety, would take too long to explain haha I wish I did, it looked fun from the pictures
Super sad
I will hopefully :D
Thank you so much, I love this jumper dress :D
Aww bless you, I'm sure we'll make it ❤️
Thank you very much for the comment ❤️ I've been out since March and presenting Fem in public since. I think I just had a bad day haha hopefully better in the future
Thank you so much ❤️
Thank you very much ❤️
Thank you very much ❤️ hopefully the next one haha
Aww bless you ♥️
Thank you very much ❤️ I was using the techniques I'd learnt but it just got too much for me, maybe next time :)
Thank you very much and yeah that is true ❤️
That explains why I took my clothes off 😅
Thank you very much ❤️
Definitely not ❤️🧡💛💚💙💜
Hopefully so ❤️ thank you
Thank you very much ❤️ I hope so, I try haha
Notts Pride is the one I bailed on haha
I am both 😘
Aww thank you very much ❤️
I am definitely feeling better than earlier thank you ♥️
Aww bless you, hopefully so ❤️
Thank you very much, I love it too :D
I'm in the UK sadly. Yesterday I learnt people see the SC in my name as South Carolina, I wonder how long that's been going on haha
Thank you very much, I love sharing photos here, people are so lovely ❤️
Thank you very much ❤️
Thank you very much ❤️
Thank you very much ❤️
They suck so much and thank you very much. Maybe next time ❤️
If you're a dude that's transphobic as fuck but if you're a lady, thank you
Mine was delayed from earlier in the year so I was hoping to get there. Nevermind, there's other times :) also I love She Ra and love Scorpia ❤️
Thank you very much ❤️ I love it too
Sometimes the realisation that I'm intentionally getting dressed to look femme makes me dysphoric. I guess it's because it makes me feel like I need to do this to look feminine
I have OCD and social anxiety, too. You're not alone.

Sorry to hear things didn't go so well this year. Know that whether you participate in Pride is completely inconsequential to your identity. I can't stand large crowds and frankly get a little turned off by the ebullience of Pride sometimes.

For what it's worth, you look great. I hope you can summon the courage to do all the things you want to do.
Trans Minecraft server?
Definitely not,  incredibly common. You will find your way. :)
Well I wasn't blaming myself!  I empathizin'.  <3
It looks lovely on you.
I feel that. I’ve had horrible insomnia lately and all it does is make me wake up depressed and feeling like shit. It’s not a fun experience. Sleep is definitely important for good mental health. Like you said though, you will get there! Just be kind to yourself. Btw where’d you snag that adorable mushroom mask if you don’t mind my asking? I absolutely love it!
Of course honey
Fun times huh?
🥰🥰🥰💕 Nottingham gang!
Thank you very much ❤️
My local trans Facebook group has a minecraft server. We're all trans or SOs of trans people
Ooooh, well I dumb xD
Thank you again ❤️
Oh insomnia is the worst

And my mum makes and sells them https://www.etsy.com/uk/shop/ANTEMACCASSA international delivery too :)
Can't wait for the next one 😅
What kind of server is it? Would it be possible for me to join as well?
It's a good thing you're so pretty
OMG so cute! And she also makes adorable spooky/occult themed stuff and holiday stuff and sells metal band t’s. It’s like her shop is tailored to my exact tastes! 😃
Me tooooo~~~
Sorry its set up for people who live in and around the area, it's only small. I wish there were more spaces like it out there though
:D
She makes so many cute things and she knows exactly what clothes I like :D I won't urge you to buy anything but I won't try to stop you either haha
Yea, that'd be great. Maybe I'll start a server like that sometime if I have the money.
Haha I’m definitely copping that mushy mask and probably that tarot bunting for Halloween coming up Or to just have because my wife and I wish every day was Halloween and we both love tarot haha. I’m sure she’ll love this shop too!
I'm sure she will :D thanks for looking at her stuff ❤️
Of course thanks for sharing! 😊"	pm83yr	trans	2882	0.93	2021-09-11 14:10:07
After months of searching, I got my own Trans Pride Flag!!! mtf		"Does your skirt have a pentagram on it? If so I have the same one but with the Pan flag
You are ""pile of newborn puppies"" level of cute
Your smile is delightful and infectious!
Did you get the top from Spencer's? It's adorable!
Surprisingly, although I’ve been on hormones for over half a year… I STILL don’t have a pride flag. Huh
Any particular reason it took months?
ayy loving that spencers pride top! i tried getting one but it was too smol for me :/
HXJFSKSKSK IM OBSESSED WITH HOW HAPPY YOU LOOK AAAAAAAAA
Pride Palace is giving away pride flags! You just have to pay the shipping! We (my SO and I) just ordered a trans one and a general pride flag! 🥰
Nice
You look so genuinely happy is made ME smile! Slay queen and HAPPY EARLY/ALMOST PRIDE MONTH EVERYONE!!! 🎉🏳️‍⚧️🎉
Edit: autocorrect 🤦‍♂️
Cute 🥰🥰💕🥰
Love it!
I also should get one, pride month starts tomorrow!
That beautiful flag goes well with your beautiful smile. Congratulations.
Omg I love your smile you're so cute!! Nice flag too
Lucky I’ve been wanting to get one for the longest
You look absolutely amazing :DDD
I'm having a cuteness overload holy hell
Look at that sweet, happy face! :)
You literally look sooo feminine I never would’ve guessed you’re not cis! Wow, so beautiful 😄 congratulations on the flag!
NO WAY!
I GOT MINE TODAY TOO WHAT DA HECC
you have become a burrito of Transness.
Excuse me you look like a cis girl, what the heck I wanna look like you you are so cute
Ahhh you look amazing!!!
U look si beautiful and si happy!!!
Ahhhhh!! You're gorgeous jdjfjdjdndn
Now iron it! Immediately! This is how you activate its power!
I did the same thing when I got my trans and pan flags! I wore mine like capes and did a little spin with them! Congratulations and wave it with pride! 🏳️‍⚧️
Trans law declares that you don’t iron it!
Congrats!!!!!
Don't know what flag that is but I see booba so u a girl
Congrats! You look cute in it :3
Imagine being this cute
You look so friggin cute

The trans pride flag has always been a solid pride flag. Personally I’d have had it go blue strip white strip pink strip to represent transitioning more, but it’s still a solid flag that’s gets across what it needs to.
MCLovin
Nope! It just has the two white bars going around the hem☺️
Seconding this, OP is reaching new levels of cute
Thank you for phrasing this so perfectly. She's really got the adorable pixie look nailed
You said it better than I was going to.
Exactly! I have such a wide grin on my face
Yeah! Where I'm at the Spencer's locations didn't get a ton of pride stuff so I got pretty lucky✨
That doesn't make you any less trans darling ☺️
None of the Spencer's in my area had any for quite some time and I don't trust most flag ads I see on other media
Aw that's sad 🥺 I hope you find one in your size!
Why pay a shipping fee of over 25$ when I can buy it in person for 16$? But also I'm happy for you and your SO. I hope you like the flags when they get to you☺️
YESSSSSSS 💖
Thank you!
There's plenty of places to find them. I think another couple here mentioned Pride Palace which is a great pride flag company 😊
THATS AWESOME!
In a healthy relationship but thank you respectfully
And theyll use your real name in hell when you fucking burn for your bigotry.
Yes, your insecurity being so fragile is very ew
Eyyy, their merch is great! Been eyeing one of their skirts there and their chokers / necklaces are super adorable.
I found some relatively cheap on Amazon, but  you might like shopping in person instead.
You could always have just looked for one yourself online, you didn't need to follow an ad...
i just remembered i got one of their bras with sunflower pasties on it and im trying to remember where the hell i put it lmao
Unfortunately we’re in rural western Maryland, so there’s no local shops we can purchase from. We can’t wait for them to get here though!
HAPPY PRIDE OFFICALLY,
Its not that big of a deal i need to calm down
I totally found one thanks
I know I know, it was meant more like a compliment than an actual request to go out with you. Because you look gooorgeous
Go for it!!! Best thing you can do is be yourself hun ☺️
Awwww it's kind of you to look🥺 I'm personally very happy with my one flag for now though 💖
Sunflower seeds may help lower blood pressure, cholesterol and blood sugar as they contain vitamin E, magnesium, protein, linoleic fatty acids and several plant compounds.
That's unfortunate 🥺. Happy pride to you both though
YAYYYYYYY
Oh I understand now☺️

just wanted to show of my trans flag outfit I put together for pride		"Oo nicely done, I hadn't thought of wearing the colors as layers, I'll be trying this soon
This works so well 😂 nice outfit !
You look so beautiful aaaaaaaa 😭
The First thing coming to my mind seeing you was that you look like Makima in Chainsaw man 

Outfits looking great >.<
Love it!
Looks nice as fuck!
I love the outfit! You look awesome. Did you just stack the jackets on top of each other? Sounds cozy, I like it. Now I kinda want to Frankenstein a few jackets together and make a trans pride jacket. (Like, a pink one with blue sleeves or something with a pride flag on the back). I like sewing. You give me ideas 🤩
Nice!
Love it x
Both you and your fashion are so pretty!
OMG YESS 😤💖✨✨
Omg where did you get that hoodie?
Wow so a cool outfit and you looks beautiful. 🤗
Wow beutiful
You look cute in this girl!
Both you and the outfit look amazing!
 I want to look like you so bad!!
Looking pretty gurl
Looks lovely ☺️
That is brilliant and beautiful. Might need an outfit like that...
Omggg r/transitiongoals you look so cute. And I love that outfit it goes so well 🩷🏳️‍⚧️
This is such a cool idea, you nailed it and look absolutely gorgeous!
I love the outfit! I would love to copy it myself! Cool?
Omg, you're so cute!!!
Absolutely beautiful darling! I love the outfit so much! I'll be trying that at some point when I have money
Super cute style, I love it!
It should be illegal to be this pretty.
Help I'm gay. And you are making me gayer you are so pretty 🫠🥺
Makima?
Looks awesome you do look a bit like makima but in a good way
Ok but tell me why this gives such Madeline from Celeste vibes?
You would do such a great Frankie from Foster’s cosplay!!
You look like you can double jump
Never in my life have I expected Makima to wear anything colourful.
Looks good.

Except when the photo is cropped while scrolling. Your belly button gets cut off half way and it looks like the crack of a forward facing ass
You look like makima.

So lovely
Imagine doing your hair the flag too. o.o would be so wild.
👍👍
Nice outfit you look so good
Neat.
That's amazing!

....I need links to purchase things. You know...for totally cis reasons....
SLAY EVERYDAY.
that looks so good, I've wanted to do something like this too and I'm currently trying to come up with ideas for a trans flag crochet bag that isn't just the actual flag on it
I absolutely love this
That’s so damn cute!
Amazing done :)
I love it
where'd you get the hoodie
Fly as hell
This is so pretty! Where can I have one?
Cute
You look cute and beautiful
Such a cool style!
Wow that outfit is really cute!
You remind me of Iris from AITSF
I like what i see 🙈
You're cute
You look great
Holy heck i wish i looked like that
BECOME THE FLAG, OBEY THE FLAG, WORSHIP THE FLAG. 

JOIN MEEEE
Why the laughing emoji 🙁
My face just matched my hair oml
Came to the comments looking for this exactly lol
Oh hell yeah that sounds amazing
Its 2 that I just got of shien
Aim higher 😭
Cool 😎
The GOP is passing these terrible anti trans laws because of how jealous they are of her looks. Im making that my headcanon. They wish they could be that pretty.
PFFFFF
What can I do to get a 10
I have a flower crown with the colours that I'm going to wear
push pins are great too !
You're preaching to the choir honey, my first color choices are always pastel pink blue and white.  Omg I need to ask for a white eyes option on my new model
[removed]
Because the cute outfit made me laugh, in a good way bc I love hidden trans colors. I wasn't sarcastic or something
I wish I had hair as beautiful as yours aaaaa
Oh its two, cool, at a glance I though it was one that was pink inside and blue outside.
this is high enough for me!  (and many other people) 

you look pretty, ok? dont let anyone tell you otherwise!
Be yourself. 10/10 pass.
Exciting 😁
Sorry more interested in the tranflag cult than the christian one.
Lol nah. Being a cute girl takes priority
Oh 😁 can't wait to rock this at pride
Omggg r/transitiongoals you look so cute. And I love that outfit it goes so well 🩷🏳️‍⚧️
Ok I'll try
Hope you'll have a great time! Have a great day :)

you’re destined to look awesome. just sayin‘ 🏳️‍⚧️🏳️‍⚧️🏳️‍⚧️
All my LGBTQ+ friends used to tease me and say that since I was born in June I must be gay, I always replied with ""I can't be gay I only like women"" turns out they were right
Mine too! *trans high five!
Lmao, same
Same 16th of June and my partner is 6th
Holy shit that eyeliner is amazing! Good job.
Happy birthday and keep being Gorgeous!!!
Happy Birthday, also can you send me the link to the eyeliner tutorials you use?

Happy birthday Robyn! You cute as hell
Same here actually June the 6th
Ayyy my birthday is in pride Month too, and I was destined to be pansexual 😋👌🏾
you look magical!
Same! Mines in 2 days.
Likewise. Except....

1. Why did it take me half a century to figure it out.  

2. My home town celebrates Pride in October


Edit: I need to go do something else. Otherwise,  I'll just keep scrolling up to look at your gorgeousness
Samesies!
Same lol
Same!!! Gemini twinsies
You remind me of Céline Dion🎤
Mine too!! Hope you have a great birthday and pride month!!!
Gawd I wish I could get my eyes to look like that 😳
Interesting. My birthday is in National Princess Peach Month. And also Sandwich Month.

Oh shoot, mine too! I should have seen the foreshadowing.

Happy early, current, or late birthday, you look wonderful!
Same gurl! June 27th! 🏳️‍🌈🏳️‍⚧️
Mine is 4 days off :/
Happy early birthday to you, too, from another pansexual person! 🎉🍙🍱🎂🍰
June 14th i always hated pride month cuz i felt it overtook my birthday and made it “gay” but now its funny cuz i found out last year i am trans
You are beautiful!!!!
Wait is it ALSO your birthday?
You're so gorgeous I actually gasped, happy pride/early birthday! Also please do my eyeliner 🥺
You need to iron your flags to activate their powers.
Mines in november, supposedly mens month according to google, im mtf xd
I was not

But I'm still queer and trans

You know our way. We must now battle to the death.
Same! Mines the 5th
Also destined to be hot and sexy. I wish I could do my eye makeup like yours. Happy Pride Month-Birthday 🎂
Oh girl, this is the first picture I saw opening up the subreddit and I'm not disappointed. You look amazing <3
Me too, also my birthday is on the anniversary of when the stonewall riots started
mine too! I’m on the 29th :)
same, mine is today!!
Shit. Mine is too.

inb4 Fellas, is it gay to be born in June?
Your Absolutely Lovely !
You’re the one from the prophecy!
I accidentally named myself after pride month 😅
The best queer identity. Ukrainian. (/j because this is Reddit and somebody’s gonna take this seriously)
Wow your gorgeous. My birthday is coming up as well this month . But I consider celebrating by spoils or knowing it's my birth month. Nice to meet a fellow June bug.
Why do you look at me like you want some of my chicken nuggets...just ask
Teach me your eye makeup ways....
You are so insanely cute! I love your flags, and your outfit is perfect!
Congrats. So is mine! 🤘
Same girl 💅
Happy Birthday. 
Btw. mine is at the end of pride month. So there is some truth to it. 😅
Happy (maybe early) pride birthday!!! 😊
It feels cool coming across this because I'm also Trans and pansexual :) Happy early birthday!
**F A B U L O U S**
Happy birthday month! You look awesome! I love your style, your eyeliner/makeup and everything about this photo! 🏳️‍⚧️🏳️‍🌈💙🏳️‍🌈🏳️‍⚧️

Happy birthday and happy BIRTHPRIDE!
Happy birthday
Thank ya! It’s been a great one so far
It’s still hard for me to believe, but I can’t argue with that 💕
Can we puhLEASE stop making it all about subjective looks?
I really feel that 😅 I was too much of a girl for my straight girlfriends
Hell yeah! ✋🏼
It should be illegal not to be 🤣
Ha. 16th for me too.
Happy early birthday to both of ya! 🥳
Mines the 5th and my partners is exactly a week after mine on the 12th.
It’s only the second time I’ve tried this style 😁 It’s definitely my go to now, thanks!
That Ukrainian flag isn't even regulation.
Thanks! I don’t think I can stop at this point 😁
I’ve never watched an eyeliner tutorial 😅 I just learned the basics of makeup in my high school theater, and practice nearly daily. Maybe I’ll make some sometime! Thank you 💕
Yeah, you think I woulda noticed earlier 😆
You too! I love meetin’ other birds 💕
🥰 I’m hopin’ to get there someday! I’ve got grand plans for art & streaming. Thank you so much!!
🥰 I’ll never stop lovin’ people tellin’ me that! Thank ya!
Right! I got it last week and it’s already my favorite 🤩
Aww, thanks 🥰 It’s actually today!
Thank you 💕💕
The June queer gang’ll be unstoppable!
Aww thank ya 💕 I hope you have a wonderful birthday!
💕 Thanks! I’ve put a lot of practice in!
Nice! It’s a wonderful month to celebrate 💕
I hope it’s a great one! 🎊
Happy early birthday to ya 🥳
Envy’s one of my prime motivators
It’s a sheer mesh crop top! It’s my new favorite top 😁
You can’t prove that I’m not 😉
Right! It’s my second time doin’ this style, and I think it’s gonna be my go-to 😁
I still have a hard time believin’ people when they say that 🥰 Thank you!
😆 If that puts some fire in ya, then hell yeah! Thank you 💕
Happy early birthday! 🎉
Hell yeah! Happy early birthday 🎉
I feel magical 🥰
I hope it’s fantastic! 🎊
I’m happy for ya that you did figure it out 💕
Twins! 😁
Happy birthgay 😁
Happy (early?) birthday! 🎉
🥰 that’s a hella compliment!
Same to you 💕
It took a whole lotta failures to find a style that works this well on me! 💕
Your birthday meal’s planned out for you 😁
Thank you 🥰 It’s today!
Thank ya 💕 I wish the same to you!
I’m glad you’re makin’ sure we’ve got the whole month covered!
You still count! You’re just the advanced/rear guard, and that’s essential!💕
Mine’s actually today 😁 thank you!!
I felt the same for a long time! Happy early birthday 🥳
Yeah! It’s been a great one, too 😁
🥰 I’m blushing! I’d love to do your eyeliner
That’s the plan! I didn’t want to climb all over them after ironing 😄
Forging your own destiny’s just as good, if not better 💕
Oh, when did highlander rules start 😮 I guess I can’t argue with it. Square up!
Happy early birthday! 🎊
Aww, thanks so much 🥰
You’re chosen one! 😮
We’ve got some good coverage of the month 😁
Happy birthday!! We’re twins 😁
Yeah, probably 🤣
I’ll do my best to fulfill it 😆
June’s a wonderful name!
🤣 I noticed that too, so I made sure the pink was showing
Happy early birthday 🎉 thank you for the wonderful compliment!
I can’t unsee the look now 🤣
People keep askin’ me to, so I might actually make some tutorials 😅
Thank you 💕 It makes me so happy to hear you're finding yourself! Happy early birthday!
I do! It's @lewdlittlebird. Thank you 💕
If it’s that bad it’s best to call an ambulance, not post on reddit
It’s nice of you to label yourself so others know to avoid ya 😘
I think ya need some glasses 😄 Don’t worry, I know a few opticians who can help
If only 🙄
Thank ya so much! I just had someone use the word birthgay and I need to spread the term now 💕
They simply said that they look good regardless of personal preference.
That's cool I've never met someone with the same birthday as me
Mine’s on the 15th
Thank you
Also on the 12th!
A fellow 5th! I wish you a happy birthday for 2-3 days from now depending on your timezone!
That's... not a Ukrainian flag. It'd kind of be weird for a queer person to have the flag of a state that doesn't even have legal same-sex marriage.
You picked up on it quicker than I did!
What a delightful way to think about it! 🤗
That's awesome! I can't wait to see it! 😃🌈
Oh nice! Hope you have a great birthday! ❤️
Thank you! You too girl!!! 😘
Thank you im gonna be 27😊💚
Well now I gotta find me one you rock it for sure
true, because i dont have a soul!

i sold it for free Tittles and a single green m&m
Only speak the truth, gorgeous 🥰💕🫂🫂🫂
thank you
Thank you! ☺️

Little bird, this is your God damn BIRTHGAY! I love it hah
And you still haven’t 

:)
Yeah!!!!
Mines the 14th :)
Happy birthday to us!!! I’m in California! :)
They don't? wtf is wrong with them?
I'm sorry, I should have looked at it more closely.
At least we both figured it out 💕
💕💕 I can’t wait to start!
Nice! I’m a couple years behind ya
Thank ya! They’re not super complex so they’re usually really affordable!
Sounds like a pretty good trade 😁 I haven’t found any buyers for mine
Lol I’m looking for one as we speak I’m just more curious on how it will look on me I’m Broad lol still learning what fits and doesn’t
I’m still figuring it out myself 😅 I’ve recently learned that stuff with shoulder cut outs look great with broad shoulders!
Well thank you so much for the tips☺️ this girls got alot to learn
No problem! I love spreadin’ knowledge 💕
Well I’m def givin you a follow lol if I have any questions if you don’t mind
Feel free to ask me whatever! 💕

My question for the day, how many of you guys own a trans/pride flag?		"I have 4 flags: Luxembourg, Gay, Bi and Trans
nope just anime and witcher posters
I wish I had a trans flag. Transphobic parents make that hard tho😭
I do! I have a full size and a mini
The real question should be how many of us don't iron our pride flags? 😁

I'll start off by saying me : D
Own a pride flag!! Except I hide it.
I do! I have a full sized one I'm currently using as a curtain since the room I moved into needed a curtain and now I like it too much to change it
Ima walking fuckin flag
I literally have a stack of 3'x5' trans pride flags so if the one on the side of my house gets damaged by wind or assholes, I can replace it pretty quickly.
I do. Ironically, I haven't hung it with pride yet (not out).
I have a full size trans flag, a full size pansexual flag, and two tiny gay pride flags. Plus multiple pride shirts.
Not yet, only small diy paper flags, but I'm planning on getting some if i end up shopping someday
I wish I did. I need to get one
i dont own a trans flag but i do have a Celeste poster framed on my wall... its my stealth pride flag
Just a mini flag but a ton of enamel pins
I can’t find any online cuz yay conservative country but however I found a website that makes and ships custom flags and they have a good size range (from 210 x 180 mm to 400 x 270 cm, literally the size of the flag flown in the capitol hill) so I’m kinda tempted to try that option. It’s also buy 2 get one free right now so that’s also a good benefit
I don’t but I have a non-binary flag!
I don’t, I’d like to make one because I feel like in as many instances as possible our flag should be made by our people.
I dont
I do not
I do!
I don’t but I know I will someday.
um not like 14 of the lil ones secretly  uwu
I do. I have one full size trans flag wich i'm proud of. I also have a small trans flag and a small rainbow flag standing together on the table in my living room.
yes
I dont have a flag specifically but i have a nonbinary flag hoodie
I have one hanging in my living room
I have a little flag I got at a pride fest by my front door! My regular sized is in a box somewhere and comes out when I’m going to a pride fest
Got one on the wall and one as curtains. And several pins on my handbag.
I don’t unfortunately
me
Strictly speaking, one little one in a pencil mug on my desk at home, but I like to think flying a mini Progress flag above my work cubicle is also worth at least half credit here.
Pins(lapel style), mask, full size, throw blanket, swim suit, stickers on my laptop, trans cat stuffed animal my girlfriend gave me... probably a dozen other items and over a hundred on different wishlists lol

I'm pretty public about being trans which might be crazy considering I live in the southern US but I've always been a bit of a IRL tank 🤣
I would hang one I just don’t have much money and I really really try to avoid buying small things if I don’t need them 

Like all of the guitar picks and lighters I have were given to me or I found them or I was gifted them I’ve never bought them. 

I did get a giant white board for Christmas and I drew a tiny trans flag on it
I’m planning on getting quite a few pride flags soon, gonna decorate my room with them :D
I have one on my wall
I do not
I low key wanna get rid of my trans flag but ig its there to fight my small internal transphobia
i only have a trans pin i got online because my country sees pride flags as propaganda lol
ok do any of you guys own an iron?
100% buying one when i come out
I dont own a pride flag but I do have a pirate flag lol
Honestly, I probably should. I just don't have space for a flag
No, but once I'm out i want one lol
i only have a lesbian flag!!
Not a flag cuz I live with my parents, but I own a jacket with trans colours
I’d love to but can’t yet
I don't have one because im buried too deep in the closet ;v;
I would if my parents would let me :<
I dont
But i want
me and my fiancee hung it right over our bed :3
I want to get one but some of my family looks through my mail so I can't get one
I actually got one on Monday from the mall :D
I own a big one, it's been on my wall since last week :)
I don't but I lowkey want to have a big flag on the wall
🙋‍♀️🏳️‍⚧️
I wish
I do! I got a big one for Christmas alongside cute trans bracelets.
Guilty
r/ironthedamnflag
Heyo! I got pins too and a bead version my friend made
I need to buy a trans one, I do have a rainbow one though!
Trans and pride flag in my room and progress flag off my balcony 🙌🏻
I need to get me one
not me but my roommate one I gifted him two years ago
I used the trans pride flag as my calling card while I am playing COD warzone.
I just got mine in the other day! Too nervous to hang it up though
I just moved into a new room and I haven't decided where to hang my pride flag yet.
I dooo
I've got a mini one cause I can't find good yet cheap ones
Don’t own one yet but I’m moving soon so i can get one in a few months
I got mine from Spencer’s, my sibling got it for me since they’re the only one in my family who supports me being trans
*raises hand*
Me
Alas, I do not. 😔
I only Have Mexican Flag
Not a pride flag but a flag of Japan
I have a mini trans flag
I have a trans flag blanket, which sort of counts
I have one but I haven’t hung it up yet on account of my being trans is a bit awkward with my family.
I have a trans flag and a lesbian flag on my wall.
I would if it weren’t for my mom, someday though
I do not
I put a full sized trans pride flag up in my room back in November when I was not out yet. My parents didn’t know what it meant but eventually my sister came over on Thanksgiving, noticed it, and it was the start of me coming out to my family.
I've got a Bi flag and a Trans flag.
i do; ive got a medium-ish one that i bought at the first pride event i went to
My household has a large Progress Pride flag in our dining room. My wife also has one hanging in her classroom.
I don’t cuz my family is transphobic
I have my Germany flag and my nonbinary flag. My ex used to have a trans flag in the apt
No but I want one
I don't have one but because I don't really like flags in general..
I do! A smallish one though
I don’t. I wish.
My boyfriend got me 2 big ones and 2 small ones xp
I'll get one soon. Waiting for my first therapy session before I take the plunge.
I want to get a bunch of pride flags when I move out but I sadly cant right now
I dont, my family is transphobic and I didnt come out to them
I don't :/ 

I wish I had one
I dooo! Hangs proudly in my kitchen! Not feeding anyone that doesn’t accept me!
just got mine :D
Yes :)
Got a genderfluid flag! I bought it from a vendor at my first pride parade.
I've 2 rainbows but no trans although I need one
I’ve got two trans flags. Ones hanging up by my bed, and I’m waiting to move to a new garden to have it up outside or in a workshop.
I couldn't find a place to buy one so I bought the fabric, learned to sew and made one myself
would a blanket count? also i have a pair of programming socks
Me
Nope my walls are gonna be taken up by my signed stuff and my shelf’s eventually but maybe on the other side of my room one day when I’m out
Have one, just need to put it on my wall.
I've got one folded up in my dresser cause I'm not out to my parents
Nope, I only have a flag of my provence and city
I bought mind on my birthday this year!
I wish I did
Technically, yes. I cut out little squares of paper, color different pride flags on them, and tape them around my room! :D
The only flag I own is the flag of the Soviet Union, so… proletariat pride?
i came out to my mome about a month ago, she gave me 6 months  to figure myself out, see if i was making the right decision. so iwill be asking for one for my birthday.
So far i only have the pansexual flag since i came out to my parents, although I'm a closeted transmasc to them, I am planning to secretly purchase a trans pride flag
I have a small trans flag on my desk.
I don’t have the ability to do so as my parents would quickly scold and ground me for such “stupid and gay bullshit”
I couldn't find any in my own town because the shop was usually sold out (yay?) So when I had to travel to visit the dr, I found a lil tiny one there. Came home and the local shop finally had the full sized ones in stock again so I got one!They were sold out again 2 days later
Yup! I have a full-sized trans pride flag on my room wall as well as a lesbian flag with some art on it from Etsy on my other wall (which is friggin beautiful by the way).
I wish I did.😔 my family is homophobic and transphobic.
Got a couple little pins and a sticker 
No flag yet though :/
Not yet.
I have 2 small trans flags and a lgbt+ flag
I own a pin shaped like a planet with the flag on it? Does that count?
Yes
I own a tiny one from my friend on my first Pride Day :)
Definitely, need to get a lesbian bi ace and lgbt flag next lol
I only have the older version of the rainbow pride flag. Need to get me a trans one
Do the Ugg Trans Pride slippers count
I have a pride flag that is well hidden for certain reasons
none 😔
Yes I have one
We do! We have a trans flag, a nonbinary flag, a polyamory flag, and a (slightly outdated) progress flag! :)
Yup
I wear a pin on my beanie, which I have on so much people wonder if I have a top of my head. But not a flag. No room in my van home to really display flags and I would hate to see it get torn up in the wind. Plus...I'm in the south, so I'm not too keen on outing myself That hard.
I don't have any... yet. I plan on getting a Trans and Lesbian flag once I live alone
I wish I had one
No not yet! But I want to, but I’m also a little scared
I will get a trans flag in like a month, lol. I am just wraping up christmas with my transsceptical family, then moving back at school. So yeah, let's see if this is gonna be my last christmas with them. I have planned it such atlast.



I do have one flag in my dorm hanging on my wall though. It is the Åland flag, which I bought whilst I visited Finland. It is probably some of the most random in here. Not THE most random I imagine though, lol.
Bi flag haver gang.
I own a progress pride flag, which is currently flying outside of my house, and a trans pride flag that I will fly outside as well.
I do 🏳️‍⚧️🏳️‍⚧️🏳️‍⚧️🏳️‍⚧️
i have one
I don’t because it’s not something I am proud of, not to mention I live with my parents, but even if I lived alone I still wouldn’t have one because I I’m still struggling to accept who I am.
I have a trans/gay flag blanket, does that count?
no flags yet... but a hoodie with it, a ring that the whole way around is trans flag color, my tablet case is the trans flag... and lots of color coordination like my pens XD
Not me and I never will
I don’t own a transgender pride flag I really should get one but I have a Rainbow pride flag, a Pansexual pride flag and a Non Binary pride flag.
I'm going to order one from Amazon with my next paycheck and then I'll proudly hang it on my bedroom wall😊
I have a trans one
I made a little one with paper and paint when I first came out. Since then I also did a drawing of my 3 flags merging together (one which is not accurate now...)
I have a trans flag and that pillow-
i don't unfortunately, but i made a minecraft mod that adds various pride flag blocks. the progress flag block speeds you up when walking on it (ik i'm hilarious)
I have a picture of Canadian astronauts from that one time I went to the Science Center, a poster of resource areas of Canada, an airplane poster... 

and math... lots of math.
I don't have an actual pride flag, but I do have a flag lapel pin.
we have 2! also an enby flag, a demi flag and le$bean flag
No, sadly. I only have an old lesbian one from when I thought I was a cis female. Good thing I have a lesbian friend.
in my house? i wish
As of xmas I do! And an enby flag and an enby-pan
not me :(
Two trans,  one pride,  one lesbian :)
I still need one 😭
I don’t because my mom only respects my bi identity despite coming out as bi and trans at the same time.
i dont own a trans flag but i own crippling dysphoria so i feel like that counts for something
Pride flag and I show it proudly!
LGBT flag but currently loaned to my classroom as we wanted to have one. I take it back home in June tho.
I don't but I don't really own many material things as I don't really find interested in that. I do have my favourite sweater that says ""Human"" with all the lgbtqi+ flags within. ,
Me! I use it to wear as a cape and to display at my apartment. 🏳️‍⚧️
I don't have one. It's a conflicting thing for me...like idk how many people I want to know I'm trans while I'm in transition. I'm probably just being self conscious but it's a thing. Thought about a tattoo...but same deal.
I used to but I gave it to someone who couldn’t buy their own, and I regret nothing!
I wish, but transphobic parents, closeted, and broke :( I drew a mini one just like 5 minutes ago though and taped it behind my bookshelf 😅
I have one i hide under my bed which i got a pride a few months ago
I don't, because I live with my parents and can't be honest about my gender identity :(
I own a progress flag!
Don't have one, but got a pride flag for Christmas :)
I own a bi+demisexual combo flag and a rainbow flag.
My fiancee and I have multiple flags around our room, a big trans flag hanging on the wall, a trans folding fan thingie with another trans flag and a lesbian flag on either side of it hanging on the wall and there is a lil baby trans flag that is slotted into the fan. Oh yeah, there is also a trans brick. :) (tldr: we have a lot of them)
Iron it.
I dont
Can't really have one. I have neither money nor societal acceptance to buy that kind of stuff
omgz now that you mention it I need to buy one.
I wish I did :,>
I have only a trans flag, I have yet to get a bi flag ^^
I do! 😊
Yes, two, a progress flag and a Twenty One Pilots poster
Nope. I am that stealth...
I have a trans flag that I got from a really awesome lesbian woman on discord, her parents were homophobic so she was never able to get a flag as a teenager and she wouldn't let me say no
I have a small canvas I painted the trans flag on, if that counts
I have a couple of flags:

No Step on Snek (Don’t tread on me but gay)
Trans pride flag (I don’t fly it tho)
Faroe Islands Flag
French Flag
Albanian Flag
Canadian Flag
Malta Flag
UK flag
I have: Pansexual and Gay. The former represents the part of the LGBTQ+ group I'm in.

I'm not trans, but I do have trans friends.
I got a trans flag for Christmas and I hung it up just ten minutes ago!
I just have a little hand flag. But my partner and I used it as our tree topper this year! Super cute. We also have a progress pride flag hanging on our balcony.
Well I don't have a big flag but I have a patch that's a Trans flag with a rifle on it
I don't, but now I'm considering it. 

Part of me wants to outdo that trump-crazy guy that plastered his house in flags, and his house is positioned right before the entrance of the neighborhood if I understand it? But my family isn't allowed to post signs due to some regulation or other (not sure if that guy is flouting the rules or is just outside of the area it affects). Plus, the neighbors seem to be nosy in general, and I'd rather not accidentally attract their ire.

So I guess I'd have to have something small/hidden from the outside.
I have a trans flag and a New California Republic flag :3
My wife and I have one! We need a lesbian and bi one though too!
Nope my parents are transphobes
I have a NATO flag…. that’s it
i habe one that i got at a pride parade, i have to hide it but it's nice to know it's their :]
I have a non binary flag hanging in my closet, Does that count?
You all should know, [Prideplace.lgbt](https://pridepalace.lgbt/collections/flags?utm_term=15141961080&utm_adgroup=126546941182&gclid=Cj0KCQiAq7COBhC2ARIsANsPATEqlwjbru_paz7Pq-VqSdejTIj_z7YeOIJ7hU7atPU5ukt5-JgvOI8aAtnhEALw_wcB) is a nonprofit that ""sells"" pride flags for the low low price of absolutely nothing.
Only pins, earrings, rings, necklaces, and coordinated outfits, sorry.
I want to get a trans flag
I wish. I make pride flag jewlery tho so idk if that counts
I actually just bought a pride flag today
Honestly I need to get one. I keep forgetting to add to Amazon
I got myself a mini trans flag this Christmas. Have to keep it hidden tho
Me
I have a non-binary pride flag and an ace pride flag!
I desperately want to but I don't have any. Not that I need to hide from family or anything, but I just can't get one right now
My roommates an I have a t on of flags: Black Lives Matter, Pride Flag, Bi, Pan, Trans, Genderfluid, and are  in the works of getting an MLM flag
i'm not brave enough to get one
Ngl I stopped caring about pride flags when I realized I was trans. Idk if it’s a lowered sense of community compared with being gay, but I don’t see any need to own one anymore (although I still have an old rainbow flag, purely because I don’t know what to do with it anymore)
I have one trans and a progressive flag but I’m too fucking lazy to put them up
I actually just ordered mine last night lol
Agender, bi, lgbt
How many of you have actually gotten the fold marks out of them? 👀
2 trans flags in my room
I've been debating picking up a ""defend equality"" trans flag. Something to this affect: https://offcolordecals.com/?product=defend-equality-trans-pride-ar-15-flag
Buying my first one in a week or two when I come out to my roomie/cousin. Coming out's really a formality and acknowledgement of the obvious at this point anyway. Dude knows I have dresses in my closet, saw a bra in my floor like twice (and he knows nobody's hittin' this right now), a few other things that make it pretty obvious. But yeah, figured I should probably acknowledge the really gay elephant in the room before I start E, huh?
Not out yet so sadly no. But when I'm out I'll hang one on my wall 😅
I want to own one heh
Serveral in fact. Ask me more! Lol 😂 🏳️‍⚧️🙏🏼🔥❤️‍🔥💫🤗🛠🏳️‍⚧️🏳️‍⚧️🏳️‍🌈🌎💥🌑 bring on that New Years new moon 🌑
I don't have any flags unfortunately. :( I do have a few pan items though. I'd really like to get some things with the trans flag.
I have only a single one, and its a very special one for me, cause I painted it by myself :D

I also painted the lgbtq+ pride flag and the nb pride flag
I have an agender flag
I have a bi and trans flag lol
I have an encanto poster so close enough (in all seriousness I do have a rainbow flag)
I got a necklace for Christmas that has the trans flag on it but outside of that I don't have one
i’m begging you please iron that flag
I don’t but i do have, 1 pride flag, a progress pride flag, Bi flag, and a demi boy flag! (ftm)
I do not
I own 4 flags! Trans, Genderqueer and Queer, also a bisexual one but there isn't room for that with my posters up plus I'm kinda questioning that one at all (might also have my old Polyamourus flag from when I identified as that)
i made a makeshift pride pin using pen, paper and tape
I have a gay flag. I can't display it though. Folded up for when I move
I do
i have small pride flags hung up in my room, i have a nonbinary and pan flag but i havent hing it up yet
I don’t, but I really wish I did!
I still don't have one, but soon enough i'll get myself one :v
I have way too many flags ,, trans, nonbinary, asexual, aromantic and the pride one
My binder has the trans flag does that count
I have two, one in my bedroom and one in my home office.

I did have one in front of my house, but I sent it to a friend.
I dooooo
I’ve got one flag, 2 stickers, 2 pins, 2 shirts, and a hat. All trans
i have a tiny hand-drawn trans flag, i guess that counts too!
I have one coming in the mail!! It says fuck around and find out!!
I have a pan and a trans flag
I’m trying to get a trans flag, I currently have a rainbow pride flag and a pansexual pride flag
I have an ace pride flag.  I don't have a trans one yet, not really sure why... brb.
It’s my personal opinion you should always have one 😄
But it’s because of my personal situation allowing me to display it.
I have a pansexual and asexual flag
I have one hanging in my room next to some photos and cute lights :) and I have a tiny one on my project car
I wish I could, my fams not super LGBT friendly
I have one hanging in my room next to some photos and cute lights :) and I have a tiny one on my project car
i have a demigirl flag but i dont even identify as demigirl anymore >_<
I need one even though I’m not trans it’s like ideally I would be
I wanna buy one so bad but idk if I have room for it in my room lol
me!
I don't, i wish i can but i need to be completely safe. Can't risk putting things around the house that might out me
I own a trans flag
I'm not out yet so
I wish I did, my parents havent come to terms with the idea I'm trans yet.
I had no idea about the different flags, looks like I need to make room right next to my upsidedown American flag to fly my new flag???  It's a mystery???
I got one!
I got 5 depending on how far we are stretching it. I got a trans and bi big flags. Trans flag necklace. Bi flag ear plugs. And a trans flag throw blanket
I don’t have a trans flag, but I have a bisexual flag and a non-binary flag!! I’m also gonna hang them up on my ceiling like a tapestry kind of thing, I just need to get the ceiling hooks for them.
I don’t own an actual flag, but I’m making a collection of bracelets on pride flags. I have one that reads “I’m me” and I’m now working in a pronoun collection. So far I have “they/them,” “he/him,” and I’m almost done with “it/its.”

I’ve also made an ace collection. I have asexual, demisexual, and gray-asexual. And I have non-binary, gender-queer, and agender. Making them and wearing them have really helped me with figuring out what identity and words feel right.
I do but my mom took it and hid it from me T-T
Not me. I wish tho
I have a bi flag hung up in my room!
I don't own one but my sister does and she hangs it up just outside our room doors in the hallway she not trans I am
Flag? Not really

Rainbow blankets, jewelry, etc? Yeah
I have a rainbow flag with “equality” on it and a non-binary flag
I do. The pride and trans flags.
hah, i wish!
I got my partner a nonbinary pride flag for Christmas! I’m planning on getting one next year when I go to college :)
I have 3: leather, trans, and lesbian.
I have a Trans and a Pride flag
I have a trans flag and the same pillow lol
I have one of those mini ones on a stick!
Unfortunately no but i do have earrings and shoelaces!

One day you'll probably see me in the street looking like a walking pride flag. Oh well. I accept my destiny
I made one myself and then wore it to a pride parade with friends in order to come out to them
hopefully one day! just need to come out first </3
I don't yet bcuz I haven't come out yet :/ (Hoping go on New Year's though!)
oh I wish I was able to get a pride flag. My parents are kinda iffy about LGBTQ+ stuff (even though I came out as trans to my mother) so I don’t think they would exactly like it. My mom deals with it better but my dad is a very extreme lgbt-phobe.
I have a trans flag in my room, several trans flag shirts, and everyday I wear a trans flag necklace and face mask. I'm pretty proud I guess lol. Also you gotta ward off those people that say ""I don't mind it as long as they don't make it their whole personality""
I do but tbh i dont know what to do with it, i had it on my wall but i ended up not liking it there.
I have one
I have 3 handheld flags I got for free from college, trans, nonbinary, and rainbow, but I have big empty spaces on my walls so I might want a big flag or 3, or maybe posters
I wish but can't 😔
A rainbow flag sticker on my laptop and a trans flag pin on my tower
I ha trans flag and a progress flag!
I own 2, my parents found my first one and made me throw it away
i have a smol trans flag and folding fan
I don't :( not out irl yet but hopefully soon ig :)
i have a little handheld one :) i have multiple and i put one on my christmas tree to see how my conservative parents would react, and they didn’t take it down surprisingly so yay?
Does it count if it's part of a blanket?
I have a trans flag in my old house that I still have to get, And I have a German flag where I currently live
I do!
i still dont have a trans flag yet but i have a pan flag (and a demigirl flag i no longer need)
I would if I could :/
Yes 💗
I own a small enby pin
I have two trans flags that I use as curtains, and a pride flag on my wall
I own both
I have a bi flag and my non-binary and trans flags are on their way
Not me 😔
I don’t have a trans flag but I have an enby flag!
I wish i did but unfortunately not.
I have mine at the road and my rainbow flag hanging in my kitchen window. They’re garden sized flags
None so far, but hopefully I’ll have one some day
You have to walk through a trans flag and or bi flag to navigate my house. I have them hanging from the ceiling.
It's right behind my computer monitor!! :D
I own half of one! My friend Pax has the other half, our friend Rowan allowed us to split his bc he's pretty sure it has another. 

I plan to get an ace one soon
I already have a progress flag in my bedroom (from when I merely thought I was gay but starting to question my gender), and may treat myself to a trans pride flag to go with it now that I'm out.
I have a poster of Hong Kong, a Hong Kong flag, a Hong Kong protest flag, a Chelsea FC flag and a BF1 propaganda poster. If I come out to my parents before college then maybe I’ll get a trans flag otherwise I’ll get one in college
I dont
Don’t have one yet but I’m getting one soon (I hope)
Rainbow Gadsden.
Yes
I don’t, but I’ve been thinking about getting one to hang on the front of my electric drum kit :D
unfortunately not (yet)
Not a flag but a scarf with the pattern of the trans flag, hanging from the window, it remains incognite to my stupid and transfobic family. (Valga la redundancia)
I've got a trans and polysexual flag. Gotta get an omni flag at some point
I made my own flag 2 days ago... It was so euphoric
I don’t, and I don’t feel like I should need too either.
No, but I want one.  I just don’t really know where i’d put it.  I’ve had one that I bought at a festival but, for the sole purpose that the money spent would go to an lgbtq+ charity.  I ended up leaving it in a bar somewhere.
I'm thinking about getting one.
nah I don't have flags. I just dont see the point
I’m not allowed to, but I might be moving into my own rental property soon, so I’ll have a massive trans flag in my house cos I can
I have a weird homemade trans pride flag that I sewed together with scrapbook cloth I found. Does that count?
Not yet its coming along with a pan flag! And badges too
3 are hunging up:trans, non-binary, normal pride ( rainbow) 
The only not hanging up is the pansexual one sense i used to identify as that but i don't anymore
I don't, but I plan on ordering one
I actually made one in a terraria world out of gemspark and made it activated by a wire since I’m not out to anyone
only pan unfortunately, saving up for a trans, ace and demiboy flag
My partner and I own several flags. LGBTQ, trans, lesbian (orange version), lesbian (pink version), and non-binary.
Yeah I got a trans flag and rainbow flag, although I keep the trans flag hidden because I'm closeted as fuck
I don't. I can't stand the color blue of any shade.
Na but I got a t-shirt
Yeah, have a big one on my wall
Fun fact actually, I bought like a huge pack and gave them to almost everyone. I also have one taped on my wall. Then I have a big gay pride flag
I don’t because **closet** but once I get into university.. oh boy you’ll better believe I’ll start hoarding them all, I will custume order my microlabels to indie underappreciated artists
I own a progress pride flag and a trans flag :)
I want one badly but I cannot afford one right now 😵
I have a bi flag pin... If that counts.
i wish i had one
my parents would destroy me lol
I don't... But when I will live on my own I will get one.
I got a rainbow amd an ace flag bc am on the ace spectrum ya know
does a virtual one count
I have the trans pride flag on the bracelet I wear every day.
I have a rainbow flag in my room from my first pride parade, and I don't own any physical trans pride items but I have a subtle trans pride color tattoo! it's a retro TV with a ""sunset"" (blue and pink gradient) and white stars, a moon, and clouds.
I asked for a trans one but my parents got a progress flag. I don't think they think I will always be trans
I got a trans flag
im closeted :c
i have a bi flag!!!!
Got mine in October, I think. Been hanging me up in my room ever since :)
Nope. I fly stealth. It's better that way. Like, when I played ArcheAge and I would go pirating. I would sail a merchant schooner rebuilt to specialize as a catch-and-board vessel, but on the radar, I appeared as a merchant which means the trade ships wouldn't freak out when they saw me on radar allowing me to get close, harpoon their boat, reel 'em in, kill them, steal their goods and then sink their ship. No one was safe. Not even my own countrymen.

So, the only flag I fly is the Jolly Roger.
I've been out for half a year now and I still don't own one. Idk...I might get one and cover my bedroom door with it. Who knows.
I don't own any forms of pride flag but I do support LGBTQ+ and trans rights.🏳️‍🌈🏳️‍⚧️🏳️‍🌈🏳️‍⚧️🏳️‍🌈🏳️‍⚧️🏳️‍🌈🏳️‍⚧️
I will soon enough

I’m looking for other pride merch too
I have a tiny one on my desk from when i went to my first pride parade :3
I own a trans kirby sticker and a trans dinosaur, but no flag
I have one, I don’t think either of my partners do though, nor any of our friends. So like two flags between all of us at most.
Trans flag and progress pride flag
I can print a few out and stick them on my walll... but no, other than that. I only have an Inuyasha wall scroll, if that counts as a ""flag"" (quotes because idk if wall scrolls count)
I have a pride flag
We have 2 big pride flags and 1 big trans flag and then we have 1 small pride, bi and pan flag and one middle size pride flag
i do! i have a nonbinary one and a lesbian one <33
one time I showed my trans flag to a childhood friend, I asked them if they can name the country, they were confuseddd
i have an omni flag and a non binary flag!
Just got a pan flag ✌️
I do, and I have it hung up over/in front of my closet door as opposed to inside
I want to own one so badlyy.
I have a little mini pride flag that I got at an event for free, but no big flags
I want one but I don't have the money to buy one
Two, one big one at home and a mini one at work😊
I have a card with the trans flag on that my parents got me without know it was the trans flag (I’m still closeted lol). Does that count?
I own 3 flags, a little ace one, a little trans one and a LARGE rainbow one
i dont have one bc i dont wanna remind myself that im trans to avoid dysphoria lol
I wish I could get myself to buy one and be proud of it, but I don’t enjoy being trans and just continuously dream of having been born with the body I was supposed to have. I’m filled with bitterness about it rather than pride and it sucks. 

Every time I see one though, I’m filled with pride for the person who is truly proud and love who they are. I’m so happy for everyone who feels that way.
I have a trans flag, I wanna get a bi and lesbian flag as well and maybe a demi flag too (but jury's out on that one)
Mee
I have 2 flags trans and lesbian
Planning on getting a lesbian flag some day but I think that’s the only one I’ll get, I’m proud of being a girl, but I’m not proud of the fact I am AMAB, so getting a trans flag isn’t rlly something I could see myself doing.
I have one!!
i have the trans/mlm flag as sticker on my phone case and i drew the trans flag on a canvas which i hung up.
i have full sized non-binary and asexual flags hidden in my underwear drawer so i don't get outed lmao (i'm coming out next month tho so...maybe won't have to hide them anymore?)
I 'had' 2 pride flags until I gave away my bisexual flag to a friend, now I just have the trans flag and an Australian flag.
I own both, they act as rlly shitty curtains but idm cuz gay
I have one that was sent to me by a friend, its hidden.
i have a blahaj
I have 2 trans flags, a pan flag, an original Pride flag, but I’m probably about to order a sapphic flag and a progress flag
i wish 😩
I have a one which I made on my own( just drew it on a piece of paper so not really a Flag but hope it counts) and it's hidden 247 because I'm not out to anyone
A trans flag, as of literally yesterday
I haven’t got a trans flag but I’ve got a pride flag being shipped 🏳️‍🌈😁
Me! But I also haven't ironed it yet lmao. I wanna get a pan flag too but I dunno where to put it
i have a trans flag 🏳️‍🌈
I need to move out before I can collect any
My trans flag is proudly posted in my semi. My hard hat has a transgender symbol on the front. No one has a clue what either are either 🤷‍♀️
I still want on but I haven't gotten one.
Well I have a Bisexual and A rainbow flag hanging over both windows in my room atm.
Fuck no
I don’t have an actual flag flag, but someone embroidered one on a little circle canvas, probably 5x5 with “pride” on the white line. I also make my own little pride bracelets and I got pride earrings/pins. Just no actual flag yet.
I would if I could
I think...most
Not me. but my swastika should be arriving soon, so excited!
Ah yes, LGBT.
Luxembourg is honestly my favourite Pride flag.
Lol I could do lesbian, Germany, bi, and trans
I have a bisexual flag and a trans flag in my room
You from the country of Lesbian, five time ESC winner?
Luxembourg? you mean Dutch Deutschland
[deleted]
I’m not actually ‘out’ to my parents yet soooo, the flag you see in the photo is hidden most of the time
I put mine on just because of that >:)
Same here. 😔
Hugs! 🤗🙏🏼🏳️‍⚧️🔥
Tell them it's a heterosexual pride flag, the blue is men, the pink is women, and the white represents the purity of heterosexuality
Me too! Got the full size for the wall and when my wife got me a trans/lesbian necklace from etsy the seller sent a little mini flag of each with it
Me obviously
me !
You're...supposed to iron them?....
Mines still got the square crease lines from the packaging
u can iron flags? :0
Secretly proud.
I’ve been in need of a curtain, sounds like a great solution
Put a motion sprinkler so that if someone touches it it sprays them like a sprinkler. Would be great for winter, spring and fall not so much summer
Get one of the ""defend equality"" ones. Something like this: https://offcolordecals.com/?product=defend-equality-trans-pride-ar-15-flag
Yessss I love making diy flags
You could tie dye one!
I NEED PINS!!! my mom wont buy me anything, and i have no source of income, nor a bank account. pretty obvious because im 13, i spent all my dads money because he put no effort into having a relationship with me, and was supposed to get me down to see him. something i need to sort out with a therapist :3
What's the site I'd really like to have a half AroAce and half Demiboy flag custom flag
You could make one with tie dye!
I originally got this one , when I was with one of my friends during a pride fest.
Will do
Usually it would be fine but before I took this picture I made it into a cape and ran around in it sooooo
well no one in my house is lesbian so it would be odd, unless we started collecting more unrelated pride flags 😂 kinda tempting but need to make more space for it
Same
let’s hang out
I actually am out. Im not sure if it’s a good or bad thing yet. I came out about a year ago and I’ve only gotten support from my grandma
I think it depends on their material? Pure cotton yes, since it wrinkles easy (the line between paper and fabric is blurred indeed). But polyester no, or very low, since it is basically plastic and may melt.
Granted there were crease lines on my flag because my family were out and I felt like wearing it as a cape for some reason.
I am pretty bougie, but I'm not the kind of bougie that owns a sprinkler. Hahaha!
Lol. I have some ""fuck around and find out"" trans alligator stickers.

But really, I'm probably pushing enough buttons in this city with the trans flag.
The L is for Luxembourg.
Adopt a lesbian then
I have a question: what draws you most to the Witcher? Cause I’m going to be honest it was originally Henry Cavill
W grandma
oh I know, just explaining why we have Luxembourg instead of lesbian (: else it feels exclusionary
Henry cavill is 😍
Nah, it's just hilarious 😂

And I say this as a lesbian
I don’t disagree with you for any reason other than you put your smiley faces as (: instead of :)
(: well that's (: a shame (:
:(

Oh god I don’t know what happened but it looks like a coagulation of curved lines and triangles

fixed it, needed escape chars or Reddit formating went wild
I internally read this comment with an intense amount of fear"	rreywm	trans	2596	0.97	2021-12-29 18:29:56
Saw this at a local church today. Pride and BLM flags are nothing new around here, they're everywhere. This is the first time I've seen the transgender flag being flown here!		"Where is this and can I move there?
WHERE
I'm surprised a church put those up.

In the next city over from me they have the trans flag and pride flag hanging in a park that everyone can see on the main road. Many years went by until I saw it myself, but I thought that was pretty cool.
This is wholesome.
Even though I’m not terribly religious it always makes me feel good to know that some people out there that are have their ideas and belief systems set up in a way that is queer friendly and doesn’t automatically make them hateful to trans, non-binary, gay, bi, pan, ect folks.
Those 3 beautiful flags there belong next to the American flag, not a MAGA flag. What a nice sight. Shame I live in a red state so I never see this 😕
Another church finally figuring out that when God told us not to judge others , it was meant to be done practically.
It’s nice to see a church following the actual teachings of god. It’s all about Love.
Soooo wholesome omg!!!
There’s a church up the street from me with all of those flags too, always nice to see :)
Nice, I used to live in Northampton, MA and there were a ton of churches that displayed those flags. Feels so good to see them. I moved down to south AL and you can bet your money that there's no flags like those being flown over churches, or anywhere else for that matter
see, you could save a lot of room with that new-fangled flag with the trans colors and brown/black along with the rainbow..

however.. wo needs room when you can reject modernity
While I absolutely love this, I love that it's not entirely ridiculous or scandalous any more. My dream is when we see this and go, ""neat"", and live continues. I was absolutely shocked at how many pride flags I saw in Juneau (lived there last year). I had heard it was a bit conservative. I'm trans, and was newly out when I moved there.
Wow, huge kudos to that church and its leaders
I would like to migrate, even though I’m straight
Why is the BLM flag mirrored?
I'd put money on there being several people who work there that remember the last anti-lgbtq sermon, and probably many more than that. Christianity doesn't deserve our forgiveness with how many of us have died at their hands, and how many continue to be persecuted by people who share the book this church preserves and defends. Call it progress, but it's not enough. They can never properly atone for what they've done and who they enable.
yikes
Ah yes, representing everyone paying taxes except for their asses!
Downvoted for implying the church should pay taxes? Very rich
[removed]
I'm not Christian and I WANT to go there.
I could cry
Oberlin Ohio also has a small church with a pride flag on the front. It's a pretty liberal nice little town, can't recommend most of the rest of Ohio though.
Very pog
They get it. They are showing God's love through their actions. ❤️
My son went to an autism treatment facility last summer. I noticed the trans flag when I visited him. I asked if he knew what it was for and we discussed it.
I am now dating an amazing transwoman, and at least know my son has an open and accepting view of transgender people for when the time comes for them to meet.
I need a church like this, i live in the boonies where saying someone is homophobic is probably a compliment to them
WHAT FUCKING COUNTRY IS THIS I WONT ASK AGAIN!!!!!!
Could it be that a trans person joined that specific church?
Sweet!
Nice!
Portland, OR also has a church with pride flags downtown. Pretty baller city overall.
Its called the Old Dutch Church in kingston NY
There are some pretty liberal denominations out there. I know there’s a church in the East Village that used to host Trans Support Groups back in the before times
A church in Austin TX had a pride flag up, Lutheran denomination, I believe. And my church in BFE West Texas, while it doesn’t have a flag pole to fly flags from, it does allow all LGBT folks to serve in equal capacity as cishet folks. Welcome to r/GayChristians, where we believe loving your neighbor means loving *everyone*. How may we love you today?
My teacher of 65 has shown me that not all Christians are as extreme as that some people portray them to be.
I feel like you can never really say that about Christianity given their history. If a serial killer saves someone from drowning, does that make them a good person? Especially if they come from a family of more prolific ones.
Where would we be without our alias?
It wasn't, it was just the way the wind was blowing here.
Yikes
It may be. It also might not. On the human level I expect it's just decent people being decent. I was a pretty liberal Christian on these issues before I left, and I know there are trans Christians out there. Leadership might see a practical benefit to showing tolerance, but I'd focus the blame for that more on capitalism. 

I'm generally opposed to religion, mainly because it's often opposed to people being free. But this is religion doing the right thing. It should be encouraged.

Besides, scripture says a lot of things that nobody actually does or believes. You have to know someone's interpretation and added beliefs before you can (accurately) say why they're doing things.
Oh thanks!
That makes it even more epic, as I have an ancestor who married there in the mid-17th century not too long after its founding.
My husbands home town! He is trans too! Started his transition last March at age 63! I live with him for two years there back in 2000-2002. We live in Portland Oregon now.
Holy fuck, this in Kingston? Dm me pls
Hello from across the river :)
Does that really make them better though? They're still associated with the ones that lynch us.

This is true.
I've got a few Christian friends, they aren't necessarily for it but are not willing to unfriend such a close friend over it.
My parents are Christians and they also don't agree with it, but haven't been rude or disowned me.

I'm just surprised a church itself put the flags up. I wouldn't be so surprised if a Christian had the flags up in their yard.
Hopefully i'm understanding it right, but from what I gather, religious ideas and systems are more about how people perceive them and what they let those principals and systems do for them. So seeing as the analogy you use implies christianity as a whole has some sort of bad thing thing in it that idea is really just one way of looking at things. besides my comment wasn't about liking christianity anyway. It was about jut the general idea of enjoying people who found ways to fit saying being queer is okay into their belief systems instead of using their belief systems to justify promoting hateful queer bigotry.
It's important to understand the wide variance in factions that make up any religious group (especially Christians). I grew up in a denomination that is pretty conservative overall, but even then there were massive faction swings from one church to another. There was a pretty common occurrence of hate towards other denominations and religions which always made me uncomfortable (leaning heavily into it after a bad breakup and dropping out of college made me realize how much I disagreed fundamentally with that religion, followed quickly by disagreeing with Christianity entirely).

Here's what I learned, having been exposed to a reasonable number of different religions, Christian groups, and individuals. An individual can believe in the ""core beliefs"" and be an amazing person who is balanced and looks for the good in everyone. An individual can say they believe in those same beliefs and be a complete asshole. These are the ones who will look to twist anything in their beliefs into a reason to hate another group, person, or idea. Doesn't matter what religious belief system one has, being an asshole is universal and being a kind person is universal. I'd argue only a few ideologies are systemically opposed to to either viewpoint, and I'm not sure any of those really counts as a religious belief system.

Basically, you can absolutely be a good person and even a good ally as a religious person, it often will depend on your subgroup whether doing so is considered part of your shared beliefs or in spite of your shared beliefs. Not gonna lie, the bible is kinda fucked up no matter how you slice it, but it's often misquoted to allow subgroups of Christians to justify being terrible people without guild when they look in the mirror or see blatant lessons in that same book about being kind to people and not judging others.

It's the people more than the ideology. While I'm anti-religion personally, I'd never tell anyone that their religion makes them bad or incapable of being an ally. Because it's just not true. If someone wants to talk religion, I am still more than happy to show the dichotomy of their own beliefs, and the ways in which those same beliefs have oppressed others for millennia. People who can own how dangerous their religion can be are the only thing preventing their quiet little church from becoming that same force of evil.

That all being said, almost all mainstream churches and evangelicals are toxic and inflammatory, and I will not tolerate their shit. But smaller factions don't always agree with the larger ones, and their beliefs are valid when they oppose harming others.
The wind? How does the wind make it look mirrored?
You're mad that what I said reads as religiously intolerant. But I was a marketing tool as a kid, for the Bible circuit.
[removed]
Well humans kill each other, rape each other, torture each other etc. It's the person that matters, not the group/community
Absolutely love your user
I think it makes more sense to look at the ideology and the source in tandem, but also consider the impact they have. Christianity as a whole has led to the death of probably millions of queer and trans people, all on the basis of tradition and their interpretations of their book. If they preserve the book, and history has shown a much more profoundly destructive tradition, then how can we really believe that the few churches with slightly different ideologies will change anything, especially while preserving the same book used to justify the previous atrocities? I think we'd be better off if, instead of just ""looking at things differently,"" they do actual revisions. Why keep the parts of Bible that defended destruction? Why affiliate yourself with Christianity at all? If they want to change something, they should change more than their decorations at a few locations and start over entirely. Christianity can't be salvaged, and trying to just put some nicer stickers on the Bible doesn't make it good.
Idk why the flag was like that. The picture isn't mirrored.
It's a broken institution. We've had fascist and broken governments in the world where people defended them saying it was a few bad rulers or humans in those governments, but the conclusion was still to overhaul the system. The Bible was used to justify murder, rape, war, white supremacy, and it still is. Why not actually change things and revise or toss out the whole thing? Is painting a church different colors going to make the blood stains any less important? People aren't going to have these ideas if they aren't inspired to have them. People aren't inherently evil. Preserving Christianity and the Bible is preserving the things that led to those atrocities and basically ensuring it'll happen again.
Thank you.
I just deleted my other account because I used my chosen name but decided I didn't like it so I went back to my given name.
Then I realized I needed to change my Reddit name.
Your right, there is no way to truly know if a church with different ideas will change an entire system of ideas that have been historically perceived in a bigoted way. Yet the ambiguity of its success does leave the idea that it possibly could. 

Also since christianity isn't directly connected to any one person it's easier to sepperate an individuals ideology from the source. 

This is in contrast to trying to seperate for example, uhh...queer fans of harry potter enjoying the harry potter stuff and supporting JK Rowling from each other. With the Harry Potter situation any way you perceive the media you are consuming will always go back to creating a bad outcome. The outcome being, giving an author you disagree with a fandom by doing things related to the authors works. Where as with the christianity situation, any interpretation of the media (aka your interpretation of the bible, how to conduct actions correlated with the belief system,ect.)does not create any bad problems unless the way you interpret it is structured to cause issues.

In sum, with a religion connected to thousands of people who make up what it is the only person causing hate is you if you chose to see your idea of the religion as having bigoted aspects. Yet with something connected to a defined group of people/person making up what a thing is, you have no say in if what you do based around that thing will contribute to hate or not. 

Anyway i'm not terribly religious so I probably have no place in saying anything about how its valid for people to have different ideas about their belief systems. It was fun though to have a civil ideological debate. Sadly though I cannot sit here using my time only for typing things to internet strangers. Have a good day internet person :)
You believe it will change because we are seeing that change. To be fair to your point I quite honestly believe most religious systems to be more harmful than beneficial. This is still a step in the right direction though. Humans aren't going to give up their religions overnight but this is progress."	lb1xfl	trans	2585	0.98	2021-02-02 17:58:01

Rest In Pride Brianna Ghey		"Hi, I'm Laurajane and I read about the response from the police about Brianna Ghey.I am sixty-eight years old now and I am a transgender woman. I am from New Zealand. When I read what they were saying about Brianna I was in tears. How can people be so callous. I am a transgender woman myself. What is wrong with the people in the UK?.the Police sound like they are so indifferent  what is wrong with them?don't they have any compassion?what has this poor girl done?. I am totally disgusted. The police in,New Zealand would look at this a lot differently. Brianna my sweet  we have never met,but rest in peace my love 💓 ❤️ 😍 from Laurajane in Taupo New Zealand ❤️ 🇳🇿
Her fate was awful. No one—NO ONE—should have to suffer it. This world is so fucked up. At least in the afterlife, wherever it is, she can be happy and free of hate. Rest in pride, Brianna.
I wonder if the conservative's and the terfs are happy now. This is what their fanning the flames of bigotry and hatred has done. Hate is not something you are born with. It's learnt and taught. When will people realise that we are as valid as the next person. Why can't we all just let each other live our best lives? If another person living how they choose to doesn't harm anyone else, then what business is it of anyone else.
For those in the UK interested in attending a vigil this week
https://www.warringtonguardian.co.uk/news/23320335.brianna-ghey-vigils-held-across-uk/
If this is what is happening in the UK, I can’t imagine what’s coming for the US. I bought a gun today after crying and reading about Brianna Ghey and all the anti-trans laws being pushed/passed here in America. I encourage the rest of you to arm yourselves as well, anyway you can…
Rest in pride, rest in power, rest in peace.
Fly high. This is so fucked up and I just hope we can soon live in a world where this shit doesn't happen.
😔 😢
I'm sorry, but who was Brianna? I'm quite uneducated on this :/
Rest in pride and power. She deserved so much better, but this world is fucked.
💔 So young, such a tragic loss. I hurt for her friends and family. 💔
https://chng.it/CgcZtHDdjj

Please sign to fight to ensure Brianna is recognised as how she identified.
Rest in peace, Brianna
Brianna was from my hometown. I was so shocked and upset when I heard about her death. I feel annoyed at the people in my town for not promoting trans rights more and for not educating teens about it. I'm annoyed at the government for not doing anything. Rest in peace angel
What happened?
I hope she is at peace and I hope that anyone that puts someone through this rots in the darkest place that could be imagined.
❤️❤️❤️
RIP Brianna. It's an indictment upon the state who would allow such atrocities to continue and then in the same breath turn around and attack the victim.
I think it's foul how much British news has shunned this story, when a trans person does something wrong it's the weeks news and every headline is about it. but when an innocent trans girl is murdered we get one report which is massively undershadowed. you were an inspiration brianna, rest in pride <3
I’ve seen this image posted by an Italian activist, their action is pretty sus🤔
This is unfortunately how it goes with police. Police don’t take hate crimes (and crimes in general) against minorities very seriously and often leave them unsolved or try to solve them as quickly as possible so they won’t have to deal with it. It’s a sad reality. Brianna didn’t deserve her fate in the slightest and her case has been mishandled because of decades of intentional design of the legal system. :(
Such beautiful words, thank you xx
I hope they learn from this and stop discriminating against trans people, but for some reason I doubt they will stop for at least 50 years :/
Of course they’re happy. This is exactly what they want to happen. To erase our existence by any means necessary. No one is coming to save us, we have to help ourselves.
If you look into insta comments, you can see: Yes, they are. Seen a lot of comments like ""groomers get what they deserve"".
Tbh I’d totally attend if I could and if I weren’t a coward and if I wasn’t pre everything but like my spirit will attend definitely
At times like this I couldn't agree more
Make sure you get trained on how to properly use it. Training is everything.
Sorry but buying a gun is not the answer. Trying to protect yourself from one issue by adding to another issue.
She was a trans female who was beat up and murdered during the weekend. She was only 16 years old. And ontop of that, she will be buried in with her dead name and birth gender, because of the stupid laws in the UK
Brianna was a brave transgirl who was brutally murdered over the weekend. She was a fierce girl who helped many other tran teenagers finds themselves. She should be an inspiration to all, so young yet so strong. 

This comes after years of rampant transphobia in our press, in our politics and in our medical system. Her death will not be recorded as that of woman's nor under her real name since the UK doesn't allow under 18s to receive a GRC, nor posthumously. She will be remembered by us though, and her heart will live on! xx
Stay safe, those bastards may be arrested but there's still danger out there, don't be afraid to defend yourself xx
Brianna was a trans woman who was murdered over the weekend. She was only 16 years old. Ontop of that, the UK has stupid ass laws and she will be buried with her dead name and birth gender.
The fuckers who did this will be in prison a long time I hope
This photo is my own so don't know where you got this from
This is what they want. They aren't trying to merely exclude us or keep us out of their spaces. This is a genocide in the making.
You're not a coward, you have very legitimate reasons to be fearful. Please don't feel bad, this is just one way people can honour Brianna x
You will be loved and supported if you do go though
Self-defense is the answer to anti-trans violent hate crimes.
I just don’t understand this mindset. You can’t vote away fascism nor can we (or should we have to) debate for our existence with those who want us dead.
I mean, id rather have one than not if someone is pointing one at me anyways 🤷‍♀️ its not like theyre going anywhere anytime soon, so we might as well use every tool we can. Moral high grounds are great when we have the privilege to take them.
I've started carrying my pocket knife, this isntvpeace time anymore
Genuinely broke my heart reading that :'(
I hope she finds peace. RIP.
Oh... wow. I didn't realise the last part.

That's just adding so much more grief to an already tragic event.

I hope she, her family and friends, and all trans people in the UK can find peace.
An land that is so UnKind.
I hope this opens up people's eyes to what's really going on in this cruel world...  Stay strong.
[removed]
I dunno even though I am still my hideous self with something like this so so close to home I wanna do something you know? Wanna be involved somehow. Eh perhaps in a better life but thank you!
I’ve missed my local I see but look in reality I’m just like a depre pre everything teenage. I mean if I feel intimidated normally outside then being surrounded by people like me but better well that’s just all the more intimidating
Guns are not self defence. They're simply another weapon with which to do harm.
Her friends are posting a lot of edits on tik tok, it's so heartbreaking to see. 

I hope they do as well, she deserved so much better.
I'm British and I took this photo, stop actively lying on this post about a dead girl
Talk to friends, light a candle for her, remember her - any small thing is a wonderful way to honour her. But I think the best way is being kind to yourself x
We're exactly like you, but I get your point, stay safe x
If you're in a dark corner with no where to go, and faced with the possibility of death. And, there's a killer who seems dangerous with no one around who could defend for you. Either a knife or more likely a gun may be necessary.

I wouldn't use a gun if I didn't think it was necessary. I don't actually use any, but it'd probably be a good idea if you stop feeling safe.
Self-defense weapons can be murder weapons, but not all self-defense acts kill. And, the ones that do are self-defense."	1139487	trans	2553	1.0	2023-02-15 21:31:22

OMG you're SO PRETTY

Cute! Hopefully i can do something like this on my end of the medical field!
if i would wear that to work (geriatric nurse) i would have a not so friendly call 2h later and have to come to my bosses office to get yelled at :(
i got yelled at and made feel back on trans visibility day for wearing a funny tshirt -.-
You look beautiful also iv got the same pin my sister gave me a while back I don't wear it as I have a necklace but I keep it pinned to my pocket book purse thing

Stick to selling gas and food instead of pushing religious-political ideologies in the workplace.""

Back at ya, boss.
I still have them up, I just moved them so they're not visible from the window.
pUsHiNg SoCiAl iDeOlOgY
like my right to live is a fucking debate.
screw them
Time to submit a complaint saying that I love your store but can no longer support you due to your stance on LGBT+ rights
I wonder if that concerned citizen feels the same way about businesses that have anti lgbtq imagery?🤷‍♀️
Rebel. Keep the flags up. /hj
it's so obvious that the whole narrative of trans ideology being ""shoved down people's throats"" is said only when they notice we exist. you'd think that with how much they portray trans people as being part of a shadowy, secret plot, that we'd maybe pop up in their lives more than they'd realize and not only in the areas of their life where they expect us to be.
I'd submit a few fake reviews saying I ""absolutely loved your flags and will definitely come back because it shows how much of a WELCOMING place it is for everyone""
Other than the US flag, are there any other flags displayed (confederate flag, sports team flag,  military flag, etc)? If so, either those go also, or you get to put your flag back up. It's called freedom of speech.
Ah yes our lives are merely a political philosophy...sure sure.
Screw that guy. I'd fight for your right to be able to keep then up.
Why are they pushing THEIR social ideology onto you?
If they would stop politicizing our bodies, it wouldn't be a political issue.
Yea, I’m sure this customer is an avid fan of this gas station and “loves their stores,” and is not just pushing their own politics.
Interesting how they knew the lesbian flag. Idk where you are but where I'm from most people have no idea what a lesbian pride flag looks like. 👀 

For real though, fuck that.
our identities and existence isn’t a fucking political ideology
Taking them down is just as political as leaving them up, it’s just some TERF’s politics trying to undermine our existence instead of us being proud of who we are
Ew
So sad that letting people be themselves is ""political""
Our identity is not a political statement.
The person who wrote this has a confederate flag bumper sticker, 100%
That's actually discrimination, you can sue
I don’t know which is more infuriating; the fact this transphobic nitwit views trans people existing as a ““political ideology””, or the fact that the spineless higher ups at your workplace actually caved to this one singular nitwit and made you move the flag to the inside. I guess making money from one customer is more important to them then making their trans staff members and potential customers feel welcome.  🤦🏻

I don’t blame you for still working there in this economy, but I feel like that has to be worthy of some kind of formal complaint. If they’re willing to cave and pull garbage like this, then it might just be a slippery slope to worse bullshit. Call it out while you still can…
That pisses me off so fucking much. So, so much. God, what about any of this makes you think that being trans or lesbian is fucking political?
Your existence is not a political agenda, and those flags are not for him.
funny how they know those flags so well, obsessed much?
Isn’t it illegal for your manager to do that, or something? Maybe take it to the… I forget- not the BBB, but the other one.
Imagine being so fragile that you’re upset by a flag. I don’t know if there’s a place for that kind of fragility in todays world.
NEITHER OF THOSE FLAGS PUSH EITHER OF THOSE THINGS. BUY YOURSELF A FUCKING DICTIONARY YOU NIT.
Keep them both prominently displayed, have your boss put in writing (an email works) why they want them taken down.  Present this to HR as discrimination based on your gender and your sexual orientation, both of which are illegal.  Raise hell about it and don't back down.  You have every right to display your flags.
The customer isn't always right >:(
That's not political. It's a basic human right thing.  Wtf
Fuck that shit.   Time for a new job?
I hate when homophobes use that line as if it makes they're behavior excusable, how much u wanna bet they'd go off on someone who told one of them to stop wearing cross necklaces because it pushes religious beliefs and makes people uncomfortable
Wish I could crosspost this to r/antiwork
Noooope. That's discrimination. Tell your work that. Never EVER back down to bigotry.
iDeOlOgY
Tina M Mendoza? You can totally see her name in the pic
Firstly I apologise for ruining these 69 comments number... Secondly what a load of f****** bullocks
That’s grounds to sue for discrimination
I think the point of flags in businesses is to make people feel welcome and not to advertise a specific gender identity.   Otherwise why stop at Trans and Lesbian?  Perhaps ask management to replace with a more prominent and permanent “All are welcome here ” door decal. I feel like this is less alienating, especially for those who may not choose to identify with a particular group.
""Sorry we don't sell gas to cis straight people...their whole gender and sexuality thing is just really too political for us!""
Ugh I hate that being trans is somehow always related to politics. Like damn people just dislike other people being out and happy
My response to the customer would be, ""you should stick to buying stuff, not pushing your political ideology onto others.""
You know what... More flags!
Say: no
I'd quit on the spot. Or make the boss pick. Me or the flag.
I can't get over the ignorance of this person. Projecting their own view of our self-acceptance as some ideological agenda.

Fuck them all.

Take down the flags if you must but don't let anyone stop you from owning your identity proudly via clothing and jewellery.  

Damn I am so fucking sick of these ignorant arseholes telling us how we should live.
""i would rather you stick to selling gas and food""

ah yes because it's impossible to have a pride flag and continue business. you gotta pick just one
The day someone’s identity stops being politics or a social ideology is the day I will be happs
Ah yes, because simply existing is **Political**
Put up bigger ones
They do realize that this is discrimination and that’s still illegal in most states. Maybe you don’t want them to push their Karenism onto you; hope they think about that… I’m sorry you went through that; you are beautiful as you are and you should never have to be dismissed because someone doesn’t like it.
I'm going to be very sad if this happens to me.
Hang up two more.
Nah imma just be fr with you I’ll prob get banned for this but like people can have opinions without being gay haters they just don’t like when you bring your opinion in and the us flag or any other flag is not an option it’s literally a symbol for the usa and the conferdate flag is no longer used by anyone because of the general hate surrounding it I agree with y’all but me personally I think really just leave anything that’s yours at home leave the building the way it is I’d say the same thing if the trans flag was up and the poster took it down for a usa flag
Tell me why ain’t nothing but a heart ache TELL ME WHY ain’t nothing but a mistake continue the song
[deleted]
You are not being told that. The title is misleading.
People like the twat complaining are so hypocritical, they push their agenda thinking it's more valid than anyone elses, but they're blind to that of course because they're ""normal""
I'd go to your boss but open with I'm all for us as a store staying neutral and willing to work with you as long as you also make sure all other supportive type stuff is removed like anything that relates to religion or sports teams. Don't just shove your feet in the dirt it makes us look bad. Try to work with your boss and find a happy medium. Either it all stays up or it all goes down. Don't just get pushed around but don't attempt to uno reverse and push them around either.
Them asking you to take it down is them pushing their social ideology on you. Also a flag as a symbol isn’t “pUsHiNg An idEoLoGy” it’s just saying your store is a safe space and it’s showing that you yourself support it. Doesn’t force anyone. Like damnit can’t these creatures (ik they people I’m just giving them a fitting group name, I mean the homophobes/transphobes/biphobes etc) just ignore the flags if they hate them so much, call us snowflakes and make such a big deal Everytime someone doesn’t present in their ideals.
...
Was the costumer a Karen?
Huh. The cis strikes again....
Wtf doesn't that fall under discrimination? That person can fuck off.
Complying would only be furthering Karen ideology!
Don’t let that bring your spirits down, I’m sorry they are targeting you it’s so unfair that they think they can treat us this way. Do you remember the individual in particular? Could this be reported as an act of hate crime for harassing you?
Keep it up!!
And we say fuck you gayness rules
Having a pride flag isn't pushing anything it's showing that you support it no more no less not like you say to every customer who comes in ""hi how are you why don't you support the LGBT community"" or something like that
They didn't even leave any customer info, how lame. Hopefully you don't have to interact with that loser again...
""No""
I am surprised they knew what the flags were. I suppose the trans flag I could understand given that the anti-trans propaganda teaches ""the symbols of the enemy,"" but the lesbian flag is lesser-known, at least based on my experience. I have a trans pin on one hat and a massive patch on another, and I have had so many cis hetero and even cis bi people totally not see it or get it. (I wear them to hopefully get gendered correctly because I know I do not look like my pronouns.)

Edit: spelling
Get a new job. Fuck the idiot who complained
“Political” tf?
“I couldn’t help but notice” pisses me off more than it should.
I am so sick of hateful people making everyone else’s lives miserable because theirs is. So sorry! So unfair! If your flag has to come down, all flags should have to do the same.
Fuck that person in particular!
Got something similar with my stuff. Fucking corporations.
Wtf, the flags aren't politics or ideological stuff, they are just... flags. Lol
Depending where you work I believe that goes against non-discrimination policies?
Move them back to the window 

Put your foot down on this
[removed]
Is this an American thing?
That’s so frustrating ☹️
There have been several good ideas for how to combat this here, so imma just say I approve of all of them. Creativity is really important when fighting discrimination, so keep it up cool internet people!

Also, if you choose to fight this don’t let them vilify you. You’re right, and you’re fighting for equal rights, as long as everyone knows you’re fighting for the well being of everyone, they have no real power over you. If they can make you seem like the bad guy, they will, and then you lose support and they gain power.
Huh. I’m honestly surprised someone recognized both the trans flag and the lesbian flag AND was upset about them. Most of the bigots I know could probably tell the flags were LGBTQ+ related but I doubt they would be able to identify the lesbian flag.
That's bullshit they are just showing there Pride there not pushing anything on people. The people complaining are the ones who are pushing there shit onto people like there Fairy Tail religion
Ugh.. pathetic.

Feels like your employer doesn't value you worth anything when shit like this happens. The potential loss out ways the potential outrage and backlash from getting cancelled. Good news is if you keep pushing it once in a while, eventually someone will cancel corporate for it and they'll lose massive profits once the investors realize they're bigots.
If you think that’s political, you are the problem.
Tfw your existence alone is considered a political opinion…
Fuck that customer keep it up
YES!
But it‘s ReLigEoUs FrEeDOm!!1!1!1
That's what they do though. Allow a LGBT group at a school? Shut down all clubs instead. Then there is even more hate given to the LGBT folks. It happens. Has happened when there was going to be a Gay Support group, or a Jewish heritage group, etc.
Not to mention flags of any kind, even the one of your own country.
If OP doesn’t do this I’ll be disappointed
That's what Im saying, it's like they use that line as an excuse for they're hideously close minded behavior
[removed]
From a legal standpoint, you understand there's a difference between something you are wearing on your body and something you hang in a window in a public space right?

If OP was wearing trans earrings or a pin, I'd say they are 100% in the right in not allowing the company to bully them, but a window is a different story. So the comparison you're making doesn't work.

It would have to be something like the company was allowing a cross in the window but not the flag, but even then it would be hard to argue Title VII because Gender Expression is not a catch-all and doesn't cover a public space, only a personal space like your clothing, your personal desk, etc.

Another example would be say you worked at a diner and had a trans pin and the company said take it off, 100% Title VII right there. However, if you went around and put a small trans flag on every table when you started taking orders, that would not be covered.
We need to find that feedback form and notice the flags are gone from the window. That the place used to feel welcoming and now that it has been removed we are starting to wonder if this company is placing politics over actual people.
move them back
Why move them Don’t give in.
Sounds like the dialogs between me and my dad

Right? It works the other way too right?
We should find the name of the store and all leave complaints.

Edit - removed a part that made it sound like I know how to find the store. I do not.

Edit - just in case anyone doesn't read through the thread, don't actually do it. They still work there and could get in trouble or have unwanted heat or attention from something like this. I shouldn't have mentioned it.
I would for sure. At this point id be operating under the assumption that either im getting fired or quitting.
OP please have your friends do this.
Yea
Screw it, remove the country flag too
Being trans lesbian is definitely part of The Agenda (TM)
Right? They're weirdly dedicated to gas stations 🙄
IKR - first thought. Obvious already primed by anti-queer ideology. Ironic that they are the ones trying to make our existence political.
How I wish an employer would reply to this kind of crap with exactly that sentiment. IF only we all worked for someone with a spine who would stand up against this shit. Who fucking cares if one self-important bigot goes somewhere else to shop. Surely their contribution to the bottom line is insignificant by itself, and the business of other new customers who respect courage, conviction and empathy would outweigh their loss.
OP can sue their boss if the boss tells them off.
[deleted]
>You have every right to display your flags.

You do in your own personal areas such as your desk or a pin on your clothing. A window in a shop is not a personal area and wouldn't be covered under Title VII for gender discrimination if the boss asked you to remove it.

Gender Expression does not mean you have the right to place a flag anywhere you choose at your place of work. Please do not give bad legal advice.
She works in the corporate office and receives customer complaints
Wait a minute it says no customer info, meaning Tina m mendoza must be someone who works there 🕵🏼‍♀️
If only the coward afforded her the opportunity by telling her to her face.
Ratio
I was told to by the area supervisor after receiving said complaint
yes because one jpeg is all you need to understand the incident, dumdum
Awww, I just saw your cute little insult before it got removed. Try a little harder, honey.
No clue, nobody ever complained about them directly to me
It does, I was going to make this comment. It doesn't matter where they work or the companies policy, it's a Federal law against discrimination that applies to every business in America. The Civil Rights Act of 1968
If that were true then they also shouldn't care enough to complain
Apparently. The almighty dollar is the power, and the ppl who wield it.  Complain loud enough, store owners get nervous about getting negative attention. Easier to conform.  That’s why despite complaints like this cause flags to be taken down in stores, large companies still take advantage of Pride month with product placement here. Go figure.  I wish the large corporations would try to promote Pride by not profiting from the products they sell (M&Ms, Skittles, etc.) and sink that $$ into non-profits that genuinely help those who are LGBTQ+ that are in need.
AND I'M HANGING UP A PIECE OF COLOURED PAPER, SO STOP WHINING AND BUY YOUR DAMN COFFEE!!!
As a hedonist, it is my religion to live my life to the fullest, so the flags are my religion
I'm only saying that we can't sit back and do nothing when they target only LGBTQIA+ people. 

If they want to remove one symbol, then they need to be consistent -- or realize that my Pride flag isn't any different than their other symbols which are allowed.
Just giving in is the wrong way to handle it though. You gotta direct that hate to where it belongs. Not to the LGBTQ+ group but at the asshats who suppress others.
We hid a secret LGBT club in our dnd club
I heard about that story. Benny Shabeepoo made a video on it even.
wait did this actually happen bc of a jewish heritage group? im jewish and just want to know
Likewise, I don't see a Pride flag or pin as a problem. It's a way for LGBTQIA+ people to express themselves and for cis het allies to show support.

The owner should not have told her to take the flag down.
Do you have a problem with displaying a trans or pride flag?
This.

Please post the URL for feedback. I want to show my dismay.
YES, OP please link and I will post something similar.
this might just be my 3 am brain but i cannot understand what you said
Better yet: add more pride flags
dementia hits hard
dementia hits hard
dementia hits hard
OP still works there...
Well the investigator in me couldn't help herself. I'm pretty sure I have figured out the store but now I have no idea what, if anything, to do with this information.

I want to support my siblings but not at the risk of it backfiring on an individual.

Edit: I guess I should just let it be. OP will do what she needs to feel OK without me meddling. I doubt head office would nationally endorse inclusivity based on what I have read.

I guess as an employee the only recourse is to just push the boundaries (in the bigots eyes) of self-expression and either continue happily of be terminated and sue.
It’s discrimination based on the basis of sex, so you could try to sue them… but then again the local governments aren’t really in our favor anyway
No thats just MY agenda for me. Accomplished btw :)
Cue the ""why you so obsessed with me"" lmao MY EXISTENCE ISNT MY CHOICE DUDE at least let me be happy in the body I'm cursed to exist in??
Got it, so solution here is… refuse to take down the flags, get told off, sue.
It doesn't though - as much as I wish this were true. Firing someone or treating them differently on the basis of gender identity would be a violation. But it is the business owner's right to market their business any way they chose - as accepting of gender and sexual diversity or not. Personally I think the employer is losing by not advertising that they welcome us all. But it is their choice.

What the employer cannot do is dictate your own gender presentation or expression of identity beyond requiring a uniform to be worn. My reaction to this crap would be to first explain to the employer what they are losing by caving in to bigots vs the potential benefits of showing they are enlightened. If that failed I would push the boundaries of my own presentation to be as out, proud and obvious as possible both to get up bigots' noses and to show support for my fellow queer people.

>my Pride flag isn't any different than their other symbols

In that, you are wrong. Your pride flag stands for the freedom to live your life the way you want to. 

Their crosses, for example,  stand for ~ 2000 years of war, inquisition, crusades, punishent, torture and blind obedience. It stands for beliving in biologically and physically impossible processes, so called wonders, described in a fairy tale / old book. You could go as well as with The Lord of The Rings.
  
Freedom is to say things, others don't want to hear. To write things, that others don't want to read and to do things that others don't want you to do. As long as nobody is hurt.

There is nothing more into freedom than the pride flag.

Edit: some grammar
[removed]
Oh, you're so right ... we cannot sit back and do nothing.
But I for one am not convinced the correct thing to do is widen an unreasonably vague, arbitrary, and prejudicial policy in order to cure some inadequacy about it.

Whenever the reach of a bad rule becomes the focus, it's easier to forget that it's just a bad rule altogether.
Sure; widening the scope of the rule until it applies to literally everyone is a subtle way to do that; but in this brave new world of Trump supporters?
You gotta spell it out in taller letters than that.
Yes, but this is what they do to enforce said hate.
Seems I was mistaken, had recalled it but couldn't find a source. Jewish as well, and all I could find is the recent Yeshiva debacle for an LGBT group, which is almost the opposite of what I was looking for.
[removed]
[removed]
They could potentially get in trouble for that, I would rather not cost OP her job.
I worded it kinda weird, like I would have spoken it out loud. 3am brain might have never had a chance, mine included...

Basically, find the feedback form for that gas station and leave feedback that says we miss the pride flags that were in the window. Insinuating that they were taken down for political reasons when the flags are really just about people (putting politics over actual people).
Add an American flag. That way if they complain, they by extension they must complain  amount the American flag
And add one more every day, until OPs boss or other customers notice :3
Yes, but I doubt they wish to dox themselves. Or do you mean we shouldn't do this because it could get them in trouble? Because that could be possible now that I think about it.
I feel ya. Our hearts were in the right place. But you're right, it could be risky.
:)
Yes. Profit. If they're forced to take down the flags, it's a discrimination case.

Wow you're an absolute pos lol 

GL with your garbage personality
< evil laugh > Oh you fool, I AM my manager! *boss music starts playing *health bar appears
The sad thing is, it goes both ways.
Sweet quote, I’m stealing this! :D
I agree with you.
No, they're not any different. Christian symbols have meaning to them and identify themselves to others -- so also does a Pride flag have meaning to LGBTQIA+ people and identify themselves to others.

If you push out people who are LGBTQIA+ just because of who they are, that's hateful.

***Bottom Line:*** Let's leave **BOTH** the Pride flag **AND** the Cross in place and remove neither.
Doesn't mean you can't use that hate against them.
Let's keep \*both\* the Pride flag and religious symbols up and visible.
It’s just a question
ohhh alr thanks!
Yeah, we don't want them to have a hard time at work.
Yeah. I thought about a non-identifying non-store-specific approach via the chain website but after a little bit of research on the chain I doubt this would result in any positive change and may indeed come back to the OP.

So ultimately as much as this hurts us all its not our business to act if the nett result is just another loss for a sister.
Hi, actual lawyer here. You're completely wrong. Title VII does NOT cover putting a flag in a window. If it was a pin on someone's person, or say a flag on a personal desk, that could easily be argued as part of gender expression (like clothing choice), but a window in a storefront is not a part of gender expression and can 100% be regulated by an owner of a business.

The cases you're quoting are for things like use of preferred restroom, being denied a promotion on the basis of gender, etc. and are not relevant.

Please don't play armchair lawyer and give factually untrue advice to people.
God, what a playground level insult that was. Buddy needs to try a little harder, eh?

Kind of heard ' Killing in the Name of' a few hours ago... Song of my time. 

Everytime I hear it, I wonder why people don't see that 'belive' and obedience are the tools for religious leaders to make them follow. Everytime I end with the answer that one part of them does see it, they had to. They don't care or want to benefit from it. The other part is too weak in mind to understand their own limited life. They want more life, a better life. 

It all comes down to one Thing: greed.

3 beautiful ladies right there. (The third is the beer).
Every week is pride week 🌈 teehee
pretty!
Stunning! Xx
I assume this picture is old as it's currently winter. Either way two beautiful gall's the both of you 😘!
I'm Irish and trans and you are doing a great job as a representative member of our community. Sorry if I was vague.
???
Thank you grrl xx
Ireland xx
Thank you ❤️❤️❤️
We did 💜
And looking trans is bad how?
I know this comment is trying to say something positive but it really comes off as ""congrats you don't look trans""
Thank you darling ❣️
Absolutely. Not a big fan of Guinness. Prefer the chardonnay 💅💅💅💅
Really as Kerry gold xx
I did. It was fun xx
Hehe 😋
Facts 🏳️‍🌈🏳️‍🌈🏳️‍🌈🏳️‍🌈 xx
Thank you pups xx
💜💜💜💜
A lot of people despise the Irish so it's good to have quality representatives.
Aye I didn't mean it that way, sry for any offence. I meant it as a more ""Hey, your transition looks really good nice work"" instead of an insult. Sry for any accidental insults
Oh really. I never really came across that.
English person here. I haven't either. Usually you guys get extra love because everyone actually hates us and we've been so terrible to you.

You both match your drinks nicely BTW"	10izway	trans	2312	0.98	2023-01-23 01:11:55
Attended my first pride march today, also dressed fem outside for the first time, I loved it 🏳️‍⚧️🏳️‍🌈💕 (thank you Hannover)		"Glad for you on both counts; 1st Pride and 1st time dressing for *your* comfort and happiness. 🌈👍
Why do we girls love the goth look so much? Oh, right! Because it looks amazing! Especially on you!
Ahh amazing I’m so pleased for you ! I love your outfit too !
There is a very good chance I walked past you today then lmao
Cuuute 😍🥰🥰🥰
I love ur outfit!! It suits you very well <3
Absolutely wonderful
I am so thrilled for you that you got to do this! Your smile is so unbelievably warm and I love your goth look so much.   


I was at my first Pridefest in Milwaukee yesterday and it was only the second time I'd been in public as myself. It was amazing in every possible way. I took so many photos and videos, bought some beautiful earrings and a great Pride shirt, and even DANCED during the big rave party!

I have never felt so free and welcome to be myself. I never felt like anyone was staring, looking, or judging, or anything. I will cherish this event forever.
I love your look!! It's def close to the aesthetic I want for myself. 😊😊😊
i went to my first one yesterday!
Great outfit!!! I really love your bag too.
I love the net leggings!
Girl, you've got a 90s ""The Craft"" aesthetic and I'm here for it! Congrats on 1st pride and first outing as yourself!
[deleted]
I went to my first Pride today too! It was in Jacksonville NC.
I love the pentagram bag haha
Gosh you're so cute! 🥰 Also, I love Germany, it's such a beautiful country ❤️ Ich lerne jetzt Deutsch aber es ist echt schwer 🫤
I also went to my first pride fest today! Different one though judging by the background.
So happy for you, looooove this look ❤️
Get it girl!
Aw, I'm so proud of you!!!! This year will be my first pride too. Hopefully I can get the courage to be like you!!!!!     🏳️‍🌈💙💗🤍💗💙🏳️‍🌈
Damn, sweetie, you look amazing!

Happy Pride!
You look so pretty! The style definitely suits you!

My style is more pastel goth, which is tough to work with as a guy but I am trying to be the change I wanna see in the world, both fashion wise and in general lol

Plus I can never give up cute stuff and wearing adorable pins/buttons in my outfits haha
I'm so happy for you :D, me and my gf wanted to go to the csd in Hamburg. We're taking our trans flag and Blahaj with us
U look absolutely fabulous, i cant wait to attend my first pride march someday, though it will probably only be in a few years when i go to college w my bf, there arent many cities in my country that holds pride events
Didn't expect to see Hannover on here, but nice.
I might have walked just a few rows behind you then c:
I actually talked to the guy in yellow behind you in the picture, he had asked what the Trans- and Lesbian Flags meant my friends were using as capes.
Yay I hope you had a great time, you look stunning!
Omg i saw you!!!!
Short and dump question: Can you Send me a dm?
You people have way too much free time, really envy people like you....
Love the goth look, you look beautiful <3
😊😊😊
I saw a meme before I started transitioning that was like, ""Be the big-tiddie goth gf you want to see in the world"", and I'm really taking it to heart.   
Good job, OP! Keep it up you look AMAZING and you are glowing! :)
RIGHT?! It's the best aesthetic! ... now I just got to learn how to do some fitting makeup >.>
Thanks <3
Oh neat, I was pretty much all the way at the front of the march :3  


... judging by that one pic of yourself you posted (sorry for stalking) I might actually have seen you >w<
Aww <3
Thanks <3 felt really comfortable in it :3
🥺🥺🥺 awww thanks hun <3  


Yeah I actually was THIS close to dancing and singing as well >w<  
I NEVER dare doing that  
I even dared take some cute people up on their ""free hugs and kisses"" offers x3  


The feeling of just being able to be yourself without judgement is AMAZING
Awwww 🥺🥺🥺
Nice <3
Aww thanks <3
Wasn't confident enough in my legs to have them bare >w<  


... not that nets cover much anyways x3
Actually kind of what I was going for >w<  
Wish I had the makeup skills though
Literally the best day of my life, felt genuinely happy and welcomed for the first time ... without any fears or doubts ... too bad it's  back to being harrased by the cishets in day to day life again ...
Awesome!
Me too :3  
If you google ""Banned Alternative Anubis Handbag"" you should be able to find more pics of it
\>///w///<  
Ahhhhhh thanks <3  


Yeah I hear people say that it's quite hard a lot x3
Yeah I was in Hannover Germany and we Germans seem to be a rather small group on here >w<
Thanks <3
Ya girl did in fact get it :3
You can do it, we believe in you <3  
It was an amazing experience
Thanks <3  


Happy Pride to you too <3
Aww thanks <3  


I LOVE pastel goth, but I don't think I could pull it off >w<
I really want to go to Hamburg as well, but Wacken ends that day so I'll probably be on my way home from that ... although we're passing through Hamburg anyway so we might just make a quick stop there as well >w<

Absolutely going to Bremen though

I SHOULD HAVE BROUGHT MY BLÅHAJ!Dangit!
Yeah it's not too many here either sadly ...  


Good luck with your plans though, I'm sure it'll be all the better when you finally are there <3
Yup  
The rare non American post :3  


Didn't expect this many people to be there either tbh ... or how many of those actually took the train to where I live ... also kinda sad to see most of them take of their flags and stuff before arriving ... I learned why pretty quickly
Oh heck that's cool  
Silly me forgot her trans flag, because I was in a hurry and thought I missed my train (yay 9€ Ticket) but ended up being 40 minutes early >w<  
So I had to buy one there and they didn't have any trans flag, so I got an inclusive flag instead and used that as a cape, most people seemed to know that one at least >w<  


If you see me next year just come say hi ... I really should have made a sign ... or be brave enough to take people up on their offered hugs
<3  
I had
You did?! 

.>w< that’s cool, wish I had said hi to more people, but I’m bad at talking in person
Sure :3  
Sent you one
Awww thanks <3  


Also YES, I'm going for that big tiddie goth gf look x3
Oh I didn't actually participate in the march, I don't really like being in large groups of people, I was just in the city to get some nail polish and then I went home LMAO

nontheless you still might have seen me yeah
I think you look great! Skills come with practice for sure. A dark lip and mascara would be totally 90s. We used to line our lips with brown eyebrow pencil and fill in with lipgloss or a lighter shade of lipatick back in the day (using the pencil to get a shade we wanted) So are extra thin eyebrows, but I wouldn't go that far!
[deleted]
Ooo niceee
My best friend/ex bf just moved to Germany to be with his boyfriend, and I'm going to be visiting them later this year for a few weeks. We're probably going to take a road trip around Germany, any recommendations if we end up in Hannover?
🙌🏻🙌🏻🙌🏻🙌🏻🙌🏻
Thank you for the support! I'm on day 18 of hrt and starting to feel like myself!!!!💙💗🏳️‍⚧️💗💙
No problem, you're definitely rocking the goth style🖤

Pastel goth is a cute style but it's ridiculous how hard it is to make it work sometimes. 
Don't get me started on the struggle of making sure nothing pastel is mixed with my dark clothing when I do my laundry lol
Ty, stay safe mate, remeber that u and whoever else is reading this comment are loved and ambsolutely awsome!
I couldn't be there sadly, because i was sick, but i heard it was a pretty nice experience, what would you say?
Yea same there where sooo many people i wish i Talked with
Ah I see >w<  


Yeah normally I'm the same and get really anxious around people ... but yesterday I just felt so comfortable around all those cool people <3
Yeah ... I just gotta convince myself to actually try and keep trying ... I always get really dysphoric when I try and it doesn't look any good and that discourages me so much that I stop trying for some time ...
Awww <3   
Thanks, although I look 5-10 years younger than I actually am >w<  
Started at 28, am 29 now :3  
I'll try to be more brave in the future, this definitely improved my self worth a lot, so I hope I'll dare to go out like this more often
Sorry just recently moved here myself so I can't really make any real recommendations, but if you're around here see if you can make a trip to the Harz, especially the Brocken. A beautiful mountain which gives you a great view over northern Germany because of it's location within relatively flat surrounding terrain. There's a cute steam train running up there if you're not into hiking :3
Yay, that's amazing <3
Awww thanks <3  


YES, not mixing my two styles is a PAIN ... pink and black don't like to share >w<
Yeah it was pretty great, huge crowd, great people ...  although the organisation was a bit crap  
I was all the way at the front but from what I heard the march got seperated a few times and some of the slower groups at the back got lost ... yeah I don't think they were prepared for like 11.000 people >w<
Like they literally have „free hugs and kisses“ signs and I’m like „nah, they can’t possibly mean me!“ … I’ll definitely get one for next year’s 

Also if you ever see me around feel free to say hi :3
I’m very shy and won’t bite
I can understand that. Maybe try doing just one area at a time for awhile? Try only lipstick for awhile, say 2 weeks. (Lip gloss can give a tint and you just gave yo out a bit on and not worry about ""coloring outside of the lines."" Play with mascara for a couple of weeks. Emphasis on *play. No one is good at makeup when they start... or even for awhile! Just play and have fun, if it's not fun, don't do it. I only wear makeup when I want to, nothing says you have to! You've got this, no matter what you do! *hugs
[deleted]
Holy shit! 11k? that's amazing!
Thanks, I might try that <3
But of course 
Why wouldn’t I :3
Yeah it was HUGE
Also, you look pretty good! totally forgot that lmao

3 months on HRT, License changed to represent my true self, and a gorgeous (even if it is sweltering) week here in Seattle. 🌈 happy pride month 🖤🖤🖤		"Looking good, and I also love your tattoo!

Glad to see you survived the heatwave! That was a nightmare!

UR SO PRETTY

You are literally goals 😍😩
Cute 🥰☺️

Age? I love what HRT does for us !!! 🙏🏳️‍⚧️
Congrats!! The weather isn’t the only gorgeous thing in Seattle today. Happy Pride Month!!🏳️‍🌈🏳️‍🌈
You look great!!
You look like the vampire lady from the new resident evil, thats awesome
Happy pride! Looking great 🏳️‍🌈
Absolutely Stunning!
Just to verify, in Washington you just declare your gender at the DMV right? My name change court date is end of July and I want to be prepared. The courthouse gave me a form for license gender marker that looks like it might have been out of date since it required information from a doctor.
Omg you are gorgeous ahhhh heat wave sucked, but I accidentally was in a park for 7 hours because a pride meetup descended on my meditation spot! Heat wave defeated by gay friendship!
MAGNIFICENT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!❤️💫❤️
YOOOO WHERE ARE MY WASHITONIAN SISTERS AT?... I'm stanwood
I just left Seattle on Saturday lmao
You look amazing!!!
Congrats
Woh! Girl you look AMAZING! I'm 4 months in but pretty much boy mode... Do you have some tips for me?
Hello goddess
congrats that’s awesome! you’re so pretty, goals goals goals 🙂
Ok you are absolutely stunning and straight up GOALS! also I love that dress!
You Look Amazing Girl!! keep giving us updates on your HRT. Kisses From Atlanta!! Happy Pride Month!!
Sure looks 🌡️😎❗Great for you...I recently did the same♀️on my CAID...so awesome! Been on HRT (5 months now) MTF ,Enjoy...
Thanks! I got it done at Hidden Hand Tattoo by Jeff ❤
Never noticed that until now it's my friends place 🤣🤣
'cause our community is in distress due to a wave of reactionary anti-trans backlash.
Hot Topic 😄
Dirty 30 😈
You're too kind 🥰
My friends say I dress like Im in AHS Coven 🤣🤷‍♀️
At least in king co thats all you gotta do. I was born in Arkansas so I gotta have an orchiectomy at min to change my birth certificate. 🥺
Good timing 😝
Everybody is so different that everybody's journey will be very different so what works for me may not for you.  Take your HRT, stay hydrated, wear the clothes you wanna wear, speak however you're comfortable. Most importantly remember that you are valid and beautiful.
Taking note for when I inevitably return to Seattle.
Gotcha, DMV/DOL rules should be state wide so I should be good then. I hear you about birth certificate though. I was born in Oklahoma so I gotta get a gender change court order but I'm struggling to find out how since it doesn't seem like Washington does those. I'm probably just going to get passport and SSA done to start with after my driver's license.
Seattle was a fun 2 week trip. Did a bunch of hiking, plus the pride flags everywhere were very heartwarming
Awww ty for this cute message <3 and you betcha I'll be taking my HRT! Cant wait to finnaly go trough life as a woman, but it's still proves to be quite a daunting task unfortunately. But hopefully as time goes on I'll be able to see the woman I am :)"	oakal2	trans	2106	0.97	2021-06-29 23:29:44

Do they have an elastic bit to slip over the back on your foot so your feet don’t constantly fall out of them? That’s genius!
Gorgeous!  The slippers are pretty cool too.

Trans pride ariel silks :) [art by me]		"Your art style is so cool tho :))
Ahem... this is gay. But also like holy shot that is amazing art.
I literally saw a lady doing ariel silks yesterday and in the middle they pulled out a trans flag hand fan for a few moments at the circus!
Holy shit! As someone who just started aerial silks in October, this absolutely amazing!!!!
Great art!!
This is so pretty!!
YOOOO, this art is fantastic! It's nice to see other trans folks who do silks aaaaa
OOHHH
I'm looking at this like 15 minutes before an aerial silks class lol
Awwww. That's so cute
Oh that's awesome 👌🏼
I might have to commission some work from you
Too beautiful, Can I save it in my phone?
Love it but it’s aerial. Although points for my name though
Thank u!
Whaaaat nooo

Thank u!
Ooo awesome!
And thank u!
Thank u!
Thank u!! I barely do silks myself, I'm more of an ariel hoop or pole guy XD but I try 😂
My DMs are always open :)
No problem
I know this is going to sound dumb but I hope you know what I mean, but I'll also try to explain it as much as possible, but. How long have you been a transman, like ya know out as a transman if you are out of course? I'm only asking cause if you want any advice on how men work I can give you some advice but it'd have to be in the dms cause it's secretive stuff.
I've actually discovered a place that will dye silks and do pride flags. My friend has lesbian silks!
Yo, whaaat, what a coincidence! I'm also more of a hoop guy myself, it's so much fun! I've never tried pole, but it seems fun
Its alright, I'm pretty open! I figured out I was trans at 14, at which I tried coming out within that year.  My parents didn't approve, so I went into the closet and supressed everything until about 18 where I came out again and just yeeted everyone's opinions aside.  Been on T for 6 months now :)

My DMs are always open!
They're both quite fun, but omg my muscles after 😂 pain
Alright sounds like you prolly know more than enough already. But also even though I haven't seen what you look like you're a handsome bastard :) <3
Uuuuuuugh, I know the feeling!! It's like I hate that I'm doing this for my own good
Aw thank u :)
Now go and freaking destroy everything, with how ungodly handsome you are, my lord (if of course you are okay with being called that)"	v0j061	trans	1871	0.99	2022-05-29 19:56:05
"The german ""Selbstbestimmungsgesetz"" (Self ID Law)"	"The last day of pride month the german government revealed their plans for the upcoming self ID law, after 40 years without changes:

-Removal of assessments, people can now simply file a change and get it 

-Deadnaming will be a punishable offense

-Forced outing will be punishable even for private persons

I liked is that they reaffirmed in response to T*RF questions that trans women are women and also the statement that the supposed debate about trans people is already settled in the medical world. 

It's a start and I am very happy about it!😍 🏳️‍⚧️"	"YOU FORGOT THE BEST PART!!! Starting at age 14 you can do it on your own and if your lega guardians disagree with it you can get the German version of cps to ""replace your parents""(this is a quote and I find it hella funny) after an application of the child!!!
\- Deadnaming will be a punishable offense  
For who? The people or the government?
Germany is fucking legendary… cheers… now THAT’S what i call freedom

Not whatever the fuck america’s doin
I miss Germany! Years ago as a young teen. I’m so happy for you.
I already know basic German from highschool. Think I may need to polish it up and flee my country soon...
F*ck the US, I'm moving to Germany
adding it to my list of places to live in a few years.
omw to Germany
Einfach genial! Can Germany pick up the torch for research into uterine transplants for trans women? I have a feeling if German surgeons picked it up and joined the Swedish and Indian surgeons we could have a solution in single years instead of decades.
Nice
But you'll still need to get 2 therapist to analyse you and shit to medically transition :/
maybe all hope isn’t lost just yet
As a german person I absolutely love this.
Do you have a link to an article or something?
So first of all, it's not coming until mid 2023. If at all, knowing our government.

And it doesn't include much needed improvements to medical access as was promised and as was included in the old proposals from the greens and FDP. The fucking terfs at the SPD made them compromise on this. 

It's a disappointment.

https://www.queer.de/detail.php?article_id=42474
Well, if the USA completely goes to shit, Germany, here I come
Despite Germany being controversial in world history it is ahead of America can we just appreciate that for a second
I love Germany even more now
I am SO glad for some good news for once.
I need to up my Duolingo game, because if our government doesn't do stuff in the foreseeable future, I might be migrating.
Do you have a link to the debate or wherever they answered the questions/suggested the law?
I hope they implement it soon..
Lets fucking gooooooo (to germany)
That's it, Germany here I come!
Where in Germany can an aspiring trans film maker get work and be safe and survive knowing no German except ""eggs taste good"" 😂
Finally! I still remember how the Judge basically just chatted a little with me when I had my court appointment, because to her I look like a woman and sound like a woman and that's that.
Sounds like I need to brush up on my German...
I think they need to ad a couple more letters to that word
***SOMEBODY CALL UP A PLANE, I'M PACKING MY BAGS***
I've been on a high ever since they announced it 😊
I FUCKING LOVE GERMANY I AM going to move there as soon as I turn 18 and can get the fuck out of America and away from my mostly shitty family
Aaay go Germany!
I'm visiting Germany rn and that's why I love this country! BERLIN IS MY CITY! ICH BIN BERLINER!!!
Dude I gotta move to germany
I'll be keeping Germany in my mind for when I finish my computer science degree here in the US 👀
criminalisation of private conversations and interactions is fucking terrifying. this is not the way to go.
Fuck that's awesome, but with a word that long you knew it had to be awesome. I love the German language :P
the mentioned points are outlines of the law, wich fill be finished in the next months and will be official in about a year.
A law for easier access to medical transitioning will follow during the next years too.
Germany is finally going a few steps forward, now that the Conservative party is out of government!
does the removal of assessments apply to hrt and surgeries?
That sounds wonderful!
While America goes backwards…
That's extremely based.
I hope it passes this time 🙏. The SPD (Social democrats) wouldn't pass it the last time. 

The current law is in desperate need of overhual.
Feels weird to say, but the Germans are getting it right..
This made me cry I love German people so much it’s so wonderful to see good news when there is so much bad in the us
Okay but punishing people who deadname? It’s taken my friends and especially relatives a while to get used to my chosen name for example, so I think there should be some limitations there
Working adjacent to the german cps - it aint that easy, replacing parents is the very last measure we are legally allowed to take. Gotta try fixing it first, aka talking to parents and helping them understand. Only if there is child endangerment going on (which it also is if parents refuse to change problematic behaviour in their parenting) can we take kids away. 


Unless you mean cps consent replaces parental consent for this procedure only. Then it might be very much different, depending on how the law is worded.
[removed]
It counts as infringement of your privacy. If you are considered openly trans, i.e. you were a public figure before transitioning then it is okay for newspaper to mention your deadname so people know who actually tranistioned. Otherwise, if someone would out you to people who don't know, or the General public, that would be punishable. Its probably a bit like publishing photos of the inside of the home of somebody, in a paper, without their consent. (In terms of legal things)
They said that it's only punishavle if you don't have the infotmation from public sources.

So no, deadnaming by random people, who happen to know your deadname, will not be punishable.

It's about the people who work with the government and have access to the documents, where your name change is listed (i think this extends to everyone who has access to these documents). If they out you, that would be an offense.

But i'm not getting my hopes as high. It was just a plan with no duty to follow up on it. The law-writing-process didn't even begin yet. So we'll see if there will be anything at all, and if yes, how the law will look at that point...
It's probably gonna be similar to insults but I'm not sure
Eh, I highly doubt that this will actually happen.


Last time they promised similar nice things and what did they try in the end?
Make the trans person's fucking SPOUSE testify in court.
Never specified how that will impact the decision of gender marker change, just that the spouse will be asked to testify.


Caused huge outrage and they pulled it back.

So yeah, I don't think this is going to happen.




Hell, even legalization of cannabis, while everywhere in the news, is still on very unstable legs.
CDU just needs to get a tad more power and they will throw it out of the window, despite nearly all of Germany supporting it.


Fuck I despise these Christian conservative fuckers.
I'm living in Germany and it's not that great. Still better than the usa right now, i guess, but fascism is rising fast here as well. So let's see how the future goes...
Americas a nursery in comparison to the burj Khalifa which is germany
what america is doing is called fascism ~ the oppression of individual freedoms combined with ultra-militarism/ultra-nationalism
Same.
I heard the earliest it'll be an active law is the start of 2023, take your time lol
Its not passed
We were the leading nation in transgender issues once, we can do it again, I'll believe in it!
Germany does research into uterine transplants already, but that really doesn't help trans women as of yet. The problem isn't the uterus, it's synthesising the complex hormones needed for a full cycle as well as pregnancy.

And so far, ovaries aren't reusable.

Plus, transplanted people are *extremely* immunocompromised. 

I wish that uterine transplants would be the viable next step for trans women becoming biological, child carrying mothers, but I really don't think it is. First we need to find a way to improve HRT to a point that a uterus would be useful.
It ain't gonna happen ever.

It's theoretically possible, but every type of organ transplant requires immuno suppressants.

People are already fighting back against hormones due to side effects and such, society would never allow a surgery like that if it means being reliant on immuno suppressants for the rest of your life.
And most organ implants still get rejected a decade or so later so it is a super dangerous surgery too, even years after it's healed. 

It's a nice dream for sure but I don't think it's gonna be reality :<
Apparently they said that Lauterbach is working to reform that
No, you don't. You need a mandatory number of therapy sessions (differs for what you want; it's 12 for HRT and minor surgeries) and then a single letter (the Indikationsschreiben) from a single therapist of your choosing.

The 2 specialist thing and court sessions is only for changing your name and/or sexmarker in your documents and the very law that this thread is about aims to get rid of that.
Here's a brief one. There's surprisingly little about it in the newspapers so far. https://www.dw.com/en/germany-unveils-plans-for-simpler-legal-gender-change-process/a-62315345
If you're not german, then run this through a translator. https://www.queer.de/detail.php?article_id=42474
every country is controversial in world history so it doesnt make a diffrence
https://youtu.be/_wF9mCQgF4Q

Its in german though
You get by in most of europe with english, and over time you'll learn more than ""eggs taste good"". Just what city you need to ask a german about, but I'm guessing Berlin isn't such a bad bet.
We are pros in long weird words xD
Rindfleischetikettierungsüberwachungsaufgabenübertragungsgesetz
(it means Beef Labelling Monitoring Task Transfer Act)
Yesssss!
Welcome to Germany!
It's also not remotely what's proposed here, but go off i guess.
I wasn't sure if it's the right thing to post it right now. But now I kbow it was a good idea!
It will only be punishable if it's done on purpose, not when people slip up unintentionally.
In the courts the child welfare has the highest priority so even if the parents are against it, the child can get a name change. Although i am not entirely sure how this process is and what steps the kid might go through. But it's long in practice to have the child welfare as first priority no matter the case.
this just rubs off the wrong way
[deleted]
That was 90 years ago and this is not a good way to speak of those times.
It's about privacy.


With the transgender law (TSG) as it is right now, legally most places are required to terminate data revealing your past.

""Offenbarung Verbot"" Meaning ""Prohibition of revealing""
Your status as transgender is protected by law.
No one is allowed to see that data anywhere, unless very very necessary.
Even your workplace has to delete any files that can be accessed.
Files that are stored internally and never used don't apply though.
This law doesn't need to go through the Bundesrat. That means only our current government can and will decide about it. 
It's also not just a promise anymore. They showed us the key points of the actual law in work and it will be ready for debate after summer break.
They even said that it will be official early to mid 2023. That is way more than an empty promise. 
And in that time frame the CDU can't possibly gain the power to stop it.
At least we have a democracy lul
Oof

I wish u luck
As a German 

Germany is pretty old school in that regard. We have a law that is proven multiple times to go against human dignity (first article of our constitution) 
Yet somehow is still in place.

One of the party's involved in the new law promised it last legislature as well and then voted against it. 

It also is not set in stone that the law is coming. And if it does it comes in about a year. 

Germany is really not that progressive. 

There are many EU states who have these kind of laws for years

Edit: got words with different meanings mixed up
Would the udssr count as fascistic by that definition?
Maybe Autumn 2022, we have to wait
..
I mean that sounds a long time until you realize that is like half a year which is what you will need to properly come here anyways. 

Starting hrt is still a lottery tho.
Yes, I'd have to be on immunosuppressants. I'm also aware that I'd have a very limited time with it. I just want to have one child. Just one and then they can take it back. 

There's one doctor in India that's going to do the procedure on a trans woman soon, and iirc one in South America. American society will never be ready for it- the only comments I've seen from random Americans is talk of flying to India to assassinate the doctor and patient. 

An American surgeon though did recently write an article talking about how a trans man giving up *all* of their reproductive system could be the solution, and due to many underlying factors could create a surgery with a much higher chance of success. There's also a scientific technique called decellularization which has already shown success in (30k ft version) overwriting the genetic signature of the donor with that of the host, making the donor tissue biocompatible. These two things together would be the way forward, but we're not there yet. 

In the meantime, I understand that there's a high risk of death, either by rejection or by freedom loving Americans, but the pain that this has caused me since I was a teen and still causes me to this day makes the risks to my life and never being able to return to the US are worth it for me. I don't want to be infertile, I want to at least have a chance.
Uterine transplants have already been done several times, idk what you're on about. They just don't work for trans women because of the hormonal situation, but cis women who didn't have an uterus for whatever reason have received transplants and carried children to term with them.
I hope something will come out of this.
Didn't knew that, thanks for telling.
[deleted]
I mean one can hope they're properly going through the law text until they publish something but oh well...
Idek what those words mean together in English
Alrighty, that’s good then c:
Eh, I've said it before and I'll say it again. You'll never find a more reliable ally than an enemy whos seen the error of their ways.
Well... Wow!
Genuinely confused about what I said that’s offensive. They have a legal route for the children to “replace your parents” that doesn’t sound like the CPS nightmare the US has. This is after they are allowed to start hormonal therapy without parental permission. That sounds like it provides autonomy for the children to be accountable for their future. 

Seriously, what’s the low blow here? Unless it seriously is just the joke about “Germany used to be the baddies.”
I’m still really confused about how this was offensive to most people on the sub, and I genuinely am trying to understand.

The first statement was genuine. I really do mean that they offer an unparalleled level of autonomy to people under 16-18, especially the trans community now.

The second statement was a joke about how Germany has come so far from Nazism in comparison to the US going backwards towards fascism, nationalism, and theocracy, *especially in the trans community now.*

I really hope someone can bring it to light how I’m being ignorant and I can actually grow from this, but I really don’t understand how that could’ve been misconstrued.
I might need to start a go fund me for my transition and moving to Germany
Very much hope you are right. The process I went through was real shit 🤷‍♀️


Hope they don't remove the offenbarungsgesetz though. That needs to stay.
Don't really see, why that's a good thing...
This is not the First amendment but rather the first Article of the Constitution. An amendment is something that is added afterwards.
Still sounds better then America
How many? I know of Denmark, Belgium, Malta, Ireland and Portugal. Norway and switzerland also have em but arent EU. 

Thats 5/27 EU nations which is decent, but not a lot. I am genuinely curious if I am missing some.

E: 6/27 actually, I remebered Luxembourg.
It's worth adding that getting an abortion is still a criminal act in Germany. This law is a step in the right direction, but the country still lags behind in many ways and the religious lobby has considerable power. There's no room for complacency anywhere.
6-9 months until it goes to the ministers and the some more time until it goes to the parliament... Summer 2023 is what they communicated
They've said mid 2023.
Fucking same in Finland, with covid everything got fucked. Takes a year and a half at the earliest to start HRT, and my appointments keep fucking getting pushed back double the time
My main point wasn't about it being impossible, but about it not being done due to the huge health risks and costs.


Uterine transplants require life long immune suppressants.



With transgender Healthcare, people claim they balance benefit and risk, and thus try to make many things not available.



Since trans women have been able to live without an uterus for decades, I don't think they will make it available.


Maybe in some non western countries like Thailand, for some good amounts of money.



Well there is also the issue of not many uterus being available.
I can do you one better; here is a very helpful site for all things trans: https://transmann.de

Here's their info on therapy stuff:
https://transmann.de/trans-informationen/medizinisches/therapie-gutachten/

Here's a list with therapists and doctors (probably not 100% up to date, but still better than blind googling):
https://transmann.de/adressen/

They also have a helpline.
The draft law is only going to be published in September at earliest, this is an ""Eckpunktepapier"", a statement of the intended content
I am very sorry,
It's a long bs word, which is used for a meat packaging control law... Its hilarious.
Joking about such things = not OK.

At least as a german thats my best guess.
Thanks for the correction
At least you got informed consent HRT clinics
Ok fewer than I remembered
Still Germany is not that progressive
Sweden i guess?
That's true on paper, but abortion law is also swamped by a bunch of technicalities

Pre-12 week abortions are always allowed, after 12 weeks you need sufficient enough reason, and since it also includes ""significant threat to the physical **or mental** health"", you can chalk up a lot of things under that mental health part, and you need a counselling session 3 days before the abortion.

Realistically, I have not heard from someone who wasn't able to have an abortion, but it's very possible that it does happen, I wouldn't know

A law that didn't allow for ""advertisement"" of abortion by doctors was also repealed in Germany, the same day Roe v Wade was overturned, coincidentally. It means doctors are actually allowed to inform about abortions now, and inform if they offer it as a healthcare service, which previously wasn't allowed either since that would count as ""advertising"".
Getting an abortion is ""illegal"", meaning you can get one if you fulfill certain conditions. The conditions are that you have to ask for it, you have to talk with some guys that yes, you understand what you're doing and get some document from them, a licensed doctor has to do the abortion and the pregnancy has to be before it's 14th week. I'm not sure what happens during the talks so idk if they try to convince you to keep the baby or really just inform you about abortion, but otherwise the conditions sound fairly reasonable to me.
The transplants aren't for LIFE, though. They're transplanted, then you need a few successful cycles, and then they last the pregnancy and get taken out after.

They are only done for people with an extreme wish for biological children, and usually require a donation from your own mum.

They're not done for any other purpose. 

And they wouldn't do shit for trans women because HRT isn't there yet. HRT can't simulate pregnancy hormones. Yet, at least.

The risks outweigh the benefits anyway, for most people, so it'll stay rare.
As someone in Germany with a shaky German at best, do you have any idea how easy/difficult it is to find a therapist speaking English for the required sessions to start HRT?
Wellll, yeah, then our government might be there but the news outlets still don't wan to publish on our issues
Yeah, but I’m requesting an answer from the trans community rather than the German community. It’s clear that y’all have done leaps and bounds. I could understand the response if it’s the “baddies” joke if this were a German subreddit, but I just don’t see how it was in **such** bad taste according to the people of the sub. 

Yes, I might have a very dark sense of humor, but like I feel like this response is strictly from this community and would be accepted elsewhere. 

This community is very small. I have a job working with all kinds of people in a public space, yet not large enough that I interact with members of the trans community on even a bi-monthly basis. 

Really I just want to know what exactly I said was offensive, why, and so I can use it to not offend someone in the future. So far 40+ people have felt the need to downvote and not a single one expand on why it’s negative to the trans community. 

Children only learn when you tell them why they do or don’t do something, not when you say “because I said so.”
Should have made that clear, I don't live in America but I have close friends who do so I'm usually made aware of what goes on. I live in the UK
More progressive on this particular subject than 20 or so other countries. I see what you're saying, but it's important that a 'not very progressive' country seems to be becoming moreso.
Oh no definitely not. 

However I am realizung a shift in tone regarding this issue with many of the 40-60 year old conservatives I work with.
Abortions before twelve weeks and after an array of meetings are not punishable, but still technically illegal. This is the result of a compromise with the Christian right following reunification, and for the former GDR this is worse than what they had before. The overall point I was making is that progress shouldn't be taken for granted on either side of the Atlantic.
It's still a criminal act, but is not punishable if a range of conditions are met. Until very recently, it was also illegal for doctors to advertise (""promote"") abortions.

In practice, it's the usual German thing of making people jump through unnecessary bureaucratic hoops. But the criminalisation of abortion in Eastern Germany and the cancellation of the Roe v Wade ruling in the US show us that progress is not something that can be taken for granted, it has to be fought for. That was my point.
Eh, I assume the science is there, we just need human trials. 


Implants that release very specific amounts of drug into the system are a thing.

We have drugs for e1, drugs for e2, drugs to control SHGB levels, drugs to control prolactin levels, drugs to control progesterone levels. We can control Fsh and lh, but how are we going to get there without trying is the question.



Although you are right, I did not think about using it for pregnancy only.
I would only do such a surgery for a permanent effect in my case.
Doesn't even matter if I'll still be infertile, I just want the tools x')
No, you'd have to call around and ask, i'm afraid.
I searched for an article but was surprised at the lack of major newspapers. Maybe I jumped the gun though - like someone else said, the summary was only published on Thursday and there are opinion pieces out there, only behind paywalls.
Depends on the paper. I read an article where 3 activists discussed this law and even found a trans man who was very much opposed to this law (1 of the three). Forgot names tho, sorry.
I can think of a couple reasons...

- There are some things that shouldn't be joked about, and this is one of them.

- It could be triggering for some people

- ~~Some~~ A lot of people feel that we're headed back to dark days and just don't want that reminder in their face.

- It's old and trite. Will EVERYTHING good that EVER happens there reference their past?

- Several people have reported this comment, so it's not just me.
Finally, thank you. Don’t remove, please leave it all up in case anyone comes across. 

I won’t answer to your points even though I disagree with some of the opinion. I made this chain with open mindedness, rather than to promote any kind of dissent."	vpkf8v	trans	1725	0.97	2022-07-02 05:26:53
Be Proud	Sometimes it’s hard to find pride when the world seems to be crumbling around us. Myself like many can be guilty of burying our heads in the sand, but it’s time to be visibly proud and not just blend in. Together as one we are strong and we can create change, I love you all 🏳️‍⚧️🏳️‍🌈💜	"Fot sure. Love the fit! I love the flag
Thank you 🥲
I love the positivity and solidarity but for the love of the gods, please iron your flags people.
You're xute🥺
Beautifully said! 🧡
Love the outfit! Quite curious where you got the shoes!
IRON THE DANG FLAG
Gorgeous
So cute
For some that’s not possible I for one don’t own an iron, the shower rail is a nice idea again but I don’t have one of those either 😆. Regardless of thoughtful words written or spoken there has to be negativity from someone within the “community”. Thank you for giving me a gentle reminder on why I went about my business with my head buried in the sand for 12 years, with everything that’s going on and what’s wrong with the world there’s always infighting and just negativity somewhere.... I’m proud to be trans and I’m proud of the flag creased or un-creased and I’ll continue being a renegade or let me guess I’m not trans enough?  😆🙈
hang ‘em over the shower curtain rod while you run the shower, minimal effort and steams creases right out
No gatekeeping on this subreddit.
Thank you Skaylen21 💜
Awh thanks 😊, I don’t remember entirely as they’re super old but kind of my comfy a lot to do out and about shoes, I think ASOS but it was years ago, same with the skirt I’ve had that since I was 21 and somehow still fit in it 😂🙈
See previous response about this, it’s not possible for all and I like it the way it is. I’ll rock the flag any dang way I want to, I’m not perfect and neither is anything else in this world, but like I’ve said previous, thanks for reminding me why I’ve buried my head in the sand for over a decade, no matter what words you say or what your trying to achieve someone in the “community” would rather just be 100% negative than 90% positive and 10% suggestion. I’m a renegade but you can’t stop me being trans because my flags creased 🤣😆🏳️‍⚧️
No gatekeeping on this sub. People can use the trans flag however they wish.
You’re trans enough, but unfortunately as a trans elder I’m going to have to issue you a citation for violation of flag etiquette. You must recite the pledge 20 times while holding a BLÅHAJ over your heart. It’s the law. If you refuse you will be sentenced to six months in a dysfunctional trans polycule full of emotional turmoil and leftist infighting. 🤷‍♀️ I don’t make the rules.
Love this ❤️
Please iron flag = you're trans enough.

I genuinely, honestly, whole heartedly don't understand how ""get the creases out of your flag"" has *anything* to do with your trans validity.
I don't understand how I'm gatekeeping.
sorry it just makes me crazy and i didn't see it until after i commented
I didn't gatekeep, I DON'T EVEN KNOW WHAT THAT MEANS
Blåhaj aren’t easy to come by, friend. At least I can’t seem to get my grubby hands on one ;-;
It’s a dry reply to a gatekeepy negative comment, people can display the trans flag however they wish creased or uncreased it doesn’t matter and it’s such a trivial thing compared to the point that was trying to be made about change and love. For many their flags will be creased as they probably are folded and hidden for reasons. A comment such as yours could quite easily make people scared to share them with their flag because it’s creased and it may be the only thing they find peace and solace in... we should be encouraging waving the flag about and it’s condition or presentation shouldn’t be something we hone in on.
It means that it’s exactly ZERO percent your business how others present the flag, or anything else on this subreddit.
Why would you admit this publicly? To the polycule with you! I hope you like six months of hard emotional labor!
Fine
Ugh fine. Maybe I can get in touch with an ethical Blåhaj distributor through the polycule. -_-"	115d8kh	trans	1671	0.95	2023-02-18 11:23:16

Suffice to say, I shall not look anywhere as good as you 💟
I wouldn't even suspect you're trans<3<3<3
Just remember you don’t owe anyone an outfit, and that just waking up in the morning you fuck the corrupt system that oppresses you, just by existing.
You look beautiful! You should tie the shoelaces in stars[like this](https://pin.it/qseLrhz)

Right on girl 🥳
I’m so proud of you! Love your vibe and energy! Your hair is really cute that length by the way
My gf is jealous of your hair (and she’s been on HRT for 3.5 years now!)!  You should check out the world of curly-girl hair.  I would recommend googling curly hair types, figuring out your hair type with the help of YouTube, and then finding someone with similar hair to yours and trying their products as a good way to get into it! I would love to see how much bounce you can get out of that hair!
Good luck!!
Your so cute! Love the outfit
Good luck darling
That's amazing good luck
That's amazing good luck
Cherish it.  I was giddy the first day i started.  I’m now 3 months in.  It’s a long process but it feels sooo good knowing you’re finally doing it.

You’ve got this girl!

Aaaah ! I have the exact same type of hair ! It's such a pain to work with, right ? I could never get it to look like I wanted without something to freeze the curls, so I started to straighten it.

There's lots to say about the best way to navigate your first doctor-patient interaction asking for HRT but the biggest things I would recommend are to know the existing standards of care (link below) so that you are aware of when your doctor is deviating from them. Also be aware that there are two main roadblocks in those standards which may disqualify you if you are not careful. 


The first is if the doctor believes that it would not be safe for you to begin HRT e.g. they may ask about your support group, if the people in your life would react violently to your being on HRT, etc. Note that things like substance abuse, mental health conditions, etc generally should not be considered as legitimate reasons to withhold HRT as dysphoria is often the underlying cause and beginning treatment often alleviates these issues (the only exception to this is physiological health conditions that directly increase the risk of taking certain medications, high risk of blood clots for example may disqualify someone from certain estrogen formulations). 


And the second common roadblock is that some providers want to see a stable long-term desire for transition. Often just your word for it is enough but if eg you tell them you realized you want HRT a couple weeks ago they may ask you to wait to be sure (it's gross I know but frustratingly common). Other times they will want to see proof from like a registered therapist that this is something you have wanted for a long time. This is also often required down the line for other types of transition related care like surgery so I do recommend getting a therapist who specializes in trans issues in case it ever comes up as a requirement. 


If you are denied for any reason, don't panic! Be aware there are very good online clinics that operate on ""informed consent"" which means they will explain the risks and effects to expect and if you still want to move forward they will provide you medication. 


A couple resources you may find helpful (the first two are US only):


If you end up going the route of the online clinics, I have used Folx for this and they are amazing, same day virtual appointments where they will give you a script on the spot and can rush delivery meds to you door.


For a therapist I have used Headway in the past and they are also very good, you fill out some forms explaining what you are looking for and they will give you a list of matching therapists so it is very easy to set up an appointment and switch if you do not feel it is a good match. 


Here are the WPATH Standards of Care I mentioned earlier: https://www.wpath.org/publications/soc


And finally here is a good overview of the medical specifics of feminizing HRT so you are aware of the generally accepted first line medications, starting doses, and effects to expect: https://transcare.ucsf.edu/guidelines/feminizing-hormone-therapy
This may be dependent on the doctor and where you live, but knowing as much info as possible helped fast track me for hormones. Like understanding most of the effects, and being confident this is what I want/need.
Good luck also I am doing my physical so I am going to ask about it
So do I, I’m so nervous!
Thanks

Stunning work. Exceptional artwork and very cute.

Thank you so much! And maybe with a little practice, you can :D 
I started drawing seriously for around 6 years. I still have a lot to learn, but I've improved a lot since I first started :) 
Drawing is a bit tough when you're newer, but you'll slowly improve and get more confident over time
Yay! Thank you so much! :D

I lowkey kind of want to, but I don't feel like dealing with angry transphobes lol.
At least I can draw and make 'shit art' instead of spending my day being a dick to other people for no reason. :)   
If you don't wish to say anything good, then don't even open your mouth in the first place. If you're trying to get a kick out of me or ruin my day, nice try pal, it ain't working.
Welcome
You welcome
I can do it. Though thatd be taking potential karma from you and if i crosspost it angry transphobes can still comment on this post

Hmmm I'd rather not. I know the mods will kick all the nasty transphobes out of the comments for this post, but I don't really want to invite them over here to wreck havoc. I don't really feel like dealing with nasty comments either way.

Thank you 😜
it is! owo
sorry, i just think of that meme ""look at this dude"" but i definitely meant it in an endearing way

i have no idea what the context of that meme is tho, so hopefully its as wholesome as i meant it to be lol
Hey friend, it’s easy to get down on ourselves when we see someone else farther along in their journey. I sometimes have the same reaction. I found that changing my thought process helped. “I look forward to announcing my 18 months someday.” It helps, but baby steps are so critical to changing our thoughts. I hope you see how wonderful you are and I hope you look forward to your journey too.
Thank you!

So I contacted Ikea Canada about their BEYOU/trans pride Blahaj and got a disappointing answer (Happy for all the folks that got one though 💖🏳️‍⚧️)		"Blahaj goes where they are most needed ❤️
Tbh I think its nice that they didnt profit off of it. Feels like more genuine support
It took me so long to understand what BEYOU meant I honestly thought they just misspelled bayou or something
I swear I would sell my soul for a trans Blahaj
I think it would've been kinda cool if they sold a limited amount of them and donated the proceeds to trans charities.

Still, cool that they did it at all. I just really want one haha.
We were this close to greatness! This close!
Watch people start to sell them on eBay for 300 dollars
Perhaps i shall dismember a blåhaj and then trace the pattern and make my own trans blåhaj market /hj
Maybe if enough of us contact Ikea they'll make it an official skew
this is adorable! sucks a lot of people can't get it, but that means those who need it the most will have a comforting shark boy. ♡♡♡
What is Beyou Blahaj?
NOOOOO I CAN'T GET A TRANS BLAHAJ I'M CRYING
They had trans blahaj???!?!?!? 😩😩😩😩
IIRC They were donated to clinics that do GRS to bring comfort to their patients as they are recovering from their surgery
What in God's green earth is beyon blahaj
Here’s a decal you can get: https://www.etsy.com/ca/listing/1382576156/ikea-shark-blahaj-trans-rights-35-in

Also, you could dress up as one? https://www.etsy.com/ca/listing/1294134443/shark-hoodie-unisex-super-funny-fashion ;)

There are also patterns on Etsy so you can make your own in the colours of Canadian Blahaj! :)
It's time for a few trans pepole to get filthy rich from reselling those
This is extremely transphobic
Pinkwashing. Id rather have them pay their taxes. Fuck corporates
Damn 😔
i really wish i could have gotten one
Couldn't you dye a blahaj with fabric dye maybe?

Saw people painting their couch, maybe you can do that with a stuffy too.
aw damn, didn’t think it was limited
You can get them from eBay , it’s where I got mine
Hm. Must be popular.
Maybe if we ask enough, they'll do a limited run
it seems harsh, but i'm seriously considering dissassembling my blahaj so i can make a pattern from it.  overstuffed custom-colored blahaj with weighted beans for the win!!
You can buy both pink and blue shark plushies on aliexpress… a half skilled sewer could remove the stuffing and cut both (making sure to leave a seam allowance) and sew the parts together & restuff to make their own for much less than they are going for on ebay. Just a thought….
Godspeed Blahaj
Yeah, I'm glad pride Blahaj is out there making people happy ❤
Yeah I agree, it's disappointing that many are gonna miss out, but it's an act that feels genuine rather than just for clout and profit. I honestly wouldn't mind seeing them sell them and donate part of the profits to trans charities
Agreed
I'm learning Swedish atm and was like ""This doesn't sound like Swedish. I wonder what it means?""
oh. yeah that makes a lot more sense than it being a misspelling of the first half of beautiful

^(i may be stupid <3)
Lol literally just got it while reading this thread

Also thought it was pronounced ""bayou"" 😂
Does it mean Be You? (Asking for a shark friend)
whats blahaj
But what about your soul?
I would pay much more than that
I will buy one if I must.
BAD IDEA DO NOT BOMBARD IKEA 

Better idea make a silly little petition to politely show demand for the trans shark 👍
Btw, (and this is *suuuuper* pedantic) but it’s actually “SKU” which is an acronym for “stock keeping unit”
Ikea made a Blahaj in the colors of the trans flag and gave them to gender clinics. It is a Be You Blahaj. :)
Right!? Why am I always missing out on stuff like this?
Blahaj with trans pride colors. They were only limited time and given away through DMs and possibly to other places (The Halifax Sexual Health Center got donated one)
???
Tbf, I really don't think it's pinkwashing here. Ikea actually did  something with thought behind it, and rather than just donating x amount to y charity, actually designed and created something with at least some thought and care put into it, I'm not pro corporation myself by any means but it does for all intents and purposes seem like a nice gesture, not to mention Ikea as a company has outlined itself as  being pretty progressive for quite some time iirc. 

Also, if they were really pinkwashing, I'm sure they'd actually sell it right off the bat rather than just donating it. However many Blahaj' they send out they're not pricey enough that they're gonna make a dent in a tax filing, you're talking a really miniscule amount of tax being cut overall from this.
Donating plushies with preferred names embroidered to trans folks who dm them, as well as donating said plushies to sexual health/gender affirming health care centers, without charging a cent to anybody, hardly seems like pinkwashing, especially cause it's not like Ikea has any controversy they need distracting from
Selling them for charity would be a good idea too
In Louisiana we pronounce it bye-you
I believe so, lol
Shut up
i could get so many normal blähaj for that much money.
That is a better idea <3
I found it. I had no idea what a blahaj was until now.

https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blåhaj
Oh it's a Ikea plush toy shark I see, I had to google it 😂
Extremely transphobic that I cannot have one I mean
Their tax avoidance (in EU, im not 100% sure how its handled in the US) is not even about the blahajs tho. Name of the Scheme is Flat Pack. I just have a hard time giving them props for one good deed when they  dismiss their social responsibility of paying taxes
Theyre dismissing their social responsibility of paying taxes in the EU(nit sure about the US). Its a shame that it isnt a controversy. I cant praise them for one good deed.
Sell them, but don’t donate to charity. Put that money towards creating the infrastructure to create even more at a lower price. Then sell them at double the *lower* price, and make it a buy one, donate one type deal.

Of course that’s way over the top, but it’s fun to dream
Ah yes, Louisiana. I fucking hate it here :)
Or you could sell a kidney and get both
Ah! I'm sorry that I didn't explain that Blahaj is a stuffed toy shark from Ikea. I focused too much on the type of Blahaj as the source of confusion, and forgot that someone may not know what a Blahaj is. My apologies, and I'm glad to know you found the info you needed. :)
Haha you got downvoted for not knowing Blahaj
Ok good for a second I thought you were one of those 'Being Bisexual is Transphobic' Types
I think it would help if you elaborated on your frustrations and Ikea's wrongdoing in your initial comment, a simple ""they should be paying their taxes instead"", probably comes off as a little vague to a lot of people, especially as Ikea's tax avoidance is a hardly touched upon subject that a majority of people have no idea about
Yeah...I moved for work...to fucking Oklahoma 😢

I hate it here too
or i just work at ikea and slowly syphon the supply of Blähaj from out the back so i get them free.
I turn 40 next month. You’ll have to forgive us “older folk”.
Blahaj is all powerfull ig 😂
I guess thats fair. Im sorry for letting my frustration through like that. I shouldve known better
*OUCH.* Right now I’m split 50/50 between Shreveport and Alabama where I go to school. Neither are good options lol. I’m hoping I can move to Colorado with my aerospace engineering degree.
UGH. I was born and raised here, and it sucks. We have the worst governor right now.
The underground trans blähaj heist
Indeed, indeed
It's understandable, I think your frustration is valid, it is just difficult for others to understand said frustration when they are uninformed
I went to Louisiana Tech in Ruston for my schooling. I did electrical engineering. Personally, I liked Tech overall even if Ruston is a bit on the smaller side. I just went to Shreveport or Monroe whenever I wanted to do something that wasn't available in Ruston. For example, I went to watch Rent live in Monroe, got my wife's tattoo done in Monroe, and took her pet snake to the vet in Monroe. Loved going to Shreveport for Second and Charles.
Agreed. I've been here for a few years now and our politicians suck floppy donkey dick.
*Insert Payday 2 Planning theme here.*
Oh cool! Lots of my friends went to Tech. My (transmasc) brother’s partner is heavily involved in the Trans Advocacy Group there.
now how will we do the heist split like how everyone argues on gta about how they didn't get 85% of  the pay for 3% of the work 😂
I didn't know there was one there. Would have been nice to know, though, lol. I didn't understand I was trans until about 3 years after college, though, so idk if it would've helped me anyone. I'm happy for them, though, and that there is a group 🥰
Yeah, they’ve been asking me a bunch of questions for TAG about the name change I’m currently going through. Honestly it feels good to be able to help other trans people through my own experience. 

When my egg finally cracked, I had just finished my undergrad program, so I had not been involved with my university’s LGBTQ organization at all. But at least my partner has always been super supportive! (and non-binary and pan lol)"	10foekk	trans	1390	1.0	2023-01-19 01:16:40

Happy Pride Month to me lol :') my dad had a Facebook meltdown about me being trans, TW for his transphobia and a TON of misgendering/deadnaming. It's time to block		"**Context:**

I'm 25 and I moved to a new state last year to start HRT and also just cause I wanted to. My two older siblings stopped talking to my dad like 1-2 years ago. I still was mostly because I was living under his roof at the time. I am not any longer. Ive posted about my dad a couple times here. This will hopefully be the last time.

I shared one of those posts about men at pride who give dad hugs and how sad it is to be able to sob in the arms of a stranger bc your dad won't accept you. My dad texted me saying he assumed that was about him and that it was ridiculous. I should go see him asap. I was at work when he texted me this

Not 10 mins later he commented on a photo I was TAGGED in. So as I'm sure many of you know, the person who posted that photo also got notified of this whole thing, and I feel really bad for her. The pic was me at age 6 on Halloween. My mom commented about how cute it was 8wks ago when it was posted. My dad commented all the stuff in the screenshots lol I guess because he needed to publicly be an ass? He sure loves to air out personal shit too in front of an audience 🙄 he is definitely a narcissist. 

And he's over half a year late to this reaction. He pretended to support me for quite a while. Now he's showing his true colors. I suspected this from the very beginning. Hopefully no one will, but on the off chance someone questions me, yes I have shown him plenty of grace and sent him countless resources and been nothing but kind and patient with him. but he was a shitty father to my not (out) queer siblings and they hate him too so 🤷🏼‍♂️

He also recently commented on a selfie of me looking buff being like ""oh you're just like these buff WOMEN!!"" like seriously fuck him fr it's just so shitty and disrespectful

And lastly: GOD BLESS MY SISTER!!!! 😭😭😭😭🙏🙏🙏🙏 I'm so thankful to have her back me up like that 😭❤️ I was a little worried how she would handle me being trans for a while so it's nice to see her defend me this way ❤️


**In case anyone gets confused:**
Red = my dad

Blue = my sister

White = a former classmate from our school whose like 5 yr older than me. They don't know me well but defended me nonetheless

Green = my other sibling

Purple = my deadname. My real name is Bucky. I blocked out my last name in one of the comments w purple. 

Maya is a family dog who sadly passed away at an old age in a shelter because my sister was unable to support her for extremely valid reasons. It was not a kill shelter, she just died naturally. My sister thought she was going to live longer than she did.

**EDIT: Hi friends I just logged on and had 55 notifs from this post! I'm at work but I'm going to read and reply to all of them eventually. I skimmed a bunch and I feel a lot of love** ❤️

**I wanted to let you all know I blocked my dad on Facebook and I blocked his phone number. I don't think he knows how to find me elsewhere, but I locked my twitter account for the time being just for peace of mind. My sister said this morning that HE blocked HER before she was able to again (Facebook makes you wait 48 hrs to reblock) so idk if that means he noticed me blocking him or what. The only way he'd be able to contact me now is by mailing a letter. On the off chance that he does, he'll likely write my deadname. In which case I can return it to the sender for ""no such name"" at my address :-)**
Sister is an absolute Champion, the dad sucks. Got myself a similar thing in that level!
It's kinda like his answer is in his own transphobia... perhaps trans people are at a higher risk of attempting and/or committing suicide because their own parents don't love them as they are and/or identify but instead berate them with how ""wrong"" their life is, hmmm?!?!
When will people learn.  That 41% statistic was 1. Attempts, not successful suicides, and 2. was whether the person was out or not.  We get suicidal because of a bigoted society, not because we transitioned.  I am part of that statistic.  That's why I came out.  Transition saved my life.
Gotta love it when people think they can speak for you. ""[Deadname] never wanted to be a boy"" like okay buddy

Sorry to hear your dad is a bigoted POS :( it's great that you have your sister at your side though. Stay strong Bucky 🙏
the suicide rate is so high because of transphobia tell me what that mf is on cause i fucking want some

edit: i just got to the second page so i didn’t see that the point was brought up during the conversation
I’m truly sorry your dad is like this Bucky, it’s disgusting how parents can be like this. I’ve had similar experiences with family but I can’t say I understand how you feel, all I can honestly say is that I sympathize with you and if you ever need someone to talk to I’ll do everything I can to respond as frequently as possible. My inbox is always open, especially to a brother like you. I hope your dad will eventually learn so you can see eye to eye before he’s gone and I hope you have a good day.
~~hey man...uh...u left ur deadname in that last pic i think. idk if it bothers u or not but thought id memtion it~~

nvm read ur other comment lol, maya is a cute name for a dog
lol what a loser. sounds like you guys should block him and deny him the satisfaction. it's amazing how these people think they know who we are more than we do even when we never fucking talk to them. I had a grandpa like this guy and believe me I fucking WISH my mother had not let him see me. that man fucked up so much of my life. your sister is doing the right thing keeping their kid from him.
Yeah I'm absolutely never telling my family I'm trans
I'm so glad you've got someone in your life who is unconditionally supportive of you. 

That looks like it hurt a lot, and I'm pretty sure that you know that you're not responsible for making him see the light, but I'm saying it just the same because sometimes you just need to see it. Sometimes parents cannot sacrifice their own comfort- emotional, psychological, whatever- for their kids, at the end of the day. It's not your fault, this isn't your damage that is causing him to act like this. Your dad is exhibiting a lot of anxiety controlling behaviors- he needs help but not from you. I hope he gets it and gets some healing and can come back to you in a respectful and supportive way.
Your sister rocks. I'm so sorry that your dad is giving you such a hard time.
[removed]
... okay, I actually have nothing nice to say about your dad so I'll just say... god, I am so sorry you had to deal with this. What a horrible way for him to talk about his son... I hope you can heal from this soon, I'm very glad you have a truly loving sister, and I wish you a fulfilling life with people who love and see you for who you are.
Your dad doesn’t seem to realize that the suicide rate is only higher for those who are NOT accepted by family. Like Jfc
No offense but your dad kinda sucks
What he neglects to realize is that the reason for a high suicide rate, is due to people like him. And that behavior and mentality such as his, is harmful. Especially from a parent towards their trans child. But, there's plenty of people who love, support, and are very proud of you; like your sister.
This is so painful to read. Parents should love their kids and want them to be happy. I understand this too. My Dad has not been very accepting. He said some hurtful stuff like he is praying for God to ""fix"" me and many other things. I hope my Dad comes around and I hope yours does too.
Bruuuuh, he told your sister “you dont even have the balls-“ 💀💀💀 The cognitive dissonance is strong in him… sorry you’ve had to deal with that kind of disappointment. Definitely the right move to throw the block and start and new chapter without him.
And why does he think the suicide rate is so high? Unaccepting, bigoted family members contribute to that 🙄
Da hecc? He's so rude-   


I'm glad you're following your heart. Congrats on getting away from him lmao
That's something else. Your dad's bigoty has alienated him from all 3 of his children? I mean, I'm shaking my head at this for the dumbassery of it all, but I kind of feel sorry for him when he's older, lonely AF, and realizes that this attitude quite literally cost him his whole family. I hope he figures his shit out before it's too late, if it isn't already.
Situations like this, knowing that suicide rates are high due to bigotry, and what your dad is doing (he needs true hell for what he's doing, I'm glad you are blocking him), make me feel like a traitor to the community because due to being a pansexual enby who has supportive queer parents, I cannot relate well.

Bucky, I would like to award your sister for her vigilance in supporting you against this awful dad of yours. I like that my trans female friend is herself, and I like that you are you, just as I like that Ralsei of Deltarune is Ralsei!
I'm sorry you had to experience this but on the bright side you have lots of people who support you it seems
So sorry this happened to you. I can relate except my situation is the opposite— my sister is the righteous one that has been victimized by my transness and my parents are enjoying getting to know me as their youngest daughter. It’s hard because I basically learned everything about being a girl from quietly observing my sister for 18 years. 

Here’s a warm hug for you….*hug*
Transphobes always leave out the part in that suicide stat that it's for UNSUPPORTED trans people
He's creating the environment that causes us to kill ourselves and then saying I told you so when it happens
My god he’s such a hypocrite. Fuck him. Good luck to you dude! He doesn’t deserve to be in your life.
I’m glad you at least have your siblings that support you, my two younger sisters treat me like a freak.
Ah yes, voicing concern about suicidal people while saying \*exactly\* the sort of shit that exacerbates trans people's suicidal ideation.

How ""lovely"".  


I'm sorry you have to read things like this, especially from a family member. Stay strong.
Yea.. that will fix it
This is the type of person whom I'd like to nominate for a line of mugs and other chachkas with the phrases ""No 1 deadbeat dad!""

And ""ohhkay Boomer""
I humbly agree, having someone like him in your life can be very... bad. And what your father said is honestly awful, hopefully he turns around to reflect but he is in way to deep to where he doesnt understand that trans suicide rates are due to unsupportive people like him. Stay strong and be comfortable with yourself man. Its good that your siblings are there for you, they seem like great people.

And Honestly I feel this on a personal level, ive told a few family members that im cutting off everyone in the family when I leave(Family talks about shooting any lgbt+ people on sight so coming out or staying around them is... like feeling like a sheep in wolves clothing, in a wolves den).

Anyway, stay safe, stay hydrated, stay prideful.
People like you are the reason its so high 💀
“They protect their children from harm”, proceeds to cause immense harm.
r/confidentlyincorrect

Yikes. He’s got a case of conditional love. You deserve so much better OP.
it baffles me how people can be so dumb
Nice to meet you Bucky, glad to see you're living your true self. Hopefully he will leave you alone at the very least and quit trying to make it seem like you're dead. He's a disgusting man, and that is coming from a registered republican who used to think along similar roads as him. It took me a bit to realize at the end of the day that I was the problem even if I wasn't vocal about my disliking and just did it silently, love you for you. Don't let anyone try and make you feel bad about it
-sigh- a true parent should love their children unconditionally and ur so called dad has failed to do so and even tho that parents should protect their children from getting hurt but it is also true that they have no right to tell who u r only u decide that and 4 what it is all worth u r a very handsome man
On the first picture I was going to say that even if your father is a biggot you should still aim to mend your relationship with him. a lot of our folks from the previous generation came from a different, less open and less tolerate world and really do want the best for us. As misguided as they may be - but - upon reading further, I see you have a sibling which also cut contact with him and your father really is persistent in his ignorance so I’m not sure anymore. Do what makes you happy and live your life but please don’t view your father as a villain.. just a fool maybe. Hope he changes his mind and ways as the time goes. For the time being focus on yourself and enjoy your new freedom
[removed]
Your dad sounds eerily like my mom… 

funny because even though she tries to argue that I killed her daughter, she never lost anything, she just gained a son. I’m a man and a woman lmao
Hey OP: Your dad sucks
Lol i hate my parents
Ew.
Glad your siblings are looking after each other. Absolutely incredible how people who claim to preach love are so filled with hate and ignorance. Not shocking, just impressive and kind of sad.
“Actions that have more than a 50% suicide rate.”

I fucking wonder why
OP, I'm incredibly sorry, but also, incredibly happy for you living your life as your true self I'm still working on figuring out who I am, and...it's hard. Feel like there's no one I can talk to sometimes. I'm glad your support system is as strong as it is.

Also...have to say, the donor for half of your genes (Mot calling that man a father. None of what we're seeing here is fatherly behavior.) has to be the poster child for contradicting himself multiple times within his own comment. Yikes.
I can't fathom ever treating your child or family like that. So fucked up :(
Gosh, I would want to send the last reply to that transphobe so much!
Lmao, as if that guys grandchild will miss not being able to see a fuckhead like him.

Also, hilarious to see him sign off with “you don’t know me >>>:( !!!” after just claiming to know everything about someone.
This breaks my heart. Bucky, your dad wishes he could be even half the man you are. We love you brother
I feel like if it’s FTM dad is sad, if MTF dad is angry
SO tired of shitty fucking unsupportive parents. I’m so sorry. Thank god you have a wonderful sister!
Bucky, I'm so happy you got your sister and people around you who supports you! I hope where you're living now is much better and allowing you to be your true self 💜

I'm sorry about your dad tho, he definitely sounds like....a mouthful. And reading the part ""parents don't tell you everything"" is just so stupid like?? Sure but kids don't tell their parents everything either. And for valid reasons that he clearly don't understand.
You are a KING, Bucky. Don’t you EVER forget that!
Drop him like a hot potato. Congrats on being you ❤️
Big thumbs up for your sis. 👍🏽👍🏽
Aren't those rates hes on about more a problem for people who are forced to not come out and he them selves?
Your dad seems like he's deep in denial and refuses to accept yourself being happier than you used to be in the past. You have no obligation to fulfill what he wants because he just thinks about himself, and doing so would make you unhappy. He's egoistic and manipulative, and him being left by his family members was self-inflicted, but he doesn't want to admit that, as it's easier to shift blame on someone else.

His mention of suicide rates is completely off, and it's related to the opposite thing - because of people refusing to accept trans folks, or worse, disowning them.

Also good job to your sister for calling his bullshit out, glad to have parts of the family that are supportive. At this point cutting him off from everything is the best you can do, you don't owe him anything and it's his fault that he's ended like that.
Are you ok?
But... It doesn't havea suicide rate that high? That dude is a fucking idiot.
Ah yes I remember when I realized I was trans and instantly became 50% suicidal because that's obviously how that works lol
Your father want you to commit suicide like many of us.

Ps: It's 40% of trans people have suicidal ideas in their lifetime, his stat are from right wing websites.
This makes me so fucking angry. His only argument is the 50% suicide rate. If he‘d only realize that he’s the reason for it being so high.
""50% suicide rate"" yeah well mabye if you and alot of other shit heads supported your child then those numbers would drop?, It just boils my blood when people use that as an excuse
Your sister and her classmate are awesome people, sorry about your dad
""part of a movement with a 50% suicide chance""
First: As if it was your choice to be trans
Second: He's one of the reasons why people kill themselves. Parents have so much influence on their kids and when they try to force their son to live as a girl, they don't even realize how much they harm their child.
The cognitive dissonance is astronomically strong in this one. Like bro, you're the cause of the 41% suicide rate. The words you are speaking, are literally the cause.
Proud of you bro
Old people really can't handle their social media. Sorry.
this happens to me too :(
“3 of my kids/ all of my kids aren’t speaking to me anymore I have done nothing to cause this”

I’m glad your other family members support you! Best of luck on your journey !
Do... Do we have the same dad? 

But, seriously, I feel ya.
r/insaneparents
I'm so sorry.

I'm so glad your sister and the friend stuck up for you.

I am a great proponent for burning bridges with family that let you down, but I'm sad for you that it's necessary.

This mum of a trans girl is sending you love and hugs 💖
Yikes, I'm sorry your dad was such a cunt. But you don't need people like that in your life and you will find plenty of respect and love from other people as long as you love yourself. Take care comrade
Hey Bucky,

That hurt ME to read and it’s about you. I’m so sorry that he is that way. How ignorant of him. He’s using twisted facts (like the suicide rate ) and right wing extremist and TERF talking points so jumbled, it’s obvious he doesn’t even understand them. 

I think you’re better off without him in your life. I know some parents need some time to mourn our other selves, but it’s all in the intent. And this clearly isn’t a case of misgendering you by habit or accident. He’s trying to play a victim role to get sympathy and support. 

The bright spot in all this is the defense of you by your sister. I was so happy to read the added post that you have supportive people in your life.  Keep the people who show you love. Life is too short for the other kind of person
I'm too chickenshit to actually read most of what your dad said, but your sister sounds like an awesome person 💜
Parents experiencing grief in the beginning is a common thing, especially when it's dads about their ""daughters"". But man, your dad's an ignorant asshole beyond repair. You're really better off blocking him. You have the greatest sister though, so I'm glad you still have family to rely on. Good luck, my man <3
slide 2 they really said “find god”😂😂
🤐
W sister
A parent doesn't fail when they have a trans kid. A parent fails when they don't SUPPORT a trans kid. Much love and support to you as you walk your authentic path, dude!!! 🥰
Sometimes the hardest thing is disassociating yourself with awful people you’ve known your whole life. Just remember, there are always people out there that love you for you.
I'm really glad you have a sister like that. Especially with a dad like that
i'm tired of people saying that there's a high suicide rate while they're actively telling you that you're horrible and you're not trans. like it's absolutely awful like seriously you're helping those rates go up by being such an awful person about it. 
sorry i ranted about that it just really reeeeaaaallllyyyyy makes me mad
Thats not a parent that's a bully
""You wouldn't encourage them into behaviour with over a 50% suicide rate""

Actually braindead words right there
thats my parents im 17
no offence, your dad's a piece of shit
Block him! He is toxic to you! I have had to remove people from my life because of crap like this including family and the longer you leave it the more toxic they get. The rest of your family are supportive and are in your corner and god bless them for that but it won’t stop him pushing his agenda but in the end he will not know the real you and will miss out on you and that is something he will never get back. ❤️ this is just my thoughts and off my experience. Much love to you ❤️
I don't get how people like them can't see that the reason the s-word rate is so high for trans people is because of people exactly like them not being accepting  of their own children, it takes a huge emotional toll and I wish they could see that
Holy shit. I'm sorry, Bucky. My mom is cut from this cloth and I don't wish it on anyone. I hope you're happy despite the harrasment. And yes, definitely time to block, I think.
The only reason we have a high suicide rate is cause if people like him that try to repress us
Honestly alot of your dad's comments echo the same toxic sentiments my family have been gas lighting me with since I came out in february.

You have absolutely wonderful siblings, and clearly they surround themselves with equally wonderful people. 

Def. Time to block. You got this bro- cut that negativity out of your life.
[removed]
I do agree 💯
I wonder why the suicide rates are high… 🙄
This is always the attitude of the people on the political right: “how this affects ME”. Zero consideration that this is a human being’s entire life being discussed, we don’t want to minorly inconvenience them worth our own personal fulfilling. Lol
I'm so sorry.
""Parents don't tell their children everything"" ""that's not my child you don't know [him] I know everything about [him]""

Bro seriously needs to read up on the word ""hypocrisy"" because damn.
OP, my sister in arms and/or knighthood, with all due respect, your dad seems like a tool.
w siblings L father
The way he used the suicide statistic to help him pisses me off so much
he's beyond horrible. i'm so sorry bucky.
Damn what a hissy fit from dad, I'm sorry you had to deal with him.
Glad you have people backing you up on this.
Also just want to say, love your name.
Good on you for sticking to your ground. I’m glad that at least someone is in your corner. ☺️
r/insaneparents
I have something verry similar with my family ""we like you"" ""we respect"" and ""we just think thoses things shouldn't exist"" yhea i see that they are REALLY loving when they say thoses thing, or my father saying to my face that i am an abomination and later saye that he likes me and ""what are you doing to us""
*puts hands together in prayer fashion, moved to lips. Inhales, then exhales before pointing hands to you while still together*

Please don't take offense to this, because it is completely out of love for you:

That person is not your father. I don't care if I'm a trans-woman, I will be your father now, and I couldn't be any prouder of you and your amazing sister. And if anyone gives you shit, point me in the right direction and I will still go ""papa bear"" on them, because you deserve love and support, even if I don't fit the mold to be a ""father figure"". 😊

Be true to you; I'm proud of you.
Listen to me, it looks very very bad now, terrible, and listen to me you still have worth man. You are a man just like everyone else. You’re perfect the way you are and it’s going to be hard for a little bit but he WILL possibly come around (mine did) but don’t sit and twiddle ur thumbs and try to convince him. If your sister is in your corner appreciate it but don’t use her to feel happy again, put your head down and put focus into becoming the best version of urself and chasing any goals and dreams you have. It’ll be okay
Wow, I’m so sorry OP. Fuck that man, he’s not your dad he’s a sperm donor and that’s all… I’m glad your siblings have your back
Wat a prick
Sorry your dads being a jerk. I’m glad to see some stand up for you though! Hope your day is good.
I about to have a very “civil” conversation with you dad (by civil I mean I’m gonna yell at him for a good 2 hours until he gets it into his head that he’s so fucking wrong)
I love the casual“you need Jesus”
You’re not under *any* obligation to put up with that sort of shit, you don’t owe him “grace”, nor do you owe him education. That’s shit he needs to work o it on his own.

You owe yourself protection for yourself.

I’m sorry - you deserve better.
I love you. I'm glad you're here. Happy pride month.
So sorry you have to go through this! Sounds like your dad just wants to stay ignorant to have something to be mad about, if he truly cared about you he'd educate himself on trans people as much as possible. It's really sad this is so common, the way he acts is literally why so many trans people can't ever be themselves.

As another trans guy (closeted to family because homophobia), absolute condolences to you my dude.
So true. I'm sorry you're going through something similar. On one hand, he makes it easy to justify cutting him out. On the other, it took me 3 days to gather the emotional strength to even read any of what he said, and it hurts 🤕
 I KNOW RIGHT. He brings it up like 2 or 3 times and someone even pointed this out to him and he still somehow doesn't get it lmfao it's so weird how people like him genuinely think being trans dooms you to suicide lmao 

I'm not even inclined to do that and have never given my parents a reason to think so. Back in highschool when I knew something was wrong mentally, I asked me parents to take me to the docs and therapy. So they know I advocate for my own mental health. Now the reason I want to go to therapy again is to specifically work on issues my dad has caused. Very ironic lol but he wouldn't understand since ofc he is so perfect and knows me so well
I have a very conservative neighbor. She asks me questions about my son a lot- it might seem weird to some but she's friendly and has never treated my son with anything but respect, she's just reallly conservative. I welcome her questions because I kind of feel like if I can help educate people that's the least I can do to help out. 

This topic came up and I told her to think that through- ostracizing trans kids just when they really need their parents might be a reason more than the decision to be who they are. I think I gave her something to think about.
Not just whether they're out or not, but whether or not they even *know* at the time. I didn't figure it out until the week before my 34th birthday, but if I had tried to take my life in the decades of dysphoria and depression before then I'd STILL be counted as part of that now.

I'm so sorry you had to go through that but I'm glad you made it out the other side
They think you just turn trans the moment you ""do the voluntary decision to switch your gender"" because of boredom, satanic advertising is something, because

mY cHiLd WaS nOt BoRn ThIs WaY, oh you mean these signs? Solved them with beatings
Also, I read from a study somewhere that using your child/ a trans person's pronouns and name (not deadname or old pronouns), DRASTICALLY decreases the rate of suicide. Hang on, I'll pull it [the link to the study] up if I can.
Exactly!! People would not feel so inclined if they lived in a society where they were loved, accepted, and respected. Would people still attempt and commit suicide? Of course, but it would definitely be far less, and it wouldn't be because they chose to transition. 

I'm happy you're still here and able to transition ❤️❤️ I hope things are better for you 🫂
That genuinely made me laugh. I never wanted to be a boy so bad I started T last year 😩🤣🤣 

Thank you 💕🫂🫂
Like, hell, I didn't want to be non-binary when I was younger cause of internalized enbyphobia. But here I am. Whether you WANTED to be who you are now when you were younger doesn't matter. I WANTED to be a dragon or named Rainbow. Now I want to be authentic and happy. Shit changes. And people need to get over this.
Haha no worries! He ignored it anyway 🤦🏼‍♂️ of course. Ignore all the valid points and just keep spewing crap. 

The scary part is my dad is vehemently against any drugs or alcohol. He is just sober all the time and thinks like this 😭😂😂😂😂
Ah thank you so much 🥺❤️ I really appreciate this 💕 I wish this wasn't a frequent experience for us 😔 I'll keep your offer in mind 💞
No worries!! I appreciate pointing it out just in case ❤️ she was a husky and the goodest dog 🥺
I totally agree. Her kid is only 3 years old so she will not be damaged by never knowing her maternal grandfather. My mom is with a really great guy now AND my niece has a great paternal grandfather so she will not miss out or resent my sister for anything. 

And seriously the way he kept insisting he ""knows"" me is so funny. He tried to say that on the phone before too, that he knows me better than anyone. It's laughably untrue. My dad has not had a single interest in my personal life, my thoughts or beliefs in..EVER. when I was a little kid I talked to my dad all the time but he would get annoyed and say I talk way too much. So I stopped 🤷🏼‍♂️ I became my own person without him and now he's mad he's been left out 🙄 mf did it to himself!!

My sister actually UNblocked my dad so she could defend me 😂 she had to wait 48 hrs but she is gonna block him again. I plan to as well

I'm sorry youve been hurt by a paternal figure as well 😔🫂
If nothing else, I'd definitely recommend moving far away from them if it's at all possible. I'm not sure how old you are. I have way more peace of mind knowing I'm a 5 hour drive away from my dad knowing he will never put that much effort into driving that far to Do Something
Thank you so much 🥺❤️❤️❤️ I actually have panic disorder that I inherited from my dad. He has been on the same meds for like decades and they probably aren't doing it for him. He has major mood swings and has always been an incredibly angry person that needs to be in constant control. I wish he would seek therapy, but he's nearing 60 and I just don't see him ever resigning to it :/ either way, I'm going to separate myself from him for the time being but this does hurt me a LOT more than I'd like it to. 

And even though I know it, thank you for saying it isn't my fault 😭 I didn't respond to any of these comments and yet I still feel I need to personally apologize to the op for his behavior even though I didn't say a single thing to him to inspire this.
She does! And thank u 🥺
So tru 💪😤
Thank u sm 🥺🥺🫂 dw a lot of my friends have been saying a lot of Not So Nice Things about my dad 😂 and they have been long before I came out as trans. He just really Sucks. I always knew this was going to end up as the breaking point for me. It felt different when he still didn't know who the real me was. Now I can see he is always to reject all of me, and that sucks.


That being said, I'm actually REALLY thankful I wasnt born cis. I can't imagine what type of person I would be if my dad raised me as a boy and his only son 😬
Idk if you read them but someone mentions it in the screenshots and he just flat out ignores it but then brings up the (not even accurate) statistic again 😑
He does and u can be offensive about it 😂
Yes you're very correct. I have a lot of wonderful and amazing friends as well. This does pain me, but in my case I don't feel driven to any type of self harm. I just like putting my dad on blast as a means to cope LMAO I have tried to explain the reasons for several trans statistics but they all just go in one ear and out the other 😑
I'm sorry to hear that 😔 I wish this wasn't a common experience for us 🫂
LMAO OMG YOURE RIGHT I didn't even think about that! 😂😂😂😂😂 

It will be such a huge relief tbh my dad has been a constant stressful looming presence I just can't have hanging over me anymore
Thanks!! When I initially came out he was like... Completely fine with it. And for a hot minute I DID think maybe I did overreact? Cause I spent YEARS mentally preparing for the inevitable fall out and even joked I wouldn't know what to do if he didn't disown me lol 

Now it almost feels like he did that JUST to gas light me long term. Cause my dad for most of my life has constantly berated me for being too sensitive, angry and constantly over reacting 🙄
It was all for uniquely different reasons too 😭 My dad is like conspiracy theorist Republican, like, I'm sure you know what I mean. 

My sister is very much a centrist, so I was actually a bit worried she might not fully accept me. I was really shocked and touched by what she said here. My sister doesn't really comment or get offended by my dad's views, she just hates him for being a shitty dad, which is valid. 

My oldest sibling, however, cut my dad off because he picked a fight (on Facebook lol) over politics during the George Floyd protests. 

For me this was all worthy of cutting him off but I'm kinda glad he gave me a good reason. I was too afraid to just randomly block him out of fear of what he'd say or do but he made it easy here. He is delusional but I have to think on some level he can't possibly think after saying all this that I would be like ""oh haha dear old dad! I'll come visit next week!""? Like ??? C'mon bro. 

Sorry if this is TMI or anything. I keep word vomiting in the comments. You can probably tell I'm just trying to justify myself 😅 this whole situation just really sucks.
Ah don't think yourself as a traitor! You just happen to be really lucky and that's a good thing I'm happy for 🙂 it's saddening to see how many people relate to this post so it's actually comforting to know there's someone who doesn't but cares nonetheless. We are all in this together no matter what ❤️ thank you for this comment 💞
MAN im sorry dear 🫂 in our case I'm glad we have at least SOME family on our side ❤️
The ""I told you so"" is more important to those people than the actual lives of their children because then they get to be right and get to be the victim.
LEGIT he's such a fucking weirdo honestly
Thank you ❤️❤️❤️❤️
I'm sorry to hear that:( many hugs 🫂
For real 🙄🙄 thank u 💖
Oh same to you 🥺💕 please stay safe 🫂 That sounds really scary 😔

I am very lucky for all the people and things I do have. This is a struggle but as far as being trans, I'm actually very happy and confident. I just have bad anxiety but I'll be getting help soon
IKR 😭 and the bit about ""protecting them from themselves"" I am 25 goddamn years old. I am a whole ass adult who is free to do whatever I please. It's not like I'm a 3 year old sticking my fingers in electrical sockets. He can't control my actions forever 🙄
Thank you 🤧💕
Thank you so much for saying this ❤️❤️ I really appreciate it 🥺 and it's lovely to meet you too 💞
Thank you 🥺 ur absolutely right. Protecting me doesn't mean denying my own identity 😑
Uhm absolutely the fuck not. They didn’t just disappear when the world progressed they actively made the choice to continue to be horrible “people”. Seriously where the fuck did you get the audacity to say shit like this.

His father is a bad person, and that’s a fact.
Yes, both my older siblings have severed contact with my dad and neither of them are LGBT like me. My sister who commented is married to a man with her own kid and lives a very traditional life and even shares some of my dad's political views. He is just simply a bad father whose always emotionally berated us and our mom. He wasnt physically abusive...much. he always blamed it on his own bad upbringing and insisted allowing us to live in his home and eat his food meant he was a good dad. But there is so much more to being a good parent than being a provider. We needed a father who loved us unconditionally, taught us things, and supported us. He just didn't do that. 

It just happens for me that this is my final straw, but I'm not severing contact purely because he doesn't accept me being trans. However I still think that's a valid reason anyway because I do not want to spend the rest of my life constantly justifying my own existence to my parent
There is no old me I'm still the same. I just go by a different name and pronouns. My personality is still the same, which is what my dad should love me for
I agree. And I'm glad my siblings and I have stuck together against our dad instead of letting him turn us against each other. It makes cutting him off easier knowing I'm not the only one
IKR I don't think he rereads any comment or text he's ever sent, or thought it through 😭

I'm happy your exploring yourself but I'm sorry it doesn't feel like you can talk to anyone. I know it may seem hard but there are some wonderful people online who can really help give support 💗 my online spaces contributed a LOT to me realizing I'm trans and wanted to start HRT. Stay strong ❤️🫂🫂🫂
I can't understand it either 😔 this isn't the first time Ive been genuinely at a loss bc of something horrible my dad said or did to me. But hopefully this will be the very last time
You mean my sister's? It was a really good reply haha
Ajsjhwb ethank you sm 🥺🥺😭💓💕💞💗💖🫂
Same here dude. I'm very thankful for my sister too 💕
I KNOW RIGHT I honestly don't know what point he was trying to make there?? 😂😂 It sounded like he was saying he purposely withholds info and makes stuff up but it's only right when HE does it. Idfk tho lmao 

And ty, I'm living in a very progressive state/area now and am called Bucky and he/him at work by everyone :) I actually think there is a trans femme person at my new job bc she told me her pronouns were she/they and asked mine too. It's so awesome to have this be a new normal for me ❤️
HELL YEAH 💪🤴🏼 ty 💞
Thank you for saying this ❤️❤️ at times like these its genuinely helpful to have so many people validate my feelings and help free me from the guilt I feel for blocking him. Next step is therapy lmfao 😂💕
Im doing better now with all this mind blowing support ❤️ ty for asking
LMAO YEAH I love how he chose a higher scarier sounding number lol what if im the 50% who ISNT suicidal? 🤨 What then ?? 🧐
I have SO MANY icky memories from childhood about my parents saying and doing things that made me extremely uncomfortable but felt like I couldn't say anything. Im realizing now many of my sorta ""core"" memories were moments were I felt dysphoric. In my dad's mind, because I never told them about all these feelings that meant I just never had them

I will genuinely never understand how you can have such little interest in a person and then suddenly claim to know all their thoughts and feelings and going as far as calling them a liar when those feelings are voiced 🙄
My favorite part was when he said me moving away for my SAFETY was actually me knowing what I'm doing is wrong and that I'm embarrassed 🙃 like yeah ur right I'm embarrassed to be related to such a bigot 😂
🥺🤧💓💖💕💞
It's crazy how they aren't embarrassed to say stuff like this in front of everyone they know lmao
I'm so sorry :( much love and hugs 🫂🫂
He's so dumb fr 😂😂 thank you!! 💕
Oof big hugs cause it's ROUGH:( 🫂🫂🫂
Thank you sm mum 🥺🫂💖💖
Thank you for this comment 💖💖

I can confidently say that he has been recently getting deep into the Republican narrative against trans people with a touch of TERF. He suddenly started using their very specific language, such as texting one of my friends that I was ""mutilating"" myself. He definitely wouldn't have said that if he didn't read it somewhere. 

And yes, this isn't a case of me being annoyed by small things. I have answer every question he's had and assured him to HIS satisfaction that I thought this through and nothing huge was permanent with HRT that I didn't absolutely want. I haven't even CONSULTED about ANY surgery so it's not even like I just got top surgery and he's sad cause my tits are gone lol 

I've also sent him a TON of resources and gave him the benefit of the doubt by saying myself he was just having a hard time. But then of course this confirmed he is a victim so I kinda regret but also I don't because I can block him knowing EYE did everything the way Republicans and TERFs say I should, by being nothing but kind. I didn't want there to be a chance of a legitimate claim that I was being that angry trans person who cuts off the head of anyone that misgenders him haha

This is not to say that people are wrong for their feelings, I'm just a people pleaser and I just try to be nice. I'm not always nice tho haha anyways this is a long comment AJAJSJS I have a hard time staying concise on reddit because I'm always compensating for the fact that no one will know or remember me between posts 😂😂 I'm so not used to this haha
That's totally fair please take care of yourself ❤️❤️ I myself didn't read all his comments for a few days. The only reason I did was keep my resolve about blocking him tbh. But I was very happy to read what my sister said 🥺
LMAO YEAH!! also how convenient for my dad to say he has Jesus and Jesus agrees with him LMFAO funny because my mom was the religious one who always took us to church. My dad ain't never went!! Mf is the one going to hell here 🤣
EXACTLY! Thank you so much you're a sweetheart 🌸❤️
Me too 💗
It's ok!! You are very justified in feeling that way! It's a super annoying talking point they ALWAYS default to. I wonder what statistics I could pull up for lonely old angry white men dying young and alone 🤔😂😂  seriously though. You can make anything sound bad with statistics, especially if you never bother to think of their implications. It's a weakass argument but people are still falling for it. It's VERY frustrating
RIGHT 😭 like any trans person has ever gotten on hrt and surrounded themselves with love and support and went ""this is the very thing that makes me want to die"" lmfao my dad has -10 braincells
I'm sorry to hear that:( I hope you are able to find a safe space when you are a bit older ❤️❤️🫂🫂
Thank you sm!! ❤️ I actually did block him on FB and his phone number as well 👍 he doesn't really have any other way to contact me but I suspect I will be hearing about things via family members. We'll see how that goes. Bless u and much love to you as well 🫂
Same. It kinda sucks he ignored the person who pointed this out to him in the screenshots 😔 but he has always flat out ignores valid arguments
MAN sorry your mom sucks too 😭 this is tough but I did block and I'm still very happy with the person I've become :-) big hugs from me to u 🫂
I did it!! I blocked FB and phone number last night. Thank you for offering me strength 💪 I'm sorry this is happening to you. I hope things get better for you and you find peace 🫂
Nah my dad ain't respecting me so I'm not gonna respect him 🤷🏼‍♂️
LMAO IKR they are always so selfish ""but what about ME 🥺"" it's especially ridiculous considering my father put in 0 effort to be an active presence in my life. It's not as if we had a super loving and close relationship before this
IKR he doesn't make any sense 😂 honestly a lot of his comment I was just going 🤨 HUH??
He definitely is
Same 🙄 I hate knowing me coming out as trans just says ""I'm suicidal"" to some people because I am not!
Aw thank you!! 🥺❤️ I love my name too and it's really cool to have a bunch of people commenting with it 💕💕
Me too 🥺
Ajsjdjeje this is very cute and precious and made me smile a lot 🥺🥰🥰🥰🥰 thank you so much for saying this for real :') ❤️🧡💛💚💙💜
Thank you!! 🥺❤️
> nor do you owe him education.

I'd say if a friend or family member genuinely cares about you and is just grossly misinformed but trying to learn in good faith, by all means help them learn before they end up ""learning"" from dubious sources. But if someone goes off the rails on a transphobic tirade, fuck them.
You are right and I appreciate it ❤️ I have a tendency to show way too much patience and care for people who dont deserve it haha and a lot of that is because of the way I had to act to keep my dad from getting angry at me. So I have a hard time not translating that online *especially* reddit I feel like I really have to over explain myself so people are mean to me or something lmao ik it's dumb/pointless cause they will be mean anyway
I love u too 🥺🥺❤️🧡💛💚💙💜🤎🤍
Much love to you 🫂

I've sent him Sooo many resources including links, YouTube videos and mercury stardust's tiktoks (I love her 💖) And Im pretty sure he didn't read or watch any of them:/ or if he did, he consumed it in bad faith. 

I was closeted for a very long time before it was safe for me. My dad doing this confirmed I was right to follow my gut and wait until it was safe. I hope you also come to that point soon 💞
I been seeing my folks less and less intentionally. Hearing them is exhausting. It's a mood.
>mY cHiLd WaS nOt BoRn ThIs WaY, oh you mean these signs? Solved them with beatings

Seems familiar 🤔
https://news.utexas.edu/2018/03/30/name-use-matters-for-transgender-youths-mental-health/ (study link)

""Researchers[Study](https://news.utexas.edu/2018/03/30/name-use-matters-for-transgender-youths-mental-health/) interviewed transgender youths ages 15 to 21 and asked whether young people could use their chosen name at school, home, work and with friends. Compared with peers who could not use their chosen name in any context, young people who could use their name in all four areas experienced 71 percent fewer symptoms of severe depression, a 34 percent decrease in reported thoughts of suicide and a 65 percent decrease in suicidal attempts.""

""[Earlier research](https://cns.utexas.edu/news/victimization-of-transgender-youths-linked-to-suicidal-thoughts-substance-abuse) by Russell found that transgender youths report having suicidal thoughts at nearly twice the rate of their peers, with about 1 out of 3 transgender youths reporting considering suicide. In the new study, having even one context in which a chosen name could be used was associated with a 29 percent decrease in suicidal thoughts. The researchers controlled for personal characteristics and social support.""

So if you don't want your trans child to commit unalive, use their pronouns and new name. Don't deadname.
yeah transphobes ignore anything that don’t go along with their beliefs. i think there was a study where homophobia and transphobia was often linked with low intelligence
I hope the frequency of it lessens as your father grows. I’ll be here if you need to talk, that’s a promise
Old habits die hard- the OP in your post may be more worried about you than themselves.  I don't think you need to apologize, but maybe reach out and say 'I see this really sucked for your perfectly innocent thread. I just want to check in and make sure we're okay."" or something like that.

My dad is very similar and while he's undiagnosed I'm certain he has depression and anxiety issues- all of his kids do, whether or not we were raised with him. When my son became my son, my dad insisted on confusing comfort with respect. As a result he's not in our lives anymore. My dad had a pretty rough upbringing, but he's an adult now and deserves the consequences of his actions in all things, just like yours does. You're not the one making things difficult. Keep your chin up- you're going to get the last laugh here.

&#x200B;

Edited to add- Sorry, you didn't ask for advice- old habits die hard for me too. I'll leave it there, I don't believe in erasing mistakes so much as learning from them.
You're welcome I get it my parents don't get me either. They deal with me but they don't fully support me use name pronouns so it's a pain in the ass.
Oh yes hugs are nice 🫂
HA! Well as far as trans perks go, that's definitely is pretty high up there! Maybe that was a way for the universe to be kind to you. :)
Yeah, I didn’t realize there was more than one 😂
You have a good head on your shoulders. Keep doing what you do King 💜
So do I. If you ever need someone to talk to feel free to message
Yeah, tbh he sounds like an emotional liability—the kind of person who you keep attached simply to give them the opportunity to prove they arent shitty or prove they can change, and in the end its just excuse after excuse, holding your breath until the next disappointment… it is better to go ahead and shut it down now. He has made his priorities crystal clear, and that is that his kids are not among them.
People are horrible.
You have nothing you *need* to justify, and your dad has nothing he *can* justify. This whole thing he has created is both sad and tragic. I'm just sorry you have to deal with it. No parent should treat their child like this.
Exactly this. My dad has ALWAYS had the ""I'm always right and the victim"" mentality my whole life 🙄 he wants to predict bad things happening to his children in hopes that WHEN they do, we'll go ""you were right dad!:/"" Idk how I can tell him he's right if I'm dead tho LMAO ig he thinks my demise is inevitable and my siblings will come crawling back  to him. It's never going to happen though. If I end up dead it will be because of something out of my control
Well, its great that your getting help, and that you're happy with yourself. I am personally happy with myself as well, being Aro/Ace/Agender. But the friends I have are probably the only good thing outside of my ownself. But thanks for the well wishings, it means a lot.
I don’t know who he thinks he is telling you that you “never wanted to be a boy” as if it’s a choice. I don’t know what’s up with him, but he needs to get his brain checked or something cause he’s completely brain dead.
No problem my fellow dude bro, we're all made in God's image and this is you fulfilling that image, not making some arbitrary choice like the prick your stuck calling a father seems to think. And whether you believe in God or not isn't important to me, but thats how I feel about all LGBTQIA+ people living out as their true selves. If you're happy, then you're fulfilling God's image of you. Continue to be the awesome, handsome guy you are, and much love from me to you!
Thanks for defending me ❤️ he genuinely is a bad person like, beyond these screenshots.
First off, chill. Second off that’s quite the black/white way of seeing things. Nobody wakes up and goes “hehe time to be evil today”, everyone has their points of view and misguided notions about the world, my father is also a biggot but I understand where he comes from, an extremely religious and primitive upbringing. Nobody is perfect and rarely people are 100% in control of themselves and their thoughts and so I’ve been working with him for years and surely enough he opens up more as time goes because before all he simply acts the way he does out of concern and love. Showing zero empathy like you are now is no better than the way OP’s father acts in my opinion. Only love and understanding will lead to love and understanding.
I can understand and relate. I have a similar experience- you do what’s best for you. I do hope your father develop his senses one day and make amends
[removed]
Stay strong, I believe in you ❤️

It's not easy 😔
I mean to your dad... from me :)

I just didn't want to point out directaly, that he's your dad.
Im here and ill help when I can 💗
No that's impossible, obviously every single trans person has a 50/50 chance of committing suicide no matter what xD
🤜
🫂💖
I agree, this is definitely not a case of being annoyed by small things. You’ve gone above and beyond. I mean texting your friends to complain about you? He honestly believes that he’s going to recruit them and turn them against you? Bucky, as a parent of two grown people. I would never dream of that. I love my kids unconditionally, and all I want for them is to be happy. It’s horrifying that he would do this. I see the hurt in your post. You’re justified in how you feel. 

When one told me they were Bi, I hugged them and told them to find whoever made them happy. I said that there’s not enough love in this world, and that however they decided to share that love was going to make the world better. It didn’t matter if they got married or not, had one significant other or several. I would always love and support them. 

You’ve tried. You really have. But his actions are wrong. It shouldn’t matter what you’ve done medically. He doesn’t have the right to make your decisions for your body. Which the republican narrative tries to assert. Their narrative needs to really re-examine their hypocrisy…They screamed you don’t have the right to make me wear a mask, but they can’t possibly move fast enough to try and block healthcare for women or transgender youth. These are the people who scream what about the children, but with the school shootings go out of their way to defend their guns instead of the children. 

I’m rather long winded here also. You have my support, and I guess I could have just said that. But I hope you know, that by my long response that I believe that you have done everything you could. And it’s now time to stop allowing him to hurt you. But my final word is you’ve already proven yourself a better human, and a better man than he ever was or ever will be. Go and let yourself enjoy this life. It’s too short to allow him to drag you down into his swamp of misery.
Exactly
❤️❤️❤️
It just supports their persecution complex
I just realized that I meant brother in arms and in knight hood, I might not have half a braincell.
Even then you don't owe them anything. It's a good thing and nice to educate them, but they're not entitled to a trans person, be it a friend, family member or stranger, explaining anything to them. It's okay to not have the energy to explain things. It's okay to set a boundary because it would be re-traumatising to have to explain why the things they say or think are wrong. It's okay to not want to put up with it. Offering education to those willing to learn is great, but it's not mandatory. You don't **owe** it to them
Good vs bad faith was actually the main thing I brought up with each of my parents. All I asked of them was to just listen to me and ask questions *in good faith.* I did try really really hard and did a lot of research FOR my dad and sent him all the links. He just ignored all of it. Plus he has always asked questions in bad faith. My answers never mattered to him because he already made up his mind 😔

And I'm confident in this because my mom was really upset with me at first but she maintains good faith and has even started educating her own peers. My dad would NEVER
I totally get that. I tend to do the same, myself - it’s taken me a long time to recognise that the way my parents treated me wasn’t okay, and that I needed better boundaries
I also love your username. I assume it's IASIP related?
It's honestly really sad they don't even bother reading scientifically proven articles. Just really proves that some people would rather hate people than try to be a better person. You're pretty damn strong to be able to put up with your literal dad treating you like this!

&#x200B;

Thanks! Probably won't be able to come out until I'm over 18, but sadly I know they won't support me (but probably won't disown me, at least before I take t) so I'll have to figure out how to get a t prescription myself :').
Luckily I moved to a state where none of my family lives, so I don't see them often. My dad claims I did that cause I'm embarrassed. Yah embarrassed of how bigoted y'all are 😂😂😂
Don't worry about it haha I appreciate your insight a lot 🥺❤️ I didn't even pay attention to your flair at first hwheje its nice to know there are cis parents here looking out for us, for me 🥺🥺🥺💕
My mom has been slow to get there but she's getting there. I don't expect my extended family to ever get it though. Maybe when I get top surgery and grow a beard they'll feel awkward enough but who knows. they don't seem to take it seriously
That's what I chose to believe tbh 🥺 I probably would have been an asshole for a while and would've had a really strained relationship with my older siblings. My dad is very misogynist but he would say ""old fashioned"" but I also would have been gay AF so who knows what would have happened tbh. I am still going to view it as a kindness because I think I've grown up to be a good person 👉👈
Thank u cutie 🥺💕
Thank you ❤️🌺
You're right. Ive been doing the holding my breath until the next disappointment for too many years to wait any longer. Every single family member whose known my dad since before I was born all agree...he will NEVER change.
Thank you for your kind words 🥺💕💕🫂
Also because it's not like I grew up saying ""I never want to be a boy!"" ?? 😂😂 My dad legit would get worried if I cut my hair too short or dress like a boy. Now he wanna pretend like I've been an ultra femme womanly woman all along 🙄😂
Thanks for being so respectful and kind :-) I am no longer religious but I respect your views and am happy to know you believe in something so wonderful 💞
It’s the least I can do, I know what you mean. You deserve infinitely better, and don’t let assholes like that get to you. You, and you alone, can decide if something is bad enough.
These people constantly harm others. They don’t deserve empathy. 

And really, because I make the true statement that bigots are evil, I’m *no better than them*? Lmao shut the fuck up. Queer people didn’t just appear all of a sudden. We have always existed.

Bigotry exists out of lack of empathy and a refusal to learn, not the inability. “Love and understanding” is bullshit. These people want us dead, there is no love and certainly no understanding. “Yeah I get it you think I’m an abomination and want me dead, that’s valid, but maybe don’t do that?”.

If we continue to be weak against these “people” we’ll never be free. No progress has ever been achieved by kindly asking your oppressors to please stop. Being nice to them does nothing more than limit our progress to actual freedom. 

I hope you become a good person and deconstruct the bigotry you clearly have left in you from your upbringing
I see you've commented on my post several times but they keep getting deleted. Are you my dad? Lmao if you're not I suggest to stop being so obsessed with me and leave me alone ❤️
Lmao what, I hope you come back to reality one day, if not, I’ll be enjoying the fact you will suffer endlessly in the next life <3
Ohh gotcha!
OHH right right that 50/50 shot 🤣
🥺🥺🥺🥺 I'm actually really happy for your lengthy reply ❤️❤️ you're a really lovely person 💕 I'm glad other people can see I've put in the effort. it just helps to be validated and reminded I'm doing the right thing

You're a wonderful parent your kids are very lucky to have you 🙂💗💞
Haha no worries!
Yes!! 🥰
Thank you 🥺

I'm not sure where you live ofc but luckily resources like the trans reddits are great ways to figure out where and how to get your T. Some US states do informed consent so it's a matter of talking to a doctor and having them write your script. I myself have been using plume until I can find a doc who will write my scripts instead of the plume service
Heh yeah I finally figured out how to set my flair.. A LOT of the early posts I posted in this subreddit are ""Hi there, I'm a (cis) mom to a (trans) son"" ha ha

And you're totally worth looking out for. Buy your sister a drink (coffee, adult beverages, a soda, whatever) next time you see her, she's a keeper. And if you need parental perspective, feel free to send me a dm, or whatever it is the kids call it these days. Christ I'm old.. :D
Yeah it's the opposite for me it's like the less people knew me pre coming out the easier it is for them the longer they knew me before it's like brutal. I'm in my 30s. So I'm kinda like eh this is what it is they can't stop me and I can't change them.
You're welcome 😊💜
Of course ❤️🫂
I don’t know who he thinks he is saying “this isn’t your true self” like dude, yes it is. Since when does he get to make the decisions on who your true self is? Anyways, go tell your dad to suck a fat cock. (Hope you don’t take offense to that)
We should all be kind and respectful at the bare minimum, regardless of our views on the subject, hell that's what the Bible teaches us, but people have twisted and perverted its words to fit their ideas. Hopefully one day religion as a whole can go back to what it should've always been. A loving accepting home for those in need of one. But I digress and end my rant. And since I'm unsure if you have heard this recently. I love you man. You are loved.
Jesus to the holy Christ. There isn’t enough time in the day to unpack all of this and you don’t seem open to discussion at the moment so I’ll just say this few things. these “people” are our friends and family - normal people, not a KKK-style clan of biggots. They aren’t cordinated in their stupidity. Instead of aiming for a war with them you should aim to help them understand. There is such a thing as blunt education when things go too far but here we are in 2022 - where being ourselves becomes more celebrated with each passing day thanks to the hard work of countless people who acted kindly and intellectually through years of hardship out in the real world, not thanks to angry people arguing on social networks. 2, hate and anger only leads to more hate and anger which you seem to be full of. I don’t know your story or circumstances but you don’t know mine either and what I’ve been through. But I’ll tell you as someone who was surrounded by hatred their entire life and still is - just writing people off as evil is the simple way out. Aiming for mutual understanding is not ״bigotry from my upbringing”. It’s a strength I’ve acquired because of it. I don’t categorize myself as a “good person” and I don’t aim to be one because such thing doesn’t exist. You’ll do good things in your life and bad things, the goal is to be our best self we can be.
Marry me.
Np!

Thank you so much! That really helps a lot! I'll look up the guidelines for my state right now!
Thank you sm 💞💞 I really appreciate it and will keep it in mind 🥺💕
Thank you 🥺❤️ I'm case you haven't heard it either you are loved too! 💕
Alright so you just don’t actually care about change. They’ve had their entire lives to learn, they haven’t, that’s on them.

And there certainly is a thing as a good person, but I’m glad you recognize you aren’t one.

May the Gods help the people around you
OKAY! 😍💍💒
The fact you categorize me as a bad person because my opinion is different than you even though we both aim for the same goal speaks volume. You are being extremely mean but again I don’t know what’s behind your words so I won’t retaliate. You also don’t seem 
to even care about what I’m saying so communication is meaningless - I wish you a wonderful day, week, year and life my friend. I hope you find peace
Done. No take backsies.
You’re defending bigots and telling someone not to blame their abusive family for being abusive. That makes you a bad person.
Where did I do either of those things?
Your original comment"	v8tuic	trans	1334	0.99	2022-06-09 23:23:46
The owner of GayPrideShop UK, the largest LGBTQ+ store in the UK, told me to get used to being misgendered.	"This is a cross-post from r/transgenderuk
I've read the rules, but I'm not clear on the etiquette, so I'm sorry if I have not followed correctly. 

When i worked there from June - December, customers often misgendered me, but during halloween, when it was particularly busy, it happened a lot more. One guy looked me right in the eyes, and at the huge ""She/Her"" patch on my beanie and said ""see ya later fella"", which, obviously, made me feel disgusting. I told the owner of the store about this, and he said the exact words:

""you'd better get over it, because I make most of my money this time of year"".

He said that to me at the start of the first day of the Halloween rush, and I then, for three days, served most of the customers during the rush. Almost all of them misgendered me, and this period was awful for my mental health.

My first day off after those three days, I went to my GP and was prescribed anti-depressants. This was because of a mental health crisis I was having because of what the owner had said to me. 

In November, he -actually- misgendered me, in front of a customer, who then consequently misgendered me. He'd also make light of what had happened during halloween and would double down on what he'd said. 

They appear inclusive, because they include neopronouns, and they cover a lot of different identities. But from my experience with the two owners, any support they show for trans rights is just virtue signalling. 

Anyway, sorry for the wall of text, this has sat with me for a while and I felt the need to say something."	"i feel that alot of ""lgbtq+ friendly"" companies are actually very queerphobic.
Unfortunately there is a surprisingly large amount of transphobia in the LGBTQ+ community from those who aren’t trans.
This is rainbow capitalism. Nothing about a business selling pride merch is liberators. I'm sorry you went through that OP
Well I straight-up would have told him that some people are going to need to get used to getting punched in the nose then
He wants money. I don't think he actually cares about advocating or misgendering.
I've heard of companies profiting off of pride before but an entire store DEDICATED to profiting off of pride without actually caring about LGBT people? Holy fuck.
Ugh. Where in the UK is the shop?
I swear to god this country is just the earth's butthole
I don’t support gays who don’t support me
Wtf :( I am soooo sorry to hear that.
Unfortunately alot of the ""support"" from companies regarding lgbtq+ is purely financially motivated. It's a shame they don't always care but atleast it's some progress, exposure can help normalise our culture but we still have a far way to go.
Only commenting because now they're mad so I want to get this post some karma boosting powers....
this.  this kind of shit is proof the pride flag and the term ""LGBT"" doesn't actually include transgender rights at all.
Fact is. Most people are too busy to care about anything other than their own ego….
All capitalists are bastards. They would sell out their communities for profit in a heartbeat. The “representation” they give us is just a ploy to squeeze more money out of the most exploited sections of the working class.
Terf island strikes again 😔
time to boycott
Well this is one shop to never give money to.

What really bothers me is that you mention *multiple* customers misgendering you. Why would there be any need to use gender specific terms at all? That seems malicious in intent to me.
Sorry that happened to you Estelle, I hope you’re in a much better place now.
that was brutal, they didn't even pull their punches they just went nuclear on you, like damn.
I would just misgender your boss and customers and ask them why they get mad
That’s so disheartening because they should know better. I’m sorry you went through this. Your employer doesn’t value you, they value profit. You need to work for a company that does values you, because you deserve it. Surround yourself with people who support your authentic self. It’s critical to do this when you’re trans or non-binary.
Being fair, and 100% playing devils advocate; sometimes you do just have to get used to it bc there will always be shitty people both above, below, and on the same level as you. It sucks for real, but focusing on it only hurts more.

Personally, I just decry them as dickheads who can’t be better.

Sorry about the abuse you faced, but thanks for the heads-up, I now know where *not* to shop!
You should post this to r/antiwork
like Disney they have been saying forever they are supporters then turn around and cancel all of Pixar's queer content and support the people behind the Don't Say Gay bill.
Their level of friendliness is directly correlated to how much money you have to spend with them.
That’s because companies don’t have beliefs, they aren’t people. They only have one interest: profit, and will seek this by any means necessary. “LGBT positive” companies are only using that label to commodify our community and cater to those who may be fooled by their aesthetic. The second we aren’t profitable anymore, they’ll go right back to hating us.
hannaford (a local supermarket chain) is genuinely really good though :)) im really happy they are actually super nice and just really kind..
YEP.

Capitalism is the enemy.
The bourgeois class will be liquidated someday, my trans brothers and sisters.
Despite what people say, violence sometimes IS the answer.
Odd how he did all that misgendering personally for free then

He's transphobic.
Based in Manchester, they ship globally.
Not just your country. There's a wrong way to be in every place you can go.
People in the UK tend to use gendered terms naturally, to my dismay 😅

I wore signage (sold by the store) constantly to try and get people to take a hint, the entire building is meant to be trans positive (there are signs saying ""no transphobia"" and a huge trans day of visibility mural) so I feel like it's fair to expect people to respect it.
What
Jesus Christ homegirl was just venting and warning us about this place. If you never feel shitty about this sort of thing then great for you, other people can use some support and that's perfectly OK too.
>That’s the reality of our choice.

What choice?
Choice? Just because your experience soured your outlook doesn't mean everybody has to be as jaded as you. If you need to talk, my DMs are open for all, but don't spread your misery and try bringing everyone down to how fucked up you feel inside. Jesus Christ.
sounds like someone could use some therapy and antidepressants. hope you get better soon!
Thats depressing me rn
walmart too!
I'm so fed up of these large media corporations that are just slightly ""technically not *too* big to be considered a monopoly"" limiting their creators, mainly when these limitations are because of bigotry...
In Maine? How trans-friendly is Maine in general, would you say?
Unfortunately for some people I am a scrapper more unfortunate for some people my brother is an insane person who loves to fight and will fight anyone who is transphobic. The older I get the less scrappy I've become but I will defend myself and more importantly anyone in the community. Sometimes some loud mouth transphobic jerk needs a nice jarring slap or a punch to the gut. Be safe out there everyone
Violence is never the answer!
Its the question, and the answer is always YES
it’s always a solution
The one if affleks? If so I'll avoid it and just use QueerLit
Based here in Manchester you say! Disgraceful. Have the owner come down to Wythenshawe, we'll show him a ""good time"" 😇

Side note if you're ever in need of a South Manchester friend just DM me and say hi, I myself don't know a lot of people from the community here! ^-^
That must be regional because I'm from UK and never used gendered terms to refer to people I didn't know since long before I knew about anything LGBT.
LMAO it's like tell me you have internalized transphobia without telling me you have internalized transphobia
uhhh no not maine but new england. idk abt maine but where i live is really nice honestly.
I feel this on a spiritual level.
Any time is go time, and these hands are rated E for Everyone! lol In all honesty I've lost a lot of my fight (physically) but I grew up in the ghetto so the savagery still remains if I ever need it.
It is that one yes, they actually have beef with QueerLit.
Dm me of you want a link to a Manchester based social group for 18-35 year old trans people! ^_^ it's a lovely group.
Ohh, I just looked it up and apparently hannaford’s exists outside of Maine lol. My bad. I’m in Mass and it seems pretty friendly, but I’m still scared shitless to come out tbh
All the more reason to support queer lit then!
Oh my days yes, I went there to ask about books that might help my parents get their heads round the trans of it all. They recommended the transgender issue and coming out stories, both of which my mum has now read and is helping my dad get used to gendering me correctly now 😊
Also, the staff there were lovely as it wasn't too busy so I got to have a proper good chat with the 3 people in that day. Love that place! Can't wait to move back to Manchester and get all my queer books from there 😁
I love Queer Lit! Such a genuinely nice business."	tjjrvh	trans	1333	0.99	2022-03-21 19:25:55

I'm sorry but you look exactly the same, these progress pics could've been taken on the same day
Thanks! I'm actually a little insecure about them. I feel like they are counterproductive
Thank you!
Thank you! :)
Thank you for the compliment! Hugs
Oh? You mean in comparison to my other post where I had a beard? Or when? Both these pictures in the blue polka dot dress were taken that same day.
I can get that. They’re good-looking tattoos tho, and I think they add to the aesthetic you have going on here"	o9y5rh	trans	1324	0.98	2021-06-29 01:31:49
Had a great time at pride today!		"Love the guy with the statistic sign. Wonder why those numbers are so high 🤔
Lol those homophobes sure do love attending Pride, they always make sure they never miss an event!
If I ever go to a pride parade I’m gonna go right in front of the homophobes and transphobes. Thou shall assert thy dominance.
The best part is your cheeky smile in front of those dumb homophobes 🤣
lol, “more likely to use illegal drugs”
homo sex? is this a robocop spin im not aware? or the special scene
So nice of them to put their sign in rainbow text 😂 great pic! Love ur hair and lipstick.
Homo Sex Is In
Holy shit, girl, I *need* that fan!!💖💖💖
Ah so Akron and Ottawa both had pride this weekend! No protests here that I saw.
We sure live rent-free in their head.
I'm going to shamelessly steal your look, it's fantastic!
Looks fun and chaotic but those homophobes are just so stupid
Is this Akron? I feel like I just saw that same sign at Pride here.
I went to the one in Manchester today, had a great time. I don't think I saw anything -phobic there.
Is that an Ayyawear kilt?
Looked so prettyyyyy
Whats a pride parade lik anyway ive never even seen one in person
I was there!! I have a selfie with them 💀
Is that the Versatta pride kilt?
I think that is the same pride parade i went to!
Goalssssss
The fanatical religious types never were very good with the whole self-awareness thing.
i guess they'll never know...
You can’t, of course, point this out to the religious people. It frightens them, and makes them start to feel terrible things like “guilt” and “responsibility” and in extreme cases, “empathy”
Yeaaaahhh haha makes for great photo ops though!
They love it really. Hopefully they'll be in the parade next year! 😉
It's usually better if it is in.
It was in Akron! Lol my wife and I just moved down here.
Verillas!
It is indeed!
I read this comment with Patrick star’s voice and it got a good chuckle out of me
Lmao I love these types of pictures. The protestors are always the most ugly looking mfs lolol
That’s awesome! My wife and I were just there a few hours ago. You might have even passed us!
\*smacks forehead\* yeah Verillas, how are you finding it? Been thinking of buying one too.
This is the best thing ever omggggggggggggggg
We were there at the start of the march! My wife and I and my best friend went. I havent been since I first came out 4 years ago but it was massive! Hope yall had/have a great Pride!
Mine isn't *quite* as wrinkle-prone as similar kilts usually are.  I honestly prefer ones made with heavier fabric specifically because of the wrinkle problem.  Having said that, the verillas example is a heck of a lot more comfortable to wear, in general, at least in the heat.  (Also, that they come with pockets by default is awesome, as is the fact that you can remove the pockets if you want.)
Ive been loving it! It's not a traditional heavy fabric kilt it's more of a polyester but I enjoy it over traditional fabric kilts. It's comfy enough for me to wear at work and I put in like 22k steps a day, 10/10 would recommend.
We did! As much fun as you can have taking two toddlers to pride. lol I hope you had a great time as well!
Sweet,  thanks! My mistake with the name, I forgot that Ayyawear merged into Verillas...
No probs!"	wz901s	trans	1323	0.99	2022-08-27 17:51:12

I make hidden pride flags for those of us that have to hide who we are. As someone apart of the trans community, I hope this art can help you feel seen.		"If you'd like, please feel free to check out my [Etsy](http://theythemart.etsy.com). Every little bit of support helps me continue to make art full time.
I love it
This is amazing!
That’s a beautiful idea
*sneaky trans noises*
That deserves a follow and recognition, many people need this in their lives, you are doing the world a favor. All the love. 💜🧡
Just bought one, looks amazing!!!
I can relate so much to this and it makes me extremely sad :(
This is so wonderful! I had a similar idea with making bookmarks with characters dressed in different pride colors, but this is so much more beautiful and under the radar!
This is beautiful Can you post on r/drawing ? They would love it so much I guarantee it.
Omg, your painting is way better than mine! 🥺
That's super pretty
I am fully closeted at home, school, and work as of this comment. That made my morning to wake up and see. I have my own hidden trans flag on my rgb keyboard. Thank you so much, I really appreciate this and it feels like this was made jsut for me
this is sooooo pretty !!!
Hi love. Do you do frames to them? I absolutely adore this trans flag one.

edit: the last two frames ive bought for posters ive got wrong size wise or broken, forgive my being stupid, lol.
HA! I was just going to ask if there was any chance you'd consider selling these. XD
I'm wheezing 😩
You deserve better, friend ❤️
Do you think so? I wouldn't want to intrude, since it's a painting and not a drawing.
I don't personally frame them however, the dimensions are 7in by 5in if you were looking to get a frame for it. ❤️
I do! [Here you are! ](http://theythemart.etsy.com)
it would be fine people post paintings and such all the time! The community would find it so dope!
Ah thank you. Btw what a beautiful idea for art! I love your work and I wish you all the best with your business."	jvdl0j	trans	1231	0.99	2020-11-16 19:45:17
Coming Out and Cutting Off	"On January 23rd, 2022, I came out to my parents. I had written them a letter a couple of weeks beforehand and put it in my room. I told my mother where to find it. I was at a friend's apartment, near my college.

I didn't speak to her for about another week. The first person I spoke to was my Grandmother, who lives with my parents. She wasn't happy. Neither was my Dad. There was a lot of yelling, a lot of anger, and a lot of pain that day, while I attempted to explain everything to them calmly. I've never been one to get angry.

The days went by, and things slowly calmed down. My Grandma, who had said she didn't want to talk anymore, began to call every day again (multiple times daily), and my Dad called occasionally. I even spoke to my Aunt, who wanted to be the ""mediator"" between me and my Mom.

And then. They asked me to go home. And I agreed.

I was treated with the worst weekend of my entire life.

&#x200B;

The ride home with my Mom was painful. We argued for a bit, invalidating my gender, saying she'd only ever love \*dead name\*. We ate and continued to argue. I never raised my voice. I wasn't raised to do that. The rest of the ride home was silent. I never looked at my phone, I just looked forward as the time ticked down. I didn't rest my eyes, nor did I ask to go to the bathroom despite my bladder screaming at me. I didn't want her berating me for not feeling up to go into the Women's restroom yet.

When we got home, I brought my stuff up to my room. My Grandma had asked to see my HRT, so I took 1 of both pills I take to her. My Mom found the rest and took it, calling me a liar and receptor for even trying to keep it. I went to bed shortly after.

When I got up, my Grandpa wanted to take me to his priest. It wasn't the worst experience in the world, he didn't yell, say I was going to hell, or even say it was a sin. He wanted to ""guide"" me through this. We ate, got home, and then, it was my Dad's turn.

He took me to my Grandfather and Uncle's graves. Both died before I was born. He told me about how proud his Grandfather was of him getting married, and how wanted to feel the same for me. I said he could. He said it wouldn't be the same. He said he wanted to continue his family's name and legacy. I said I could, with adoption. He said it wouldn't be the same. He then took me to see my Grandma. He hadn't told her and left it up to me. I didn't say anything.

We got home. My mom made dinner, and we ate. Afterward, my Grandma encouraged me to speak with my Mo, or she wouldn't speak to me. I wanted to keep her, so I did. It quickly went awry. She took my phone and began reading chat logs, seeing how I spoke to people, now my friends, at my college's PRIDE club. She had already thought I was brainwashed, and this cemented it in her mind. I knew I was trans before I met them, however.

My mom and dad began reacting horribly. They wanted legal action done against my friends, the club, the school, Plume (where I get my HRT). They threatened to get my close friend expelled and fired. Thye began posting things online calling them cultists indoctrinating their child and ""warning"" parents of the threat. My dad sent emails to the heads of the PRIDE club, threatening them if they ever spoke to me again.

My dad threatened to beat me. He said he didn't know if he'd be able to stop himself from killing me if he started.

Both wanted to attack any of my friends if they saw them.

and...

&#x200B;

My dad threatened to shoot my close friend.

&#x200B;

They continued reading chat messages. They were now getting to my high school friends, who I had come out to and who supported me. They started to insult and threaten them too.

My mom began to threaten not to take me back to my dorm. To not let me go back to classes. I had to say things I didn't mean in order to convince her to let me get out of that house.

I went to bed. My dad later told me that as he continued to read my messages, (which he now had access to on his computer because he asked for my Discord password) he wanted to enter my room and beat me while I was asleep.

When I finally got back to campus, my Mom forced me to take my box of feminine items in my dorm down to their car. And then, they left.

&#x200B;

It took me a while to respond to any of my friends. They were incredibly worried about me. I told them I was doing okay, and about everything that had occurred. 

I began formulating a plan of what to do.

My friends had already reported my dad to campus safety. The things I told them were just the icing on the cake.

They got me a prepaid phone. The one I had had Life360 on it, and I wasn't sure how much else they had access to.

I informed my Calculus professor, whose class I had an exam in on the day I planned to confront them. He allowed me to delay it.

I spoke to campus officers, lawyers, to about everyone I could without my parents knowing. They were watching me like a hawk, unfortunately.

During this time, my parents drained my bank account, which was jointly owned. They also informed me that they knew I had another prescription for my HRT filled, and they would be forcing me to pick it up and give it to them.

The plan was for me to confront them. A parent's weekend was coming up, wonderful timing. My friends notified the school of my plan. They would be prepared in case anything happened.

And the day came.

&#x200B;

I got up early, and got ready, watching Life360 as my parents drive down. Luckily, it went both ways. We met up briefly before classes began. I told them I loved them.

When classes were over, I went to our Student Union. Many people, students parents, faculty, security would be there. I'd be safe. My parents came to meet me.

I gave them an ultimatum. They either accept me, give me back my money, stop threatening me and my friends, or I cut them off. My mother gave me a counter ultimatum. There was one option in both that matched.

We continued to argue. I told them I didn't deserve the things they did. They said they had the right to do them. She asked for ""her"" phone. I handed it right to her. She said I was her son. I told her I was her daughter. She walked away.

My dad continued to speak with me for a bit. He said he didn't agree with her taking my phone, and that he didn't ""mean"" any of the threats he made. He was just angry. He asked me if visiting his father and brother's graves meant nothing to me. I said it did, but it didn't change who I was. I hugged him, and he left after my mother.

It has since been a day. I was able to spend the rest of that day with my friends, dressing up how I want, getting my HRT back, changing my passwords to accounts they had, and watching Queer Eye. I had never actually watched it before. It was nice.

&#x200B;

The strange thing is, I feel as though I should have a sense of grief. I will miss my family, I will miss my Grandma, and I will miss my Niece and Nephew. But I think I already accepted losing them as a possibility before I even came out. So, I expected it, and it's what I got. I already went through my grief.

From now on, my life will be harder. I won't be supported by my family, I will have to do my own financial aid for college, I will have to do everything on my own. And maybe I am not ready for it. But I will try. I will be the person my parents thought I couldn't be. I will go through life as myself, unapologetically. Because I have spent the past 18 years incapable of doing so, suppressing myself and my emotions, being the perfect little child, who does no wrong.

&#x200B;

My life will be harder. But it also shines so much brighter. And I cannot wait to keep living it."	"This sounds like an absolute horror show. Your parents could and should be charged for stealing your medication and for making threats of violence. I hope you are well.
It took a ton of strength to make those steps and you were right to defend yourself!
Thank you so much for posting this, and you know we are here for you. Reading this was almost therapeutic for me, as I can relate to most everything and it shows that even if everything goes wrong, its still possible to make it.
I realized my identity just over a month ago, at the end of my first semester in college. I realize my suppression had been preventing me from really connecting with people, and im still trying to figure out how to get friends who would accept me if I came out to them.
This kind of confrontation takes the strength that not many have. I am happy that you are currently safe, and I wish you luck on your journey. This story is the biggest thing I am personally afraid of happening and that is why I am waiting till I graduate. Hiding it is tough, but it is even more badass to live your life as yourself. When it comes to providing for yourself, depending on your major you could look around for some entry internships. Or look into possible scholarships to apply for. Depending on how high your tuition is will change the difficulty of the whole process. If you have more internships than is necessary for your tuition and any other administrative expenses you will get that money refunded to you. Good luck girl, we are all cheering for you.
Did they ever return the money they stole?
It's amazing how mature of a person you are! I wouldn't be so delicated as you were, personally.
They don't deserve you, they sound like disgusting human being frankly, and long term you will be better of without them. You are string, doing this. Be proud
Proud of you, keep it up 💜
Am I the only one who thinks you should run to the cops and tell them your parents threatened your friends life just because you're trans?
You are so brave.
I'm a stranger and this shouldn't mean anything to you
but I am proud of you for stepping up to your parents.

I wish you all the best and joy with your new won freedom:)
Resonated with a lot in your story. Shit birth family here as well. Stay strong! Remember you can make your family however you want! It doesn’t have to be your blood!
Exactly what I’m a afraid of when I go off to college and begin to transition.

Honestly you are so brave and you did the right thing by cutting out your family; if they want you back in their then they need to realize they have to make peace with who you are.

Good luck your are braver than I good lady.
Walk your own path, make your own family   


I don't have supportive family, me and my mum pretty much openly hate each other - unless someone is around then she tries to play nice ofc.  
Rest of family is abroad and I have no contact with them, I came out to them though.  
They don't understand it or accept it, but they do want me to be happy - therefore I told them one thing I must do is cut myself from the past, because I won't be able to heal from trauma.

I need love and support, I only started HRT lately and I just have a mindset of a teenage girl, who is beyond her wisdom for her age.

The way I counterpart loneliness and trauma from not so great family is building my own circle of friends, who treat me with respect for who I am.  
When I am surrounded by such people, I am able to be honest, emotional, more loving and I will grow as a person, that I am transitioning to.
I get the feelings what they did should be labeled abuse. None of that was ok, by any metric.
We cannot choose our gender or who we love, but we CAN choose who we call our ""family"". For some of us this is easier said than done, but Im glad you found the support and strength to be true to who you are.

Also, on a brighter note, Queer Eye is an excellent pick-me-up for any occasion.
Yeah. This is why I sent my parents a letter and then just never talked to them again.
I'm so incredibly sorry for you. And I know that this might happen to me too. So I'm cutting them off emotionally at the moment to feel stronger when that happens.
Thanks for sharing. I'm expecting the same of my parents in about a month, so your experience really hits home. You are better off and you have a bright future ahead of you. The best thing to do is to continue to be and become who you were meant to be. Get into a field that you love and live a life worth envying. It's their loss that they chose not to be part of that.

Lots of love sis. You are so awesome. <3
Dear god, I’m so sorry you had to go through all that. I don’t know if I would have had the resilience you did. Stay strong girl, you’ve gotten this far, nothing can stop you now.
Your parents sound like they would be great friends with mine. I was cut off last summer, tried to let my mom back in a few months ago, and ultimately went no contact. 

Mine didn’t have as much access to abuse me as yours did. I came out as a married adult, post college. But they still paid for my phone service. They got rid of that eight months ago. I still don’t have cell service. 

It’s hard, but I resonate with you saying you already mourned them, in a sense. 

Much love to you girl, you have a fantastic life ahead of you.
You seem like an amazingly composed and compassionate person. I wish I could give you a round of applause and a massive hug at the same time. Whoever you choose to be your friends and family from now on are so lucky to have you!
This is why Im not planning to have any discussion with my family Once I transit, I will just cut them of. Its better that way. Im sorry OP for what happened to you. Also you was very brave.
This post is written like someone is dissociating while writing it. That kind of experience is extremely traumatizing. I hope you’re okay. Please talk to a therapist as soon as you can. Your campus should have services available.
I'm proud of you. Abusive parents suck and you did the right thing here. Never go back, you worked hard to get here, to a place where you can be yourself.
That sounds like an absolute shitshow, i'm really sorry you had to go through that ☹️ but you have friends and an environment that loves and accepts you so that's a major plus. And you have us as well 😊 stay strong girl, and stay safe
I'm sorry these awful ideas got into your family's head. The things people will do when they're scared or angry, over something that doesn't warrant it. I don't know how you kept your cool. That must have been so hard. 

I hope you make out okay, I'll be thinking about you Sister. They didn't give you a choice, you tried.
this is horrifying but I'm so glad you're safe now. you're an incredibly strong young woman, you should be proud for coming out and proud for standing up against them. with support from people who actually accept you you'll grow even stronger and more wonderful. never forget that, never deny who you are
I am so sorry for all that you have had to go through and in the end all of this will make you stronger and now you can truly be your happy self the way you feel and the way you are.
As I was reading this I swear I had hand tremors from trying not to punch these parents ngl.
I know how you're feeling. I've definitely been in a very similar situation a long time ago and those very same events I've never forgotten. 10 years later on down the line with years hrt and many years of effort and dedication and I pass really well, I don't live in a dangerous environment anymore. I have so many friends willing to put others before themselves in this community. It did get easier and I hope that it does for you. The only advice I can really think of right now is to make things as easy as possible for yourself in future by having backup plans and backup plans for those backup plans because people who don't understand tend to find ways to hurt us / upend those plans sometimes without even meaning to.
For one, this is triggering, bot just ""possibly triggering"" seccond, why did you just like.. let your family take all of your stuff? From what i hear you are a grown woman in college so you shouldn't have any incentive to stay or to let them go through your private stuff on your phone or give your dad your discord password, third, IF YOUR DAD IS THREATENING TO KILL YOU AND YOUR FRIENDS THEN CALL THE FUCKING POLICE!! Like what??
You are one of the strongest people, I wish I could hug you. *Hugs*
There is you and there is the *idea* of you. You are the former; your parents “loved” the latter.
I’m so sorry you had to go through this sweetie! I have difficult parents but nothing like this. Not even close. I just want to say how strong and brave you are little flower, and that while it is sad, you have a truly shining path ahead to realize your full potential as the beautiful woman you are. Much love from a fellow trans sister ❤️
Some people are horrible people. No one should have to experience what you just did. 

As I am also a parent, were one of my kids to leave me a letter… I would honestly feel bad for not making them feel safe to tell me in person. In person because I would want to hug them, tell them I loved them… right there,  right then. Let them know I would fight for them. 

Those people don’t deserve any more of your time. 

Small piece of advice just in case…

Take what you’ve written here. Add to it, add details, who was present what approximate time things happened… get and include case number from campus security. Get info for everyone you talked to. make sure you can tell the entire story. Because you may need to take legal action (saw that you were waiting for that ‘one more thing’ these people sound quite capable of continuing.
<hugs> ❤️
I'm sorry for your family of violent criminals. I hope they get what they deserve if you wish to report them and I'm sure your friends will be there to support you I stead of your family.
Don't feel sorry for leaving them, the things they've done to you could get you into jail in my country.
You are so brave and such a beautiful person. Sending you some 💕
As someone who also has unsupportive parents, and is going off to college in a year or so, this is heartbreaking to read. Scary, even. But seeing someone show so much bravery and stand up for herself in this way is so so powerful and im glad I took the time to read it. You are so strong, and I am sending you all the well wishes and good luck that I can. You're strong, beautiful, and we're all cheering you on!!
Welcome to your newfound freedom. I've been there before, and trust me: none of the upcoming challenges compare to the crippling weight of abusive parents. You'll be okay. You've got this.
Jesus Christ what a shit show. I'm 45 and horrified at this story. Life will be hard but way better than what they did to you. You are obviously a strong woman and many people including me couldn't have handled that as well as you did. Maybe one day they'll come around but it will be on your terms if you want to forgive them (you don't have to)you go girl!!! Also you should sue them for the trauma they caused
It’s been a pleasure getting to know you and watch you grow, and I’m so proud! - Max
You're a strong woman, you know that right? Not everyone could stand their ground like that in such a situation, yet you did, as you said life will be hard now, but finally you can start living it as yourself, much love!
Whew that sucks. But also, you sound like an absolute badass. I cannot imagine the strength it must have taken to go through all of this. That you still retain a positive outlook is amazing. Keep spinning, girl.

(Also, if you haven't watched it yet, I recommend seeing the Matrix).
I am very proud of you for standing up to yourself and basically everyone involved in helping you out! You all did great in such a stressful situation!
You're amazing. Always remember that the authentic you will always handle any situation better than the fake you they want you to be ever would.
Ngl, I think you should throw the book at them. This barbaric behavior needs to start hurting these people.
Yeah okay your family fucking sucks, I'm your new mom or dad or whatever the fuck you need lol you are an amazing human being and you are a valid trans person! Now go have a great rest of your day, you incredible young lassie and always know that this community (and I) will be here for you whenever you need!!
It does get brighter! I’m worse off financially, too, but I’ve been doing much better mentally/emotionally and it gets better! ❤️
You are going to do great. Keep that determination and remember most of the people you find and bring close will have your back more than family ever does. ""The blood of the covenant is thicker than the water of the womb""
wow... just wow. I'm so heartbroken for reading all of that. I want you to know that you have all of my support, love, affection and time if you want to talk anytime, even if you want a new friend. I'm not doing as bad as you but I too am planning to escape from home this september (that's when I will turn 18) and be myself, because at my place my parents think it's a phase and my mother is very strict about how I act when she's not looking.

I am really really REALLY sorry that you had to go through everything I've just read (and more things that you probably didn't write which I respect too) but I know deep inside it will be worth it, I know that you will be able to move forward and be who you aspire to be.

I just would love to hug you right now and to tell you that everything will be okay but as I think that we live quite far from each other I'll just send you this, hope for you to read it and say that I love you, that you're valid and that I'm sending a virtual hug.

Lots of love honey, take amazing care of yourself and stay strong, you're doing great and you will be happy. <3
You did so well! I’m very proud of you 💜👍
What a painful experience. Just wish I could hug you. I'm so sorry your family treated you to that abuse.
You are so incredibly strong and brave. I started reading this post and had to put it down several times before I could make it all the way through it. What you went through and what they did and said both infuriated me and made me incredibly sad all at once. I’m so sorry. I’m glad that you’re ok though. So your research like you said in response to one of the comments. Do your research and speak with lawyers or councilors, maybe even something like campus police. Find out exactly what your rights are and what they can/cannot do or force you to do. I’m not sure where you are located but I’m pretty sure if you’re 18 then they have no legal bearing over you at all. I’m not saying press charges or anything either, that’s something only you can decide on. I am saying though, to know your rights to protect yourself from them trying anything else. Please stay safe. I’m glad that you have a good supportive group of friends.
Wow thats alot sorry
I'm so sorry you had to go through all that. But I am proud of you for standing up for yourself, impressed with your resourcefulness and happy that you have friends who will support you.
You deserve all the best, and you have the patience of a saint for not getting angry with them.
I wish you the best of luck and happiness, going forward!
Well... I’m so sorry for you😭😭😭

You can be SUPER SUPER proud of yourself💜, for how you’re dealing with this difficult situation.

Hang in there, things will get better eventually...
Wow. I'm sorry girl. No one should have to deal with that kind of extremely transphobic parents. I thought my parents were acting really bad but here you're coming back from hell.

I understand very much about this kind of grief. After several months of arguing about me being trans, I decided to cut off with mine last week too. I will definitely miss them, especially the ones they were before I came out.

I'm 1000% with you.
I think the most frustrating parts of these stories for me is hearing all the abuse and then ending with “those rascals, I’m not gonna make them face repercussions for their actions but I’m not happy with what they’ve done”. Ik it’s family and all but people need to understand that things have consequences and legal ramifications, you can’t withhold someone’s medication from them legally and threatening someone with physically harm is a serious crime that shouldn’t be brushed off. I’m guilty of doing this as well with the whole “one more thing, that’ll be my breaking point” but then things calm down and the next thing doesn’t quite hit your breaking point so it slides and then accumulates and you end up with an abusive shit show. If my siblings wouldn’t be split up and sent to equally abusive “fathers” ide have my mother in prison for life with the amount of shit I have on her, so I understand there’s nuance but op if there isn’t anything truly stopping you, you should seek legal advice in one way or another or atleast get a restraining order
Damn I just have no word to describe this it just seems so out of this world for parents to act like this i know I shouldn't be saying that but and im sorry for what im about to say but ETF IS WRING WITH ARE THEY FUCKING INSANE ACTING LIKE FUCKING DRAMA QUEEN BITCH WTF . More seriously I hope your doing fine by yourself and now that you're free enjoy your oife and be yourself.
This is one of the only things that I read on the internet that actually gave me goosebumps and made me scared for op.
Omg.
You should not be missing that awful, awful family of yours! Such a horror show...

In fact, your ""parents"" should have been charged with prescription medication theft and child abuse!

Just want to wish you well, sweetie. You're a girl and that's what matters.
I know that they can. I've done a lot of research and stuff into what they could be charged with, and it's a fair amount.

I don't intend to do anything to them at the moment though, unless they force my hand. They could do that by trying to ruin my life more than they have by like suing me, or attempting to take the stuff in my room.

On a more lighthearted note, my friends and I had been talking about what they might be able to take from me if they tried, and I joke they may try to take my fridge they had gotten me.

The two things my Mom said she wanted were my phone and my fridge.

My fucking fridge. Not my $1000 laptop, or my Switch, or anything else I have.

My fridge.

It was so ridiculous that I couldn't help but laugh at it with my friends once it was over.
Thanks!

It hasn't been easy, but I have a lot of very good friends supporting me through this. I really owe it all to them.
Hey! I get that. I really didn't put myself out there for a very long time. My high school friend group is only there because I was friends with one guy since middle school, and then a friend of his came in, and then a friend or two of hers, etc.

I'd suggest seeing if your campus has a PRIDE club of some kind. You can get some great friends thereto are almost certain to accept you for yourself. It can be tough to put yourself out there as your authentic self though, and I get that. My first club meeting, I didn't even say my name, or talk to anyone.

But over time, you may begin to loosen up. Tell them your name, maybe even dress as yourself. The first time I went out in public as myself was with them, to a PRIDE event. It's exciting to be yourself, so, all I can say is to try. Go at your own pace of course, but don't let it go ignored.
Yeah, financial stuff is gonna be a bit hard. Luckily, someone in our group recently went through a tough time with parents, and he's supposedly done a bunch of research into financial aid and stuff, and is willing to help out.

I also intend to look into internships, or at least a job of some kind. While my living expenses for the semester are covered (housing by dorm, and food by meal plan) I still have to worry about paying for HRT and stuff.

Tuition is quite high for my college (50k-ish), though I currently have 2 main scholarships covering like 35k each semester as long as I keep a decent GPA. The rest is a bit of an issue, but I've been researching scholarships, and now especially intend to go into them.
That's possible, but remember what the cops have done in the US. I don't trust the police. A lawsuit is a better option...
They don't have a case to sue you with. They're textbook abusive, breaking several laws, and if you throw the book at them (or vice versa) you are going to win.
Are you a minor? Refuse. If you're a minor get emancipated. This is insane. Stop doing what they say, stop giving them passwords. Go change all your passwords right now. Stop giving them access to anything..just refuse. And do not go back. You need to get help through LGBT groups for young people. Their are groups that help out up to mid 20s.
Ah, yes, the most.... Actually, stealing your fridge would be a pain in the ass for you, I was going to make fun of it but honestly that would be one weird power move
Yeah time for new parents.
Don't sell yourself short - your friends are backing the strength they see in you.

This was a tough read, and you're in a tough situation. 

But you got this. Stay strong...
I'm lucky the college I go to has a PRIDE club...
Make sure you check prices against GoodRX and CostPlus Pharmacy if you're in the US (which is what I'm assuming) because they may help bring the cost of your HRT wayy down.
If you haven't already and you're in the US and 25 or under, talk to your school's financial aid department to start paperwork for financial independence. Just let them know you've been cut off. This will have them reassess your financial obligation and can result in a significant increase in financial aid.

Good luck. It's so hard. I'm so sorry you're dealing with this.
I know in my area they sheltered a trans masc from his family and friends who basically ganged up to kill him over nonsense. It's worth a shot
You're right.
In addition to this great advice…

You can call your HRT provider and ask if they are willing to move you to a more inexpensive option.  Most providers are acutely aware of the challenges that the cost of medications pose to patients, and they know a few tricks."	slqvog	trans	1206	0.99	2022-02-06 07:21:51

so ive come out a couple times but never fully transitioned, the biggest hold up at this point is that i really want to be a musician and i’m scared how transitioning would affect that. hopefully i’ll have the courage to live full time as a female soon. happy pride everyone :)		"You’re gorgeous! Definitely don’t be afraid,
I still am because of my career too but you are beautiful
Fellow MTF musician, fucking DO IT (if you feel ready and want to.) My BEST performance (so far) was the one after I performed under my chosen name in femme. It's so liberating. 10/10 would recommend.  


Edit: I will say a few places I used to perform at haven't gotten back to me but the vibe was always weird there (yee yee etc) and I'm better off saving my energy for affirming venues.
[deleted]
Hi! You are a very talented musician whether you transition or not. But If you do decide to take that step I think it will open up a whole new world to you. A community of other trans musicians and an audience of people hungry for more queer representation in the music industry. I’m definitely a new fan now! Can’t wait to hear your future music!
Just wanted to say your looks show no sign of a lack of confidence. I believe transitioning for you should be easy as you already have the looks going for you. 

Don't be scared
Heyyyy, I may not be a musician but I know for a fact that trans women can have beautiful voices (indistinguishable from cis women). Just be yourself, thats all that rly matters.
There are lots of transgender musicians, and famous singers like Kim Petras.  Being authentic liberates you in so many ways... and my IT career has really taken off since I embraced my true self.  Anything new to this degree is going to make you fearful, but when you embrace who you are without reservation, then anything becomes possible!
This is kind of eerie to me because you look like a much younger version of my aunt. I mean no offense by this but it’s like you’re her clone.
you remind me so much of Allison Argent from teen wolf, you're so pwetty <3 I wanna look this amazing one day
In the same exact boat as you. Hang strong ♥️
Take all the time you need! I know it can be scary to transition. And you are gorgeous, btw. 😉
I completely 100% relate. However i realized one day that i couldnt actually invision myself become a male anything but i could instead see a future for myself as a female. So i started hrt like 8 months ago and my propensity for procrastinating has almost disappeared. 


Good luck finding your future girl. 💜💙💜
Stay strong you’re gorgeous btw!
Obviously do whatever you need to for you, we all have different pathways through life. That being said, while I have experienced pushback since coming out, none of if it has been work related. In fact, as a larger group, the people I've played with, recorded with/for etc have probably been the most supportive group. Happy Pride!
Beautiful!
She’s gorgeous!!
Look at Ezra Furman. She's doing great. Or Laura Jane Grace. Music will help you spread your wings
Take the advice of an older person; disregard fear and make the leap! Follow your dreams they are greater than regret! GO! Go you! 🏳️‍⚧️
I’ve known a ton of very talented, gorgeous tramsfem musicians. Most notably in my area (Ohio) is Lisa Bella Donna. She’s a genius. Fuck the music scene that’s too full of toxic masculinity and gross men gatekeeping. It’s up to us to change it. I personally only felt comfortable coming out as non-binary because I was involved in the queer music scene and was encouraged to come out by other musicians.
Can't wait to see a beautiful transgender woman take the music industry by storm!! Try listening to some queer artists (""Madam"" by eyeamki changed my life) to find inspiration!! Even if you can't ever have a voice that is as high as some Afab folx or Cis women, there is a market for women with deep voices! Androgenous voices are totally awesome, too, (""Electric"" by Miki Ratsula) and there is actually a much bigger queer community in music than it seems at first glance!!! Good luck cutie!!!!
[removed]
You got this. You’ll be the next Joan Jett
cute😊❤🤗
I’m a mtf trans musician! It’s totally good actually! There’s so much extra range that you can reach with practice as a vocalist, and trans musicians usually get extra attention just based off their identity. I think people like my music for it’s merit, but it’s good to have people pay attention to you right off the bat!
That hair looks so good on you! You’re absolutely beautiful and I wish you the best 😊
there r at least a dozen of us dw
Please don't be afraid to be a trans musician, you look cool as hell and trans representation is needed
you’re beautiful!!!
You are so pretty :0
U look like makoto from persona 5!
you look great girl!
Same here, I want to be a musician but I'm ftm, I personally don't think it's going to matter that I'm trans, and either way I try to not worry about that because music is everything for me, and if I start thinking about not transitioning because of my music, I think I'll start feeling more negatively about my music, and that's the last thing I want.
Arca, SOPHIE (whilst she was still alive), Galen Tipton, Lotic, Angel Ho, Tami T, bottoms, Fire-Toolz, Machine Girl, Kim Petras, Lyra Pramuk, Yves Tumor, or Swan Meat,  - are all amazing trans fem or non binary/genderqueer musicians of varying amounts of fame.  

this basically just turned into a list of recommendations for trans musicians but there are honestly so many amazing trans artists out there and that’s not to say anxieties aren’t valid but i think you will find the place and scene you are comfortable in, it might take some time but the spaces exist!!
That really should not hold you back. As a musician myself I needed to be absolutey true to myself to be able to present myself as my  true self. If know one can that's their problem x
My first thought is that because you’re an artist/musician that it’s absolutely crucial to your craft that you are vulnerable and honest in your work, especially if you’re a solo gig or the lead musician or something. I think that trying to hide or conceal major parts about you will show up in your performance. In contrast, if you were to be your authentic self for your audience, I think that would help you to connect to each other greatly & win over more fans, whether they’re queer/trans or not. 💕
*paniccc* I LOVE YOUR HAIR STYLE I WANTTTT
Hey go for it! You'll feel better once you do and it'll be freeing :) happy pride lovely 💕
Thank you for coming out when I was able to see you are beautiful
Just look at sza she’s trans (from what google has told me) and her music career is ✨chefs kiss✨
aw thank you ☺️
As a fellow musician im glad to hear you say that :)  
my first gig is in september and i'm not sure yet if i should present femme by then. It's on a pretty big festival too :o
i feel that!! but yeah my bands instagram is @backroomportrait
Those are very inspiring words! :)
your aunt better be hot lol
THAT IS SUCH A BIG COMPLIMENT I GREW UP ON TEEN WOLF
Ew what is that comment
People dig that shit. Be yourself! I feel enabled to actually express myself and be raw/real. I’m in the folk/punk scene too so that helps.
I wouldn’t say my aunt is hot because that’s weird, but in her city in Brasil she was Queen of Carnival a couple of times.
sowwy, for some reason it didn't show me your comment until just now (thanks, reddit) but yeah, I always loved Allison so much, she was the mvp of teen wolf to me
Thats awesome! :D

Still dealing with my depression but good things are happening. I got my new prosthetic leg and my new apartment in NYC. My rent is insanely cheap, less than 400 a month!
The pain was worth it. I jumped in front of a train with all intention of never seeing another day. Waking up from a coma 2 weeks later was surreal. It taught me to be my true self with no care about what other people think. Love yourself no matter what.

So you say that we were raised in a household with manners and respect and it shows? Is that an insult or a compliment.
People are downvoting you because of how you worded it. It comes off as kinda creepy or you were hitting on OP or something. If you were trying to offer support you should lead with that, not saying you REALLY wanna hear more. And not sure about most people, but I find 👉👈 a bit weird usually, it doesn't really get across good emotions. Also how is it bad to not wanna track dirt through your house??
OP here. There is nothing weird about what they are asking. Let's stay positive and supportive.
Choice of insult is weird but take my upvote. Some people are absolutely terrible about injecting negativity where none was meant aren't they?

PS: for all you uncultured folks who don't understand the gesture portrayed by those emoji, it's a gesture many characters in anime make when they're nervous about something.
""I'd love to hear more"" is not reaching out or offering a shoulder to cry on and if you seriously don't know that that says more about you than anything else
Damn, my rent is 800 and I live in the sticks
Its good your doing well now. I am not too many months off from hrt right now just like 3 so my life is going ok, I have parents that support me and everything. I just struggle with bouts of depression and dysphoria and anxiety towards being myself publicly but I think im on a good path.
It’s a joke.
Thank you, but it’s too late. Mob mentality activated.

FWIW, I have experienced / am experiencing a lot of what you described in your OP, so I thought maybe we could compare notes, and support eachother.
Yeah, the “insult” is just nonsense; a joke carrying a theme about people being offended by something completely innocuous and innocent.
It says that my mind isn’t in the gutter
Either way, your wording sucks and makes you look like a weirdo, sorry for overreacting at your “joke”
Please don’t be sorry. I’m not."	p3kccf	trans	1095	0.99	2021-08-13 09:57:22

Holy cow what is your workout routine for those legs and hips?!
Thanks everyone I really appreciate all the warm comments!
Absolutely beautiful
Oh my God
Hngg
Wowowow
😍😍
Lol I’m in Southern California so very unlikely
It's warm in every western hemisphere country that actually matters.
A month before my 24th birthday
Lol I’m pretty use to that already
Tucking
Yeah that’s what most straight men tell me 😂
[removed]
I actually don’t workout I had pretty thick thighs even before starting HRT
LA has been cold and overcast lately
I just want to make sure you understand that the northern hemisphere is the one in summer right now. Right?
That's amazing! I literally wouldn't be able to tell your trans if the post didn't say it ❤️
Haha you're not wrong!
I didn’t get cold lol in case anyone was curious
Not all countries experience warm summers. That's why I said ""warm"" instead of ""in summer"".

Also, it's still spring.
Yeah, the weather cleared up for the queers! Lol! I just rode back from WeHo on my motorcycle in booty shorts
My bad it's spring for the next 2 weeks. Same thing.
Fam I was just trying to say that Canada sucks. Why did you have to be rude about it?
Are you a bad troll or something?
No, I just don't like Canada. I was admittedly very tired when I posted that first comment. I probably would have been able to formulate a better comment, but there was a lot going on.
Yeah, your original comment comes off as quite racist to me. It sounds like you’re hating on South America or something.
If I had formulated it better, it wouldn't have. I forgot how far south Argentina and Chile are.

I don't hate South America. Every South American I've met has been the bee's knees. They have good food and good people, which are the only two qualifications I have for liking a country. Canada has none of that. They have Corner Gas, Kids in the Hall, and a good looking president who said Canada has no core identity. I swooned when I found out he said that 😍😍😍"	by5p3f	trans	1038	0.99	2019-06-08 08:01:33
The issue with transphobia all ove reddit	"TW:Transphobia, plotted murder, slurs, trans suicide

I hate the fact rhat literally everywhere on reddit that isnt an lgbtq+ space itd so toxic against trans and gay people, there was a post about a load of adults plotting to kill q trans kid and someones reply to a validly concerned person was ""why are people so sensitive lately get a grip lol"" and i just feel disgusted. On a smaller scale, this morning i got a comment on some deltarune pride art I'd made basically saying ""so this game is all about sexuality now?"" And the characters i drew were all queer with just one of their identities uncomfirmed and its just mind-boggling how they describe how they are homophobic and transphobic and then say they dont want to be accused of being such just cause they dont agree with the 'lgbtq+ ideology' and i just feel horrendous."	"Yeah, it's pretty rough out there. If you want to share art/fandom stuff, then tumblr might be good. (OK, that's a queer space too, something like 60% of users). They're nice over there though
I posted a picture of Hunter Schafer and the first comment I got was ""That's a man"". I fucking hate people.
Every time when people mention a gay ship people down vote it and are like ""I don't like this ship"" or ""not my cup of tea"" and all that shit.
But they would never say shit like this with straight ships. It's so annoying.

Last time I called somebody out as homophobe and they legit told ""my cousin is gay i cant be homophobic""

Every time when I think twitter is bad, reddit wins. 

Somebody said it already but tumblr really is the best platform for this
and they invade our spaces too. i made a post on r/pronounsdressingroom and the second comment i got was someone saying “you people need some serious help.” i just told them “go home.” i’m so fucking tired
That plotted murder thing is so awful. I refused to read any comments
I’ve just come to expect people to be shitty, and act cautious accordingly.
I get the feeling that society in general has become more tolerant, but the phobic people have become a lot more hateful and nasty.
Lmfao people who are so sensitive about THE BIG BAD LGBT in deltarune is hilarious. Toby Fox literally corrected someone referring Kris as “He”. His canonically Non-Binary. 

Plus almost all of gaming is homophobic sadly. After all a gamer’s favorite mantra is “you wouldn’t survive in a MW2 lobby” wow bro, slurs and yelling, I face that in TF2 and CSGO every single day. If the only insult you can come up with are low blow personal insults, you have no right to say that phrase.
I lot of communities on Reddit are hostile to trans people, game related subreddits seem to be worse. But if it helps at all, it's certainly not the case that all non-lgbt-focused subreddits are hostile. 

In my experience a lot of hobby subreddits are pretty accepting or at least neutral. I've seen trans or queer related content in /r/unixporn, /r/conlangs, /r/vexillology, /r/baduk, /r/mechanicalkeyboards, and probably other subs as well. Typically people are generally accepting and kind, with a few bad comments that get plenty of downvotes.
This shit literally makes me depressed.
Yeah ive found that people on this platform are quite hostile towards trans people outside of spaces like these. Ive found so many hate comments against us. Reddit does nothing to stop the blatant transphobia and homophobia on this site.
they literally posted a plan for murder and nobody batted an eye? that’s fucked up.
especially r/cringetopia, that place is a shithole.
It's in some lgbt spaces too.  


TERFs regularly troll the posts in my country's subreddit. Tried bringing it up with the cis shit exclu mod but he just said ""It's not against the rules"".
Toby literally has gay characters and confirmed Kris uses they/them only (not cuz they are meant to be us- he corrected someone on Kris's pronouns before)
Reddit is nothing but transphobia.
WTF???!! a plot to kill a trans kid????!!
I'm sorry to see and hear this in many places. I do know that most pagan communities are very trans inclusive as well, and some more niche communities out there I'm sure are inclusive. But in general, yes I've seen a lot of communities are ignorant on the subject at best.
Reddit is a cesspool.
we need to become militant with the report button. bother mods incessantly (i know its a shot in the dark, you don’t need to tell me)
Bigots always have an excuse loaded why they are the victim in their choice to act openly bigoted toward marginalized peoples. In fact, to the point, it's how you identify them.

Anyone who *just* says something ignorant is likely just ignorant and not a bigot. Anyone who claps back with how actually you having an opinion about their opinion is the real bigotry. Not the discriminatory laws, not the suicide campaigns, not the beatings in the streets, not the sexual assault while yelling slurs. 

That's how you know you have a bigot and not just someone who's clueless. They are openly declaring that someone potentially murdering you is less of a problem to society than you being allowed to have an opinion about their opinion.
deltarune fans are accepting of lgbtq identities in my experience but there's always ""that guy""
To reduce a bit the negativity feel out there, remember they are a vocal minority.
When exploring nice there will be many indifferent of even sororities printed since you, loudly transphobic people barely exist and know not to give their opinion in public places like work and such ✨❤️
My TKD/Judo grandmaster used to say 'empty can rattle.'  Meaning that people with nothing intelligent or constructive to say can't seem to shut the fuck up.

I usually bark back at these folks not because it's a constructive argument but to give them the impression that starting this shit in meatspace may not go the way they hope for it to, and that at least some of us *won't* curl up into a ball and start crying but in fact may get super-duper extra with them.  I have cleansed my profile of any pictoral references to me specifically so they won't know which of us to avoid starting shit with.

I hate that the online space I've spent 30 years in, and helping cultivate access to as an IT technician and programmer, has turned into a cesspool of stupid assholes but all I can do is make the assholes uncomfortable while I'm here.
got banned from a subreddit for reporting transphobic comments to a mod. I wasn't even aggressive about it. just said 'hey as a trans guy these comments are pretty offensive because everyone's saying this trans guy is a woman because he gave birth'.
Well, there was just a few swipes upwards the question ""What is a adult problem no one prepared you for?"" (Ore so) under the r/AskReddit sub with a comment that which told something like ""that even most adults have the mind of a teen which makes it hard to argue with fact's""
Yeah it's pretty awful how many bigots there are on here, not surprised but it sucks, also I can't believe they were plotting to kill a trans Kid. That's horrible
agreed! a subreddit I used to enjoy, r/tumblrinaction has become so transphobic, like that's all they do now, and I'm genuinely confused what happened
I haven't found any transphobia or other discrimination in r/musicals, but musicals aren't for everyone and that's cool too, I on the other hand am obsessed
Yeah. I know i (a queer trans guy ) used to call myself gay and went on one gay subreddit with just a bunch of memes for gay men and made one comment on a shit post meme about it being inclusive to all men and got called homophobic by a cis gay men for being ""a woman calling herself gay to trick gay men into being straight"" . Was told to kill myself and he stalked my account and sent violent threats when i tried turning to trans spaces for emotional support until i deleted the account that i had been using for over a year. 

When the queer spaces arent even safe for queer people you know there is a problem. I literally changed my sexuality label to try to keep cis gay men from getting upset . i have enough shit going on. I dont need to be called homophobic for just existing.
I corrected a celebrities pronouns on reddit, and people downvoted me for it lol.
r/mademesmile, mademecry, and wholesome are good ones. I haven’t ever experienced any lgbtqphobic stuff on those subreddits.
Oddly enough one sub that I have found non transphobic that isnt a trans sub is r/SquaredCircle it is a wrestling sub that is pretty supportive of trans peolple.
The only non lgbt subreddit I’ve seen that’s mostly trans positive is r/196 but they often have a lot of femboy content to
I don't think I've come across any transphobia--maybe one time ever on reddit and I spend like an hour a day here.

Does anyone know how the algorithms work and why some people see so much trans hate and I've only seen the trans positive?
I'm all for murder

But why discriminate?

^ and even if some transphobes/homophobes show up there. Tumblrs 2 big powerhouses, pukicho and gaud will scare them off
Yeah that could be good thanks!
People make jokes about Tumblr “being a hellhole” but it’s really not that bad
tumblr was shown to be the queerest place on the internet, and you can basically bite back as hard as you want there as well
Checked their account, it seems like theyre a creep who’s obsessed with celebrity womens breasts. Theyre whole account is about celebrity boobs. Or “bags” as they call them. Definitely not worth the argument, seems like a gross perv misogynist who will never change. I hate how they get into every space its so tiring
Christ thats not great
At this level these people are just deranged psychopaths
That logic cracks me up everytime.

You can be gay and homophobic. Trans and transphobic. Black and racist. Just because you have someone related to you that identifies as a certain identity, Does not mean you can’t be biased towards hat identity
Yeah that really sucks, i didnt so much get this on my post though luckily, it was mostly people debating over whether susie is lesbian bi or ace cause i headcanoned them as lesbian in my art and eugh
There are plenty of ships that aren't my cup of tea but I'll still read them if they are written well
Yeah theres even a comment on this post from some conservative so thats fun
Every time I go to r/neopronouns, I get comments from raiders telling me to get a life and that i’m pathetic.
Out of the topic but I love your pfp lol
Yeah it was just, terrifying
Thats fair enough
That makes alot of sense really
I know right? Its just so annoying how they cant see how ridiculous they sound
I know it probably doesn't mean anything to you, but I would like to say that the Fire Emblem community is very accepting of LGBTQ+ fans, ships, and everything else. You'll find some rotten eggs like you would anywhere else, but I've found it be a very welcoming community

Edit: I would like to specify that the primary place I go to on Reddit is r/feheroes which is the sub for the mobile game, but most of the fan artists end up there anyhow
I love the ""you'd never survive in a \[INSERT FPS NAME HERE\] lobby"" meme because it speaks to how incredibly, ridiculously cushy the speaker's life is.  That's the most hardcore thing you can think of, a bunch of teenagers swearing into their headsets?  Pathetic.
Just wanna add r/ProgrammerHumor is relatively accepting as well as some of the dungeons and dragons subreddits.
what is it with transfems and linux/conlanging?
r/SubredditDrama is also pretty accepting, assuming you like dishing over petty reddit drama.
Same,,
Yeah its so just sad people should be able to be themselves
I’m literally gonna be the modern female version of Martin Luther King. Before I die I WILL change this world and how society perceives and treats us. Mark my words. I refuse to settle for that crap.
Sometimes I see posts from cringetopia from browsing popular, and it is always a cesspool. Every single time
Fun fact: it was started by some of the mods of /r/CringeAnarchy...which was banned for, among other things, transphobia and homophobia. It's no surprise that it's that way.
That sucks, its so ridiculous how people are, im sorry
I know right? And even if it wasn't confirmed i still have a right to headcanon characters? This guy just got so pissed that only when my cis friend (super supportive and nice btw) joined he finally left.
Yeah it was dreadful honestly
Yeah i used to be pagan and the religion is super accepting, im currently atheist but my mum is pagan
Yeah i love the deltarune and undertale community to bits honestly, they're such lovely well made games, i feel like most of the community is super accepting and even lgbtq themselves but like you said, there is always thay one small group in the corner who gets mad over the smallest thing lgbt in the fandom
that sub loves shitting on disabled/neurodivergent and trans people more than they hate tumblr culture as a whole
> has become so transphobic

It's been transphobic for years and years and years. One of few big subs I would completely consider to be a trans hate sub. It was almost exclusively full of non-binary hate years ago - that's the content that grew the sub to begin with.
I love musicals! Its good to know that thats a saferplace
Im so sorry that is absolutely dreadful, i hope things are going better now
Thats good!
Oh thatd nice!
And chasers
I've only been actually active for 2 days and I've seen it non-stop
Don't be for murder
You had me .. until the end. Of course you wanna “have fun” with a Trans-Woman… but if that’s ALL you want and don’t ever plan on considering bonding to that person BCUZ of their identity.. give up. All I can say is dare to be different. We have enough chasers already.
uhhhh, ok?
Honestly, you sound just like other chasers I've turned down. You'll have better luck if you treat the transwomen and non-binary transfemme as people, and not as an experience for you to check off
Thanks for generalizing us. In our own sub. In our safe place. We appreciate that you're telling us how it really is. What we’re really thinking. You're the hero we needed today. Also, we’re glad that you find our thoughts so interesting!  
  
I'm a mod for r/Trans and a couple of other subs. The amount of shit that we stop from reaching the public is mind-boggling. We're not talking about feeling slighted because of an off-color joke, or even Dave Chappell punching down. We're talking about hate in the vilest forms and the strongest language, all delivered with the expectation that it will do serious and irreparable harm to this community.  
  
Or, it will be sexual. Posts and comments reducing us to our parts. Fetishizing and sexualizing us, othering us, using us. It's sad, degrading and maddening. I know, I know; everyone gets dick picks or whatever. No, it's not just that. It's focusing on some of the very things that make us physically different, that we have privately fought for and against our entire lives.  
  
I can't get into details, though I'm sure you'd find it interesting, as it would violate our Rule 7 (No sharing hate speech), but the struggle is actually, literally real. It's not theoretical. It's not hyperbole. It's not snowflakes melting. It's systemic, it's personal, and it's extremely specific. It's a weight on our shoulders and a target on our backs for the crime of simply existing. For wanting to be able to take a shit someplace/anyplace, for having long or short hair, for smiling at the wrong person, for wanting to go on a date and to not die alone.  
  
This is only my opinion; I'm not speaking for the other mods.
I wouldn't say it's about taking a joke. Most cis people's jokes about trans people are very much rooted in transphobia. It's about people's ""jokes"" not being discriminatory. You have no idea how hard it is for us. I know a few trans people who do, in fact, joke about trans people themselves, but the thing is, *they've actually got good intentions*. I do appreciate you wanting to learn more, though. Maybe watch your words next time?

(And please, anyone else reading this, keep it civil.)
> the idea that jokes about trans people promotes violence is incredibly off the mark to me

Where’s the humor in a joke about wanting to kill trans people? Am I supposed to laugh at it?

> Straight people are not out hunting trans or gay people, at least not where I'm from. All the straight people I know honestly don't care what you do with your life, just as long as you leave them alone.

People who frame this in terms of “not caring what you do with your life” don’t recognize trans people for what they are, or they wouldn’t be framing it that way. Where I live they are out to get gay and trans people and many of my friends have learned that firsthand. And relearned it. And relearned it.

> The internet is a tough place regardless of who you are. Every walk of life gets the most horrific shit thrown their way […] but its not inclusive to any particular groups of people.

Which is why there are support groups and suicide hotlines for cisstraight people too.

> You think that you are becoming the person you were born to be, and everybody else thinks its crazy to start chopping off body parts to do that. Especially when it comes to chopping of your own penis. That is just something most straight people, including myself, will never fully rationalize. 

And we’re supposed to tolerate it when they spread this idea and claim they know better?

> It's the one thing that really bothers me about the trans community, you don't allow anybody to have their own thoughts about the matter without thinking they are a nazi who deserves death. 

Their own “thoughts” on whether we exist or not, something we literally have direct experience of and medical evidence for, is not a debate. Framing it as some subjective everybody-has-their-own-opinion matter is ridiculous as is suggesting *we’re* somehow intolerant of *them* for not having it.

> you guy's would be a lot more accepted into society if you lightened up and just started joking around with the rest of us.

Bullshit. As if that’s ever worked for any group of people. You just want license to joke about us under the guise of harmless fun.
Oh we'd all just be accepted if we'd all just join in on the jokes about murdering and abusing us. Ya know, the things that CisHets make so many of us fear happening on a daily fucking basis
The thing about murdering a trans kid was serious, and us being trans isn't your science project dude! We're real people with real lives, and of course im not gonna let someone tell me im a woman? That doesnt make them a nazi or that i think they should die? Thats me simply saying how its wrong of them to be discriminatory. And nobodys cutting off their dick that'd lead to a shit ton of medical issues. Please leave the trans subreddit because lets be real here theres like 1 trans person that'll appreciate what you have to say.
Grow up and get off the Internet
If you're against two people being in love because they're both the same gender or someone being a woman because they were born biologically male, you don't cone from reason, you come from hate
MMMMM PRAISE OUR SAVIORS PUKICHO AND GAUD
No worries bud
Hellhole (affectionate)
Now that’s just ableist to psychopaths. Psychopaths aren’t inherently evil— these “people”, these transphobes, are evil af.
Ppl that think transphobic trans ppl don’t exist need look no further then r/transmedical it’s a dumpster fire
Right? This is ridiculous. They really think it's a excuse for being rude.
Yeah I get that. Especially all the debates under a great artwork is annoying. Like, just enjoy the art with the headcanon, people!
I'll never understand why people lose their shit about neopronouns. I've got like four trans friends (I'm also trans) and they all unanimously agree with each other that ""Neopronouns are a joke and people who use them are mentally ill"".

Idk maybe I just am too tolerant or something but isn't it a matter of respect? Like if someone says politely ""hey I go by x/y, can you use that from now on"" how is that not a matter of respect? 

Like it's two words, why are we drawing the line here? Why are we being tricked into hating each other when the actual enemies are standing right in front of us? Why can't we have decency and respect for our fellow humans?

I get why people don't, but it's still so fucked up.
You'll always be valid no matter what pronouns you use, it can be hard but you're stronger and you can get by that, they're the miserable ones spending all their spare time saying things that'll never make you change in reality.
Oh that's great! I'm a fire emblem fan but I didn't know

That actually makes me very happy considering the rocky road that FE has with lgbt options
Yeah, I know not all communities are shitty. I’m on r/SSBM and any case of people being queerphobic or bigoted in general are downvoted and laughed at. The only case you’d see shitty Melee and Project + players are on twitter and it’s usually the meme tier Spaces players
Oh thats nice!
Even then all they can think of are white nerds saying the N word and homophobic slurs. Have you seen black folk roast people in Black ops 2? They’ll rip INTO YOU and the only slur they’d say is their reclaimed n word (I think that’s the PC way of referring to it right?)
I experienced like almost all FPS players are toxic. The games are somewhat intrinsicly toxic, so their players.
And somehow some games like CoD are especionally prone to this lol
The DnD ones have been getting slammed in with transphobes too, and it sucks, they just play more coy there.
Tbh I have no idea, lol. What I like about those things has nothing to do with transness inherently, although I do let my trans experience inform my conlanging (not a fan of gender-based pronouns, I like to do a generic personal pronoun or do pronouns based on level of respect or other things).

I've been using linux since 2009, a decade before I came out to myself. I like it because it's open and I can customize it and learn what it's doing under the hood. Plus microsoft is just creepy.

And I've always liked languages and grammar, and the theory of grammar. Conlanging is a great way to explore the underlying systems that human communication emerges from.

Neither of these things has anything to do with being a trans girl, but there do seem to be a lot of us in those spaces for some reason.
You go girl. The world might be shitty today but everyone has a voice and I love that you're planning to use yours in such a great way
I just got banned from there for saying “trans women exist” and “this subreddit has a transphobia problem”
Yeah like how can the homophobes be fans of the series if literally everyone important is gay except the goats and the skeleton
If anything I’ve seen a couple of very progressive post and cute couples being themselves 🥰
Dang!!!!  That's a huge bummer!!  I'm so sorry you've seen so much negativity about it! Any ideas on why some people will see so much and others don't see any of it?
[removed]
I said the same thing when I read it 😂😂😂
\^yep. I’m not averse to edgy jokes about trans people - I make them constantly - but unlike most cis people the jokes I make reflect an actual understanding of trans people and not r/onejoke shit.
I feel like its ok to make trans jokes if you have a trans friend who says its cool and you make sure the trans people you're around are comfortable with the jokes or if you are trans yourself
[removed]
Could you explain why?  


I don't mean to strike a nerve or anything; I get It's a touchy subject.
lmao
That and r/truscum 

(They're definitely aphobic too, given that I saw a poll on their subreddit claiming that asexual people don't deserve to be part of the LGBTQ+ community, when they absolutely should)
Confused on what your trying to say here, snd the community you tagged is coming up as doesn’t exist
Oh yeah transmed is dreadful
Should not have clicked that. Definitely shouldn't have clicked that. 

I'm absolutely sick of people like that, as a non-binary person who's tried for the last 3-4 years to be a ""normal"" trans person. I hated myself for so long just because I knew I wasn't a woman, but I couldn't be myself as a man no matter how much I tried. I mean seriously, I've had people try to argue I'm not trans just because I don't have voice dysphoria. Transphobic idiots are still transphobic idiots, even if they're also trans.
It all just feels really demotivating and i have to try and reply nicely cause i dont want to be a dick but i struggle with emotions and i end up feeling real messy over it nd yeah
I'm not trans, nor do I use neopronouns, but I think a lot of people are disillusioned by the more out-there neopronouns and feel like it delegitimizes their own struggle for rights. They feel that their use of ""conventional"" alternative pronouns would be more widely accepted if there weren't people out there in their same community actively feeding the transphobes more ammo for their ""made-up words/attack helicopter"" strawman argument. It's not my place to really comment on the validity or lack thereof, but I sort of see where people on both sides are coming from.
Those people are playing the optics game. As a queer person, you NEVER want to play the optics game. There's absolutely no reason, Conservatives will never take the more progressive side until ALL of their stupid, made-up talking points have been dead for a couple years and some of them never will.

They're just making a bad assessment in how valuable optics are. That's why TERFs have been claiming lately that it's a slur, because they care about their optics.
I used to be horrible to a friend of mine who used xenopronouns (i think thats what its called?) And I've always felt terrible since, but luckily I've been shown why its valid and we're still friends, im glad i changed before i ruined one of my best friendships
Thank you.
Most of the time, we just end up complaining about how half-assed the developers are with those same options. They've definitely come a long way though!
Thats so nice ill definitely join thoee subreddits!
Yeah it sucks alot, but i feel there are certain subreddits where alot of mods or lgbtq+ and that matters alot, but even then I've had a few pretty bad comments under this post, so im not exactly sure
LOL you surely had enough energy to express your sexual interest in us tho. I’m not surprised. In my head you no different than the millions of other men out there.

Theres is little to no reason to hate lgbtq+ people, we're just people and just want to be us without being cut up to identity politics. There's plenty of science backing us up, we just want to be people like anyone else, except some woman like woman, some guys like guys, some guys aren't guys, some woman aren't woman.
Ide like to believe it’s just a bunch of edgy teens and some mentally ill adults who don’t realize what they’re doing is genuinely wrong but idk it’s prolly a bit too hopeful
Had to edit it because transmedicalists and transmedicalist didn’t work
/r/Truscum is the sub y'all are looking for
It’s even worse than truescum imo cause atleast the ppl there have an idea that they’re assholes cause they’ve been shunned by the general community which is a pretty challenging feat
We’ve had the exact same experience! Like I can say hands down that I’m not a woman. I know that for absolute sure. Being a man isn’t exactly my cup of tea either though… I tried for a while, fully socially transitioned with some people I trusted, but eventually just had to admit that I was neither man nor woman. Just me.
That is very much an accurate take. I'll admit I have felt disappointment in neopronouns at times in the past and it did take me a bit to fully grasp the complexity and reasoning around Neopronouns, and I can certainly see why it would feel like it is delegitimizing the LGBTQ+ movement.

A lot of it does stem from the strawman that every Neopronoun user is some rage obsessed child changing their gender as often as they blink, and how that strawman reflects on the community as a whole. It's unfortunate, but I've come to the personal conclusion I would rather be supportive of than ignorant, especially when the overall concept between two is the same, whereas I am the less extreme example.
This is one of things we can learn from ethnic minorities: respectability politics never works.  It doesn't matter how you ""tone things down"" or how ""reasonable"" you try to appear, it'll always be seen as unreasonable and an affront to ""decency.""  You win by not playing the game.

I agree, there is little reason to hate your community; though, I do understand why I am considered hateful.

To be completely honest with you, I don’t believe in transgenderism; I also believe in traditional marriage.

But I sympathise with you because I get how tough it feels to have your own identity debated; because for you, it’s not just an opinion—it’s your life too.

You do you; don’t listen to people like me if it makes you truly happy.
Thanks. And Jesus that thread. My mind is blown, like doctor strange when the ancient one showed him the mystic world
Is this a good or bad sub
Oh yeah i hate truscum mainly cause i mean who cares if someones gonna use star pronouns, gender literally barely makes sense its hanging on by one mental thread and we have such small understanding of it, so people can identify however the hell they want, its not hurting anyone and its making them happier so yeah
Exactly! I remember when I first started socially transitioning, I had an incident in PE that was just caused a lightbulb go off in my head. I had just recently cut my hair to shoulder length and tried to lower my voice range, so someone I didn't know very well in that class, who's actually now my friend, assumed I was a boy, and actually brought it up in a different class later on. I guess that was the first time someone had actually unironically thought I was a boy, and it made me so *uncomfortable* I can't even explain it. It just really confused me, because I've always been fine with he/him pronouns for the most part, I just don't want to be a man. 

I guess it's exactly how you said it: I don't want to be a man or a woman, I just want to be me.
Your insults aren't even insults they're juat fractured sentences that have been put together by a child
Get out of trans safe spaces and touch some grass!
While you're one of the calmest people ive talked to and i respect that, its not transgenderism or anything, we aren't some kind of ideology or religion, we're just transgender.
Yea I don’t get how people so negatively impacted by the hate that follows them everywhere would dedicate a group to nothing but hating on subreddits and people who’s general gist is just “play nice, we deal with enough already”

It doesn’t make sense. I’ve never understand how an oppressed group can oppress someone else, or a part of themselves.
I am literally gay and a minor
Your dads under grass in a grave you sound like a drunken child
Hate has no need for logic, just a strong sense of emotion a tad bit of confusion and a complete unwavering unwillingness to consider other points of view
Survival instinct. Individuals seek the protection of groups, and sometimes that means trying to appeal to the people who hate you by throwing your comrades under the bus to show the bigots that you're ""one of the good ones"".

It never works, because hate isn't based on rationality, but that doesn't keep people from trying.

According to my LGBTQ+ Mom I want to be 'Trans' because I want to fit in.	"I came out to my mom as Trans she is a lesbian and has attended every pride march in NYC for the past 5 years. She said I'm only transitioning because I want to fit in with the gays also she said I'm taking my transition too fast and I need to slow down. I am speechless, I thought coming out to her was gonna go better than this.

Update: Just want to thank you all for the support, so my Mom may be a TERF.... what a wild year its been."	"Being trans makes it so much harder to fit in wtf is she on about 😭
Flip the script and tell her she just a lesbian who wants to fit in and she should slow down and be straight. 😈
Wow! Prep the ""Hello, my name is Gatekeeper"" name tag!
Ah yes, because being trans has no societal downsides whatsoever. Great thinking, mum!

I'm sorry she's not supportive. :(

Hopefully she comes around.

At any rate, you know you're valid even if she's struggling with it.
Fitting in? Being trans is the polar opposite of “fitting in”! There is maybe 1 or 2 openly trans students for every high school (I went 4, never went to the same school more than a year. So I’m talking from my experience.)
Yup! Cause we love painting a HUGE target on our back and going through hell cause we wanna just vibe with the group :)

I'm so sorry you have to deal with this, sending hugs ❤️
Ah she’s cool with others being gay and trans but the second her kid comes out it’s not real.  I think they call these people “full of shit”.
I used to think this about myself… *two years ago* lmao and I now know how socially outcasting being trans can be. The funny thing here is that I still want to be trans and I still want to be on exogenous hormones for the rest of my life.
i don’t understand why people think that people are trans to “fit in” when there’s other groups of people that are easier to fit in with that don’t come with systemic oppression, like if i wanted to fit in i’d join a club
I wish I could say that I was surprised. Aside from the not-so-subtle TERFyness, the idea that someone would willingly upend their entire life just to be one of the cool kids is ridiculous.
Ouch. Most likely she will come around if you're patient. See if she's supportive of social transition to start.
Even if you're really young, you should have a chance to try out any gender or expression. Maybe it will be perfect and euphoric, maybe it will be meh, maybe you'll decide you prefer to go back. One way or another, she should take you seriously.
Yup, I’m trans cause I just wanted to ball with the bros 😂… I can’t understand the rational with this one.
I hope she comes around for ya love ❤️
There was a study that came out that proved that (I forgot the term) just because you are young and/or have a lot of peers around you that are trans or LGBT doesn't mean you'll be trans for that reason only. Like if all your peers are queer doesn't mean you will be, and if you are it's not because of everyone else.

Also I'm sure she doesn't understand how hard it is to be trans and you can definitely be ostracized within society for being trans. She should somewhat understand, being gay herself.
""You're only trans because it's trendy"" dear lawd those people have no idea, and they're part of why it's so hard to be trans.
She’s the one who needs to slow down
Sounds like your mom could do with going to therapy.

It might have been surprising to HER, too fast for HER, but she hasn't been living with it the way you have, and she isn't you.

The only timeline that matters is your own. Her job is simply to love and support you along the way as best she can. If for some reason she can't do that, and she wants to be a good parent, she should get help processing this change on her own rather than putting her own insecurity and attachment to your AGAB back on you.
Fit in with what ?  This can be a very long and lonely journey
Wouldn’t it be easier to join a sports team to fit in?
Never underestimate the power of the lizard brain to be offensive when those close to you are involved…. She’s a Mom first, and then a lesbian, then a member of the community.  She’ll get there, she just has some mental gymnastics to do also.
this is something that all transphobes-whether they're straight or queer-LOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOVE to spew out. 'no no no you aren't REALLY trans those nasty transes are just trying to convince you that you are, no one is actually trans it's all an evil plot-' and shit about brainwashing and grooming and whatthefuckever. 

because it's the same thing that bigots always think: a marginalized identity becoming slightly more accepted in society means that, clearly, people in that marginalized identity are invading and taking things over, all because they're \*slightly\* more visible than they were. that's also where the whole 'THE TRANSES ARE GROOMING KIDS' things come from; they take the very real statistic of more people openly being trans \*because\* of more widespread acceptance and a slight decrease in violent transphobia being the norm and twist it to say 'no one identified as trans before september of 1987'. 

it's also not shocking for an older lesbian to not be okay with trans people. not exactly unusual as a phenomenon for older gay people (both men and women) to not be cool with that. they see it in part as a threat to their status as being more accepted in society.

cause everyone wants to punch down. 

i'm sorry she's pulling this crap. you'll be alright.
Yeah my mom was always open about gayness but it went to shit when I came out as trans. It really sucks that your mom said that, it's really uneducated and low key transphobic.
That was my dad when i originally thought i was trans. Worked though i just pushed off those feelings and continued acting as a boy for about another year
Gatekeeping, thy name is mother
My mother said this to me as well, although she was just implying it would help me ""fit in"" with my male friends and at work. It wouldn't? I was actually very afraid about the consequences for my social life and career.
If you wanted to fit in with the gays…wouldn’t you just be gay? I’m sorry that really sucks, I think you just have to be persistent that you are trans and it’s not a phase or you trying to “fit in”. Don’t let her forget about it cause after I came out it was never talked about for another 3 years. Keep bringing it up and educating her. It’s going to be hard and your mam should just believe you but just keep pushing and hopefully things will work out for you :)
Uhhhh as a trans person I would love to be Cis to fit in
Here’s what I would tell your mom if I were her friend: “OP is just about at the age when the decisions you make now set the tone for your entire adult relationship. If you want to be someone OP actually tells things to, and someone who OP voluntarily spends time with, cut the terf shit, say you’re happy for them, and drop it. You may have qualms or worries about OP being trans but you are 0% in a position to actually dissuade them from anything. But you are very much in a position to burn down your relationship with your kid, which is what is going to happen if you don’t learn to process those complicated feelings *elsewhere* and leave your kid out of it.”

Feel free to repurpose any of that when talking to your mom, if it helps. She’s blowing it and needs some perspective.
HAHAHAHAHAHSHAHAHAH “fit in” that’s funny. pfft- “fit in”
sadly some people of the LGBTQ community are transphobic, Im sorry you had to go through that and I wish you well
This is major TERF red-flags and I hope you are okay 💖 sending love
Ngl if you really wanted to fit in, you would have just said that you're bisexual
Terfs are fake LBGTQ so if she says anything like this again tell her she's lost her gay card.
I’m sorry friend, you’re very valid and don’t let anyone tell you otherwise, lgbt or not!!
how the fuck can someone be lgbt and unsupportive? that’s kinda hypocritical of her
Wow. That’s rough. Having an OG TERF as a mom. That’s sucks.
[removed]
There was this thing all over the news about a les couple who adopted a kid the kid came out trans and they tried to take the kid away because they thought they were forcing the idea on the kid 

She's only protecting you please take it slower so no one thinks it's what happened before go through all the necessary things to make sure those are your true feelings incase some wack nut thinks the same to you like that one kid
Ah yes of course. Wanting to fit in with a minority that keeps facing hate and discrimination constantly. Totally makes sense!

Your mom is either a moron or kinda lost her objectivity due to being constantly surrounded by nothing but LGBTQ+ people.
just go slower monarch i know thats not how it should be but you can pull through
How does she think being trans will help you fit in?
tell her shes straight💀 dumbass mom
Now I gotta ask: is she projecting?
That sounds awful :( I understand how this feels because when I came out to my dad as non-binary, he said that he thought it was a trend and also said that he thought I was only saying this because of of my friends (only two of which are part of the community) and because of the media
oh yeah, cause being trans is really good for fitting in. definitely doesn't ostracise you. no way haha    /s

hope she comes round. good luck!
[deleted]
trans to fit in?! I'm sorry but that doesn't check out- your mom needs a brain check coz if she should know anything it's that being lgbt makes everything harder to fit in. sorry you have to deal with that bs
What is a TERF?
God’s above I’m so sorry
This is why I always offer to be replacement mum for kids that have garbage parents.
my god that's one i wouldn't expect
Tell her that being trans isn’t a choice, because no one would choose to suffer, and always remember that it’s okay to be yourself
Tbh I wish I knew but I havent lived with her for almost 4 years
Are you british? Jw
I don't even fit in my clothes!
I hope so too, decided to come out after a few months of silence! At this point theres no way I'm not Trans, and theres nothing she can say to change my mind.
I really wish someone would literally say this to her like for real.
You have no idea how trans people work, or how transitioning for teens works, or even what’s required to get to the point of being prescribed medical intervention.

Your “realism” is thinly veiled transphobia and is worth less than the electricity my phone used to display your message.
Im a grown woman, im 22 years old im confident in my ability to make my decisions and I live on my own I think oll be alright.
No one should be forced to be uncomfortable for the sake of appeasing bigots.  This is bad advice.
Incorrect.
Idk what that means?
Don’t mean to be rude but :s how does help OP 😖
Sounds like your mom is a terf
Nah, Australian (Sydney)
I love your strength!
From what I've seen in the comments OP is 22 (said by OP or I can't rember what I just saw)
That's great didn't know your an adult

Egg guy is ally	"I always get my eggs from the same guy at my local farmer’s market. This weekend I was wearing my ballcap with the original pride flag embroidered on the front, and he remarked that he forgot to put “his flags” up. I gathered based on context clues that he meant the pride flags he usually has on his truck. I made small talk, telling him about where I’d gotten the hat, and he replied by telling me he really cares about putting up a pride flag because he has a trans child 🥹

I am trans/non-binary but generally get read as a cis woman. I didn’t come out to him in that moment but it felt so great to hear this older farmer casually bring up his trans kid. 

My breakfasts are tasting even better now 😌"	"egg guy sounds awesome
I love egg guy
W moment egg man! 💖🌸🏳️‍⚧️
that's pretty cute and comical for sure
Egg man's child was an egg.
When the egg hatches, they'll be more than an ally. At least that's what the title made me think
hehehehehehe egg
It's very fitting that a dude who takes care of eggs is a trans ally lol. But yeah he sounds like a lovely guy

I just had a wholesome experience with the egg guy at my local farmer's market this weekend! He has a trans child, too, and he seems really lovely and supportive.

...Wait are you me?

For some reason I imagine [this](https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/can-i-offer-you-a-nice-egg-in-this-trying-time)
He is the egg man.

As a former egg myself I really love that it was an egg guy specifically. I love older allies. They give me hope that not all of this generation is having to push through the hate spread by the past generations
W egg man
w moment for this egg man
I don’t even eat eggs but I love your egg guy
Wholesome. 

Just like those eggs!
That's awesome. And a true ally. Incidentally, I first read egg guy as the trans term
Lol not where I thought this was going but ❤️
Egg guy is awesome!

Makes me think of the egg man from pink flamingos

how do you always find me
If his kid is the one who's trans, doesn't that technically make him the chicken?
My faith in my community is restored!

(i just read comments on trans subreddits and i see you a lot on here)

I’m really glad you had a good time!  Also your outfit is super cute also also happy cake day!

Yay!. I hope that you had a fantastic day ^u^. Your fashion sense is impeccable btw :D
I love the brandishing of the pentagram with the cross! Definitely badass with such a great goth/punky outfit. You’re rocking the drip, girl!

I'm so happy for you that you decided to take the internal challenge and own it. I know it can be scary hun! But you did it and took the courage and confidence  inside of yourself and showed everyone how awesome you are. And your really cute too. You should always choose the tougher road and use your self confidence whenever you can, because like any thing else it's a skill and the more you use it the better you get at summoning it! Good job sugar!

My grocery store made rainbow bagels for pride		"RIP to the brave bagels who dyed in the line of duty this Pride 😭
Looks super yucky lol but I love them for doing this!  How did it taste?
I feel like the dye will run and whoever eats this will look like a depressed clown after
r/therewasanattempt
Doesn't look very appetizing, honestly.
Looks like it would taste so artificial. I'm getting heartburn just from looking at it.

A better idea would be rainbow pattern sprinkles for the coloring.
RAINBOW BAGELS
gaygels? yeah i tried.
I love all of these people bashing the way they look. We have a lot of places here in New Jersey that do these every year. It’s literally just a plain bagel! Do not put sprinkles or icing on my bagel please it’s bread not a cake 😭 and it looks so much more fun when you cut it open :)
*sigh*

r/dontputyourdickinthat
Presentation needs work, but they're at least trying.
mmmm bade gul
Well they tried. I hope it at least tasted good
looks like it's made of play dough xD
was this specifically for pride? the grocery store i used to work at sold these year-round
My smoke shop is selling joints with rainbow filters. All proceeds ate going to the Trevor project.
Thanks I hate it
It looks like the ones GE has in PA
That looks like the play dough donut homer eats to get over 300lbs
Lemme guess, Lowes Foods?
my bagel store has rainbow groceries all year long.
it looks like it's made out of playdough
Looks like a good ass donut as well
Wow. This means my grocery store celebrates pride all year. Go Tops! Yay for gay.
I love these. Great taste but bad execution.  
That being said, I feel like pastries would've fit better. Something like a pride strudel would fit the rainbow colours more.
It looks like melted crayons lol
It looks like modeling clay

They trying their best though
Hi! If you got this at a bakery section in a supermarket we have those year round available. I’ve worked at multiple bakeries and kids love them! They come frozen and we date them to put them out. They taste exactly like plain bagels, can’t taste the difference.
It's....nice that they tried? That bagel does not look good. But good on them for showing support
Im sorry but that bagel is homophobic
how brave lmao
It doesn’t look great does it
I love it, but it also looks like you'll develop an angry green alternative-personality if you eat it. 🤣
Gaygel
Wooow, i had never seen so much color in a single donut, are u sure u wanna eat it? Ur gonna be shitting and seeing color for the nest months 😮 /s
there was an attempt, and while it didn't come out great, it was wholesome nonetheless.
It’s the Superman flavored ice cream
Hope the bagel tastes better than it looks.
Gotta love Tops. 

Litterally changed the label for pride month when they sell them year round. I walk around my campus and eat them in the library purely for the second glance at the colors lmao. It's a superhero bagel imo.
it look like the leftover play-doh
It looks raw lol
Nice idea and all, looks like playdough
Looks like it's made of play doh so I don't think I'll eat that but I appreciate the gesture.
well, it was a valiant effort...
It looks so fucking disgusting but I still want one.

Help
Ok, so is this for popularity  or revenue? Do they  truly stand for LGBTQA…? Or just makin colored bagels?
Looks like I'm at grateful dead concert
Most important question... was it good?
Very ugly, but there was an attempt
I think I’ve seent those before at Wegmans or tops.
I am in the friendly (?) state of TN. They don’t even know what Pride is here and if they found out there’d be a riot in the pool hall. 😱
Yo this play dough ??
How does that meme go? ""They're a little confused, but they have the right idea,"" or something like that? :\\
Looks like playdoh!!! the attempt is nice tho
Jesus Christ that looks horrible. I'm English, I'm used to shit food. This is some next level shit.
Rainagels
This looks like a dog ate it in one bite and shit it out whole. 🤢
who gave the kids all the playdough
A for effort D- on execution
It looks like playdoh
lol it looks like play dough but ok i’ll have 4 for the road
Rainbow bagels are not a new thing. This looks fine to me
i'm a gay now
It tasted like a plain bagel. It’s just food coloring so it taste like nothing. Also I love them for doing this too
Maybe close your eyes while eating it? Though I do agree with you on its appearance. I thought it was a blend of different colored clay when I first saw it.
But that’s not any different to how I am the rest of the time!
Well I don’t look like a clown
Your poop will look like a depressed clown for sure.
Lol it’s not like they can control how it looks though, all they do it put food coloring into the batter then mix and bake it. So it will always be random pattern
It tasted like a plain bagel because the food coloring is flavorless but I understand what you mean I thought it looked appetizing.
Sprinkles actually would change the flavor, where the coloring doesn't.  

I get what you mean though.  There are ways to so this effect better.  But soo happy they did something!
RAINBOW BAGELS
Rainbow Bagels!
I love it
Yesss this!!!
Best comment right here
Bade gul
It was “good” it tasted like a regular plain bagel because food coloring is flavorless.
lol. I mean real dough is similar enough right?
Well on St. Patrick’s Day they sell Green Bagels and they don’t do that year around and they don’t sell these year around so I imagine yes it’s for pride
I like when they actually donate to a charity
No, lol. Where I live lowes is a hardware store 😂😂 I got it at giant
wait no i mean rainbow bagels
Yeah I liked it too mainly because it’s just a plain bagel. But I think like prepackaged cupcakes with rainbow icing or some thing would’ve been better
Lol yea but it’s not like they can control that, all they do it put food coloring into the batter then mix and bake it. So it will always be random pattern
It wasn’t
Yes
Lol
No it’s real dough
Bet it’s great for sandwiches.
Well I do, okay? :p
I mean you kind of CAN control how it looks.. by using an entirely different method. Don’t get me wrong it’s really nice that the grocery store is doing something for pride, but I would’ve tried to make something I’d be a bit more.. idk proud of? Nevertheless, gay bagels are gay bagels!
The entire food industry exists because people want to control what food looks like and what food tastes like.
Multiple strands of dough of different colors and then twist them together evenly. I have no idea what they tried to do here.
Understandable. I still think that using frosting or sprinkles for color would be a better choice and would probably be more eye-catching.
HELL YEAH
BAINROW GAYBELS
Ah interesting! Where I live there's a grocery store called Lowe's (not affiliated with the hardware store) and they make and sell these exact bagels haha
Awesome.
I guess so. If you’d like the taste of plain bagels then using it as a bun for a sandwich I don’t see why it would be bad
Gaygels
Why tf did you get downvoted? You are right…
True if they used white food coloring and rainbow sprinkles that would’ve been cool
Lol at first I was thinking “are there some lowes that have a grocery portion?”
It actually was affiliated: Lowes started as a grocery store, but added on a homebuilding section after WW2 which was massively successful; however, Mr. Lowe was more passionate about being a grocer, so his business partner split Lowe's the hardware store off.
Isn't that just a bunch of gay geese?
Eh, no one likes a know-it-all

I found a trans cake along with a pride one at Kroger!		"🌟🌟🌟
My local Safeways usually do too.
YESSSS! I need it!
On a diet currently and here I am staring at inclusive cake. Bet it tastes fabulous.
lmaooo i told my sis to get me the trans one for my bday
“Premier Carnival Cake Slice” 🙁
I want to get those when I come out to my mom
But that’s not the gay pride colors or the trans pride color. Gay pride rainbow consists of 6 colors that is 5 ,it’s missing purple. The trans colors are baby blue, pink and white there is no purple.. I mean if ya wanna get technical lol
[removed]
Can we share?
Oh hey it's nice to see not only I got orange when aiming for pink food! Also cool cakes
I got the pride one on a discount shelf at smiths a while ago. Definitely delicious! I now want to get a trans one though haha
Heck yes pride cake, heck yes.
nice ;3
The legend says that if you take a bit, your gender changes instantly
Ok dang Kroger look at you
yessssssssssss trans prideeeeeeeeee
Does cakes 🍰 looks good 😌
I should have said, “YUMMY!” There’s all kinds of goodness in there
Close enough, it's a cake.

today was miserable	"Today I went to a big city with some friends for the first time, however since it was pride month there were pride flags everywhere.

My friends are very edgy and so whenever we saw one they would male some snarky comment including ""that's not respectable"" and ""that's disgusting""

I wanted to scream, I wanted to tell them how violated I felt, I couldn't though because I'm still closeted towards them. The only reason I haven't come out to them is because they wouldn't understand, they would abandon me.

without them I am nothing, I have nobody, I am alone apart from immediate family.

TL;DR - my friends are edgy"	"Your friends suck.
I wouldn't want to have 'friends' like that. I would honestly prefer to be alone. I would tell them so they would know how cowardly they were.
Do you really want to be friends with people who disrespect not only you, but everyone else who's just trying to be themselves?
There's a big difference between being 'edgy' and just being bad people.  I'm sorry but your friends are the latter.
I’m so sorry you’re having to experience this. I don’t really have any advice. But maybe distance yourself from them and find new people to hang out with? I know that’s easier said than done though. But it also can’t be easy hearing people you love say horrible things like that. I know this probably just comes across as lip service, but please reach out to me anytime if you need someone to talk to or vent to. I will try my best to be supportive. 💕
Those people are awful. I'd just hand them a pizza cutter since they want to be all edge with no point
As my toxic ex ironically once said, it's better to have no friends than toxic ones. It can be hard to let the few friends you have go, but this is not healthy for you. You need friends who won't abandon you.
Your friends arent fucking edgy their fucking transphobic and homophobic
I 100% feel this.. I just decided that I need new friends that accept me for who I am
It's scary but it's the best thing for me and I think that you should try it too. The world is bigger than you think and it has a ton of amazing people in it. I would say that I know what types of friends are those, they suck and that you should get new friends and in the meantime while you have alone time while you get your new friends try to learn about yourself and grow as a person, sometimes we need that loneliness. 

I wish you the best of luck ✨
Society tends to teach males those stuff, if they are really your friends they'll support you no matter what, if they're not, they will leave you, but that's better, you'll find new beautiful and supportive people in your journey. Cheers lov 🍀
I know they’re your friends; I understand staying close with bad people for fear of isolation. However, they aren’t the only friend you’ll ever have. 

I know you aren’t asking for advice, so I won’t give any. Just know that your community is here for you, no matter what you decide to do. /gen
Your friends don't seem that friendly, they seem immature and toxic. If you ever feel like your friends would abandon you, then you need to take the reins and abandon them first. Remove the toxic people from your life and replace them with people who love and support you for who you are. Whether you ever come out of the closet or not is up to you but you'd feel safer doing so without terrible ""friends"" like these around you for sure. DTMFA. You're not nothing and you're better off alone than with people who make you feel terrible. I don't know what else to tell you but to go find some new friends.  Move to that big gay city if you can, it sounds nice.
Just for the sake of clarification, your friends are not edgy. Your friends are children and shitty bigots. 

""Being edgy"" is too often an excuse for straight up bigotry, slurs, calls for violence or death, etc. Excusing it by playing into the tactic of pretending it's a comic choice only helps uphold the bigotry in the world around us.
_Edgy???_ Wtf does being homophobic have to do with being edgy??????? And why do you regard them as your friends? Why are you even friends with them???? 

I'd rather be alone than hang out with pieces of shit like them. Sorry, but this is a little pathetic. I can tell you're young, so you have plenty of opportunities to make new friends.
It's really hard to rip the band-aid off, but it's worth it in the long run. I'm not saying you should come out right now, but you could start to distance yourself and/or establish limits. It's not easy and takes a lot of courage, but it helps the most in the long run.

I had a similar experience with people from school: I had already came out to my group and it was nice, until I noticed my former friends were really edgy too and so mysogynist. I started by establishing limits and they didn't like it, so they stopped talking about some topics when I was around. The thing that really made me mad and stop talking to them was when three of them were discussing gender as if they were fetishes or similar. It was a bit hard since when I almost got mugged outside of school, they reached out to me quickly and helped me feel better, but it's not okay to tolerate their actions and even less when they don't want to change. I'm not saying we should force people to change, but it's kind of obvious when your actions hurt your friends that maybe you're doing something wrong. 

Good luck!
I sadly learned the hard way that it's better to have no one to spend time with for a while than it is to keep hanging around people who treat you like garbage. It might be rough being alone for a time but it also might just be a necessary first step to finding friends who are actually friendly. And, remember, being alone absolutely does not make you nothing. ""Nothing"" is not you, it's what you owe those loser ""friends."" If someone doesn't like you for you then kick them to the curb.
Okay, well you should probably find new friends because the company you keep influences you. You have to be like them in order to continue a relationship with them. That can't be good.
im so sorry that u had to endure this. this is a common sitch for a lot of us, myself included. you are not alone bcz i am your friend and im sure there are many others here that feel the same. hang in there friend! 🤗
It will be easier to find new friends than to hang on to these non-friends. Good luck, you can get WAY better friends.
Why do so many people here have such shitty friends?
Tell your so called friends the true how you feel and if they don't respect you or your life style f them. Find new beautiful like minded friends you feel alive with. Love you sending positive vibes 🏳️‍🌈💖
I’ll be your friend
If they would abandon you for being yourself then they aren’t worth it and never will be. You deserve way more then that. Speaking from experience it isn’t worth it. Be yourself even if the world hates you
i didn’t know we’re calling phobic “edgy” now
You deserve better than what these friends are offering. Is there really any future in your friendships if you can’t trust them, if they make you feel miserable & vulnerable? These are not your people. You could try to open up a discussion & see if their bigotry is indeed a front, or if they actually believe what they say. If it’s the latter, you’re only going to be hurt by them. They will let you down. You should separate yourself now & seek out communities with people more like minded. Loneliness is awful, but right now it sounds like you are lonely anyway, spending time with friends who you can’t be honest with, who’s views are counter to your existence. Protect yourself now. You will make other, better friends. You deserve more than this.
It's totally better to be alone than with snarky homophobic, transphobic and any other kind of phobic people that stiffle you from being your true and authentic self. The right people who don't give a coffee bean about anything but being your friend and socialising with you will find you. The hell with them----- they're not your honest friend(s). If anyone said something like that to my face I would bail out of the vehicle and find my own way home, and find authentic friends I could trust fully. You're definitely not alone!!!! Even a sympathetic stranger is better than those clowns that would make those kind of remarks.
get some new friends
Ok, ik this is difficult, but its better that u start exploring and make some friends in our community first. Then u can like try to throw hints and explain to ur these friends patiently that being not straight is not an option and everything abt the lgbt community and just come out to them. Maybe if they find out that YOU  their friend is not straight, they might change their mind and be abit more open minded. Even if you lose them at that point, u still have ur friends from our community. Sometimes, ppl who we want the most might just pass by as a chapter. Just stay strong and make bold moves
Update! (Damn this blew up)

First I want to say thank you to everybody for the kind words and support.

HOWEVER simply abandoning these people isn't so simple.
For starter my school has each year separated into halls in the mornings so I can't just avoid them.
Secondly most of these people are in my classes so again I can't just avoid them.
Thirdly half of my true friends are not like this, however we are all part of one group so leaving the people mentioned in my post would mean leaving my true friends.

However I do intend to cut ties if things don't improve once I leave school.
You'd be surprised how much better dropping toxic friends will make you feel. I'm sure you are concerned about feeling alone, but feeling alone and more confident in your body might be better than feeling your identity tied to their repugnant attitudes. 

Also, I found that after I came out, my friend circle changed considerably. Before coming out, I didn't have any queer friends. Two years later, probably 80% of my friend circle is queer. I chalk a lot of it up to ""birds of a feather."" LGBTQ+ folks accepted me and involved me more because I was trans, and the cis friends didn't accept me as much anymore as I was foreign to them.
That group just sucks - and they think they're the cool crowd.
Time for new friends!
Find some new friends…
FIND

NEW 

FRIENDS

ps: do you even want these people to be your friends know that you know their true colors?
not edgy. assholes.
Your situation is shitty and sucks. Nothing worse than feeling like you have to keep bigots around to fend off loneliness.

All that said ditch those mf’s and either find new friends (or one decent friend) or learn how to survive a more solitary life built around supporting yourself steadily.
Well, I’m not going to say to push them away, but ask yourself, is it worth tolerating people who will tear you down despite only being centimetres above them? For being yourself no less? With them, you might have friends but you yourself, are a husk of your true self. Without them, you would have time for yourself, your true self and to find new, better friends.
They're not edgy, they're discriminatory and mean. You deserve better than them.
I don't like your friends, tbh just come out and then let them live their lives. If they don't want to hang out with you, good riddance but if they do then I'm sure they'll try to be more sensitive towards you/ around you
Were they being serious? My queer friends say the same things in a joking tone (when they know they're around people who are comfortable with it)
Damn that really sucks but Uhh I think the word your looking for is bigoted not edgy.
And you are still friends with them because?  
Friends are supposed to be well... friends!

Good folk, and all, people who support you! Now there's a chance that they might be saying that to be edgy and not actually meant it, but don't put your hopes on that. Expect less then be suprised. But seriusly you need to get new friends
Other people's opinions don't dictate who you are as a person
I had friends like that and being alone is still much better than having bad friends
Find people who aren't pieces of shit to be friends with. I know i had to do this too.
Find some new friends, OP.
your friends aren't ""edgy"" they're assholes with little to no idea of what humor is. you deserve better.
They aren’t friends. Friends love you regardless
Your friends aren’t edgy. Your “friends” are pieces of shit you sully yourself with. Find better friends :) you deserve it
They are NOT your friends, you are better off having no friends, I'm currently going through this myself so you're not alone.
Trust me I've been in the same situation, it's better to just get those toxic people out of your life!
i know they might be the only people you have, but they’re not the people you would want to spend your life with. maybe find new people who would care about you regardless of your true self.
Your better off alone I'd say my friends weren't even that bad and I'm not around them
Would hardly call them ‘friends’
Your friends suck. 

ALSO

They're not edgy. They *want* to think that they're edgy, but really they're just projecting their own discomfort onto the world around them when it doesn't conform.
You deserve better friends!! It’s a horrible situation to be in - sometimes it’s really difficult to hear people say that, and I’m not the only one saying it… but just know, when I was a closeted baby gay, I was surrounded by cishet “friends” who would constantly other LGBTQ people at our school, call bi people attention-seekers etc, and my mental health was terrible because of it. I never felt like myself, I never felt like I had support… the only friend in that group I could talk to authentically, I’m still best friends with to this day, and she was the only one who never joined in with it and actively disagreed with it.

You will feel so much better if you surround yourself with support. You have the right to be proud of who you are, and to feel validated :)
OP i recommend not continuing those relationships. You can Stop being friends with them without coming out to them - just tell them they’re edgy assholes
I will be your friend, fuck those guys
Those aren’t your friends, and true friends aren’t like that either!
Sage!#3071 if you want a new friend ;)
Your friends might not be the best but you can’t keep that kinda mindset about being alone there’s plenty of people who would love being friends with you just gotta find them!
Friends?
Sounds like you need new friends
You are awesome! You deserve to be adored for who you are. 

\*hugs\*
As someone who has had to rebuild an entire social life I can tell you it’s worth it to leave them, they don’t make you who you are. If you ever need support or just want to talk feel free to message me.
Your friends don't, can't, and should never define you. You are your own person with your own internal desires and there's absolutely nothing wrong with that. That being said, I can completely understand why you wouldn't say anything. If I were you I would work towards becoming more independent and/or finding different friends. It's important to become who you want to be, but a lot more important to stay safe. Also, your friends aren't ""edgy,"" they're just assholes. How is showing a pride flag disrespectful? They're taking something personally that has literally nothing to do with them, unless they're hate projecting to scare away their own non-straight thoughts of course.
I volunteer to be a cooler and better friend. I also make realy good brownies.
Your associates aren't friends and they aren't edgey, they are bigots.
Let me put it this way being alone would've likely made you feel better around those flags. Don't waste time with people you don't think will accept you.
your friends aren't edgy, they're complete jerks.  get some new ones who respect you and the lgbt community.
I think your friends are confusing “edgy” with straight up bigotry…
I'm soo sorry  you had to hear those comments, hope you can find better friends
That’s not edgy- that’s bigotry. The way they effect your mental health aren’t worth the time you spend with them- learning to be alone and to find happiness even though your alone is a good thing.
Try meetup maybe to find new friends? Go to LGBTQ support groups? This feels hella unhealthy for you. :(
Your friends aren’t ‘edgy’. They’re assholes.
     Those people aren’t your friends. You don’t have to hide from friends. And , read to the end here, if you are nothing without them you are nothing WITH them because they are nothing. You are, in Gibran’s words, “Life longing for itself”. Everywhere there are people just like you, YOUR people; and souls are ungendered.
Edgy is a word. There are other words..
“Edgy” no transphobic
You know, someone once said this to me and it stuck ever since. It sucks to suck. What I mean by that is, sometimes, people are who they are. Unfortunately some choose to throw rocks. People are going to spit at what they fear, and that’s sad. There doesn’t have to be some grand solution though, I have found myself in your shoes wanting to implode at the lack of logic and general humanity as it can be often be incomputable… Maybe it is time you look at the paths before you. If these friends don’t hold the same values as you, and you cannot change it, then is it adding to your life or taking? Does it undermine the joy you receive from them? It may be time to move on. Life is hard, it’s really really hard. But you are the future, and someone out there needs you to be strong for them. Just as we are all for each other. Mind the grammar, it’s late and I’m exhausted. Love you darling
Your friends suck.
Even if I weren't trans I wouldn't associate with others who treat people like shit for being themselves, especially something one can't change like sexuality and identity.

Pride month is the perfect time to get out there (if you can safely) and make new friends who may be more accepting.
Was and still kinda am in the same situation. Leave them
I know its difficult, especially if u have no other friends but its better, trust me
Your friends are not really edgy to big city standards they’re just dust
Your never nothing. You understand who you are and they don't, you already have a space where the actual you is placed, without them, due to their lack of knowledge. And your still something, you. Be well.
I think your friends are holding you back. If they cant accept the true you, they dont know you, and how can they be friends in that case?
Op your ""friends"" dont sound like friends. But if you want someone to talk to your welcome to DM and hopefully you can find some supportive people.
This isn't edgy ... its straight up disrespectful
Ditch those fuckers asap. I used to have ""friends"" like that too. They almost led me to suicide. So get those scumbags out of your life now!
get new friends. youll have to eventually.  im sorry they were that way.  a lot of people suck.
Get new friends.
your friends have the humor of a 2016 leafy fan. Your better then that. 

Honestly i was in a position similar to yours abit ago, i was friends with a bunch of people whos relationships were very shallow but i still thought them as all i had because of my low self esteem.

 I know its hard and everytime you see one youll hate it and the first few days will feel awful but in the long run its best for you to cut them off before things get dramatic. 

You don't have to say to there face im cutting you guys off you can just slowly stop talking to them. Idk not my situation but they sound toxic for you so figured id add my 2 cents.
If they won't respect who you are, they aren't friends
Those aren't friends and they aren't ""edgy"", trust me, I know some edgy people. Those are just bullies and they're queerphobic.
if youre nothing without these friends, you seriously need to work on finding new friends and working on yourself.
I was in a similar situation. It's a tough break, but it gets easier with support from more sensitive people.
Honestly if they act like that are they truly friends. Also if they don't accept you for who you are they were never true friends to begin with. Don't worry about having to lose friends, it's sad but it's sometimes part of the journey. Keep your head up, you will find people who accept you and love you no matter what. 💙💜🤍💜💙
They ALREADY don't support you. It's already true! And you're already surviving living in that reality. And you can do better than them.
Find a new pack, then cut them off!
If they don't respect people for their sexuality/identity, they don't deserve to be your friends. You'll find better ones, ones that actually respect you, but living in fear of being abandoned is not a good friendship for anyone. I know it seems sad, almost unbearable to see past them, but believe me, once you're in a better place, you will be happy to have made changes for the better. If they don't accept you for who you are, you deserve better than them.
I’ve been without friends due to the “friends” I had being absolutely horrible to me. It’s not easy, but you can do it! Eventually, I became friends with someone who loves me for who I am, through and through. And then once she gave me the confidence to keep going, I reconnected with an old friend who was ran off by others and my own behavior born of being hurt.
Your friends sound like they suck but how do you know that they all would abandon you if you told them about your true self and if they do abandon you then they weren't really your friends to begin with. You may be surprised by at least some of them as they could support you 100% and anyone that abandons you let them go because you don't need them in your life anyway.
If they dont understand they are not your real friends.
If you want to come out do it and who leaves shows there real face and can f*** the f*** off.
You will finde ppl that love, support and understand you.
It was hard for me to when some left but i am at a better place now with ppl and those who left dont deserve to get me at my peak of happiness...

Love from Austria 💜
❤️
With friends like that, who needs enemies. You are more than that and deserve better than they know. If you think you are nothing without your friends, then you need better friends.
Time for new friends id say. If they sont respect you or what you stand for then they are not friends.
had friends like this a while back, one of them came out as trans, and a few others in the larger friend group had been out as trans and enby for a while, the edgelords cared enough for them to get over their prejudices and eventually grew to accept trans people with some guidance. If your friends are really your friends, they'll do the same for you.
Find some new ones.
Your friends aren’t friends, my friend.

You might be a friend to them, but they are not friends to you.

Sorry this is what you’re dealing with
I agree
I agree, they are not good people being like that.
Meh, usually the very same people claiming to be edgy just use it as an excuse to be complete assholes or say horrible stuff.
oooo that's a good one, gonna have to remember that
There are tons of teen boys who are allies and who support LGBT people.

Sometimes I think we give rotten men and boys a pass by saying that ""men"" are just like that, or that ""boys will be boys"". It overlooks the fact that there are tons of men and boys who don't do those things, who deserve to be recognized for being good people.

Likewise, bad people can be held accountable by society.
because now beeing edgy is beeing annoying and discrimantory and all.
Even if you can't avoid them you should talk with them at the very least tell them you don't like what they did, if you don't want to open up to them(eh... sorry .... ) that's fine but at least tell them you aren't ok with those things, they might complain but at least they might reduce the ammount of... edginess they do
The ones that appear to be friends that are true, do you feel like you can start coming out to them? Maybe as you develop a core of allies, they too will see that the others in the group are acting in a hurtful way that potentially harms a person they care about (you!). 

How many more months or years do you have to go in the school that you were at? That might be a factor as well because if you have a lot of time left and you're concerned of things not going well and gossip spreading, that might be some thing that holds you back understandably. But even those cases you might be able to open a dialogue just talking about issues to see where they stand.
OP, I'm sorry, but yeah, this is where you're at.  Unless you can trust any of them to talk to them about it.
Since when was being ""edgy"" synonymous with being homophobic and transphobic? This is news to me 😂
We are growing old my dear friend XD

before it used to be about that ""dark thing"" or whatever 

now beeing edgy aparently it's about beeing an a\*\*hole

Had an awesome time at my county's Pride Fair!		"Oooohhhhh that dress is gorgeous - really suits you! 😍
This day in general was just so awesome! I made a few new friends, got a bunch of compliments on my outfit, and even got asked for pictures a few times! 

I was afraid because this is my first pride since coming out, but I'm already excited for next year!
You look amazing💗💗💗 I’m ace too!!!!
Glad to hear that

Thank you! The whole outfit csme together super well and it made me really happy!
Aww I'm so happy for you!! And you look so good in that dress btw
thank you! they're from Sock Dreams

(and held up by a pair of bedsheet straps because I don't have a garter belt)
I got it from [Amazon](https://amzn.com/gp/product/B06XGVLVLS/)!
Thigh highs are like top 5 favorite articles of clothing, but shit these things are complicated. these were each being held up by two pieces of fashion tape and a *fucking bedsheet strap* because I don't have a garter belt.
Oh definitely! As long as I get to see the finished product, of course!
I am uhh
Not a man, but ok.

The socks came from Sock Dreams, and the necklace was actually purchased at pride from avlocal vendor! I can try to find their etsy tho.
I just use sock glue because I'm lazy (and I have fat thighs so everything rolls down)
Thanks a lot ! I'll send it to you in your DMs
I apologize for the word man coming off like that, I’m used to using that to really any gendered person as a slang since I’ve been learning other languages it was simple to use, sorry if I accidentally misgendered you!! Also thank you!

Students who identify outside of male or female can not complete the housing application, despite freshmen being required to live in residence halls. This college prides itself on being inclusive.		"Dorms are crap practices to begin with. Here’s a stranger now sleep in the same room with them. Better hope they don’t snore loudly. See if there is a way to get that requirement waved, they can’t possibly force all new students to live on campus, much less pay for their housing.
This is so dumb, I remember my housing at college had an mixed gender housing option.
Sooo I was the first trans person to go my college way back when. Same bullshit, different day. Your best bet is for a med waiver, which you've guessed. Dont wait though, push this person, re-insist for a non-gender option. There is a head of housing, info should be available publicly. Send all responses to the head. Tell them you're not the only non-binary person alive, and state you're not comfortable and feel ""un-safe"" rooming with a gendered person. You are happy to room with another non-binary person. 
There is now a documented report of students feeling compelled to enter unsafe housing, and being ignored along with a med waiver on the desk of the person making policy. 
The key words here are ""un-safe"" and mandatory/compelled. 
You'll get something, even if thats a written email acknowledging that school policy is ignoring safety of students. Which can be quite something in the right hands. Either way you win 😉
They were SO close to being cool about it. Then, they fumbled the ball and accidentally scored on their own end zone.
None of the 10s of Millions of intersex are allowed to exist in their dorms even. 🤦‍♀️
One trip to the higher administration should solve this (depending on who you interact with that is). Not that they necessarily care more about you, but they care about the negative PR this would generate on campus and in general. 

If they don't help, if it's a US school there's likely a queer club. Having run a club before i know the president of that club will have a direct connection to the schools student council. And those guys were always real good at cancelling faculty lol
Honestly my doorms aren't inclusive and got used to it, tho if they say they are THEN THEY GOD DAMN WILL BE
So they need to provide you somewhere to stay off campus
Aside from going for a medical waiver, you might have some luck if you contact their LGBTQ+ or inclusion office. It’s unlikely went to the same college, but where I went, the office was able to give me a “gender waiver”, if you will, to be able to dorm with whoever. You’re not the only non-binary person at the college, so they might have something like that where you will go and might even have other non-binary students looking for roommates. Best of luck.
Its going to take a long time for the world to adjust, i know its frustrating but these are still early days. We are like the Ford Model-T in 1908 while everyone else is still on horseback, and there is no accomadations for cars yet.

We are the pioneers ! Paving the way for future generations, and all the pioneers had it rough.

Considering my job as a plumber i know how costly and time consuming having a 3rd option bathroom would be EVERYWHERE.

Its going to take a handfull of decades most likly for everything to be running smooth, legally, economically, socially.
But what happens if you choose both? 🤯
This is upsetting. I don't know what I'd do in this situation. I identify as female so I could pick that option, but I don't identify as woman. Technically, they aren't even segregating by gender, they are segregating by genitals.
Live in the mess hall with the rats
Did you take this to the Pride Committee? If they claim to be inclusive, they would naturally have one. One of the purposes of any Pride Committees is to help deal with these issues.
I fucked up and picked other last year as an incoming freshman to a different college. I could not finish the application. They should have not made it an option, I almost didn't have a dorm, they had to email me then override shit.
... do you mind if I ask which school? I go to VCU (which prides itself on being inclusive) but honestly wouldn't be surprised if they did this.
I'm confused by required dorm living. Years ago when I went, the big complaint was that while I was there they stopped letting juniors and seniors apply for housing altogether, but I don't recall anyone being forced into housing. 

I hope you get it sorted though. That sounds awful.
Yikes. My main priority for applying to schools has been accessible housing since I need to leave my current living situation, I consider it more important than major options or cost.

Many schools have LGBT+ specific housing areas or coed suites listed on their website (though I'm having trouble finding out if A&M Commerce has trans accessible housing if anyone knows)
Fun fact! That’s illegal as it discriminates based on gender.
Oh shit this might be my college-

I'm so sorry this happened. I wish it wasn't how it was but even in the all girls dorm, just in my floor there are so many trans kids, being deadnamed by their names on the door. It really sucks.
Actually, the way I read their response is that you can choose who you want to live with.  It doesn't say anything about having to choose your AGAB.
If you’re comfortable, what’s the college?
Bring it up with student resources. There are generally policies on discrimination that they enforce and try to handle. Forget what it is exactly but mine has a Title *** office
Is this Denison? 🤣😭😭 This is some shit they'd pull tbh
As I said on this post in a different sub, what the hell kinda bullshit is this
Honestly, this feels more like a system/IT issue where they didn't think about the ""other"" option in the secondary systems that feed into the first.

Note that they're not asking that you ""be"" a given gender, or that non-binary people aren't allowed, but just that a selection needs to be made according to this.

Source: am in IT and have seen this multiple times (and this exact case once). What happened there was, upper management told the user that they can select whatever gender they best feel comfortable dorming with, and everyone went on their way, because changing the system would cost tens of thousands of dollars (that was a legacy/old system in use for around 7 years at that point).
I identify as nb too, honestly just choose where you feel safer sleeping at that's what I did, (I chose female, even tho I was amab, but I just don't feel comfortable around men as much)
what school is this at? Utah tech??
my cousin doesn't go to actual dorms and he is cisgender. he does online schooling from the comfort of his home. i know so many want that dorm experience, but coming from friends who had that, they said it's just not worth it and it's super expensive anyway
I put in an ADA request for a disability. If that goes through I get a single ADA room. Hoping for that.
Shit‘a just crazy because there‘s plenty places that offer non binary genders on birth certificates and passports nowadays.


Like what’s say a foreign German student supposed to do? Lie about their gender if it‘s X? 

Kinda weird trouble they are making by not including all legal genders even.
look, i've never written to protest anything so i might come off as too belligerent (i.e. mildly dissatisfied) but i wrote one up. this is assuming you can get a med waiver tho.

>Given that this institution prides itself on providing a safe and inclusive environment for all students, I am surprised by the lack of accommodations for students who do not conform to a certain gender identity. It is disappointing that a community can claim to be progressive while refusing to extend the consideration received by the majority of students to a marginalized and highly vulnerable minority.

now express to them the very real risk of being assaulted for existing as a nby/trans person:

>It's possible I am the only freshman to directly request a non-gendered housing option, but I do not believe I am the only one who feels uncomfortable choosing a label that cannot accurately describe my gender. I do not feel safe being forced to endure the stigma attached to being nonbinary in a gendered setting. As someone who has previously been harassed for my identity, being put in this situation may subject me and other nonbinary students to abuse and bodily injury.

dunno how to wrap that one up, but this is where you should mention the waiver. Though even without the waiver, ""fear of physical harm"" is already a pretty compelling reason to accommodate your needs.
It’s like a conservative safe space! They just huddle in the corner, “ we’re safe in here, gender   Nonconformity can’t hurt us!”
You act like intersex people don't ever align with a gender
You can just make existing bathrooms open to all genders though. That’s what I’ve seen places here do.
Which dorms do you wish to live in?
[ ] Male
[ ] Female
[X] Surprise me
I think they are segregating based on labels rather than genitals. 

If it was genital based I don’t think they would even inform the person that they can choose which gender they identify with and just inform them that they must choose agab
Good idea. This is adequate gender affirming housing.
We do not have one.
I can’t name drop. I don’t want to push Reddit rules or anything.
You can chose the gender you identify with, but if you select other you can’t complete the form at all… honestly utterly overlooking genders outside of male or female
Not sure if I want to name drop 

Not that I mind calling them out, I just don’t want to push Reddit and sub rules.
No. I don’t want to name drop though. Trying to be mindful of Reddit rules.
I worked with my college to get out of the dorms early (required for the first two years) because I started transitioning end of freshman year and made a case it would be safer for me to do so in my own housing. If I recall correctly, I had to work with the disability services people. Gender Dysphoria is classified as a disability now so you might be able to do something similar and argue it would be safer for you to live on your own.

They house people, its more than a checkbox. But also, yeah, they should have policy in place at this point beyond binary. Universities are not the liberal bastions they are made out to be.
The trick to writing these kinds of letters is saying as little as possible. The person on the other ends job is to tell you no without saying no, and reiterate policy. More writing just gives them more room to tapdance. Keep it under 3 sentences, and don't accuse, YET. It should be more in line with:

""I dont feel safe in this setting due to previous life experiences, and housing is mandatory by school policy. Could you please help me and provide alternative options that take into account my safety?"" 

Save the long form for higher ups. Your goal is to get a direct yes/no, and ammo for pressuring someone in a higher position, to enact a policy.
True, but they’re basing it on sex sooooo
Yea but not everyone will be comfortable with that, and i think thats fine as long as we are respected as human beings.

Anytime i have to work in a womans washroom i have to get a ""woman"" from the building to clear it out then escort me in 🙄 but i understand still.

People will want a ""mens"" a "" womans"" and a ""unisex"" and changing the minds of 8 billion + people will never happen.
I just mean that sex does not equal gender. Gender is man, woman, non-binary, etc.
Wow. I don't know what to say. I'm so sorry! They really dropped the ball on this one!
That's fair. That said I'm gonna go check what my school does now and make sure it's ok. I have too many connections to SGA to not
Yes, ***BUT***, for the purposes of the housing application, if you say you identify as a male, you will be roomed with other male-identified individuals, and if you say you identify as a female, you will be roomed with other female-identified individuals.

Is the source of your upsettedness that they don't have gender-neutral housing period?  Or that they're forcing you to choose one?  Would you rather be randomly assigned?
It's not possible to dox a public institution.

It's an institution.

And public.
Isn’t really what this is about. I put in an ADA request because I’m disabled. Id rather have that go through than deal with this, sure. But I’d be fine with a roommate should I be able to have my gender accurately represented and be placed with someone of a gender I’m comfortable with. 

This form is very flawed and needs to be updated.
>changing the minds of 8 billion + people will never happen.

You say that like transphobia has always existed and is not a pretty recent thing. We are nothing new and the world was used to accept us. Transfem being forced out women spaces would have been absurd in most parts of the world for thousands of years.
Honestly the fact that nb identities are completely left out of the housing application is a bit much for me. If you can select which gender you prefer to house with, sure. But you shouldn’t need to misgender yourself in order to do that. Something simple like “other” gender and options that allow you to chose who you want to house with, such as “other and female” would even be an improvement.
No but you’d be doxxing yourself by naming them. Especially if it’s small. Op says it’s X place, now you know what city OP lives in and where you might be able to find them. I get the hesitation. 🤷🏼‍♀️
[deleted]
Umm transphobia and homophobia aren’t recent things. Most people still see us as men playing dress up
I don't disagree that it can definitely be better... But you have to get used to things like this and not get too worked up over them. Yeah, work to change the system, but you need to work within that system while it exists as it does now. If you can't, then my friend, the real world is going to eat you alive. Beat of luck.

BTW, we've been fighting to not be ""othered"" for longer than I've been alive, which (if you're the typical college-applicant age) is over twice as long as you. ""Other"" is never an acceptable solution.
Can you elaborate on what you mean
>Yeah, work to change the system, but you need to work within that system while it exists as it does now.

What does ""working within the system to change the system"" mean to you? Because I gather that contacting the authorities responsible and explaining why they aren't serving your needs doesn't count, for some reason.

>BTW, we've been fighting to not be ""othered"" for longer than I've been alive, which (if you're the typical college-applicant age) is over twice as long as you. ""Other"" is never an acceptable solution.

Who is ""we""? What would be preferable to you? ""Non-binary""? But what about bi-gender people, or agender people, or genderfluid or genderqueer people? At least ""other"" could serve as a flag for residence services that the applicant will need further assistance to find a place they feel comfortable.
That‘s utter bullshit mate. Forcing someone to misgender themselves is ‚working within the system‘? The fuck?

People not allowing you to chose your legal fucking gender on an application is fucked. Don‘t tell people to just get used to this…
> we've been fighting to not be ""othered""

Assimilation vs. emancipation, the usual generation gap, I guess. Where were you when queer folks started to drop out this out dated strategy?
>What does ""working within the system to change the system"" mean to you?   
Because I gather that contacting the authorities responsible and   
explaining why they aren't serving your needs doesn't count, for some   
reason.

It absolutely does count.  But imaging that a major institution like a university is going to change their form, overnight, from one person's complaint, is naivete at its finest.

>Who is ""we""? What would be preferable to you? ""Non-binary""? But what   
about bi-gender people, or agender people, or genderfluid or genderqueer people?

I would prefer that the form give absolutely every option possible; make it a drop-down with 25+ options, and sure we can add an ""other"" and a free-text field then.  But if there's only two default choices, yeah ""other"" doesn't cut it.
\*shrug\* Cool.  So the OP can just not live in college housing, as is apparently required for freshman.  Forgive me for realizing that forms at major institutions don't get changed overnight."	118ifqc	trans	785	0.97	2023-02-21 23:22:43
Vancouver Pride 2019 , with my little cousin. And when I say little, I mean dysphoria inducing little, she’s barely 5 feet, and I’m only 5’7 and I feel like Andre the Giant next to her! Lmao but good times! ❤️		"Us girls all want to change something, I am short and feel like my legs are short, I wish my legs were longer. Tall girls are as beautiful as any girl!
you're both gorgeous! <3
Ayy I'm also 5'7''! I'm FTM tho, and guessing you're transfem?
Gosh, you both look absolutely ADORABLE! You're both so beautiful! It looks like it was a lot of fun there! xx
You're both gorgeous
Cute!!
🌈trans planet 🌎❤️🦄🧜🏼‍♀️☮️☯️♍️
Yesss! Vancouver Pride was so fun! It was my first pride and first time presenting in public!  


You two look great, and like you had a lot of fun! 

&#x200B;

I can't imagine if it was me being 6'2"", I hate towering over everyone 24/7 .-.
yall both gorgeous 💓
I'm 6ft 2. F*cking kill me..
Y'all look beautiful together pain like your having a good day. Remember you're a normal height I'm 5'7&1/2
Huh. I was at van pride as well. Idk if you saw a 6’5 lanky ass trans gal in a white n red flower/sun dress with black stockings. Or at a later time with only a black top n a lesbian flag around my waste. If so that was mee!! If not i hope you had a good time with your cousin!!
I am a 5’4” trans guy and all my female siblings are taller than me I feel you on the dysphoria lol 😂 Also everyone has told me Vancouver Pride is amazing and I’m definitely going next year
Tell you something, I'm trans masc and I'm 5'9 and feel short all the time even among women in Poland. Going to the US is a blessing for me, but it might be worth visiting Eastern Europe for you. People tend to be taller here!
I feel you, my older brother is over a foot taller than I am (different dads make a huge difference) & I feel like a child next to him lol. Y’all look so happy & beautiful btw!!
You are slayinggggg
Honestly, I never mind my height, it’s literally only when I’m with her that I feel so disproportionately massive lol.
Thank you 😊
I’m MTF
I'm a 5'7"" ftm too!
I am 6'4"" 😥 and MTF, I am a GIANT
Aww, thank you! it was definitely a lot of fun!
Thank you 😊
Thank you!
Aww 🤗🤗
I’m not exactly sure! Haha, we spent most of our time around the beach. But thank you! I hope you enjoyed your pride as well!
Lol it was my first van pride, im new here, originally from toronto. It’s definitely really nice, especially because of the beach!
Rock it! You are model status, don’t let it get you down. You are beautiful and valid 💕
I can relate. I'm a trans guy who's 5'7"" and have no issue with my height until I stand next to my 6'3"" brother.
You truly are magnificent
Cool! Ah, 5'7, the height that makes both trans girls and trans boys dysphoric...
5'7"" party thread!
If it makes you feel better, there's a cis girl at my school (well we go to different schools now so not any more) who was like 6'3"" and several around the 6 foot mark, so it's not impossible or anything.
What do you mean aw I f*cking hate it
You can also volunteer with Vancouver Pride Society and help out during these pride events. Walking in the parade with people cheering and showing their love was awesome, filled my heart with joy.
Haha right, not quite short, not quite tall, but can be easily considered either/or depending on the beholder.
WTF!  I’m 5’7” (AMAB) and I’m dysphoric about my height.  I wish I was taller though, not shorter.
Yep, it's less common in some areas of the world but there are definitely women who are 6'+ everywhere, I knew a cis girl who was 6'5"" and a lot of the women in my family are 6'.
Those are hugs.
Honestly, I love my height, but my love for my height gets challenged sometimes lol. often with my tiny ass cousin!
I knew a girl who's whole family was tall except her dad, we're talking she was 5'9 in 4th grade
Sadly nobody ever gives me hugs 😓
I'm just a huge joke. I deserve to die.
Jeez, you all actually made my day a little bit better ^^. Thank you. But yeah, from my family and friends, i'm the tallest.
Don’t you think that’s a little extreme ? That’s not even remotely funny.
You think I'm joking? You seriously think I'm joking? You can look at my profile to tell I'm not joking.
Don't assume s*it beforehand. That's really offended me
I see. Well, I’m actually quite apathetic, to be honest. From my perspective, it looks like you’re just begging for attention. 🤷🏾‍♀️
Why would I be begging for attention. Looking at your posts you seem to be an attention seeker. I talk to nobody everyday I'm the furthest thing from an attention seeker.
You said to look at your profile, and that’s what i did, and that’s what it looks like. 
I love attention, so you telling me I’m an attention-seeker isn’t offensive to me. It’s a fact. I make a living off of my appearance, but I’m not an asshole about it. You came on my happy post, talking about you want to kill yourself, lol yet apparently, you’re the furthest thing from an attention seeker. Okay, if you say so.
Rude, just downright rude. I'm not being an asshole you are the one making me act like that by replying in such manners to offend me.
i’m with you sis, she’s gone a bit too far being rude
Being offended is a choice.
She's just got a huge self inflated ego. Wish she knew what it was like to live on the other side. Makes me sick.
😔 sometimes people do this, don’t let them bring you down; take care sis
Take care."	cp48p9	trans	779	1.0	2019-08-11 23:37:20

Made a trans varsity jacket I'd like to do other pride jackets in the future!		"Image three is a viral internet war waiting to happen.
Looks great!
Oh my god I would totally buy these
very cool :) good job :D
So cool!
Amazing! I love the style and layout of the colours. ❤️
Can i buy one?!?
I'd buy one so fast
How much?
Why were you decapitated In the last picture lol?
i love these!
I need this.
That looks awesome
:00 that looks so cool !! i wish i could buy it
Wow!  I sew but I sure can't sew ***that*** well!  If you ever start selling them, PM me!

I love it
Wow that's so awesome , you're very talented!!! An ace one would look SO cool!
That looks really, really good!
Amazing jacket! Also, you're transition goals
yooo I'd 100% buy this. You considering selling?
Ooooh I need one :O
Thanks!
Ayy thankyou!
Thankyou!
Gah thankyou so much!
I could try making you one what size do you wear in a jacket?
What size do you wear? And what state do you live in?because I could probably do it for $50 I'd have to get some supplies if you really want one
Lmaooo
Lmao that's funny because that's what I'm gonna try to make next just figuring out the layout lol
Ayy thankyou so much!
Yeah I have considered i just don't know how to go about shipping also trying to design a new pride jacket so focusing on that for the time being lol
I live in KS and I like really loose clothes, so like women's med-large/men's med
Heck yea!! Buying myself a thrifted varsity jacket was the first time a bought clothes for myself after coming out. Felt good to actually choose what I wanted to wear, even if it was something small :)
No problem!
Nice! Yeah do whatever you want but I think a lot of ppl would buy these if you decide you want to in the future. You're a qt btw ;)
Heck yeah same here that's why I wanna start a sort of trans group in my small rural town or give some sort of comfort like making some jackets so they can sorta be Suttle about their pride : )
Oh thankyou so much 😳

I didn't get to attend pride because of an active shooter 😥 was proud of my makeup and wanted to show off at least. xoxo		"Love the lipstick on just your upperlip c: will give that a try myself if you don't mind me stealing the idea

Horrible about the shooter though... I hope you (and everyone else for that matter) are safe!
There was a false alarm of an active shooter near me, though there was a security incident and some destruction of property.  Don't know if you are in the same area, but that really sucks either way.
I'm glad you're safe and looking awesome girl!
Fucking hell
Grrrr. super cute. I want to be cute too.
That’s terrible that there always an active shooter at your Pride event. On the positive side, your makeup is on point and you look lovely!!
Oh my you're pretty! And I love your makeup, super cute! 🖤
PRETTY
Sooo pretty!!
God why can't I look that good
If it was in denver then the shooter was a false alarm
Looking good
Oh god I love your whole style and aesthetic
Very cute
You are beautiful!
Bueno por lo menos de lo mal del día dos diste unas fotos de un maravilloso maquillaje que hace resaltar tus bellos ojos solo lamento no poder ver el conjunto completo, cuídate linda.
Sorry ro hear about that!!! You look amazing though!!!!
beautiful. Still learning how to get my eye liner like that. Its wonderful.
Oh my god hot goth girl alert 📢

Hope this is OK to share, i’m just really proud of his handiwork. My brother customised this axe for one of our customers, its beautiful. It says ‘pride’ in runes ❤️		"Seems like a solid transaxetion.
That looks absolutely great, I admire people that forge things like that and having it say pride in runes is a great idea XD
Can you use it to bash transphobes skulls, and then drink in it? Asking for a friend
Beautiful

Coolest thing ever! I have a range set up in my backyard just for these kinds of things (:
That is cool on so many levels!
Are these axes functional, or just for decoration?
Oh, the might axe of pride, only true warriors of love and pride can use this powerful weapon
Is this for busting down the barriers to equality?
I’m really happy about the fact that somewhere in the world is a smith who makes pride battleaxes.
Oh fuck this is so cool
This is so great!
Oh, that's so cool!
dude. this is actually really really cool
Looks fantastic! Do want!

It will keeel!
in Nordic runes?
I want oneeee
Ahh I love it
On the note of puns, our first pride axe we gave away in an event called “Random Axe of Kindness” hahah
Thank you!!
Functional, always. People tend to customise for decoration though
Just cos I like to be an open book, we didn’t smith these (although i wish i could say we do - we’re only a small family run business so unfortunately don’t have the capabilities currently) but we buy the heads, haft them and customise them with leather and runes.
Yep, Elder Futhark
Well of course! I was just considering ordering one, but I don't want to wind up with a wallhanger.
We do have another done now, its worth noting that even though theyre functional they’re hand painted so i would worry slightly about it retaining its prettiness if it started chopping everything haha"	hs87yf	trans	746	0.99	2020-07-16 11:51:13
Happy Pride!		"And this is why she deserved to be in The Good Place
Concise and direct, the only thing some folks understand these days.
Love this beautiful giraffe. (watch The Good Place it's amazing)
Agreed..
And nice poem.
this tweet is amazing but don’t read the replies they’ll just make you sad
Haha yeah I get the reference"	h15sef	trans	692	0.99	2020-06-11 19:10:17
I went to a Reclaim Pride march! It was so much fun seeing so many amazing people and being a part of something important!		"Soo hot 🥵
Okay, but like, how are you so pretty?? I need to know your secrets. You gotta have some secret ritual. I mean, c’mon, it isn’t fair for you to be this pretty. You gotta leave some pretty for the rest of us!! But all that aside you really look beautiful, amazing, and confident, and I’m really glad that you’re able to express yourself and be yourself!! Much love ❤️✌️
I absolutely love your style! \*\_\*
Yay no mask 😀 you look great and happy
You're so beautiful omg
Can we talk about how you're rocking that Death hoodie though. Back in the days I had tons of bandshirts and hoodies. None of them fit me nicely right now, all too big and slobbery, but your hoodie just slays.
Love your style!
Good on you for going to the march!
Proud of you!
Can you explain what ""reclaim pride"" means?
Aw yay! I'm glad you enjoyed yourself, you look wonderful. 😊
that is SUCH a look omggg
Ahhh, you look so cute!
I'm 🙌living🙌 for your aesthetic
+1 for Death!!!!
Congrats you look happy, you've come a long way since wearing a mask. Keep up the good work
YOURE SO PRETTY <33333 LITERALLY HOW I DREAM TO LOOK
Tyy
Awww tysm! Honestly I was so happy there, being in a place where I'm not some outsider and where I'm accepted made me feel so amazing
Thank youu
I felt confident enough to go without the mask which is a huge step for me, I felt so happy!
Thank you!!
Tyyy
Of course! And I’m glad you were able to feel that way! You probably don’t hear this enough, but thank you so much for putting yourself out here on social media because I think that you’re really helping to inspire a lot of people to be themselves. You’re seriously a true inspiration, and that’s a fact!! Just keeping it 💯
You're welcome :D"	pr4ct6	trans	669	0.99	2021-09-19 08:50:54
On this, the last day of Pride 2022, I feel like giving up…	"I’m fighting to be here. Every. Single. Day. Dysphoria is such a beast… I don’t know how much fight this girl’s got left…

I’ve told my family I’m struggling. They’re all just ignoring what’s going on.

Just need some encouragement…"	"Your brightest day have yet to come love. You're so strong for still being here. You've fought so hard don't stop now. I know you're tired but I believe in you. If you ever need anything I'm just a message away 💜
Giving up is not an option. Keep up the fight, you will succeed. Think positve and that vibe helps a lot.
You got this girl, you will be able to be your best self you just gotta keep going!
Stay strong girl!! We’re with you every step of the way. 💖🏳️‍⚧️🥰
Hope's a poweful thing. Everyday you keep moving forward is you moving one day closer to being able to live your truth.
Hey, I know the road is long and rough and during all the parts where you hit hurtful rough patches things are gonna feel awful and crazy but It gets better! 

Someday you're gonna wake up next to the one you love who accepts you for your truth and loves you till the end of time and you're gonna walk over to the mirror and fall in love with yourself!

Life is scary and people are garbage but you are a wonderful person who is just on the verge of being their own perfect, beautiful masterpiece!

So don't give up and keep walking your road to your own truth and your own happieness!
I came close once. Had the knife to my wrist. My friends had basically all abandoned me, my dog was sick, I didn't have the money to help him, I was struggling just to pay rent, and Trump was president. I was hanging on because of a guy at work. He would always check in on me, bring me snacks and drinks, talk to me about a lot of pretty deep things, and flirt. When he got fired, it was kind of the last straw, so I got the knife. I hadn't been answering one of my friends for about ten hours by then. I had fallen asleep after drinking myself into a stupor and woke up early ready to do it. Had the music on. Had a note written that started as a journal entry. She kept texting me. All through the night and into the morning. Finally, she lost her shit and said she was coming to my place. She had a key so she could have gotten in. But something about her saying she was on the way gave me just enough of a breath to pull me back. We talked, she helped me figure out the money situation, she helped me dig out of it. She kept me going for a bit and helped me find my legs again. Even after I got fired I remembered that and fought through all of my dark days until finally meeting my Fiance. If I had killed myself, he'd still be the daughter of a christian cult's pastor and wouldn't be on his way to finding himself and fulfilling his dreams, and I never would have met my cats. So, no, don't give up. Don't ever give up. You fight every day no matter how hard it seems and you get stronger with each day. You scratch, you claw, you fight your way to victory because your very existence is a riot. Are we clear?

You got this even though I might be the last day of pride month never stop showing your pride for as long as you live you mean the world to everyone around you you got this no matter who thinks it's wrong or not or if they disagree or not just know that my love and that people will always care and you are not in the wrong so have a great day and keep believing in yourself ❤️🥰🤩✨✨
To quote a very good book:

“You told me it would get worse.” “It will,” Wit said, “but then it will get better. Then it will get worse again. Then better. This is life, and I will not lie by saying every day will be sunshine. But there will be sunshine again, and that is a very different thing to say. That is truth. I promise you, Kaladin: You will be warm again.”

I *highly* recommend the Stormlight Archive by Brandon Sanderson in general. It has some of the best depictions of mental health issues in fiction. As an added bonus, one of the characters is trans; admittedly, he's a side character, but he's on the same side as the heroes and the closest thing to a negative reaction he gets for being trans is brief surprise.
Stay strong!! 💜
Honestly it sounds like you might need mental health help love. I have a saying where  i say basically ""being trans is beautiful, transitioning it's ass). Being trans takes dedication, it's not easy. I lost my family, friends and my day ones. Cause they couldn't accept me, it sucked but I'm happier now cause i have people who love me and care for me now for being me, instead of a bullshit disguise i used to do. I understand dsyphoria sucks(it's ass). But transitioning takes years it's a process. But like j Cole said(""it's beauty in the struggle""). Honestly if not comfortable with how your journey is going you can always talk about upping doses, using injections, taking progesterone. I know this might sound condescending but transitioning is hard, but if you stick with it, you'll learn to see the beauty you possess (also fuck everyone who disses you and left you. Like the quote from nip Hussle(r.i.p) ""would you rather be at war with yourself, and at peace with the world? Or would you rather be at peace with yourself and at war with the world?"" Everything is hard at first, you get better with time. I truly wish you the best and hope things get better for you
Sorry you are struggling, if you need to talk to someone, reach out. Stay strong, don't give up. 🏳️‍⚧️🏳️‍🌈❤️
*Intense virtual hugging*
Pm me. I'm always here.
The days you’re beaten down so hard you don’t know if you can get back up, remember the little things. The little pleasures, the little victories. It doesn’t always help, but some days it can. Stay strong 💖
Stay strong, you're an amazing woman and all of us are here for you. Consider how your progress from here onwards would be rather than where you might be now 💙💞🤍💞💙 Lots of love, Lexi
Dysphoria sucks but it’s going to get so much better! We are here for you!! Keep going, you got this!

If you ever want to talk, my dms are open
press through !!!! everyday you survive is a day the world is better just because you exist. i know u can do it and i know that things will be brighter in the future
Hey girl, I want you to go turn on “In Passing by Indica”. Then come back and read the rest of this with that playing.

Ok you’re back?  Now, I want you to think back over your life, the things you were, and now aren’t, the incredibly difficult obstacles you’ve surpassed.  

See?  Everything passes, sometimes we do have to work hard to get through the opposition we face.  Also, once we get through some of the hardest stuff, the good things are there for us to enjoy, remember, and hold on to. 

Like, we pass too.  We humans are just little blips of consciousness who get to experience this existence for a small snapshot of time.  In that tiny piece of reality that we get to interact with, we can try to make this reality just a little bit better for the people that come in the future.  

It IS very hard right now, some very hard-won fights are being re-attacked and destroyed, and still, we persist.  We always will.

I am not sure of your specific situation, but I hoped this helped, and my DMs are open for people like you, if you feel like that’d help.  💖💖💖💖💖
Be proud of who you are, I know what it feels like to deal with dysphoria, but you shouldn't be ashamed, you're beautiful, okay? Love yourself! I'm very proud of you ♥️
If nothing else, please know some stranger on the internet is sending love your way!
Ugh don't make me cry I'm right here with you stay strong❤️
My queen you've got this. Through every dark night there's a bright day after that. In the words of Tupac Shakur

Never surrender
Sweet baby girl. You are a warrior and you are a forerunner in your gender and you deserve noting but praise and encouragement. Future generations are going to thank you for standing up for yourself and your peers.
So Ik it sounds cringy. But when I was younger I started taking karate lessons. They focused more on the mental aspects of it. Having a certain mindset. Each week from when I was 6-12 they taught us new lessons and how to keep a positive mindset. One day our sensei sat us down and told us a particularly important lesson. Back then it was cheered up and told in a childish way but as I have grown a little I have come to see what they meant.  People are good at finding what they are looking for, that’s how we survived so long. They did this test with us and they told us to look around the room and find something let’s say blue. They then instructed us to close our eyes and then said “now name one thing in the room that is yellow.” And because we only looked for the blue we only could recall the blue, and not the yellow. They told us it’s the same way with positivity. If you look for the negative in life. Then you will certainly find it. But if you look for the positive, you will only see the positive. They told us to always look for the positive even in the worst parts of our life’s.


    In another lesson they told us to never say we couldn’t do something. When we asked why they told us to do something we thought we couldn’t. When we tried the people who said they couldn’t do it, couldn’t do it. But the few who believed they could, did. They told us weather you think you can or you can’t do something, you’re right.  So if you try and count your blessings however few and believe that you can overcome your dysphoria and that there is light at the end of the tunnel. You will find you have multiple things to be happy about. And at the end of the tunnel you will find paradise.

I hope I didn’t sound to cringy. I hope what I said helps . But after all I am only some random 14yr old from the internet so make of this as you must.



P.S I have been doing the whole martial arts thing for 7 years and could that the mental benefits outweigh the physical ones. Without these lessons o would be in a much darker place. But thankfully they where the little spark that lit a small flame and lit up a little bit of my world.
You can get through this. You survived 100% of your bad days, you can survive more. It will be worth it in the end.
I'm right there with you. You've got this
Oh hey, you're me. I dont have any words for you, other than that you reminded me that I'm not alone. 
Thank you.
I feel the same as you
You can do it, honey ♡

I have changed my first pride month as trans to pride life :) ♡
I know the feeling, it’s a fight that will never end. But you have to keep it up. You aren’t fighting alone. There are more of us and more allies than you realize. We can, and we will secure our rights to exist.
stay strong! one day tou will be independent and not have to worry about what they think! brighter days are ahead! be proud to fight and be who you are!
My dearest sibling, I have basically nuked my life as I've known it. At 42 I have been with my wife 21 years. I have a good blue collar career, I have a family, and scores of friends.

They all just want me to be happy. They all knew that I wasn't. Despite the bad body days and the glacial pace of the changes even starting, I get to be happy and myself. I couldn't be happier! I finally understand why I was angry and depressed and disappointed that I just didn't fit in all of these years.

You can find the strength to go on. Even if it's in something seen by others as childish but brings great comfort. Even if it's just unplugging from socials. Even if you have to walk away from it all and start a new life.

You are stronger than you may give yourself credit for. You are needed. You are important. You are loved. Even if you don't know why those things are true yet, they still are.
You're doing amazing pal, don't give up on yourself.
Keep strong. You’ll make it through. Just remember to take a break and breathe every now and then.
You can do this, girl! You're stronger than you think!
There are so many wonderful moments coming for you. Just hold on and breathe, and you will get to experience them. Lately old funk tunes like Can You Get to That by Funkadelic have been helping me through the rough patches
It's not like this is the last pride month, it will come back next year and you can live through pride month again, no point in giving up
Never give up. It’s a struggle many days but those good days, even if they’re few and far between more than make up for it. 

You always reach out here for help and support!
The battle against mental illness cannot be won decisively. It is a long campaign against an enemy who never tires, whose forces swell to twice their size whenever you look away. Battle against a foe of such magnitude, who occupies your very mind… every moment you survive is a triumph against all odds. There is no more honorable combat.
this is how i feel every waking moment, nothing helps, i just want everything to be normal but tbh i feel like death would be an easy alternative.
Thank you 🙏🏽 😊
Thank you! 🙏🏽
🙂 Thank you!
Thank you!!! 🙏🏽
This is a great way to think about it. Thank you!
🙏🏽 Thank you for the encouragement. That sounds like a lovely future. Hoping that taking it one day at a time will eventually get me there.
That’s a great friend you have. And a great ex-coworker too. I don’t have any friends who check up on me. Half my family just pretends that everything’s fine. I’m estranged from my parents… I’m trying to take it one day at a time…
Thanks. Trying to take things one day at a time.
Thank you for the encouragement 🙂
Reminds me to keep up hope. Thanks. 🙏🏽
🙏🏽
I have a lovely therapist. She’s helping the best she can. I’m at a point where I need family to be on board and support me; but I’m not getting that support. So I feel stuck. I’m trying to take things one day at a time.
Thank you
Thank you. Definitely need some hugs.
Thank you for the good advice. Need to remember the little good things from each day.
Thanks you Lexi. 🙏🏽
Thank you 🙏🏽
Taking it one day at a time…
For everything there is a season. 🙂 Thank you for the reminder.
🙏🏽  Thank you
Thank you, truly. 🙏🏽
You stay strong too! 🏋️‍♀️
Thank you 🙏🏽

That’s good advice to always look for the positives. Thanks.
Thanks. Needed to hear that.
😊 Thank you! We need to keep going.
We can do this! One day at a time. 😊
We can do this! Just one day at a time. 🌈🏳️‍⚧️
Thank you. Pride like sounds awesome! 🌈🏳️‍⚧️
Thanks for the song recommendation. I’m just trying to take it one day at a time.
Just take it one day at a time. It is hard. But as evidenced by all the comments on this post, we’re not alone.
That's all you can do. It's all anyone can do. And truth is, that friend wasn't much of a friend after he got fired and I was devastated for a long time. But I remember a phrase from Firefly, ""When you can't run, you walk. When you can't walk, you crawl. And when you can't do that, you find someone to carry you."" You'll find friends but don't give up before you can. This subreddit is here for you.
Your welcome stay safe and take care 🥰😁
Honestly, if they can't accept you, then look for others who will. Hormones increase your emotional output, plus if you had/have mental illness. Then that shit gets increase also. I  get it my first year i was suicidal and dysporchic Plus I lost like 90 percent of my family a lot of old friends among more shit. It sucks, but like anything with more progress you'll get, the more it won't matter as you'll be in a different mindstate once things kick off. Also i feel like you have a glass half empty mindset. Honestly if no one in the world loves, then try to love yourself. Because if you don't love yourself, then who will. I know written maybe feels like false hope. But I believe in you, i also wish you well. From someone who knows how hard it is. I wish you nothing but the best. I honestly truly believe that things will get better, but gotta have hope love.i truly believe the energy you put it, if what you get in return. You got this, i wish you nothing but the best❤️
You're welcome  😊
You aren’t alone love :)
That's the way to do it. One day at a time. One foot in front of the other. Eyes on the horizon."	voix1b	trans	655	0.99	2022-06-30 21:06:36
Transphobes at my window	"TW: Transphobia, t-word

So I have a trans and rainbow flag in my window, which is on street level to a semi-busy street. Lots of kids pass to and from school, and people coming home from work as well. 

Yesterday I had a really uncomfortable experience I want to vent about. 

I heard some kids walking past, and once they got to my window one of them screamed ""Ew, a *t-word* flag!"", laughed, knocked really hard on my window and ran.

I was really shaken, since this has never happened in the year I've lived here. Also, a couple of weeks ago there was a shooting in my country outside a gay-bar during pride week, and the amount of homophobia and transphobia has just skyrocketed since then. 

I'm seriously considering taking down my flags until I move in two weeks, 'cause I've realized how easy it would be for someone to pick up a rock and break my window, just because of my flags."	"uff heavy stuff...whereya from?

some might say its a sign of weakness to take down the flag but id advice you to do so

better be a hidden trans than a dead one...
There's always people that hate. Don't hate me but just take it down for security, i don't want anything bad happen to you stranger from internet. :)
Kids are sponges. They absorb whatever their parents and/or figures think.

When I was their age, I was incredibly reactionary and transphobic because I was raised in a Christian, fascist cult. However, two years later, I came out as Trans and eventually became a leftist. 

They are gonna be pieces of shit for a while, and will eventually either grow into their own and become better people, or become carbon copies of those who taught them the bigotry.

I'm sorry you have to deal with this bullshit though, my mind can't wrap itself around Norway having a transphobia problem. :(
A few months ago I had the same exact scenario happen.  My neighbors caught them knocking and running off but not before they tore down my flag.  I promptly put our back up.  1 we’ll later they returned in the middle of the night and set the flag on fire with an accelerant, it almost caught my flower bed on fire as well, unfortunately the neighbors camera didn’t catch them that time.  I reported it to the Arson unit and I waited about a month before buying a new one + a security camera for my front porch right on time for pride month.  Haven’t seen the perps return to try again since hanging the new one but my machete and I anxiously await for them to try again.
You're moving in two weeks. Maybe it'll be safer to pack up the flags a little early.

Saying that makes me feel icky inside, but two weeks is not worth picking a fight over.
Are you somewhere that was normally accepting?
First of all I want to say I appreciate you for putting a trans flag there. A lot of kids like me (cant transition because of unsupportive parents) look at those flags and it gives us hope. But for your safety, I’d suggest you take it down for the time being.
In the US, we’ve grown accustomed to violent reactions to LGBTQIA symbols. To the point where anyone who attacks us for a pride symbol gets a response of more pride symbols. 

A friend put up a small pride flag a few years ago, and had it stolen. So he put up two. They were stolen. So he put up a large flag 3 meters long. It was defaced.

This year, his pride flag covered his garage door. It was 6 meters wide. You couldn’t miss it. The neighbors took notice and started watching to see who might come along. They caught a middle aged white man as he started to cut it up. 

The answer to people trying to suppress your speech is to speak louder.
I would take them down too sadly.
Ew, a transphobe
Haters gonna hate. Let them! I will even say bring it on and you will get your ass kicked by a girl.

You have enemies? Good. That means you've stood up for something, sometime in your life.

Winston Churchill
Take it down. It’s safer that way.
Set up a ring camera or something like that. That way, God forbid, something like extreme harassment happens, it’s caught on camera and you have evidence of this.
Wel I'd hate to see your flags come down. 


I recommend getting a ring or similar Wi-Fi security camera and putting it in the corner of that window, you can post the videos of the trans phones on the platform at least, and if any crimes are committed you have evidence. The plug-in ones are cheap, like $60, I have a bunch and they work great.
Wow a whole year before something happened on a busy area like that!? America you prob woulda lasted a week if your lucky in a area like that just because of the number of people walking by before someone transphobic did something stupid or confronted you freaking out that your trying to teach their kids bla bla bla. It’s getting way more stupid in America recently it feels like after the pandemic started and have been having major set backs in Society sadly.
Yikes. Did you try bringing it up with the kid's parents? No matter what they believe, surely they would see it as vandalism or something.
Your own safety is top priority always, but I think it's worth mentioning that seeing these flags displayed publically (Like in window overlooking a street) can be a strong reassurance for others.

I had a neighbour who would display various pride flags off their apartment's balcony, and as a trans woman myself it was a great feeling to know that there were people nearby that shared the same experiences and struggles that I did. People that, whilst I didn't know them, I was in the same boat with, metaphorically.

It always cheered me up walking past and being reminded that I'm not alone when I stepped off the bus.

Again, you come first, but I think it might help your decision, knowing that keeping your flags up would be a good thing for others who might need that reassurance :)
Piss. Andrew people say abortion is bad like TD shit your crotch Gremlin
This kinda stuff is honestly why I like to show my pride with smaller or harder to decipher objects.
Like pins for example.
I have many pins on my bag.
That way I can show my pride without making my home a target.

I wish the world wasn't so dangerous.
No matter what happens, I hope you stay safe, and stay okay, maybe update us when you're fully moved into your new place, stay safe
I don’t like saying this but I would take it down. It’s just not worth the danger right now.
I'd recommend owning a gun in order to scare anyone off who tries to be stupid, but thats a very American answer so I'm not sure of its applicable
Yeah, makes sense that would scare you. That is a very violating experience, having your space invaded for the purpose of expressing hate. And with what you're saying about violence in the area, I can see why you'd want to take the flags down.

I would support you doing what you feel is best, and it sounds like what you're thinking is that it makes sense to play it safe, and with the move coming up, you're right that it'll need to come down anyway.

If what you're looking for is an endorsement, I'd say what you're thinking is perfectly reasonable, and it's certainly the safest and most practical thing to do.
Oh no you should probably get some curtains to hide your window so people can’t see inside
This is what Trump and his cult have made of America. 

**Please do me (and the rest of America) a favor. Remember to register and VOTE  Democrat  this coming election.**
Kids are taught to hate ..and they're taught this trash at home.  
  
**The same for racists ...  Learning to hate, starts at their home and it starts early.**
I'm from Norway.

I've been thinking the same about the weakness thing, but I gotta take them down eventually to pack, so might as well hit two birds with one stone..
I second this. It’s better to be safe.
I'll probably end up doing that, I gotta pack for moving anyway. So happy my new place don't have street level windows!
Holy shit, I'm so sorry that happened to you! It's so scary that while people say the world has moved forward and become so much more accepting, shit like this still happens. I hope you're safe, and that it never happens again.
Kiiinda, or at least most of the transphobia has been fairly hidden up until now. Last month there were a ton of people coming out in the news being super transphobic, and then the shooting happened, and the amount of hate crime against all kinds of queer people just exploded.
Thank you for your comment, it means a lot to hear how meaningful it can be to other trans kids. Once I'm in my new place I'll proudly display them again! And I hope you get to transition one day, you deserve to be happy!
I wouldnt really say ""bring it on"" to being harassed or targeted but sure
I probably would have, if it hadn't been for the fact that I'm moving in two weeks and need the money for furniture and stuff. I'll proudly display them again in my new place!
Yeah, that's my impression of America these days too, sadly. You're probably right that the pandemic stirred up some shit. My boyfriend moved to Norway from the US right before Trump became president, and he is so happy he did before everything started going downhill. 

I'm grateful that I could go so long without anything happening, I probably wouldn't feel safe displaying it if I lived in the US.
I didn't see the kids, my blinds were down, and I also don't know anyone in the neighborhood, so I have no idea where they live or who their parents may be. If I did I would definitely have a talk with the parents!
Haha, no, not applicable at all. Here in Norway you need a hunters permit to be allowed to own a gun, and I have no interest in hunting, haha.
Get a prop gun 🤩
I don’t like trump, but I don’t like biden. He has not made life easier and he is mentally declining. I hope he gets the care he needs, but he does not need to be in office
WTF i would have thought southers us....thought norway would be much better off...so sad to see my nordic sisters and brothers suffer
I was under the impression that Norway is very progressive. Am I wrong or is something stirring up this negativity?
Its not weak. Holding them up is strong, but hiding them when it isn't safe is not weak. Showing those flags is activism, and you've got to weigh your activism against your mental health and personal safety. You are not required to be activism 24/7 for the rest of your life; its okay to take the flags down for a bit if it makes you feel safer.
Congrats and stay safe :)
The thing is, the world doesn't just ""become so much more accepting"", things back slide. With the rise of the Nazis the first time around, the first place to go up in flames was an institute set up by a gay Jewish man. It takes sacrifice and deaths for the world to become more accepting. And a hell of a lot of beatings. Keep going strong, head held high, the beatings are coming but we're ready.
Wow that’s so scary I’m so sorry pls stay safe
I know. In real life, I would just run away like a little girl. Lol.
For your new place, you can get dummy cameras and set them up where real ones would be. People won't be able to tell that it's not really recording them, so they'll be safest assuming it is. Most security is psychological, you'd be surprised how well it works.
Good luck on your move! Hope the new place is cozy.
Yea thankfully some how I have yet to have anything crazy happen to me in Oklahoma even tho I dress fully feminine and have a male voice since I have not started voice training and stand 6ft tall but everyone has been peaceful so far around here. In your scenario tho you have many numbers of people walking past your window would not do that in a busy area in America like a city from fear of a rock through the window in a best case scenario to who knows with how crazy people are acting these days.
Oh, ok.
Oh well, make sure to stay safe out there, hopefully this was just a one off experience
i mean the part about the children ok...children can be dumb and they dont know better and prob didnt even meant it to be hurtfull...but the thing bout the shooting...prob some nazi bike gangsters?
since this got so many upvotes id like to add: hail odin, hail loki, fuck thor
You're not wrong, Norway is pretty progressive compared to other countries. But regarding trans rights there's still a long long way to go. Only one hospital in the whole country offers treatment, and they're pretty shit, no treatment for non-binary people, lack of reproductive rights, and lots of transphobia in the media and amongst the people.
Thank you! I will definitely take them down until I feel safe again.
Thank you, I will!
I know, it's absolutely crazy! Sadly it was an islamist, which just increaced the amount of islamophobia in Norway (which was already pretty high in some circles)
One guy fired into a crowd and killed a few people, injuring more, definitely wasn’t a biker gang, good news is the guy was caught pretty much immediately so can’t cause anymore harm
Kids are taught to hate ..and they're taught this trash at home. 

**The same for racists  ... i Learning to hate, starts at their home and it starts early.**

Trans Man Killed During Pride Parade, Suspect Arrested		"Rest In Peace Malte.

Ugh this is devastating.
I hope those fuckers rot in a cell for the rest of their lives
Fucking hell, parent controls blocked the website, what happened? Why?
fucking murderer
A horrific story. It makes me wonder where the police presence was, given that he got punched twice *after* defending lesbians from vicious homophobic and misogynistic slurs.

There are a lot of questions to be answered here.
Why do they think murder is their answer?!?

I'm sick of it!

They claim sanctity of life regarding abortion.

Yet, we stand through candlelight vigils every year, honoring the ever growing list of murdered and suicide victims, trans folks.

We, and our deceased, are shamefully marginalized.  And, it's now at lethal costs.

And, on top of that,  I'm a trans Christian girl and these people are completely maligning my religion.

I'm sick of it!
For anyone wondering what exactly happened:

CSD in Münster, Germany.
queer women got harassed and insulted by this homo/transphobic man. A young trans man went to defend them. He got punched in the face twice and knocked out. Hit his head on the ground and died yesterday from his injuries.

Rest in power Malte. A hero.
It was one 20 year old guy who punched a 25 year old trans man in the face twice, knocking him out and he fell and hit his head and passed away.
Just goes to show that it doesn't matter how  supportive and accepting the majority of the world claims to be, we're still lightyears away from living safe and happy among Cishets.
Rest in peace Malte, we will fight for the thing that happened to you never ever happened again. The murder has to pay off.
Jesus christ. I hope the 20 year gets hit by a truck!
Transman at pride event in Germany called out someone that was harassing some lesbians. Got knocked out by the perp and later died from his injuries 😪
And here i thought germany was pretty safe -- yikes..   
Rest in peace Malte
May he rest in peace.
Hero 💔
My fucking gods... RIP brother. I’m so fucking sorry
Rest in power, my brother. Your sacrifice will not soon be forgotten. You are in all of our hearts and minds.  Blessed be.
Just because it's in Germany doesn't make it right.
That's actually the CSD I wanted to go to, but in the end I didn't...
Omg this breaks my heart
🖕
FR i Hope those fuckers stay in a cell until they got 90
Death penalty
how sad
I didn't expect such things to happen in Germany, of all places
May he rest in peace i hope the fuckers who killed him rot in hell
Imagine waking up as that guy the next morning knowing you murdered a man for defending others, all just trying to be themselves. I can't imagine being so ignorant and hateful. 

He deserves everything that's coming to him, whether it's internal guilt or legal justice, but nothing will undo the damage he's caused. May Malte Rest in Peace 💔
God how awful where was the police at the time I thought they attend these events of ours 😥😡
My heart goes out to family and the needless death. Hopefully this will go the max on sentencing to send a message to the haters.
😢😭🙏🏻😔❤
Terrible, terrible news. I hope his killer is brought to justice and goes to prison for a very, very long time. What a monster.
Rest in power  👊🏻🥺💖
fuck.. the fact this happened hurts. rest in power Malte.
rest in peace malte
this is so disgusting, especially that he was killed at pride. RIP to him
I feel alike, It's such a shame what happened to that poor man
>rot in a cell for the rest of their lives

As hard as it sounds, this is quite unlikely in Germany. Being sentenced for life usually means 15 years (unless you get preventative detention), if you behave well you might get out sooner, which is ridiculous if you consider that the guy took an innocent life. I guess it now depends on the judge.
He got killed after defending four lesbians who were being harassed
He was beaten and after being in critical condition, he died from his injuries.
A community in Germany is mourning the death of a 25-year-old transgender man who died today after being attacked and seriously injured at the closing event as part of Christopher Street Day or LGBTQ+  Pride in Münster in northwest Germany several days ago.

…

According to witnesses, the assailant insulted several women at the festival, calling them ""lesbian whores"" and telling them to ""piss off.""

Malte, police say, noticed the situation and asked the troublemaker to quit insulting people. Suddenly, the attacker punched Malte in the face, making him unsteady on his feet. Then, the person punched Malte in the face a second time, causing him to lose consciousness and hit the ground in an unprotected fall, hitting his head on the asphalt.

The suspect then fled on foot with along with another person.

Knocked out and hit his head on the ground when he fell.
he was punched twice .. knocked out hit his head ..
Asshole started harrassing lesbians at the parade, trans guy intervened and told him to piss off, asshole punched trans guy twice, which made him fall and hit his head hard on the pavement. He died at the hospital.
Where the party was, where no police presented
This was in Germany
I agree 100%. It makes me happy that trans women such as yourself are also speaking up on this, especially as a Christian yourself.
While attack was sick regardless, there was no intention to kill and everything suggests that a cis man would've had the same response from the attacker.

The attacker (who was harassing a group of lesbians when the victim stepped in) hit him in the face twice. As a result the victim died. German law differentiates between murder, killing and assault with resulting death (mord, Totschlag und Körperverletzung mit Todesfolge).

This case will most likely fall in the last of the tree named categories as the first two are tied to the intended death of the victim (which with 2 facial hits is not gonna stand a chance in court). The attacker will get between 3 and 10 years in prison - maybe they can increase it beyond the 10 years because it was a hate crime but I don't know the law enough to be able to tell.
That's murder
Well, it *is* pretty safe, that's why this is seen as extremely devastating.
What does that even mean? So many weird fucking comments in here.
How do you mean that?
nobody said it was right here tho?
People like this never care
What a fucking hero. Rest in power :(
This is all so upsetting as a trans man. God, why can't people just be respectful. May he rest in power and peace
Still murder
~~i dont fucking care if you blow on someones face and the temporary deprivation of oxygen makes them asphyxiate. if you do something intentionally meant to cause harm to an individual and said individual dies as a result it is murder, full stop.~~

~~theres no need for a weapon for it to be murder~~
Your point? That's still murder.
I realize that. It's just sad that same story, different place. That makes it all the more sadder.  I wish America was the only problem. At least that would be more fixable.
Im german myself and didn't know that. That is so fucking scary. I don't think violence is the perfect answer to these people but I wanna see him realize what he did and just break down.
Start accepting the people around you, you sick humans
A few weeks ago, I got into a fight with my parents where they said that violence against LGBTQ+ people here don't happen. Showed her just now the article and she immediately got all defensive.

Someone doesn't like being told that they're wrong.
Thank you for the explanation about German laws. Interesting and semi-like the American legal system.
He should get life in prison though. If a person harasses someone only to escalate to physical violence once someone responds to that harassment, then it should be considered murder, since the person responsible for the death also created the situation which led to it. These sickos are getting off too easy.
Not legally speaking in Germany. Probably will be tried as a lesser case of Totschlag (manslaughter)
In the US it would probably be manslaughter.
Trans hate is wrong everywhere - that's what I meant
Trans hate and violence is not right no matter where on the planet.  No hate is.
Yeah, brain fart on my end...  I was thinking what wasn't being said.
Definitely. I’m also a trans man and this is super upsetting. I’m really glad the shithead who did that got arrested. Rip to a very brave man.
Depends on the laws in Germany, tbh. Definitely not something that should ever happen to one of our brothers.
i was telling the guy what had happened he asked ..
Nobody said it wasn’t murder.
I live in that city and it makes you feel really scared
My opinion differs from the law but ultimately doesn't matter for this case.
Why am I getting all the hate here for saying the exact same thing as this?
No it wouldn't. They were attacked and due to the injuries sustained, he died. That's murder.
Was anyone saying otherwise?
happens to the best of us
you know what? thats on me. im sorry for the hostility, i guess i just assumed you were an asshole downplaying it as ""just a punch"" and so i lashed out because im sick of people downplaying trans violence. ironically making me the asshole here.

so, im sorry for that
They are specifically saying that the person was punched. Leaving out the fact that it is by definition murder. It's an attempt to excuse the criminal by omitting information.
[deleted]
Nope. You're right.  I was thinking something else.  My bad.  Sorry 💗
This wasn't in the is us. It's murder. Here's the premeditation, antagonizing a mass group of people and immediately when confronted violence occurred. The plan to attack is plain to see.
[deleted]
It does meet the legal definition. It's a court case where lawyers will argue both sides. One person intentionally attacked others and resulted in death. Here's a murderer plain and simple. Don't even fucking argue"	x4eotv	trans	629	0.99	2022-09-02 22:43:22

I got my nails done for pride month ❤️🏳️‍⚧️😊		"looking fierce!
Not to hate on pointy nails, but judging by your choice of color on the right you might want a couple short and round. Y'know, safety reasons. Looks amazing.
Looks very pretty sis!
Omg, those look seriously dangerous… lol
I will admire your weaponized pride from a safe distance.

^”Pop ^off, ^queen!”
Cool they're rly nice
Badass, you rock them so well
OoOOo. Them colors are looking good though
I love them so much. I'm pretty sure the guy that did them hated me for all the different nail polish colours he had to find lol
You honestly learn how to accommodate after awhile of having them on, mostly learning how to touch everything with the verrrry tips or your finger pads. If you’re talking in terms of penetration than it’s semi dangerous for tops if they don’t use toys/have the index trimmed, a bit the same for verse, but most bottoms will be fine if they use toys.

Hey, some bottoms just happen to need 25cm long hello kitty nails to feel euphoria (totally not me ack ack) 💅 💖


If you’re worried about this then you’d probably run if you saw 35cm ballerina points lol.
Ngl it's been a little inconvenient 😅 I wanna get a couple of smaller toys for getting started so I can keep my long pointy nails but it's just not the same 🤷🏻‍♀️

I also don't think I have the heart to tell my nail tech to give me a couple short ones 😬
Thank you! ❤️
They're super sharp esp when they're fresh. I use them for opening snacks 😊
❤️ don't worry I'm careful, I'll only scratch if it's asked for 😋
Thank you! ❤️ 😊
Toys work well since both myself and my girlfriend have this nail shape.

I also type with the tips of my nails when I'm at work, it's fine bc my keyboard there has really light switches but at home my custom keyboard has really heavy switches so it hurts to type after a page or so 🫤 I gotta make another one soon. I built it before I learned the joys of acrylic nails.

I'm not even sure these are within dress code at my job but 🤷🏻‍♀️
I mean, I wish I could have long nails period but
1) soft as tissue paper so they just rip
2) professional reasons I can't have any length but ""as short as you can get without drawing blood"".
Asking for a couple short nails is gonna be way easier on them mentally than some of the feet I'm sure they have to deal with. If they know, they know. If they don't, they don't.
When you love stilettos/sharp almonds and everyone’s slightly intimated of your claws lol 

My partner is frequently afraid I’m gunna accidentally take someone’s eye out since I talk with my hands 💅💖
Oh yeah you definitely can only use certain types of keyboards, I had the same dilemma when I first got into acrylics and had to switch my keyboard out but now the one I have now is perfect. I find it hilarious how some people hate the sound of long nails typing but I love it, I find it really calming and makes me happy to remind me I have pretty nails lol. 

Dress code can shove it, unless it’s a legitimate safety concern when working in hazardous environments, employers should have no right to dictate how someone chooses to personalize their body, capitalists have become too comfortable thinking they can control peoples right to expression. Try and take my nails and your gunna get the claws lmaoooo
You could do some temporary press on over the weekends or something, if you get a weak enough glue you can soak them in a warm bowl of water to release them that way you can take them off when you have to work but also get to do a fun look on your days off. I grow terrible natural nails so I have a pretty extensive collection of acrylics that I swap through. You should give it a try! It’s really a lot of fun.
I get a lot of comments from the boys at work saying I could take an eye or a throat, it's always funny 😁
The sound of acrylics on my keyboard at home is amazing 🥹

And yeah dress code sucks. I work with LEO so I have to adhere to a professional standard and a uniform. Minimal flexibility is allowed but no one's said anything and I've been getting these for like 3 months now 🤷🏻‍♀️

It sucks bc I really want more piercings and to dye my hair a super pale silvery blonde but I can't rn.

I could *probably* get away with the hair but not more piercings 😔

Nothing really near me and no money to travel to the next city that has a pride parade atm. :C
Some people are still taking precautions related to the pandemic.
My town is super fucking LGBT and super liberal, and yet they have no pride festival this month, no pride marches, not a single pride month event i could find, it's honestly bullshit. Maby the events are on Facebook idk I don't use FB. Our cities pride festival is in September???? It makes no sense
Oh, thank you!

I got that BoP like 15 years ago - hard to find nowadays. Think i saw some on etsy, though.
Join a local pride group organise a rally and be as fab as you look
Damm you could try and start one
It's a tiny-ass town in a rather right-wingish area - really not the place to start or find a pride group, unfortunately.

Last week was the pride in my city 💕		"Ugh, you are so cute, how was it did you have fun? 💁🏼
Beautiful 😍
So cute!
adorable
Aw you're so pretty I'm so happy for you. You're 100% goals 😭
Yo conozco ese lugar! I think
 Yay, Buenos Aires! Estuve ahí el sábado, qué buena marcha ♥
why you so cute?!
What a cutie
que bello cuanta gente de arg en este post
Iba a comentar en inglés hasta que vi los comentarios en español, jajaja
Please let me buy you

I mean what
I had so much fun! It's my second pride and I felt more confident than the last year. I went with my best friend and a really close friend of us 💕
It's Plaza de Mayo in Buenos Aires
Sounds fun, I wish pride stuff was still going on in my state!
Mala suerte que no pude ir, que piola que la pasaron bien!
I live in a small not exactly lgbtq+ supportive town so pride isnt gonna happen here"	dsk49z	trans	545	0.99	2019-11-06 18:07:32

I attended my first pride this last weekend! Picture was taken on the steps of the Idaho Capitol Building		"Beautiful!
Lovely!  Hope you had a blast!  Stay safe in Idaho!  (Lots of backwards folks there!)  ❤️
So proud of you living your truth, especially in a place like Idaho. You're so lovely, beautiful, and strong!! ps: I love your nails c:
Hey I was there too!! A few of my friends were running different booths. Glad to see others feel confident :)
Fellow Idahoan on the other side of the state. Thanks for giving me a little hope that maybe I can transition and live a happy life in this state as the girl I want to be. 💜
You look so happy!! I love the trans nails, too 💕🏳️‍⚧
So beautiful. Made me a bit teary pretty,proud,strong woman. Thank you
What a proud, strong woman. Congratulations.
Thank you! 😊🏳️‍⚧️💕
It was definitely a lot of fun! And I always make sure to stay safe. I grew up in a small town here and saw how horrible the people here are. Thank you for the kind words :) <3
Thank you so much! And yeah it definitely isn’t easy at times 😥 But I keep going to make a better path for those that will follow me ❤️🏳️‍⚧️
That's awesome! I love meeting local friends :) It was so much fun
My main advice is to be unapologetic about who you are. Live your truth and let people fall into line from there. This state isn’t friendly to us, but I hope that will change in our generation. You can do whatever you set your mind to. If you need resources or advice feel free to reach out to me! Us girls gotta stick together. And remember that you deserve to be happy. 🏳️‍⚧️❤️
Thank you so much! <3
Thank you for your compliments <3 This picture means a lot to me as well. Especially given Idaho's proactiveness in stripping trans people of our rights. There's a lot of work to be done here and I hope I can be part of the change :)
Thank you <3
Thank you! Girls together strong.
As the mother of a trans woman I am sending you my most heartfelt loving thanks for your courage and strength. And the biggest warmest hugs X
That means the world to me. Thank you so much! ❤️"	pq3b1p	trans	548	0.99	2021-09-17 16:19:00
An Interesting Conversation	"I had an interesting conversation on the bus at the weekend - it wasn't long, as this was a cross-town trip. This fellow sat next to me noticed my Pride buttons on my ruck and obviously knew what the trans pride flag looks like, because he said, ""God made you perfect. Why are you trying to mess that up?""  
I replied with ""God made me trans and this is my tribulation. I can either give up and die or try and make this shell inhabitable. Besides, my soul will be released from this prison after a while, so why not make it habitable in the meantime?""  
That made him shut up and - I sincerely hope - think about what I said. He got off a few stops later and I continued down to the Waterfront in peace."	"Awesome! I’ve thought something along this line for so long, but I’ve never heard anyone else articulate it.

Who am I to question why God made me this way? But, I’m perfect. I’m exactly who I’m supposed to be in this moment and I will always strive to be the best me tomorrow. Maybe God wants me to be the message of acceptance or tolerance. Maybe I’m supposed to be the one that causes some hateful bigot to question themselves. I don’t know. But Love is the answer.
holy sh8t you knocked him down right on the spot, great job.
I'm trans, and Christian, and I've never understood that argument. With that argument, no glasses, lasik, surgery, medicine, etc. Hell, you can't wear clothes, God didn't provide them for you in the womb. No shoes, same thing. No car, bike, bus, etc. God gave you legs.
Take my upvote
""God made you perfect""

Clearly, He did not.
I LOVE this. Its the perfect way to explain it to religious people 👍👍 awesome OP!!
You did a great job by telling him what it feels like to be trans! 💙
Your assessment was so valid even in the point of view of Christians they can’t argue with it
you went shakespeare on his ass
you handled that perfectly
That was just plain awesome! Power to you seriously best response
That was awesome. 

He came poking and you dropped a bomb right in his face.
[deleted]
Ugh, my uncle is kinda like this too, just without the religion part. So basically just an asshole lmao
yes. this right here.

I wish I could give you more upvotes...
I like to hope so, at any rate
Im glad you see it that way and I may steal this rebuttal if its ok
God did make people perfect. And then then sin fractured everything, every relationship. The relationship people have with god, with nature, with each other and even with themselves and their bodies.
I thank you kindly :)
So that was a fucking lie
:) thanks
who knew all those years spent in Law Society in university would yield positive results?
Lmao, truly did
At the time, I was leaning Thoreau, but yes :)

take my upvote :)
yes. a banana creme pie bomb

I’m making a pride colored jelly fish cat toy for my best friend’s kitty cat. Are these colors too dark? I feel like I need to remake it with lighter colors but not sure		"They’re a little dark but it looks really good
Honestly, I gushed when I saw this! A trans pride crocheted (assuming?) jellyfish cat toy!? It looks so adorable! If you're gonna remake it with lighter colors, may I make a mini suggestion? Cats can see blues, oranges, and yellows mainly, from what I remember. And as a crocheter, I know that a lot of yarn brands from what I've used have a neon pinkish-orange color. And I know from experience making homemade cat toys that that kind of color is my cat's personal favorite, she'll only play with the toys I make in that color. And it wouldn't be that different of a color scheme, it'd still be obvious what flag it is. Either way any cat owner would fecking LOVE this! I'm sure your friend and the cat'll love it to bits!
Stealth pride toy. 🎵 Is he trans or European  🎶
THIS IS SO CUTE I OOVE IT THANK UOU FOR BRINGIGN THIS INTO MU LIFE

Do you have an Etsy or anything? I want to buy one.
I thought it was holding a wizards staff for a moment.
This is so cute
Makes me think of Princess Jellyfish
Not at all it looks great to me. That’s awesome
Nooo dont remake it.

Yes the colors are a bit off, but hey, who cares!!:-D

It's your intention that counts, not if the colors are perfect.

Just explain your friend for short if he/she does not get it on her/him own.He/She will be happy anyways
Oh my god, this is one of the coolest things I’ve ever seen. 🏳️‍⚧️❤️
No way, that is *too* freaking cute! That is one lucky kitty cat!
Theres a good chance the colors will fade over time anyhow
this is really cute! the colors are a bit dark, but it’s still amazing!
That is so cute!
It looks super cute
Honestly, looks absolutely amazing.
Tiny bit dark but omg so cute! I love it to bits.
Omgggggggg i loveeee itttt!!!!!! I love jellies! And pride stuffs!!! If I could id have these everywhere in my house lol.
this remembered me kuragehime
Thank you! I think maybe I’ll try to find closer colors and if I can’t, I’m sure she will still be happy with this one.
Oooo thank you so much! That’s great to know and I really appreciate this suggestion!

i dont see the reason for face surgery. your face is already very feminine.
You don’t need ffs, but all that matters is that you want/need it.  It is your face after all.  I hope you get to have everything you want in life 😁

Not asking if I pass, just reminding people being a trans femme person (especially if you’re on HRT like me) doesn’t mean you have to be hyperfeminine to fit in!! Happy Pride y’all! ☺️		"Even for those of us that want to pass I often argue being “hyper feminine” is actually counterproductive. Passing is blending in. Sure miniskirts, fishnets, stilettos, etc. are feminine, but most women aren’t wearing that stuff most of the time. Look at any given woman on the street. What is she wearing? Probably a T-shirt and jeans. And if she is wearing something distinctly feminine, it probably isn’t *hyper*

Do whatever you want, of course, but if your goal is to blend in then dress for the occasion!
18 months HRT for those who are curious.
Based Queen (provided said title is as desired)
Thanks for the post. Seven weeks in. I know I don't ""pass"" but I fell intrinsicly better.
My gf is trans and she looks cute as a button when dressing masc, such butch, very fashion.
I didn't look at the sub and thought ""hey cool a pretty girl, is it selfie Sunday already?"" 

you look great, girl
YESSSSSSS Fuck passing culture. If a trans person wants to look feminine or masculine to fit in, more power to them. But I HATE how we post pictures asking “Do I pass” just to have other people tear us down by homing in on features most cis people NEVER would think to look at.
Yea but it be nice to be
My God you're beautiful!
Thank you for that! My coming out post was removed because I don't pass enough yet :(
I lived as a soft butch stem transbien for a decade before becoming a femme femme. You be comfortable in who you are and who you are becoming 🙂
You look really good! Still very fem even if it's not hyper feminine
Agreed! That's why my first new wardrobe items were a jeans advertised for women (different cut and I think it does look more like a woman's jeans indeed) and a bright long shirt and a shoulder free top ( that is amazing for warm temperatures!), Nothing fancy yet. I don't even have a skirt yet ( but i want one, but a knee long one probably).

It's hard to not overshoot my wants for presentation though. Firstly because I missed 35 years of dressing femme so I kinda want to do it even more now. I want to go out looking cute and pretty. But that i think works in a not hyper way
It's difficult :/
happy pride!
I agree! When I first started my transition I did the whole Barbie Doll thing every morning… like an hour getting ready. Now most of the time I go casual and wear what’s comfortable.
Happy pride. You look amazing
Very true, it’s extremely toxic for all femme presenting people out there no matter cis or trans. I just wanted my girlies to know you can be a tomboy and it doesn’t make you any less valid. 🥰
That's very true but my dream is to look hyper feminine, just once feel like some model or gamer girl u see only is my life goal
Lol, yeah it’s terrible for passing, but I love be a real life barbie doll. Hyper feminine just feels sooooo good.
As long as it’s not associated with being male I don’t care one bit ☺️
>""ShApE yOuR eYeBrOwS!""

&#x200B;

>*slightly dark lighting in the picture* ""You have beard shadow, sort that shit out!""
I’m of the mindset that question should be laid to rest and never asked again, but I understand for some it’s an integral part of their transition journey. It absolutely shouldn’t be seen as the end goal for everyone.
If that’s your truth by all means live it how you want! No one is more valid or invalid than anyone else ☺️
Thank you so much ☺️
I tried to go the very femme route, and it’s still nice to get extra done up for special occasions but in the end my go to is “stuck in ‘09 skater chic” and it’s honestly the most me I’ve felt in over a decade ☺️
“Why yes Becky, I do have a bit of stubble today. It’s just a thing my face does, would you like me to rip off just that part of my epidermis to make you more comfortable?”
Big agree! I understand passing is an important goal for some people. But the culture around passing is nearly inescapable and there are so many times “passing” gets used as a weapon against trans people who never even asked. Especially against transfems.
Well said, I'm not gonna tell anyone that they don't pass if they aren't hyper feminine, but i will tell anyone that i could only see myself as passing if i am hyper feminine
Of course! Keep being you!
That's the important part. Be you. 😊
I felt myself getting to the point (fairly early into my transition) feeling like I couldn’t leave the house without any makeup with out having intense dysphoria and once I became aware I decided cis women aren’t beholden to idiotic beauty standards and I won’t be either. I like to be a bit butch and that prerogative is mine and mine alone. Living my eternally senior year of 2009 skater chic truth for the rest of time.

Celebrating Pride with a first crack at Nail art.		"THAT'S REALLY GOOD!!! GOOD JOB!!!
This is your FIRST attempt??? It looks amazing????????? ✨✨✨✨✨
That looks great! Good job!

Also, pro tip for painting finger nails: when you're painting your dominant hand, hold the brush still in your off-hand and then move the dominant hand beneath that. And If you do get into nail art a little more, I recommend blue painter's tape for making straight lines, just make sure to let the base layer dry completely before putting tape down.
Did you paint the mail fully one color and then add the stripes, or paint each stripe individually?

I ask because when I tap on the photo to zoom in I get the broken Reddit icon and can’t tell how you did it.
That looks pretty damn good!
5th attempt overall doing toe nails but year first one trying to do something a little different.
Thanks for the tip, probably could have used something to straight it off, tap or a stencil so I'll keep that in mind.
Painted the blue first. Unfortunately the pink does not cover the best, pretty cheap nail polish so probably better in the future to use a better brand."	v5e0bf	trans	481	0.96	2022-06-05 14:03:50

I marched in NYC Pride! Unreal ❤️❤️ - 40 mtf Mom PostOp GCS/BA - Always open to questions ❤️😇		"You look fantastic and that looks like just an amazing time.

My city is really weird in that our pride parade is late July (no idea why).

I really hope I look half as good as you in a couple of years.
I've always wanted to go to a pride event!
I made a dealers ally at the one I was at, I was just chilling handing out pre rolls, condoms, water, snacks - i'm curious to see if anyone remembers because it was so fun and everyone was so adorable
how much did your surgeries cost?
Looks like it was so much fun!!! Glad you had a blast ☺️☺️
Looking gorgeous girl!! Wish I could go to a pride event and look as stunning as you. 🏳️‍⚧️💖🏳️‍⚧️💖
Hey I was there too! Nice! I wish I had that confidence! I’m still afraid to present fem even though I know nobody would judge me.
If you don’t mind me asking, when did you begin transitioning?
Was this at the bank-sponsored pride (official pride parade) or cool kid pride (queer liberation March 😎)?
Apart from a few wrinkles you absolutely do not look 40. Maybe 25-30
I'm so upset I couldn't make it this year.  You looks great
40???????
Ty! It was so magical!! Good you at least have a pride parade!! Rooting for you ❤️
Do it!!!
Lol amazing!
Bottom.. insurance covered! Boobs 7k

I Confronted my transphobic coworker.	"I finally did it. It’s taken me over a month but I finally did it, and left him stammering and tripping over his own words trying to explain and cover his own back and I just walked away, my dirty apron flowing behind me and a huge feeling of pride inside. I feel stronger than I have in quite some time.

Edit: Adding some story. When I started there was this coworker who asked me if I was a guy or a girl. This guy is like the high school class clown that isn’t funny, but no one tells him. I was excited when he asked because that usually means another person who’s getting it right. I told him I’m a girl, and he’s like aight. Since then he has been guessing at my birth name, calling me sir or gentlemen any chance he can get, bringing coworkers near me and then starting conversations about traps, and just blanket saying stuff about how I’m not a woman. I know this ain’t the worst stuff ever but it was tearing me down a bit. 
At the beginning of shift I held open the door for him, and he’s like just go. I walk through the door and he says Gentlemen first, ladies last. I wanted to deck him so hard. I fought the urge. 
At the end of the night he was hovering around me, I guess he had something to say and was waiting till I was alone, so I said something first, with people around. It was pretty much this. 

I essentially said “Dude, I don’t know if you think you’re funny or if you’re just a fucking Asshole, and I don’t care. Stop calling me a dude”
 -he interupts here saying he didn’t mean to- 
“no you’ve called me a gentleman like four times and you keep calling me a dude. Don’t fucking do it again”
Here he keeps trying to excuse himself,
Without letting him I say “No, don’t explain, I don’t want to see you I don’t want to hear you again. Don’t let it happen again”
I walked off with him stammering on his own words, which was kinda cool. I’ve always been soft spoken so I guess it was unexpected. It almost sounded like he might cry? I’m confused about his reaction to be honest. 
But I don’t care. I feel like I have super powers, and things are gonna change. I am a girl, and have been for a long time."	"You sound bad ass congrats!!!
Omfg wish I were this fearless. I still go in disguise everywhere.

This is considered harassment. If you feel comfortable doing so, make a note of each time this fool was harassing you and tell your supervisor. The notes help you keep a timeline and evidence as to what he said/did each time. If nothing is done about him, it could be considered a hostile work environment and you could maybe sue. Hopefully you nipped it in the bud already and you dont need to escalate, but you are well within your rights to do so at any time. I'm not a lawyer, I just read r/ legaladvice a lot lol
Fuck yes !!!! Proud of you
Plz give us the story I could use some tea this morning.
Fuck yeah girl! Way to go! 🤩
Good for you. There is a real big problem with entitled pigf...rs who think either its somehow charming, or if they don't act like a total drizzlesh.t, some gay communist will take away their rights to be a total drizzlesh.t. We need to take our LIVES back!

Why did you remove? I was trying to read
Putting assholes like this in their place is always great, and it’s always best done with words once you have enough experience with them to understand how they work
Proud of you
I’m so proud of you. Looks like this pup is learning how to bare her fangs. Miss you.
I wish my balls were this big, congrats
Good for you girl. Whenever this shit happens to me I end up decking them in the face off rip (went to anger management classes and got better) which is effective in putting the fear of God in a mf but not making lasting change. Good on you, I’m proud of you.
“ dude “ is genderless . Just sayin .
ur a whole BADDIE i love it
Thank you so much!! It was a busy day at work and I handled it well and I felt confident enough to do it, and I feel like I have superpowers right now!
Also here for the gossip :)
I feel confident in what I did, I wanted to share my celebration, and just enjoy it, but if you really want the.... strong language I used to do it I could share!
I added some details! I fell asleep right when I got home from work so it took a little while
I gave some detail! It wasn’t the most eventful thing. Just me and some harshly spoken words before walking away. It’s in the edit above!
Thank youuuuu
I don’t care what they think, as long as they leave me out of it, like cmon, do they not have their own shit to waste time on?
It’s edited in now!
I didn’t, I just edited in some details, idk if that breaks stuff or not
Thank you so much, I appreciate it
Howldy Mina! Hope you are well <3
I’ve been thinking of getting rid of mine, they are all yours lol
maybe to you, but not objectively.
Dude is genderless, saying “you are a dude” is not.
I added details for you ^-^
Details means a story- what had this person done/said previously? We don't know what you know unless you tell us.
Just read it. He might be an egg!
Damn, wen I was about to start, *bam* [removed]
Google it
True
That’s honestly one of my thoughts. But it’s also not my problem right now, so I’ll fix mine and move on, if he is, maybe this’ll help him.
Well here it is! My apologies, I’ve never edited a text post, didn’t know it would vibe away like that 

I Confronted my transphobic coworker.

I finally did it. It’s taken me over a month but I finally did it, and left him stammering and tripping over his own words trying to explain and cover his own back and I just walked away, my dirty apron flowing behind me and a huge feeling of pride inside. I feel stronger than I have in quite some time.

Edit: Adding some story. When I started there was this coworker who asked me if I was a guy or a girl. This guy is like the high school class clown that isn’t funny, but no one tells him. I was excited when he asked because that usually means another person who’s getting it right. I told him I’m a girl, and he’s like aight. Since then he has been guessing at my birth name, calling me sir or gentlemen any chance he can get, bringing coworkers near me and then starting conversations about traps, and just blanket saying stuff about how I’m not a woman. I know this ain’t the worst stuff ever but it was tearing me down a bit. 
At the beginning of shift I held open the door for him, and he’s like just go. I walk through the door and he says Gentlemen first, ladies last. I wanted to deck him so hard. I fought the urge. 
At the end of the night he was hovering around me, I guess he had something to say and was waiting till I was alone, so I said something first, with people around. It was pretty much this. 

I essentially said “Dude, I don’t know if you think you’re funny or if you’re just a fucking Asshole, and I don’t care. Stop calling me a dude”
 -he interupts here saying he didn’t mean to- 
“no you’ve called me a gentleman like four times and you keep calling me a dude. Don’t fucking do it again”
Here he keeps trying to excuse himself,
Without letting him I say “No, don’t explain, I don’t want to see you I don’t want to hear you again. Don’t let it happen again”
I walked off with him stammering on his own words, which was kinda cool. I’ve always been soft spoken so I guess it was unexpected. It almost sounded like he might cry? I’m confused about his reaction to be honest. 
But I don’t care. I feel like I have super powers, and things are gonna change. I am a girl, and have been for a long time.

I take a strange pride in knowing I'm a girl I would have been too nervous to approach before.		"Haha, in my youth, I wouldn't have approached you either. You have the strong punk/goth vibe that I used to envy and be far too scared to emulate.
You know, “being the girl you wouldn’t have approached” is an amazing goal. I’m inspired!
I know how you feel. 2 yrs hrt and I have bigger breasts than one of my exes 🤣
I am a girl for sure. But at this moment in time I cannot medically Transition. I am more comfortable and beautiful being out, but family is not supportive. Ugh. Your beautiful and gorgeous sister. So happy and jealous of you. You look amazing sis.
That stomach tho 👀
Yup I’d be nervous to approach you omg 
Daaaaamn!
Oh wowzers!
I would have been too nervous to talk to you too!
What mic is that?
what the fuck is this

&#x200B;
Despite the fact girls like this are my weakness and a dream to be with, I don’t know if I could approach you either, even though I’m pretty fearless when it comes to it. Fierce +100
The ultimate irony is that despite my scandalous fashion sense I'm secretly such a big softy, all it really takes is for someone to be kind to me and tell me I'm pretty and I'll start blushing and fluttering my eyelashes.  
If anything someone being nervous about approaching me would be infinitely more endearing than someone swaggering up and being cocky about it.  

It really is an amazing phrase, I am making it my goal as well!
It's a good thing to shoot for, if you're gonna take control over who you want to be it only makes sense to be the most **powerful** version of that person.

This is about as bold as I will go these days. I don't pass, but I don't care anymore... [https://imgur.com/a/CglMUDa](https://imgur.com/a/CglMUDa)  


OOh, and I made the dress myself!
Yeah! Lol. Considering egg me dedicated some pretty sappy high school diary entries to the girls I liked (read: secretly wanted to be like.) 

A selection from egg me’s diary in junior year:

“Her smile reminds me of the radiant light of dawn as it warms the skin on a frozen but clear winter morning.” 

Thank god I didn’t talk to anyone in high school or they would have thought I was the dangerous kind of weirdo, and not the “spends too much time on the Internet ” kind of weirdo. Lmao.
Nice! I have an AT2020USB+!

How 'bout the arm?
oooo, you shouldn't underestimate yourself, that is Such A Look. And I love that dress, you look great!

And I'm glad you don't get hung up on passing, the camera is very kind to me but in person I'm absolutely clockable myself, I've just found that in all the time I've spent talking and dancing (and just a little bit of flirting) with other women, both cis and trans, that has always ended up being one of the least important factors.

Plus you're cute, that never hurts.
Oh that's just a cheap boom arm off Amazon, it's not the sturdiest piece of equipment but it does the job well enough for the price. The trick is that it's installed on a really fancy mechanical desk so I can stand up while recording vocals without having to step away.  
That's super overkill for most people but I get a lot of use out of it just because of how I work in the studio.

Just had a shitty encounter at pride	"TW: unwanted physical contact 

There was this guy at pride I just talked to who was trying to get me to sign a petition and while he was talking to me he started complimenting me and he touched my hair and poked my exposed belly button and I moved away at that point cuz it was fucking weird. Like he just did those two things but I felt like violated a little? I don’t really know what to think right now because this is the first time anything like this has ever happened to me. He also misgendered me at the beginning of our conversation before correcting himself. He also also kept calling me “baby”. He was like 50 and the whole thing sucked. I feel like I’m not overreacting in how gross I feel right?"	"That's really weird and super gross. I'm sorry you had to go through that.
def not an overreaction, guys a fuckin creep
Definitely not overreacting. Touching without consent is assault.
Fuck that guy, he’s being a creep
No, certainly not an over reaction, he's a creep and likely a chaser.
I want to be another person to affirm that you are NOT overreacting. That person has no right to touch you in any way, and the creepy talk only makes it worse. 

I've had similar and worse, shock from what happened kept me from reacting how I should have. 5 minutes later I realized I should have loudly called them out, and in one case punched them. That shock delay is where I feel that ""am I overreacting"" thought comes from.
I hope you feel better, that stuff isn't fun.
Super very creepy. I’m so sorry you had to deal with that
You have been sexually assaulted. Report him to organizers and to the police. Full description and any details you remember are vital.
Ew, what a creep! You’re definitely not over reacting, that’s super weird!
What a shitty person, and no you’re not overreacting, he was fucking out of line smh
Omg, just hearing about it makes my skin crawl. What an absolute creep. I'm so sorry that happened to you.
I am so sorry that happened to you. Completely inappropriate you are totally justified in your feelings
I've had unwanted physical contact from others several times in various settings so far in my life. It sucks...  I truly am shocked every time. Like what is wrong with them? Raised by wolves? Alien?  Or are they THAT out of touch with what is considered acceptable behavior??
Definitely not overreacting. The guy is a certified creep.
Not over reacting.

Nobody likes to be touch by a stranger, especially at a civil rights event like Pride. 

A terrible irony.
Probably a chaser sadly in Lgbt event they are sometimes these people

It's easy to spot them with time

They misgender, they don't really know what they are talking about, they use old term like transsexuals or things like this

They are just here because they are attracted in a sexual way in general

You need to avoid them the most of possible

That's sad but this kind of person do this
This dude sounds like a real piece of shit. Several major violations of boundaries and personal space with a total stranger, there is absolutely no call for any of it. You aren't over-reacting, I'm sorry it happened.
I'd have recoiled so hard at the hair touch that the belly poke would never have happened, assuming I even let anyone get close enough to touch me in the first place. Don't blame you at all for feeling really gross by it. I have autism , so my skin crawling right now just thinking about an older guy with boundary issues touching my belly button. I cant even touch my own belly button without it feeling REALLY weird! 😖
Had similar issue at my workplace, guy thought he was being funny by grabbing my ear lobe and then touching my boob.. some older guys have no sense.
Not over acting at all. The dude is a douche bag.  People like that shouldn’t be there. And obviously, the org that he is with didn’t train him.
ew, fuck no :( I'm sorry girl
I’m sorry this happened. With my attitude, I would’ve smacked his hand or punched him in the face. I’m FtM but not passing so older guys still talk to me like that every now and then and it is CREEPY! They’ve been able to get away with it because before the millennial generation, women were taught to be docile. I had a conflicting upbringing. On one hand, I was taught to shut up, but also open my mouth if need be. Because of it, I have such bad anxiety and most of the time my wife has to handle it because I will shut down. It also doesn’t help I have adhd and autism. IF this ever happens again, and I pray to Odin it doesn’t, start screaming. That will knock the person for a loop and allow you to gain attention to what he is doing and give yourself time to get distance.
Yeah idk about where you live but pride in Brazil is a fucking cesspool. I went once and was horrified. Never again.
That sucks and I’m sorry. It’s sadly common for women. It’s hard to speak up in the moment, but I watched a lot of videos of women beating up men who groped them and it gave me the confidence to speak up. It’s easy to be quiet, but it only serves to make the assaulter more comfortable. Hopefully this never happens again, but if anyone makes you uncomfortable you have every right to speak up and if they try and downplay it make them know it’s not gonna be easy for them. Good luck.
Sadly, this shit happens to me all the time. Usually from older white dudes. It’ll be an arm grab, a poke, hand on the small of my back, etc. It gets really fucking old. I’m sorry you had to deal with this at pride of all places. That’s supposed to be our safe space.
I just went to my first pride parade yesterday and there had to be like 250k people there. I was also encountered by some people that made me a bit uncomfortable. When the petition guy approached me I just told him I just moved to LA and wasn’t registered to vote. There wasn’t much else to say at that point. The guy before him though was trying to get me and my friend to guess how much it cost to go on the Ferris Wheel and standing a bit too close and it kinda rubbed me the wrong way.  I thought he was the person running it, but was just some random dude that wanted to talk to two cus women waiting in line, I guess. I’m not the best socially, but it definitely felt off. Luckily he didn’t try to touch me. 

I’m so sorry you went through that and unfortunately think this probably has happened to several other people at these events. This is assault and you are valid. People should really just not touch people they just met at a social gathering especially when presenting under professional circumstances. That’s so creepy. I hope you can self soothe and parent and know that you’re away from harm. Comfort yourself however that presents to you and definitely talk it out with someone you feel safe around.
What that person did was technically assault
🤣 I have creepy old guys constantly calling my darling,sweetie, and making me feel uncomfortable as fuck. It's part of becoming a girl
I'm so sorry for you. Can you tell us where this happened?
sign a petition or was he just collecting names and addresses for his own purposes? he definitely sounds creepy.
Thank you. That’s what I thought but I didn’t want to claim that if I didn’t have a right to on this one
It's actually battery. Assault is a wrong act causing someone to fear harm. Actual touching without consent is battery. So both assault and battery happened here.
Assault is being in fear of an un-consented-to touching of an insulting or provoking nature. What OP experienced was actually battery, namely the actual touching, which is worse, and in this case, reeeeeallllly gross.
You described it so so well. It took me a second to even process what had even happened because it was so unexpected. I feel like I should have spoken up but I know I couldn’t have in the moment. Thank you
Ugh I wish I had taken a picture of him before I left. Unfortunately I’m really bad with faces and I don’t think I’d be able to give any information specific enough to avoid someone else getting profiled who isn’t involved
Thank you for sharing your experience and advice. I’m sorry you have to experience that even as a man. I definitely can relate to the anxiety making it more complicated though. I’m really glad your wife is able to support you in that way as well!
Fear has nothing to do with either definition. Battery is more about violence and harm as opposed to sexual assault which could be any inappropriate touching the victim does not want to occur/did not consent to.
What I cited is literally the historic legal definition of Assault: being put in fear of receiving an unconsented to touching of an insulting or provoking nature. 

The crime merges into Battery when the touching (*any* touching; not just violent ones) takes place. One may be battered by a nothing more than a tap on the shoulder if the other requisite elements are present. 

Sexual Assault is an entirely separate crime with separate additional elements. 

Having prosecuted all of these crimes, they’re forever seared into my brain.
Well you may live somewhere different than OP but I’ve never heard of anyone saying they were in fear of being touched so that meant they were assaulted.
That is exactly how Assault would be pled in an arrest warrant or criminal complaint all over the country. It is a legal definition literally hundreds of years old. 

OP, having been touched in an un-consented to insulting or provoking manner, was a victim of misdemeanour Battery in virtually any jurisdiction in the U.S.
the common usage of assault is that, but in most places the legal definition is different — that’s what the other commenters are talking about. Sexual assault is — in the US — often referred to as sexual battery or criminal sexual conduct, with variation between states.

Thank you! It's a bit calmer than it normally is actually
Lmao I thought I hid this post from my profile. How'd ya see it
Serious question:  did you *style* it to look like that, or does it just do that on it's own?  I ask because I'm super opposed to using products in my hair - I tend to play with my hair a lot and if the texture goes all weird it fills me with stress - but my hair pretty *naturally* wants to poof and life in and around my eyeballs.  So what I've been doing is just brushing it with a bit of oil to keep the poof down and then pinning it down with a barrette even though I'd like to figure out some way to let my hair be a bit free - just not directly in my eyeballs.

Yours seems to be of similar length and poof and doesn't seem to actually be trying to infiltrate your eyes.
It's up, who knows. You look good though
I have to throw my hair around and correct it a good bit to keep it out of my eyes. I don't use any styling product at all usually

Sorry to hear it's a source of stress for you
Specifically hid it so I wouldn't get bothered. Does hiding the post only hide it for me? That seems like a dumb way for that feature to work

A lesbian coven took me in and took me to several bars. I've never felt so apart in my life. I bought pizza so I felt part of the group but the  mature woman wanted to pay for everything. Best time I've ever had. Also I cried because my controlling roommate gave me enough shit to fill a doggy bag about how I should call and be more despite me apologigizing to the fullest extent for coming home at 9:30. There will always be problems. Pick your battles.
 
Edit; mu phone died before I could tell them I'm safe
Having a protector is all cute and all but she also really needs to respect your boundaries, girl! 
What use is someone’s help if it makes you feel like shit?
Thank you so much.
Huh?
Maybe baby lol I went back later in my bikini top and shorts.
Don't sweat it!
I've just been holding my cat crying for 2 hours fuckin hrt

I was out in Belfast today and everyone is still doing pride month, stores and even some people were wearing flags so I joined the party and I felt euphoric as fuuuck so have some me enjoying my late birthday party! everyone was so friendly too..first time I've felt properly safe		"please excuse my face lol
That is so fricking wholesome, I wish I had the confidence to do something like that haha. You go girl!!
Beautiful 🥰🥰
That's super awesome!! Hope it was as fun as you make it sound ^ ^ ❤️
Lovely!

I’m originally from Belfast and have a lot of family still in the area. It’s a beautiful place! Glad to hear it’s doing a lot better on queer friendliness - it’s been a long time since I was back there.
YOU LOOK ADORABLE!!!
You love to see it
if there's ever a pride event or something near you and people around you are doing it I highly recommend it!!! it's so fun honestly
thank youuuuu I definitely felt super beautiful XD
I'm not sure how it is on the friendliness usually but Belfast was doing a load of pride stuff yesterday so everyone was happy because who isn't happy during pride!!
eeeeeee!!!!!!
rn I definitely do
There’s one in October I might be able to go to, the one in June I would’ve needed my parents to take me to :/
Hell yes!

My mum’s parents lived right below Cavehill, in Slievedarragh, which is just a beautiful location
I would love to actually go to a pride parade itself but I'm in the same situation really, I can't go because of parent stuff, my dad didn't know Belfast pride was on today tho lol (there was an online parade or something?..) everyone was still clad with flags tho so it was still fantastic
I don't know much about the area around Belfast so idk where that is but I might visit there eventually
That's awesome, maybe I'll try to sneak it past my parents somehow XD
if you do make sure to tell me how it goes xddd
LOL, for sure XD
I hope it goes well :D"	ovhaxe	trans	363	0.99	2021-07-31 23:23:53

"My School District banned pride flags in the classroom because it is ""too political"""	"&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/x7lkilre5oca1.png?width=1200&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=7a1a954ef70920bcbca3cb84ba27e2918b7ce0fc"	"here is some more info for you guys:   
The policy specifically says employees should not “advocate” to students on “partisan, political, or social policy matters,” or display any “flag, banner, poster, sign, sticker, pin, button, insignia, paraphernalia, photograph, or other similar material that advocates concerning any partisan, political, or social policy issue.” An early draft of the policy prohibited materials related to “gender identity,” and “sexual orientation,” but school officials removed those terms after legal review and replaced them with “social policy issue.” Hunter told The \[NEWS OUTLET\] that the policy will ban Pride flags, as well as “Blue Lives Matter flags, anti-abortion flags or any other flags that advocate on social policy issues.”
I do not think they can legally do that, right?
Isn't the act of banning them political, they're taking a legislative stance on a means of expressing the recognition and celebration of minority groups? 
They're just trying to label it as too political because they're either personally against those things or afraid parents and funders are against those things.
Flags everywhere. Make them censure you. Sue their arse! If it's a staff only thing, we'll, the GRSM students gift a flag to their teacher,.as often as it takes.
Ah yes, Pride flags must be banned for being political. Unlike every other flag, including those of countries and nations, which are not political.
That moment where your mere existence is ""Too Political""
And by “treatment”, do they mean silencing and punishing students so that they fear going to school?
This doesn't sound legal.
I’m a nonbinary teacher who uses they/them pronouns. I teach 7th and 8th grade. My state senate just introduced a bill that would allow any parent to sue a school if their child received any “instruction” related to gender identity.
Did they take down the national flag too? That’s pretty political…
okay i have no serious response to this buffoonery so im just gonna say this is a dangerous gooberly bruh moment
OP, are you in WV? Because this exact “debate” is going on here.
if your school has any sort of gsa maybe you can get them in on some guerilla pride flag plastering. at least from the headline it looks like its only for teachers.
Lol see if I was the teacher and I had the balls. I would put up the “straight flag”(bc I know there is one that people made in mocking) and be like here this is a pride flag too.
A pride flag is only a political symbol of hatred of LGBTQ people is considered an acceptable political position. If you aren’t homophobic, pride flags are just part of the status quo. 

I don’t expect I’m blowing anyone’s mind on this sub but it sometimes helps me to just say the quiet parts out loud.
Why black put the name of the creep superintendent?
This makes me so mad. I’m a teacher and wear my trans pride pin every damn day. I’ve had a few of my 5th graders come out to me because I was identified as safe. 

These policies will do nothing but hurt the kids. 

As so many others have said, protest by holding the school accountable to a T. If they do ANYTHING political (even saying the pledge) report it as violating the policy. If they are going to be bigots make them put it out there plainly and don’t let them hide behind those buzz words. 

Our identities are not political or partisan. We are who we are. I do wonder if school districts in less conservative areas might ban pride symbols because of people like LOTT because they are afraid of what her followers will do if they can identify the school…
Even if it was a political issue, how can you ban politics in a democracy? Isn't there constitutional rights of political freedom or something? How are you supposed to teach democracy if you're not allowed to talk about politics?
What if everyone starts wearing rainbow/trans colors everyday. Play dumb when questioned - what this? I just thought it was a nice outfit.
This is crazy, and without going to far into Florida's ""don't say gay"" policy banning gender and gender expression outside of the cis het model from third grade up to sixth (which I mean, how is a story about gay penguins gonna make kids gay? When a lifetime of watching cis het couples have kids on family TV totally made me a cis het person who's gonna incubate 10 kids /s)

To keep things lighter this reminds me of a sketch I can't currently find of a teacher in a pronoun banning district trying to read or teach some basic thing without using any pronouns like ""He *oops* I *fuck* they *oh my god* it *ugggh* "" while just trying to say two words. If anyone knows what I'm talking about and can link I would much appreciate.
There’s another flag that’s way more political- don’t know if you heard of it - The United Sates if America flag- yeah maybe we should remove that as well
If I was a teacher here, I would respond by putting subtle pride flags everywhere!!
It’s unfortunate but true that LGBTQ rights are political. The Republican’ts have made oppression of our people a part of their party’s identity. I think this is a sad statement and a major indictment of Republican’ts. History will be as kind to them as it is to those who opposed civil rights for black people—assuming Republican’ts ever allow true history to ever be taught again.
what about Tinker v. Des Moines??
I‘m so grateful my school in Australia is a very welcoming and accepting place for anyone, but I feel so awful for the things people in other places have to go through.
That’s fair, no politic at school
cool so your school cannot teach any history or social studies courses at all, because those all refer to partisan political issues. hell given how many people believe the earth is flat and evolution is fake, science could be considered a partisan political issue. english language features the use of pronouns, toss that out. guess the only thing that's safe to teach is pure mathematics.
So, technically, this would include the American flag too because of the BLM movement and the kneeling at the anthem a few years ago.  They would be breaking their own rules if they don't count that.
Solution: get as many students as possible to bring pride flags with them to class, ally flag included. Get enough students on board and it won't matter that the teachers can't do anything
I mean, from the wording of the headline it sounds like it only applies to staff, which they might be able to limit what their staff can display in classrooms and what not, and then if not a public school then they even more ""freedom"" to restrict others, which is still bad and this school is in part letting conservatives win.
Depends on where ig? If in America freedom of speech but not every country has that
The current de facto strategy among transphobes is to pretend there’s a “gender ideology” that “liberal elites” are pushing on society that ultimately results in harm to children and infringes on their rights.  Obviously the reality is that we are just trying to live our lives and we aren’t pushing anything on anyone, but they need to create a monster in the closet.

In this way, they can justify continued hate and oppression of trans people, restrict access to trans healthcare through legislation, and make it seem like they’re acting in society’s best interest to garner support.
it is a ""political"" stance
if pride flags are banned, american (assuming it’s america) flags must be banned as well
fuck yes. FIGHT BACK!
Must ban pride flags, not the confederate flag, the us flag, the german flag, russian flag, only pride flags. Too political yep.
There is also the sharp irony that these rules to reduce “politics” in schools are incredibly political decisions.
no, the teachers cannot have pride flags in the classroom
Guess u cant even speak about being urself then at school because one of ur students could ""slip up"" and say something to their parents, and then ur screwed. Sucks :/ Because ""instruction"" just seems like a fancy word for ""talking about it"".
no way! you have to know which slave state youre giving your life for.
I think there was a Supreme Court case about a similar issue where kids protesting the Vietnam War wore black armbands. The school tried to ban them.

Tinker v. Des Moines Independent Community School District
no. i am not in WV.
Get them to cancel themselves too, gg ez game.
But maths is liberal propaganda to control the masses!
yes indeed, but i do not know much of the specifics.
That’s not how freedom of speech works. Freedom of speech means I can sit here and shit talk the government and I won’t disappear for it. Freedom of speech is not I can saw whatever and have no consequences. Freedom of speech is means I can say I think Mitch McConnell looks like an orc reject and has no business telling anyone what to do, but since I made no threats the government can’t legally do anything. Same technically applies to fuck the police, but I wouldn’t recommend that since most police are sketchy.
It's incredibly disheartening that such obvious and bigoted lies are used and believed so easily to erase and harm minorities under the guise of keeping society safe and orderly, it's disgusting. 
They're the monsters in the closet, always.
Not even just banned, the flag would technically needing to be outlawed and whoever shares it would be KOS if just the trans flag is bad enough for being ""too political"", its only political because people make it as such.

Id assume teachers cant wear masks in that school either because coronavirus was ""political"", and I guess we can't learn about China, Japan, Germany, Russia, and u know all the major countries from history because thats ""political"", so they might as well just remove US/World History/US Government subjects.
FIGHT IT! STUDENTS CAN DO THINGS THAT THE TEACHERS CANNOT!
Just goes to show: this sickness is running wild all over the MAGAT states.
And education of your native language is just pure nationalism
pls start reporting your school for teaching history and having the american flag. it’s an easy way to fight back. and when they change their law to say “only lgbtq politics” start reporting them for teaching anything that mentions straight people because A for Ally (even tho it’s for ace/aro)
Freedom of speech is the right to avoid political repercussion for your speech, social repercussion is different
Shit. My group chat is apparently not the usage of free speech. Uhmm.. ruh roh raggy
>And education of your native language is just pure nationalism

OMG MIND BLOWN!

Americans these days have this weird thing where they are shocked when someone knows a language other than english!

Knowing another language really opens your mind to other cultures ect. and destroys the myth of the racialised other , of course USA don't wanna do that XD
No when they change it to only LGBTQ politics sue for hate crime
Why not both?

[update] I recently posted about my experience at GayPrideShop UK, they are now threatening to pursue libel damages.	"They should feel slightly ridiculous using their resources to intimidate a random transgirl into censorship, since I know they're reading this. 

I think I'm okay, as I didn't say anything that was untrue, and I can at least show the court my GP records.

If anyone has legal knowledge or advice I'd be thankful 🙏"	"You don't actually have to worry until you receive a solicitors letter or a court summons but I would stop making posts about them. It isn't worth the legal fees you'll incur
From what I've heard most companies will only threaten libel because they don't actually want to spend time and money on court costs. Usually the threat alone gets them the results they want. Try not to let them intimidate you. The truth is on your side.
It's only libel if it's untrue. However, don't continue talking about it in public. Other commenter is right.
Stop posting about it on reddit if they actually pursue it immediately and for the duration of the event.
You need to consult an actual UK libel attorney. Libel law in the UK is very complicated and involves different standards of proof from the US and most other legal systems.
WAHHH

let the whiners cry 🖕🏻🏳️‍⚧️🖕🏻(hope you get good advice sorry i don't have any 💙💖🤍💖💙)
The damage has already been done, your experience has been heard by all and will stop customers including myself as they treated you poorly.  The more publicity that is brought to the topic the worst they will be affected so if they (you gayprideshop uk) want this issue to not escalate, then they should refrain from threatening you with legal advice. If there is no more story to be told then no one new will hear. 
Theres only two roads:
One-your telling the truth(i believe you) therefore they cant legally pursue you as they have broken multiple workers rights and would face massive financial repressions themselves at trial.
Two-they have done nothing wrong and will therefore hunt ya down. The famous saying ""if you have nothing to hide then you have nothing to fear"" rings true here, if your telling the truth then nothing will happen to you😖


Side note: happy thoughts im sending your way as its bs them doing what they did and threatening now
Isn't that against reddit TOS for them to do that on this platform?
Unfortunately, lawyers will definitely not offer specific, actionable legal advice on the internet, which means that the only people who will give you any are specifically people like me, who don't know what we are talking about. If a lawyer contacts you on their behalf, then you're going to have to hire your own, comply with their demands, or ignore them and hope they're bluffing. I have no idea which one of those is best. You could pay for a consultation now to see how seriously you should take their threats, but it sounds like that might be a bit pricy for you.
If you got proof, just wait for the court summons, show up, and show the proof to have the case dismissed and counter for legal fees.
Sad we have to stifle our issues because we don’t have the money to fight for what’s right.
Libel law is a bit complicated. They actually have to send a request to withdraw the alleged libel before commencing legal action. You can withdraw the alleged libel and there's nothing they can do to you. It's not actually something you can ignore and they know it and they know most people can't afford to fight.

It's possible to libel someone with the truth if it's said in the wrong way if the way it is said causes a libel.

Given the allegations made against them if there is even a shred of truth in the allegations they deserve to get done and then some.
[deleted]
Some lawyers have free consultations it might just be a matter of finding one
No. Going broke is always an option. But slapp suits are a thing.

I think the UK is more favorable to the defendant in civil suits where the plaintiff looses or drops case. So there is that.
>It's possible to libel someone with the truth if it's said in the wrong way if the way it is said causes a libel.

What?
Are you sure? I thought the accuser (the company) has the burden of proof, and not only must they prove it’s false but also damages incurred due to the alleged libel
Speak with a libel lawyer. They will say the same thing I said but use more fancy words and more paragraphs and charge you a substantial fee.

Or you could read up on it yourself. I did!
US info: also worth noting the law is different (literally, not just a metaphor or how it's applied, but literally different) for famous people, which adds to the possibility for confusion.

Something about 'actual malice' which has a specific legal definition.
Yeah, I think that's going to be exceptionally jurisdictionally dependent. Given Google says, on many sources...

>**Truth is an absolute defense to libel claims**, because one of the elements that must be proven in a defamation suit is falsity of the statement. If a statement is true, it cannot be false, and therefore, there is no prima facie case of defamation.
Correct, but remember logical truth and reasoned truth are two different things. What might be reasonable true, can be logically untrue, and vice-versa. 

That is where lawyers come in, because law is very structured, and if you don't know the structure, what you may find reasonable, may not be logical under the law. 

That is why Libel is to go to for SLAPP because it is very easy to overwhelm someone without an attorney, and billable hours skyrocket if you retain an attorney.

In the US, you would look for an atty that is willing to offer contingency, but you will normally only find those for:

Clear and easy wins.

Activists Lawyers who see a chance at establishing case law.
SLAPP suits against small targets are why the billionairess JK Rowling gets away with it. As for boosting JKR and other terfs big media are using loopholes in press regulation and criminal law to keep regurgitating slander and legally and scientifically bogus statements against the trans community.
Yeah, I don't really have a difficult time separating fact from opinion, but a lot of people do. In that context, I see what you're getting at.
Yep. Money makes you immune to SLAPP.
If my daydreams I'd like to see activists sit down with lawyers and construct a very clear and hardhitting opinion that JKR is a transphobic bigot and publish it then watch her either chicken out or lose a libel case.

Money also helps insulate you against the transphobic NHS. Seriously, I wish they would just give us the funding like they would in Germany or France and go to anyone we like. The GIC's might suddenly start being nice to us if they faced losing their jobs."	tjzb71	trans	361	0.98	2022-03-22 09:47:16
Son wanting girls things	"I have a 5 year old autistic son who is my pride and joy. He’s always been interested in stereotypical girls toys such as baby dolls, dolls house etc. he has some girls Hey Duggee pyjamas and chose himself 2 play suits to wear during the summer. I allow him to be his free self. 

The other day he told me he doesn’t want to be a boy, and didn’t want to be a boy when he was little. I told him it’s fine to feel that way, and just because he’s a boy, it doesn’t mean he can’t enjoy girls things. He likes to occasionally wear make up and get his nails done with me. 

I’m now just wondering if I should change my approach. Should I begin actively taking interest in “girl” things with him? Or should I continue to wait until he requests such things? 

I have no issue if he is gay/trans/undecided. As long as he is healthy and happy and a decent person.

Edit: this should really be titled something else because its not really about him wanting “girls things” but more on how to support his choices. Also for anyone who may not like the way I may word somethings, please remember I am talking to a 5 year old autistic child who needs language simplified. I have told him he can play with whatever toys he wants, wear what clothes he wants (I’m going to take him shopping and let him choose all his own things). Thank you for the comments so far."	"Consider also r/cisparenttranskid.  Just support them for now and take their lead. If they're trans then great and no permanent decision will be made for a long time. If he's just feminine that's great too. They'll figure themselves out in time. Just give them the space to explore. Side note: I think trans people are more likely to be nuerodivergant but I don't recall the percentage increase
Trans people are much more likely to be autistic or neurodivergent than the general population. It doesn't mean that they are trans, but they are asserting a gender identity really hard at a young age. Some kids just know and I think your child does. The big thing here is freedom and acceptance and I think you're doing a good job with that.

It is pretty dismissive for them to tell you that they don't want to be a boy and for you to respond with boys can do girly things too. Liking girly things and being a girl are two different things. I would ask your child whether they want to be referred to as a girl or boy and respect their wishes. They might change their mind in the future, but that would be perfectly fine!

I think you should engage with your kid and do things that interest them or that you think will interest them. It doesn't have to be intensely gendered. But, yeah, do girly things with them as well as not girly things.
You never made them feel like they couldn't do certain things as a boy, so if they say they want to be a girl, it's probably not just about them liking girly things.  


You should at the very least teach them that trans people exist and that you'd be okay with them being trans.  


And it's okay if they think they're trans but they're not. Let them explore, there is nothing inherently harmful about it, while taking away their agency on the matter is inherently harmful even if the person making decisions in their place were right. Autistic people often struggle with people taking away their agency, so this is doubly important
if they tell you they don’t want to be a boy and have never wanted to be a boy, responding by telling them they’re a boy is invalidating and dismissive, even if it’s in the context of telling them they can be whatever kind of boy they want. you’re still mandating their gender even if you’re not policing it’s expression.
I suggest you check out Gender Spectrum, an organization with resources specifically for families with children like yours. https://genderspectrum.org/

One thing I've heard is that a trans child will be ""persistent, insistent and consistent"" in expressing their identity. If that describes your child's interest in being a girl, it might be worthwhile to let them experiment with living as one. Keep in mind that names, pronouns, and wardrobe changes are easy, low-risk and require no long-term commitment. It's not like your child is getting any irreversible changes done.
Well my advise is to try and see a therapist specialised in trans healthcare so you can support your kid to the fullest if he does turn out to be a trans girl. If he doesnt then theres no harm done.

Thank you for being an amazing parent, not too many people ask for help from trans peeps regarding trans stuff and the fact that youre trying already means the world
Im autistic and also knew when I was very young, probably 7 or 8 for sure. I didn't start medically/socially transitioning until I was 24, and I was in denial for my entire teenage years. I can say that if I had supportive family as a kid, and had the freedom to just *be* a girl at that age, my childhood would've been so much more fulfilling and less traumatizing. 

I try really hard to focus on the positives, that I can live happily as a girl now. But I, and most trans people I know, feel like they missed out on a full childhood. I also have permanent changes from puberty that could've been halted.  

It seems like you take your child seriously, which is awesome to see. I don't think it's too early to have the conversation about whether they want to be a boy or girl, or neither, and treat that seriously. However, my advice is, I think it's important for you to create an environment where gender and expression can be playful and fun too. Part of what held me back for so long was the idea that gender and sexuality were a fire and brimstone topic (southern baptist yeehaw). Good luck!
I think some people in this thread are jumping the gun in deciding that your kids is trans. Just let your kid do their thing and be supportive of whatever their interests and choices are, there's no need to make major life decisions at this age
Usually you shouldn’t assume someone is trans because they like stuff that’s stereotyped to be liked by the other gender, but if they say they don’t want to be the gender assigned to them at birth, then it’s safe to assume they’re trans
Honestly it sounds like you're doing great. Kids, especially neuro-divergent kids, need to come to things on their own. The best thing you can do is not to be an obstacle, and you're doing a great job at that from the sound of it.

If your child wants to do ""girly"" activities, participate, but I'm not sure initiating is the best thing here. I've worked with a few neuro-divergent kids (I'm neuro-divergent myself) and it's always a challenge to figure out the best way to communicate with them.

It sounds like you love your child and that they know that in their own way. And they get that you support however they choose to express themselves in positive ways.
Hello my lovely 💛 you sound like a lovely parent and I'm so glad your child has you. I think it's best to just follow their lead, if they want to do something girly then encourage it and support it but sometimes they might want to do something that is typically a boy thing. Dont overthink it too much they will find themselve and grow up happy if you support them. Also I would suggest if they are saying they don't want to be a boy, instead of saying you can do girl things maybe try saying they can be a girl you want 😊 it's small but I think it will help them feel safe and free to be who they are if their gender is a choice rather than what gender norms they do. I hope this help💛
Probably let them know that being a girl is a thing that they can do.

I am also autistic and had those signs but I wasn't really told I was allowed to be a girl, and all the culture thrown on top of little boys is the whole ""boys rule, girls drool"" stuff which can caused me to hide my dysphoria until my life dissolved in front of my eyes.

Tbh, just be glad they are telling you this. A full childhood of dysphoria can cause a ton of damage to someone psyche.
Just want to say you sound like a supportive parent regardless of your child's path and wish there were more parents like you out there!  

I think just letting them figure out themselves at their own pace and giving them that space and support to do so is amazing, like you are doing.  If they are interested and want to share, I think they always appreciate that encouragement 😊
Just wanted to say that i love seeing posts like these, it makes me so happy to see good, supportive parents out there :)

My advise is let your kid experiment! Ask them what feels right and definitely ask about pronouns! If you keep an open mind and lead with love you’ll do great ☺️
You do just that, support him. Get him kids books about different genders, sexualities, books about two same gendered parents etc and see what happens. He very likely lacks better words, as would many children that age. Or maybe hes just drawn to the color scheme of toys marketed for girls. Who knows!? Just keep listening, letting him lead, and believing him no matter what.

I have a 4yo who loves girls things but is 100% sure her p3nis is in the mail and she does NOT want a period ever but shes going to make babies one day. Idk what that means in her mind right now and i dont really care. Shes 4. Im just creating a safe space for her to keep this conversation going.
(Trans Guy) the best thing you can do is let them explore their identity. Ask them if they want to be called a girl and if they say yes then start doing so until your kid is around 12-13-14 then ask them if they still feel like a girl and want to go on puberty blockers which are 100% reversible if they decide that's not them. If They do go on puberty blockers and still know they are a girl then at 16 you can do hormone therapy. But for now just support your child since there aren't many parents that do.
I don't know? I'd just let him decide on what toys and stuff he wants to do. Though I will say it's a little odd for him to be exploring his ""gender""(?) this early. But he's probably just being a kid and I wouldn't think too much into it. There's no real way he understands gender at this point in his life. If he's trans he more than likely won't know and won't come out until he reaches his tweens/teens. The most important thing to remember is that being gay/trans isn't a choice and nothing you do can really stop it from happening. Also remember that gender and sexuality aren't connected, he could end up being a trans woman that likes women. Just remember to be supportive of him and do not keep from doing ""girl things"" if that's what he wants to do. Though as I said he's probably just being a kid and doesn't really think anything of it or understands the concept of gender yet. 

Also you could do some research into having a trans child just in case it comes around. There's is a term in the trans community called an ""egg"" that he would fall under if he was trans. Just remember also if he does turn out to be trans and mentions wanting to start hormones (and ultimately this is your choice) it is far easier to transition during actually puberty. I regret and somewhat resent my parents every day for not letting me start hormone replacement therapy at 13 when I wanted to because now daily I have to shave facial hair and body hair every week or so.
Sounds like your child is trans. You should take them seriously, listen to them, and make this an open point of conversation.

Also maybe refer to them in neutral or feminine ways if they've expressed that they're not a boy.
(Second paragraph): this really triggered me, too
It's wonderful your supportive of your trans kid.

Watch that video. It might help.
Encourage exploration? Try feminine and masculine things together.
just have a conversation about it, ask them these things, I would also ask if they would like to try new pronouns and/ or name
So this is actually something that can be hard to place. A number of trans people are autistic (myself included) and a number of autistic people may question their gender, but are not trans. It is all very complicated and I don't understand it all myself but what I do know is I and others precieve gender differently, and while there is a link to that and being trans, it is not necessarily the case either. I am not a parent but I do know that things would have been a lot easier for me if I had a parent who supported my interest in toys of the other gender, and talked to me about gender expression and the idea of being trans. I can't tell you if your kid will grow up to transition one day, maybe even in the next year, but I do know that he will always break the mold when it comes to gender stereotypes, and that is something that should be supported. I don't know if that helps, and I think you are already doing that to some degree or another, but I think support, education and letting him chose what he will is the best way to go, and let him give you signals of his needs and preferences.
Going against the grain here, but I do not think you need to/should ask you child to decide whether they want to be a boy or a girl, then based on their response, make commitments to that ( e.g. refering to them as a girl thereafter) particularly without them asking for that thenselves. especially at such an early age. I think you don't need to ask your child searching questions about these things in general and can just accept them and follow their own lead as they explore their own identity, while offering an accepting environment for them. I think these are huge questions to ask a very young child while they are still exploring gender and its essentially like forcing someone out of the closet e.g. asking your child if they are gay or straight. I think that continuing to accept and support whatever interests your child has and giving totally neutral and accepting responses to comments about the child's own gender is more helpful e.g. child ""I want to be a girl"" adult: ""OK :)"". You can just create a generally accepting environment by making comments such as ""you can be whatever you want to be"" and ""I will always love you whatever happens"". I think you can treat the feminine interests as you would any ither interests in a childs life, you dont need to prticualaly encourage or doscourage them, just show accepting appreciation and enthusiasm. I also don't think you should be worried that telling him he is a boy was wrong or harmful. Obviously I don't know your child or how aware he is of gender yet, but I can only imagine its very basic as he's only 5. many autistic 5 yos haven't yet or have only very recently began to actually understand/recognise gender in its most basic sense yet, and even typically developing children normally develop typical use of pronouns he/she/him/her/his around 4. Its relevant for many typically developing children to explain and help label boy/girl/man/woman just for them to get the basic idea that gender exists before they can even understand their own gender identity based off that.
Sounds like you're on the right track.   Just love and support him no matter what and make sure you always listen to what he says, not what you want to hear or think he means.
Support him. If he turns out to be cis, cool! Trans? Also cool! Maybe go to someone specialized with that kinda stuff.

The best thing to do is to acknowledge your child's identity early on. I was like him when I was younger (though I wanted to be the opposite of a girl) but I didn't have the same support you give your kid, and that caused a bit of issues with figuring out my identity. Just give your kid unconditional love!
The medical/biological reasons why remain mysterious, but there does seem to be a significant correlation between being on the spectrum and being gender non-conforming: Lots of autistic people are trans, and lots of trans people are somewhere on the spectrum. So that's something to be aware of.

But yeah, I'd changing your wording if I were you. It's not about ""it's ok to like girl things even if you're a boy"". Because honestly, you don't *know* if he's a boy. All you know is that he has a body that has a masculine configuration. But you can't read his mind. You can't look in there and determine what his gender identity is. He's the only one with access to his own thoughts and feelings. He's the only one who can observe his own inner sense of gender.

And he seems to be telling you that ""boy"" ain't it.

Obviously, approach with caution: don't rush into anything, given the language challenges your kid faces, make sure you understand what he actually means by what he's telling you. But ultimately, this is about respecting your kid's authority about his/her/their own identity.

And make sure that both you and your kid know that there's a difference between how your body is configured and what gender you actually feel like. For most people they match, sure, but for trans people they don't. That's the core of being trans.

There may be language challenges, but your kid is probably not dumb, right? So I think if you can educate them about the difference between gender identity (internal; only self-observable) and gender expression (external, visible to all), that you can trust them to think about that and accurately report to you whether these two aspects of themselves match (cis) or don't match (trans).
Your child reminds me of myself when I was around his age. We said and wanted similar things. Also, I’m autistic
Part of the problem with our society is that people feel like they have to ""pick a side!""  Why can't boys who like girl things and girls who like girl things just be and act and dress as they please, at a young age or as adults?  Women wear stereotypical male clothing all the time and have been doing so for a century (in this country anyway).  Hopefully, sooner rather than later, it won't matter what a guy wears in public any more than it does for a woman.  Feel like a dress, wear a dress, feel like stockings and heels, wear em to work or to the club.  Clothing and toys and games do not have gender and we harm our children by shoving them in the artificial boxes which society dictates.

I applaud your openness in supporting your child.  My advice would be simple to support them and love them no matter what they eventually determine is their path.
I don't know how to help but I want to say you are an amazing mom and the fact that you want the best for your child no matter who they are or want to be is an inspiration for any other parent wanting to do best by their child
Stop treating toys and activities and clothes like they're gendered and just let your kid do what they wanna do. Let them know that they don't have to be a boy *or* a girl, but they can be if they want to be, it doesn't matter. Don't choose things based on gender but just on if they sound like they could be fun.

Is it likely your kid is trans? Yeah, it's pretty likely from the sounds of things. Does that mean you should be pushing them in the direction of *any* gender roles? No, that's all stuff for your kid to work out for themselves. You just have to be open and supportive, and you need to be more open to the notion that gender isn't really as important as we often grow up believing.
It's amazing that you are supporting your child, no matter what they want to be. You could attempt going up to your child and offering to do one of these activities (e.g. nail painting, playing with dolls).
When they say they want to be a girl, your response is just to assume that they want to do girly things. It’s rarely that simple and often goes much deeper than that. Do they feel discomfort at the thought of being a boy? Have you asked why they want to be a girl? The best thing you can do is attempt to understand and in turn help them understand their own feelings. It’s also important to keep in mind that sexuality≠gender identity and gender identity is a separate concept from gender expression!
Neurodivergent people are 6-10 times more likely to be transgender, and about 10-15 times more likely to be LGBTQ+
This, absolutely this! Was actually wondering about the link between neurodivergence and genderissues too as I've come across quite some people with ADHD in other genderrelated groups.
Yeah, I would add irt the language used being dismissive, I'm autistic and I even now would not be sure exactly how to respond to just being told it's ok to like doing girly things. If I were you, op, I would now, after the fact, follow up and communicate explicit affirmation, as Lilly said here
⬆️ This!! 


I think 5 is a bit too young to even worry about whether a child is trans or not. I’d be supportive and let them choose their own path within reason. 
You are a great parent 😊
It’s not at all odd for him to be exploring his gender at 5. Many trans people have vivid memories of doing so at that age and being aware there is something “off” 
even younger. I myself remember being 3/4 learning to keep my curiosity and confusion to myself because it was condemned by my Christian family. I’m glad kids today can live in a more supportive world.
(Second paragraph about calling the child a Boy): this really triggered me, too

Sorry I meant this as a comment to what Iamcalledlilly wrote.
Ewww go somewhere else
yeah, didn't one study show that 1/4 of trans people are autistic?
Source?
can you gimme a source so i can send it to my parents
>[https://www.cam.ac.uk/research/news/autistic-individuals-are-more-likely-to-be-lgbtq](https://www.cam.ac.uk/research/news/autistic-individuals-are-more-likely-to-be-lgbtq)

That study says

""autistic adults and adolescents are approximately eight times more likely to identify as asexual and ‘other’ sexuality than their non-autistic peers. And there were sex differences in sexual orientation: autistic males are 3.5 times more likely to identify as bisexual than non-autistic males, whereas autistic females are three times more likely to identify as homosexual than non-autistic females.""

Didn't see anything about trans folks in that study summary, but I will keep digging.

edit: here we go -- https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32770077/
Can confirm as an autistic transgender individual
But wasn’t it also stated that neurodivergent people are more likely to look into those things, especially earlier on, than their neurotypical counterparts? Simply because we’re less likely to just go along with something when it doesn’t feel right.
Honestly I don’t think it’s that trans people are more likely to be neurodivergent but that neurodivergent people are more likely to come out as trans. There’s already a degree of separation from “normalcy” for a lot of neurodivergent people so we’re a lot more likely to consider we may be different from most people in other ways too
1st year psych dropout so take my opinion with a grain of salt. 

my hypothesis is that a lot of people on the autism spectrum do not see the normal, in-built societal norms. things like making eye contact, body language, certain behaviours, etc. and i think gender tends to be one of those. instead of it just being ""this is how it is for everyone"" autistic folks will go ""why though?"" 

again, i'm not doctor, speaking purely from anecdotal/my own experience as an autistic trans woman.
Oh.
lol
“Our group of people has a high suicide rate. The increase in social acceptance has increased our suicide rate. Your identity is a construction. You should encourage parents to construct their children’s identity around our group. Who cares if encouraging that will cause suicidal ideation”

You are advocating for a parent to treat their child poorly. The child is 5 years old. 

Think about what you are actually advocating
I think its 1/4 of trans folks are on the spectrum including things like ADD/ADHD.
I think so. It’s been over a year, and I read numerous studies.
Multiple studies including news media. I forget how I started down that path, but I believe there a study that is either Danish or Dutch that would be a place to start.
[https://www.cam.ac.uk/research/news/autistic-individuals-are-more-likely-to-be-lgbtq](https://www.cam.ac.uk/research/news/autistic-individuals-are-more-likely-to-be-lgbtq)

There are plenty of Google results alongside this one article
Yeah, I read something in the neighborhood of 10-20 different articles a little over a year ago to come up with my numbers. Sounds like I need to up them again, maybe.
They’ve done neurology studies that show gay brains function differently than straight brains. Trans brains function in line with gender identity, not sex assigned at birth. Age of exposure is irrelevant to the subject. Neurodivergent people are more likely to be LGBTQ+.
Yeah,this. NDs are more likely to be queer. 

It's thought that since we don't follow social rules as much it could be due to being able to come out/accept ourselves easier, but that part is t fact, just one theory.
I’m ND myself and came to similar conclusions some time ago.  ND folks are just used to being different and tend to accept the idea of being different in other ways more readily.  I don’t think that there being a higher percentage of ND folks is just true for identifying as trans but for any divergence from social norms on gender and sexuality.  We’re more habituated to being different.

I have seen higher than average ND rates among the local trans, ace, queer (in the broader sense), kink and polyamorous communities.  When you start overlapping those groups, the ND rate soars.  Among the trans folks in the kink community around here, at least half are ND and they’re almost always queer and poly too.  It’s like at some point we just come to terms with not following the social norm and are more willing to just try to explore the non-traditional.  Being ND doesn’t make us divergent on sex and gender but it definitely makes us more self-accepting if we are and thus more visible and out about it.

Our social awkwardness can actually insulate us from social pressures that neurotypical folks seem to experience (e.g. I have trouble noticing a disapproving look at my presentation from a stranger or understanding why I should care much even if I do notice it - as long as the people who are important to me are accepting, I’m good).  I don’t feel shame about being different.  I just am different and I am pretty okay with that.  

My neurotypical friends often seem to think I am courageous for being so openly different but I don’t think I am.  I think I just don’t internalize pressure to conform like they do so I never have to overcome the challenges they are projecting onto me based on their experiences and thinking.  It’s the ""marching to the beat of my own drummer"" thing, not bravery.
mad? i'm transitioning and happy, you're definitely bitchless
Thanks, I’m not doubting, it’s just a pretty staggering stat and I was curious where you saw it.

How do I support my child?	"I think my child (14) may be trans, curious, or questioning.  About two years ago they cut their hair short and I supported them. A year ago they started wanting boxer briefs for underwear and I have since only bought them those. They wanted a binder. I have bought several and supported them in wanting to cover their more female form. I have sat them down and told them that I love them no matter what and will support them in whatever they may want. I have asked many times if they have a preferred pronoun or name. They will never tell me. 

About a week ago I got an email from one of their teachers addressed to me but with a different child's name. I was confused and wrote the teacher back.  The teacher explained that that name is what my child goes by at school. I had not idea of this. I asked my kid about it and they said that yes, that is what they want to go by at school. I asked if they wanted me to call them that. They started crying and said that they didn't want to tell me because I gave them their birth name and they didn't want to hurt my feelings. I told them my feelings weren't hurt. 

Today when cleaning up some old school papers from last year I found a page that they had written on. They wrote that they want to be a boy. That they want male pronouns. That they wish they were a boy but don't want to make me feel bad that I no longer have a daughter.  

I am trying so hard to make them feel comfortable to open up with me. We live in a progressive town. I was raised progressive and open to all.  I take them to pride every year and am supportive in their interests and exposing them to as much as I can. I want so much for my kid to be able to feel comfortable and honest about what they need and want. I feel like I am failing. Maybe it is just the teenager not wanting to talk to their parent dynamic?

Is there any advice anyone has? It kills me to even imagine them suffering internally. Or to get made fun of. Or to be looked at differently.  Or face any kind of prejudice. I want them to be happy and healthy and love their life. And I want them to be comfortable sharing what they need with me. It breaks my heart that they may be suffering and keeping their true self from me to protect my feelings.


Edit:

Thank you to every one of you for taking the time to read and respond. 

I have such an amazing child and am so proud to watch them grow into themself.  I will be there and make space for them as they need it.  

I take everything everyone said to heart.  Thank you all so much."	"You sound like an amazing parent who is very supportive of their child.  I recommend also asking on r/cisparenttranskid. You may find good advice there from other parents of trans (or potentially trans) children.
I’m the parent of a trans kid too, and despite me having a gay dad, being bisexual myself, and being very openly supportive of all gender and sexual orientations, it still took my daughter until 17 to officially say anything to us, and then months more to her siblings. 
None of us had any negative response, and she said she didn’t expect one to, but everyone has their own timing. It’s not always obviously rational or personal.

You sound like you’re doing everything right, it is really hard to think your kid had been suffering and that you couldn’t Immediately fix it, but it’s often so hard for anybody to put their exact feelings into words, and to be vulnerable to peoples perception of those. 

Just support your son, and keep being a great parent. Since my daughter came out, I’ve had so many people ask how I’m coping? I’m fine! My kid is going to be happier! What more could you want? My only concern is checking no one else is going to be a dick about it.
I’m 4’11 but I’d take them on.
As an adult, its easy for us to forget that kids have trouble talking about major problems yet.

I'd recommend trying to go through mental health services. Mental health is very important for trans people and it will also open up the possibility of hrt

Edit:

I'd also like to add that there is 100% an element of shame and internalized transphobia among trans people. To this day I still haven't come out to my parents (who are very pro-lgbt) simply because I feel embarrassed and that it makes me a failure.
i doubt you did anything wrong. i felt the same way before i came out, and my parents were very accepting people and i knew that. even if you live in a progressive area, your child has probably witnessed or even experienced some sort of discrimination which could elevate his fear of coming out. coming out is scary as hell, even if you’re certain you’ll have a supportive environment. it requires being vulnerable about your feelings, your future, your body, etc. 

continue to do what you’re doing and it will do wonders for him. you’re doing great <3
You are an amazing parent and in this community especially we are so happy to have you :) 

I’d say don’t pressure him, as a 15yo kid who’s not out to his parents as a trans boy, I know it’s going to be hard for him to tell you no matter how supportive you are. So just make sure he knows you are there for him but don’t pressure him to come out to you, just give him time
You get the awesome parent award! You're doing amazingly well! They'll come to open up to you in time. It's because you're so close that they're afraid of changing things, not in spite of it. Also, it's not something a lot of parents handle well, so the caution is often justified.

I caution most minors against coming out to their parents until they're independent unless they're fairly sure their parents will accept them and they have a backup plan. Even for parents that may want to help their child, if they don't already have knowledge about trans people and issues, they're often filled with fear. If they try to learn about the subject, they have a good chance to run into anti-trans rhetoric that feeds those fears and tries to stoke them towards hatred. In the majority of cases, it doesn't even go that far. The most common reaction I hear about is denial. Stock phrases like ""you're too young to know"" and ""It's just a phase"" get thrown around a lot. It isn't the worst result, but having your identity outright denied like that couldn't happen at a worse time that the teenage years, the prime period of social exploration.

Compared to all that, you are a champion! Keep helping them explore and discover. Keep a lookout for articles and pieces on the trans experience and talk to them about it. That's what I think I would do, at least. You rock this whole parenting thing!
To me it sounds like your kid just doesn't want to disappoint you, as a younger trans person with the same sort of people pleasing tendencies I can understand a lot of what that's like. Thank you for reaching out and trying, there are so many parents who wouldn't and won't so it makes me teary to see such a genuinely good person. Give it some time, being trans is a whole process, it sounds like you've made it clear you love your kid no matter what. I'd say just keep up that support and go at your kids pace. You can also consider gender counseling and talk with your kid about that. Thank you for putting in the effort and good luck!
You sound absolutley awesome, keep being supportive and don’t pressure them to tell you, it will come
It's obvious they love you very much and don't want to hurt you.

If I was in that position, personally I would not make it a big deal because big deals are stressful. Just simply call them by their new name. ""Hey Paul it's dinner time!"" And start using they/them until they let you know they prefer male pronouns. 

I wouldn't let them know you've read part of their private old papers. It might feel like a breach of privacy and they'll open up even slower to you.

They will feel the weird energy in the air if you make it a big deal or stress too much about it. Be easy going and simply let it flow. That's how people act when they are comfortable.
As a trans kid with a supportive dad, this is a lot of fear surrounding coming out to parents, even supportive ones because of a long history of being rejected, and being surrounded by friends with negative experiences. While I wouldn’t suggest this for anyone else, it may the the right call in your specific circumstance to sit your son down, and tell him you know love him you know that he’s trans and are so happy he is starting to socially transition because you just want your child to be happy with gender not making a difference. Ask him if he wants you to set up an appointment with an endocrinologist for hrt, or if he wants to go shopping with his dad (if he has a supportive dad and not 2 moms or just one mom) for men’s clothing. If he has prom coming up, ask him if he wants to get fitted for a nice suit. 

Basically my point is, tell him you know he’s trans and you’re happy for him. Then make it abundantly clear you want to help him in his transition. 

The one thing I’d suggest is to make him go by his chosen name for at least half a year before helping him change it to his legal name. Changing a name is expensive and there may be name change limits. It’s a rule my dad put in place that I am glad he did.
You're doing everything right, don't worry.
What your child needs is time. Don't push for an answer. It will come. Being trans is very difficult and the first person to come out to is yourself. Sometimes you have to try out pronouns and names first before you can be sure what gender exactly you identify as. Gender is so very complex and being a teenager in itself is complex enough.
Believe me. You are doing enough. Spend time with your child. Quality time like playing games, seeing movies or going to pride parade like you said. You don't always have to talk to let your kid know they're loved.
Thank you for being an amazing parent. I wish my parents were so understanding but they were both born a long, long time ago and it's a little harder to grasp for them.
Stay safe, you're doing great!
Damn you're the parent I wish I had, if you act and feel like you say you do it's probably a combination of transition just being scary and also teens just not really wanting to talk to parents. 

Maybe subtilty bring up the topic of lgbt things during dinner and show you're supportive. And let them know on occasion they are amazing and your happy they are Finding themselves.
confront them with the paper you found and angrily demand to know who groomed them into thinking you'd be sad or disappointed or your feelings would be hurt, cause mister, you are forbidden from talking to those creeps ever again

/s, of course. i have no advice.
To much text. Based only on some of the top paragraph, just ask your kid, and respect and support their answer even if they don't want to explain or elaborate. And of course say the usual stuff like that you support them and all that.
I am reading the title again now, and my answer may be irrelevant, but in case there is a chance it helps, I'm still gonna click ""Post"".

edit: For clarification, ""To much text."" as in I'm too tired to make sense of more than a few sentences and spell a three-letter word right, cause I just woke up.
Emotions are a bitch no matter how old you are. My daughter(14) has had issues she's bi and some other issues we're working through, she was having a hard time coming out even though I'm trans and she knew that. My wife and I did all the same things you said you did. We talked openly about the lgbt community ect..., she had a hard time expressing her feelings in a constructive way so her therapist suggested the how we feel app. It's an app that let's you pick the emotion you are feeling at that moment and gives suggestions for how to deal with those emotions, it also has mindfulness exercises. The best part of the app is you and your son can both use it and share your emotions with each other without actually having to talk to each other and that might make it easier to talk about for your son since they don't have to be right in front of you or looking at you (not saying you're doing anything wrong just saying sometimes some people find it easier to just text so they don't feel judgment (also not saying you're judgemental that's just my experience)). My daughter loves the app at this point if my wife or I put some bad feeling my daughter will bust in our room and be like why does this app say your upset what's the problem. 

Tldr: the how we feel app is a tool you should look into.
> I feel like I am failing. Maybe it is just the teenager not wanting to talk to their parent dynamic?

You're not failing. In fact, the amount of nonjudgemental support you seem to be giving based on what you've written is astoundingly great and bc of that I think you're doing a fantastic job.

Im amab 20. I still live with my parents while in college. I really just started my gender journey 3 months ago, although there have been some potential light symptoms of it for the last 5 years maybe. Anyways, my parents are extremely supportive of me in my life, and are fantastic about having made me know that they have an extreme amount of love for me. So much so, that they've both told me that they love me more than they love each other, and that's really impressive considering they've been married for more than 2 decades and have a very happy relationship, and care for each other a ton. 

I say all of that to give you vast context for what I'm going to say next: they don't really know about my gender journey. Why, even when I know they're more progressive and would always love me? Well, various reasons. Mainly, I just cant deal with any questions or uncertainties while I still figure myself out. I want to be 1000% sure whatever I discover was *my* discovery, that I wasnt influenced by the significant power a parents questions have no matter how well meaning. And because of all that I just take things the direction of ""Im an adult, and I dont owe anyone information about myself until I'm ready, no matter how caring they are, and I can do the adult thing of taking care of my own shit and discovering it for myself.""   


My point is that this is me...... someone who's in the ideal spot to be lgbtq+ for the most part, well except that the place I live is very very VERY conservative.... but I could still safely express my gender in my home if I told them, but I dont. Instead, I lock my door, talk to them through it, and wear what I want to wear if I feel like wearing a dress or skirt, and otherwise when I leave my room I just hide my occasional tucks and try to prevent them from noticing the occasional bras if I feel in the mood for one.   


And yet my parents, especially my mom, would likely feel the same way you do. I would have to reassure them that I knew I would be loved, and they would support me. Although, tbh I do fear the well-intentioned but destructive questions that could happen. Like if I ever decided on a surgery or something. They care so they would ask ""are you sure"" in some way.  Obviously that would be quite an expensive decision that only really gets made when the person is sure anyway though. 

Anyways, the only difference is that I can say Im an adult, so that executive decision was on me. I dont fear disappointing them from this cuz I know they wont be, but a 14 year old fearing that disappointment has got to be under a lot of pressure. And it doesnt matter how great you've been to them, people still get extremely worried about this stuff. Like, many trans people already have to deal with their own imposter syndromes, so if they themselves are questioning their own ""transness"", then that fear will just multiply and be projected onto others and thus they'll fear telling those people even more. 

I dont know that I could really provide any specific advice here, but my hope is that by giving you this context from a grown-up kid's perspective you might understand that this isnt a situation unique to you. Every kid is different though, but some fears are based on other fears even when those fears  simultaneously exist beside many examples of ""loving supportive parent.""
You sound like an amazing parent I wish my father  was so progressive like this
You sound like an amazing parent. Transitioning is hard and scary. I knew my friends(who are all queer as is) and my work(a very liberal leaning field, with my company having numerous queer people in it) would be supportive and accepting. However, it was still incredibly terrifying to do. Especially with my parents. Let him come to you when he is ready and take no offense to him using a different name in school.
For context,  I’m 38 years on this earth and I’m very comfortable identifying to my self as trans.   And have been for years, I’m unable to start my transition as I’m married with three kids and things are complicated. 

I have yet to tell my parents, and I’m aware that my mother is fairly open and understanding.    

It’s just a hard barrier, it’s hard to tel someone that you have learned so much from and value their opinion say anything about the topic.  I don’t want my mom to ask how I’m doing with my issues because honestly it’s not great,  honestly it’s why I don’t seek therapy because I’m pretty sure I know the answers, I know what’s causing me problems, I know my barriers and I know that I may be happier if I did what’s best for me.    But that’s messy and uncomfortable, and I may lose more then I can repair.   

So it stays with me.   



I don’t mean to make this about me, it’s about you and your child.     But I hoped to show some insight as to why I don’t tell my parents.   

You are not failing, keep doing what you’re doing.   You’re an awesome parent.
From what you’ve said it sounds like you’re doing a amazing job. I can understand seeking additional advice though.
This is the kind of kid I was. I did my transition everywhere but home first, because I didn't want to disappoint my (perfectly supportive) parents.
This is pretty much how I felt too, before & even for a while after coming out to my parents.

(For context - I knew I preferred being referred to as / like a boy since I was like 4 or 5, knew I preferred boxers as a kid, I was always super proud if I got the boys version of something, and I always wanted to buy boys shoes but couldn't find any that were comfortable. I always wanted to get changed in the boys room at school & wasn't sure why I wasn't allowed in the boys toilet. I was using he / him online by 15 & had been experimenting with names since I was around 10 or something. I didn't tell my parents anything til I was 19.)

I felt guilty about telling them I wanted to be called a different name because they'd put so much thought and consideration into my birthname & I didn't want to throw that away or seem ungrateful. 

I felt guilty about cutting my hair short because they were both so proud of how long and healthy it was & the different styles I done with it.

I felt guilty about buying guys clothes cause my mother and sister loved taking me dress and shoe and makeup shopping.

I felt guilty about asking them to use different pronouns because I didn't want to put them in a situation where they had to explain to others that their kid wasn't normal.


It took a really long time for me to get my head around it not muttering to them. They went with it. They accepted me. My mum knew before I came out that I was building myself up to something. We all cried and there were slip ups but we're happier now than we've ever been & I can't imagine my life without coming out to them & starting to transition.


I'd say it sounds like your kid wants to come out but doesn't want to disappoint you - or to make you experience any grief since a lot of the narrative is that when a child comes out as trans then the parents / family grieve the loss of the cis child they had thought they had and they grieve the loss of the life of that cis child growing into a cis adult and having a cishetero life. So the idea of coming out to you = ripping all of your hopes and aspirations for them / him as a cis girl into shreds and throwing it in your face.


Obviously that's not how you feel, but that's a pretty common narrative trans kids are told by the media - even trans positive media advises them to let parents having a grieving period after coming out to them.


I'd say a good option for showing your kid you support them / him is to surprise them / him. Use the name you found out was preferred & used at school, and use one set of pronouns, but in a total casual setting. Gauge the reaction you get. Use those pronouns & name a few times. Then switch to the other pronouns but keep using the preferred name. Gauge the reaction at the switch. You know your kid best - which ones got the more genuine ""Oh fuck yes"" reaction?? That's probably the right option. You can broach a conversation about it, or ask for your kid to write you a letter or email or even a gazillion giant texts. 


Sometimes we need prodded to take the steps we need to because even when we're ready, we're still Absolutly Terrified. My parents had to prod me for over a month until I let them help me legally change my name because they knew I was ready but I was too scared to do it myself and didn't know I was allowed to ask for help or comfort during it because all of the narrative I'd heard from other trans people was that they were so excited when they changed their name legally. But I learned it's OK to need someone to hold your hand and help lead you across some bridges when you've been standing at the edge of them psyching yourself up for crossing them but being too scared to step onto them alone.


Maybe your kid just needs you to hold their / his hand during this stage of coming out but isn't sure they / he is allowed to ask for help.


Also: thank you for being an amazing parent.
Well...you've pretty much done all you can. You might try just explicitly telling him that you don't care if you ""lost a daughter"" or w/e, because you *didn't* lose them, you just didn't know they were your son.

Otherwise, just maintain their desired pronouns and name and give them the time they need. I for one was nervous about telling my mom for a long time after I was already out to my friends, and my mom is also queer.
I'll echo others and say you sound like you're doing an amazing job already! A lot of the times the reason why a kid doesn't want to tell their parents is more to do with the kid than the parents.

For example: I'm 22, I was 21 when I came out to my mum and a few months ago when she asked me if I wanted to use a different name/pronouns I said no. I did wanted her to do exactly that and my friends had been calling me Lily for months at that point, but I'm also terrified of being a burden and asking her to call me Lily at all times *except when my siblings were around and never make a mistake* triggered that fear.

It's not that I thought she wouldn't accept me or anything, I was just scared of being a nuisance. The reasons I didn't tell her had more to do with me than her. Telling parents this stuff is especially scary I think.

To reiterate, you're great and it sounds like you're doing all the right things. Your son will realise this soon enough and tell you :)

Also, on another note, you should probably talk to the school about outing your son like that. It was fine cause you're cool but in another situation they could have placed a trans kid in real danger.
You sound like an amazing parent, and it doesn’t sound like you did anything wrong. Coming out though is one of the scariest experiences in the world. When I started questioning my identity my mom also took notice, and she gave me the same talk about how she’ll always love and support me. Unfortunately, when I came out as trans a few years later she was absolutely heartbroken and said “I thought you were a lesbian.” (It was a very rough year after that, but the has learned to accept and support me so don’t worry.)

Another part of it, at least for me, was that I had to be sure. I told friends at school and teachers long before I told my mom, because if I was going to tell her I had to be 100% sure. Coming out to your parents also makes it feel real, if that makes sense. Telling friends is one thing, but the people who raised you? It’s absolutely terrifying, and it’s almost like admitting to the world like “this really is who I am, this isn’t a phase, it’s not a joke among friends, it’s real.”

Again it sounds like you’re doing an amazing job, and I’m so happy your kid has you to support them. As with many things, it’ll take time. They’ll tell you when they are ready, and until then just keep being their support like you already have been.
It sounds like ur an amazing parent, which is so much more than a lot of trans people have. Ur son expressed that he didn't want to hurt u. My advice would b to have a talk with him about how what u want is for a happy healthy child. Explain that for him to hide who he is from u keeps him from his happiness, and therefore keeps u from the healthy happy child u want. That his gender isn't what makes u happy to b his mom, his happiness and successes r....imo that might get u a long way in his opening up more and being himself, which is supportive. Also ask him if there's anything else he needs or would like to talk about to further b himself
For a lot of kids it's easy to catastrophize and assume, based on some horrible stories from other families, that coming out to their family could result in their parents treating them badly, or even losing their home. This is absolutely not your fault, and you seem like a wonderful and supportive parent. Just keep reassuring them that they can talk to you about this stuff, keep supporting them wherever you can, and odds are they'll eventually be comfortable talking about it.
There should be more amazing parents like you.
Well don't push, for sure, I've seen people retreat back into their egg if they feel pressured. You're already doing everything right it seems like, but keep opening the door to talk in general, share your feelings about things with them so that they feel like they can share their feelings with you, and generally be supportive of queer people around you so they continue to know they'll be supported. 

If you can work it in organically into a conversation, maybe mention the name you would have given your son if you'd had one. Not necessarily for them to pick, but so that they know you were open and planning for that possibility from the start. Also, if you can mention nicknames you've gone by in the past.
The it sounds like you're doing great already, it's just one of those ""idk really know how to tall about it"" things. Hee all wrapped up in his head and the standard teenage angst. Obviously I don't know you're kid so take anything I say with a grain of salt. But there have been a few times where I knew coming out to people wasn't going to have a negative result and it still took my months or years to get around to doing it. I have a friend of mine who I still haven't come out as Trans to, not because there's going to be a negative response, but because it took awhile before I was 100% sure and I'm like 75% sure they're going to be a be incredibly confused for a long time going forward if I decided to socially transition with him to see how it felt and it didn't take. Would've spent YEARS feeling a bit up in the air about what my pronouns were and unsure how to ask (he's a bit autistic, not enough to completely disregard NT social rules, but enough to not know when and how to implement them.) Now I'm surrounded of who I am and I still haven't told him, in large part because of some baseless paranoia that he's gonna be weird about it.

I've lost sight if the point so getting back to it:
It sounds like they were getting caught up in their own head potentially, and while the sort of ""confrontation"" probably kinda sucked for everyone, I think he's going to be glad for it later. The fastest way to get used to he pool is jump in. Some sort of idea. The conversation is uncomfortable, the result is great.
I just want to say thank you for being an amazing parent, because not every trans kid (or cis kid, or any type of kid) gets to have a parent like that.
You're doing a great job. Everyone has given my advice so ill just say this. Sometimes its just nice to hear i love you. Just ""i love you no matter what and you'll always be my child""
I had no idea about that subreddit!  Thank you so much.
eh.. from my experience that sub is very anti-hrt for some reason
I am scared about how family members will react, if and when that time comes. I know that my immediate family (mainly my brother, mom, and aunt) will be open, as I have talked to them a bit about it. It is the other side of the family that is very religious and conservative that I worry about. If any of them is a dick about it I don't think I will react very kindly.
It is so true about kids having trouble talking about major issues. I know I never opened up to my parents as a teen. And still don't about most things.  Def something I need to remind myself of. 

I have reached out to several therapists in my area who have trans youth listed in their focus. There is a waitlist with everyone and we are on a handful of them. It's a waiting game at this point which is frustrating. 

That shame is something I never wish upon anyone. Imagining my child having shame is heartbreaking. I will continue to support and be here to listen when the time comes.
That is so true about the vulnerability. For some reason that didn't hit me until reading your comment. Being vulnerable is scary as hell even when you know you're in a safe environment. Thank you so much for that perspective.
Thank you for saying that.  I know when the time comes I will be there, with open arms.
Yeah this is especially a good point that could give insight into OP's son's behavior. One well-meaning ""you're too young to know/it's just a phase"" could shatter someone. And given the risk and devastating impact even just a 1% chance of ""too young to know"" could have, OP's son might be thinking it's just too risky to say anything for now.
I definitely felt really guilty after reading it. And I know I will never let them know I did. It was a moment of seeing what I could toss out and what I couldn't. Most of the other papers were old math notes and similar. I just tucked the notebook away and set it with the other keep papers in their room. 

I did tell them I would call them by the name they go at at school. Their response was ""if you want to.""  I take that as a ""yes please.""  

You are right about not making a big deal about it. It is far less stressful.

My extended family have really surprised me. But granted I don’t have religion as an issue and live in a generally liberal country. I knew my parents would be cool, but I was quite worried about my ex’s step dad, who was very anti gay etc. when I first met him. He’s generally chilled over the years, but I think because he’s one of those people who has to meet someone he likes who ‘happens to be gay’. But I thought he would be super wary of the trans issue. He’s either fine with it, or at least pretending to be (I’ll take that if necessary!) My Mum’s side can be very traditional and snobby, so that worried me too.
The way I dealt with the extended family issue was after the close family knew I  just announced it as something like “ My Eldest child is know called (insert name) and is off to University this year to study design. We’re very proud of her” on social media or email groups. That way it wasn’t a bunch of personal conversations, and there was no question whether we were supportive or not. My parents both did something similar, so close family were showing a united front in the issue.
Family either didn’t comment or sent nice messages. Obviously that wouldn’t be the case for everyone, but I was surprised by how it went for us.
Before coming out I was pretty sure my immediate family would accept me but very unsure of my extended family. This, what you mentioned, may be where your child is getting their anxiety. I spent most of my childhood trying to cause as little problems as possible so, even though I had loving parents, I was still terrified simply by the idea of taking up space.

Not sure where you are in the country or if they'd go for this, but there are a few summer camps for Trans kids out there. I was a counselor at Camp Lilac (in Ohio) last year and it was pretty incredible. Perhaps finding a way for them to interact with more trans people, esp trans and gender questioning kids their age?
i’m glad i could help, no problem :)
That was not at all how I meant it. What part of it was rude?
A summer camp is a great idea. I will have to look into that possibility.  We are in Oregon and there are likely options out there in our area.
To me it seemed like you were saying they said too much “too much text” was the part i took offense with
Oh! No, I meant too much text as in I am still half asleep, and would not be able to make sense of a large block of text, and am also too tired to spend more than 3 words on explaining that.
Okie…well sorry then…i retract my statement.
Text can easily be misinterpreted. It's ok."	y568jj	trans	347	1.0	2022-10-16 03:15:57

Happy Trans Pride in London! I accidentally took a photo where the background buildings also screamed Trans Rights! 🏳️‍⚧️		"This picture is a cosmic middle finger to Queen TERF JK Rowling. Just read the business name on the pink building.
I was there with my sister and her fiancé (they are both trans, I’m not) and it was fantastic! The level of happiness and pride there was astronomical! It was so fun, we also got some pudding after, and it had the trans flag on it. Hope you had fun!
That pink dress! 😍
Still disappointed in the royal academy for apologizing to a transphobic artist.
Haha - FU JKR!!!  Love it!
Haha yeah!
I would have loved to been there. I live across the pond though so the commute is tough.  It made me so happy to see the level of support and the shear numbers.  I just cannot wrap my head around the level of anti-trans rhetoric In the UK. I had always felt like it was light years ahead of the US for LGBT acceptance.  Love from a Native American sister.
Yeah. The world still sucks. But we have to keep trying <3
From what I’ve heard about the US, the UK is far beyond them in trans acceptance. I think that every place has anti-trans ideals in some way or another, and it’s a worldwide problem that needs to be viewed as one, and collectively solved.

Keep your chin up, girl! Love from a cis British brother. ♥️
The realization is that we can change most things  that do suck but it just takes a hell of a lot of work. 


For one, instead of boycotting or getting enraged at the Royal Academy; contact them directly and ask that if they are truly operating in the interest of an open conversation with multiple perspectives, how many trans artists are actually represented by them in the gallery and gift shop?

I sent this message, got no reply. Maybe if more people did it they would include more trans people and not just a loud transphobe.
I’m also a cis british asian and we are all constantly learning. I have made so many trans and non binary friends the last few years it would be HORRIBLE of me to be stuck in my old ways. I just hope more of us see that we all have our battles and some are better fought together than on our own/against one another!

What I mean by trans pride	"Born in the wrong body - being trans is basically being ripped off at birth. When I talk about having trans pride, I'm not proud of being ripped off, I'm proud of my ability to push through it and say ""fuck you, I'm being a woman anyway"" when I'm constantly told I can't."	"Words well spoken. This made my day!
This a hundred times. When I first started transitioning I didn’t have pride because I hate that I had to be born this way, I wish I could have just been born biologically female instead of having to go through so much time, money and pain to become as biologically female as possible.

But now I am proud because I am strong. I know who I am now more than ever before and I’m proud because I’m in tune with myself and I’m going to be myself no matter what it takes and no matter how shitty the rest of the world tries to be to me for it.
HELL YEAH

Just so you know	"As a transgender person there is no ""one way"" to be trans.
You don't owe anyone masculinity.  Femininity,  or androgony. 
You don't HAVE to change your name. But it's okay if you do.

I am male to female I've been using hormones for almost 2 years I'm still afraid to come out even though it's really hard to hide my chest
it took me longer than I should have to realize I was trans because I thought that in order to be a man I had to be super masculine and macho… nope! There is no wrong way to be a trans man
I've never understood why some folks think 'bi'
would exclude trans people.
I.. really needed to hear this today. Thank you ❤️
That is genuinely so nice to hear. I’m so glad your daughter has been welcomed into a safe and accepting home that lets her explore/ find what is most comfortable for her
Anytime! ♡♡♡
I’ve had several trans friends through the years and mental health is so important to remember.
I'm a trans man with long red hair plenty if cis men have long hair why can't we?
Only you get to determine who you are! 
If others not liking or ignoring it don't change that fact. You're a man either way! I'm doing great.
You're so welcome I'm glad I could brighten your day/night for a second :)
What do you mean?
I saw an excellent YouTube documentary about that a couple of weeks ago that argued that it's the result of the LGBT+ categorization system and the MOGAI categorization system both using the word ""Bisexual"" to mean different things, like how ""Chips"" or ""Biscuits"" mean different things in America compared to the UK.

Under MOGAI, the definition of Bisexual is ""attracted to more than one, but not all, genders"" while under LGBT+, the definition of Bisexual is ""attracted both to one's own gender and to other genders"". So the conflict comes from a fundamental disconnect of terminology, as people who described themselves as bisexual under MOGAI tended to be using that label as a smokescreen for transphobia, and when they were called out for that online, people who described themselves as bisexual under LGBT+ would defend against what they thought was an attack against them. 

It's like a plot from a bad sitcom, where it anyone took the time to clarify what they were talking about, there'd be no conflict at all. But that's just the way ""online discourse"" works.
We like to use positive examples of trans members of the LGBTQ  to keep her focused and not become confused over any of the hateful attitudes of many today,
Thank you!
She just mainly needs gender affirming activities and practices to Keri her focused  on her future now.
I'm coping with coming out, moving and a partner with cancer. My plate is full but my doctor is being awesome.
yeah you’re right time to grow out this buzz cut
I used to have long hair back when I thought I was cis
It’ll be more than a second! I’m so glad I saw this!
Well I can’t do a girl voice, i haven’t transitioned, I own no girl items, I just used to cross dress in my exs clothes and have the whole “I wish I was a girl” thing going on in my head
Plus I bet there are tons of trans musicians that can be really helpful :)
Dooooo it you got this man
How did you feel with long hair?
I'm a trans man, but so far I don't have any ""traditional male"" clothing, however clothing don't have a gender. My voice still sounds female bc I haven't started the path of transitioning medically. 

But you know what? I'm still a man. 
Some trans people don't medically transition for one reason or another. 


All the things you listed don't make you any less trans. There's no wrong or right way. 

And if you ever need to talk my dms are open for anyone.

You are so freaking valid even if you don't feel save coming out
Absolutely
It was normal. I cut it because I started balding :(

As they were a gift, I don't know the EXACT ones they got me.

But someone else linked to this page from the site they came (Sock Dreams) 

https://www.sockdreams.com/house-brands/house-brand-dreamer-socks/proud-stripes.html
Yeah, this is the site they came from! Nice sleuthing on spotting it on my toes! Though I think mine are the non-pastel. 

Almost every variant of the trans pride colors were sold out...
It's not the pastel version sadly, I think those were out of stock :(

It looks closer in person though, I think the blue on the blanket makes it look more indigo than it is!

I'm sneaking a trans pride flag into my birthday decorations. I didn't have a white balloon so I had to improvise.		"The 3 genders: boy, girl, and cow udder.

^(Nah, I'm just kidding. Non-binary people are valid and awesome.)
That seems like a handy replacement.
this is the mood of 2019; trans folks make do!
when your so trans and the only way to show pride is by using a balloon that looks like a cow udder

Brilliant
nice. condom could’ve worked too ;) 
I'm colourblind and these just look like pain white gloves to me rip

The pride Converse you like don't exist any more? Make better ones!		"I can design my own converse????? Please give me a link!!!
These look great! Where did you do this?
I love these
Update! They came!

https://www.reddit.com/r/trans/comments/k68u4a/they_came/
Wait they got rid of the other ones?

I was gonna ask to get them for Christmas :(
How much does it cost to get customised converse? Or does it depend on sizes and stuff?
If only I didnt HATE converse. I can only wear like big bulky shoes because of the way I walk
Just go on the website. There's a customize button on most of their products.
Thanks! Right on the Converse website.

Their custom options are pretty decent.

This is a link to what I made:

They aren't available through Converse directly. They may exist elsewhere though in limited sizes
$75 for lowtops. Don't know about anything else. I don't think size has anything to do with it.
Aww, that's a bummer ☹️
Thanks!☺️
Christ, that’s wayyy too much for my budget haha, thanks anyway
Yeah it is, they’re so cute! Upside is the bigger shoes push me over 6’ so I can be tall :3
You're welcome! I can't wait to see what you come up with.
Yeah, it's not cheap. I'm not sure why I ordered them, but I did. Maybe just a bit of retail therapy?
I think the original Pride ones were like $150.
Already came up with a cute design, but reddit doesn't allow pics in the replies. 😔 I sent some pics of it to my friend though and her first response was immediately ""trans flag shoe"". So I guess I did good. Lol
Just posted the pics on a reddit page. Here is the link! ☺️

In Defense of UWU culture, or How I learned to stop worrying and embraced the NYA	" 

(trigger warning, for serious discussion of transphobia and transphobic language as well as some language) 

I have noticed on many trans online spaces, some serious scoldy criticism against anime style catgirl/uwu culture that many internet transfemmes treasure and post regularly. I understand the criticisms are obvious and intuitive to many, that a lot of anime culture is problematic and overly sexualised in an often creepy way. However, something within the spirit of uwu, yet lights the hearts of countless trans with a feeling like hope. A feeling not explained in words, and I wish to do my best to serve the catgirl nation, to find those words, to defend the subculture that has proven such a balm to my jaded broken heart. 

I want to start my argument with historical western culture. I want to start with an anecdote referencing trans youtuber May’s amazing video essay on the western 80’s slasher, Sleepaway Camp. The TLDR version, is that it is a profoundly transphobic film, where the final line at the end of the movie, is the “horrific” reveal that the female presenting slasher, has male genitalia, shouting “SHEs a DUDE!” even within the safe context of a trans video essay, this scene was painful to watch. 

The interesting take on this movie, is not pointing out all the many, many ways this movie is offensive, but in the strange way that May, and I as her audience, took strange inspiration from the movie. May projects an interpretation where a kind, innocent and really cute trans girl gets epic violent revenge on “victims” who for the most part, are really abusive and mean to her. It is likely a symptom of how microscopic popular trans representation is, and how DESPERATE us trans are, to find something inspiring in any image that vaguely reminds us of ourselves. Even if the movie is made to be awful to us, May is so jaded, she just wants to find some joy in a cute looking trans character getting revenge on assholes. I relate to that level of cynicism and emotional exhaustion.

Of course, popular western culture has progressed since the 80’s, the president can say “trans rights” and a good looking enough tran can give those particular kind of “inspiring” speeches that suburban white people in auditoriums like. It appears like we might be getting a lick, a slight hint at possible full social acceptance, and with that, comes the temptation to try to fit in with popular society. But, and this is a big but, where is the “positive” trans representation in western culture right now? What TV character embodies someone that a young transfemme today, feels is inspiring and relatable, or dare I even suggest, sexy or cool? 

This is my own anecdotal experience, but the last trans representation I saw in western TV was a chick who got murdered on a cop show, and some family drama where an ugly tran was kind of a bitch (not in a cool way) and caused problems for the main cast. Oh yea, and during Halloween I saw Leprechaun in the Hood where a trans character was brutally murdered as well for laughs. Then there are characters like Nia Nal in supergirl, who are explicit pander characters who make me cringe in a way deeper and grosser than anime ever has. Such characters are examples of pure astroturfing. (for the young uns, astroturfing is when a subversive social movement is co opted by a business or government into a marketable and socially acceptable form that is no longer subversive or challenging to society.) 

Which finally brings me to the main subject of this little manifesto. Anime. anime has a lot of trans representation (compared to the popular west.) Whether its the adventurer girl in “that time I got turned into a spider” or Tanya in “The story of Tanya the Evil” or that noble knight in “Magical Girl Raising Project.” They are written naturally into the stories not to make a political statement, but because the authors, many of which are cis male, felt that such characters served the story they wanted to tell. Sometimes those representations are problematic, often they are overly sexualised. But there IS representation, lots of it, evil characters, good characters, tragic and comedic, from “Stop!! Hibari Kun!” to serious discussion of self harm and suicide in “JJ Macfield and the Ilsand of Memories” (which is a masterpiece as far as I am concerned.) 

In Anime, trans poeple are not just “valid”, or “inspiring” but are as full people as the rest of the cast, and you can find them as heroes villains and everything in  between, you can find them modest or as total uwu sex fiends. As a young tran, you can choose from an actual diverse menu of characters to relate to, something not easily said elsewhere. Hell, here in the west contemporary trans are motivated to stan for the fucking sleepaway camp slasher because representation is literally that scarce and shitty. 

Which takes me back to Sleepaway camp. A lot of people in popular culture, especially outside the circles of well to do proggressive types, cringe at the existence of trans people, even today. Many cis poeple find us disgusting, strange, dangerous, the subjects of horror movies. I want to draw a connection, between the way many of those same bigots turn their noses with disgust and contempt towards overly sexualised anime women, is literally the same reaction they give to depictions of ANY kind of trans women. Because they see trans women as devient sex objects. Please consider how a trans femme might see Felix Argyle, or that anime about the tran who lives in boy mode, but puts on a skirt and makeup when they activate their magic “save the world” smartphone app (and looks cute doing it.) Consider how much their projection is amplified 10 fold when their bullies and political enemies cringe the same way at their fictional heroes as they do against them personally.

Consider the art style itself, how the abstraction and lack of detail in anime faces obscures many of the details that trans feel super inescure about, and that when a tran appears in anime, even problematic representations, like the waitress from Persona or whatever, *they get to look hot*, they get to be attractive and normal looking compared to other girls in anime. Think about how much we trans WANT that. We dont just want to be accepted, but most of us, dont want to rock the stubble and adams apple forever, we want to be conventionally attractive, those anime boobs are #transition goals, and that is both true, deeply emotionally intimate, and not a socially acceptable thing that your #trans ally joe biden can say out loud. 

Which brings me back to western culture, and the nature of our progressive “allies.” Yes, we have allies, and trans rights have improved, but for popular hegemonic society, I think any well lived tran understands how *conditional* that societal acceptance is. The proggressive caucus will accept certain kinds of de-sexualised, de-radicalised politically narrow representation of trans in a way that does not challenge capitalism,gender, or even our place in the society they are willing to give us some seat at the table for. Even then, acceptance and integration in such a culture often means implicitly selling out many of our sisters who are poor, indiginous, neurodivergent, or politically extreme. Popular progressive culture is a place we can survive, as long as we know our place, but it is not a place where we can feel safe.

For so many trans who spend all day, living in the most “presentable” way possible, trying their best to not get fired, or evicted, or be the subject of a cringe youtube clip used as a pretext by bigots to say horrible things to us (AKA Gamestop tran freakout.) So many of us want to a space to stop living in fear, to express our hidden emotions, our hidden desires, the things we feel and think that your mom wouldn't feel comfortable liking on a facebook post. 

Anime culture is a place for social outcasts. For better and for worse, all sorts of people who don't fit in, whether its neo nazis on 4 chan, and yes, young trans femmes, find something relatable in the depiction of an artistic culture that glorifies being an outsider. I think thats important, I think its essential that we have that kind of outsider culture amongst ourselves, at least within the internet for christs sake. 

A tran well versed in our history, must understand the role that Camp has played in queer culture. For those less well read, the camp movement is the ongoing artistic trend in dressing in intentionally gaudy and off putting old looking clothing and over the top makeup in order to challenge society and draw attention to standing out as an individual opposed to what normally looks “good” and “fashionable.” Most of what is recognizable in modern drag culture is derivative of Camp. The point is, that in the darkest most transphobic days of our history, Trans found each other, and inspiration and hope and solidarity in artistic movement of intentionally standing out and causing the normies to cringe. There is a reason that many of us find something inspiring in the famous Babs Johnson clip, “Kill everyone now! Condone first degree murder! Advocate cannibalism! Eat Shit!!!Filth is my politics! Filth is my life! !”

There is something noble in giving a finger to the society which has scorned us to make a point about their hypocrisy. That is important, sacred, meaningful. To me it means, “I will not live or judge myself by your rules fuckers” That kind of subversive inclusivity needs to be a part of our sub culture, or a bunch of atomsied trans are going to spend a lot of time living in terror of never being accepted outside of successfully “passing” not even just as a cis female, but as a socially normative kind of tran. 

Therefore, the fact that uwu culture makes many respectable types cringe, is an essential feature of why it is popular. If we were to as a community, replace it, it must be with a cultural language equally or even more offensive to the same sort of people. We must not become whitewashed. Because lets be absolutely clear that this is the de facto effect of appeals to cut down on the catgirl shit. The racial politics behind such appeals. In lieu of eastern anime style art as a uniter, the popular trans culture will not become inundated with diverse art styles and references to artistics movements from africa or south America. The anime replacement art will be overwhelmingly western, and overwhelmingly white. They may often depict dark skinned characters, but they will overwhelmingly be the proggressive western white persons idea of what a POC trans “should” look like, there will be less sexual creepiness, but there will be a lot less diversity of any kind at all. We all all become fucking Nia from supergirl, who writes Joe Biden speeches and thinks the CIA is cool. That's what such a conversion would ask of us to become. Who relates to that? The anti uwu folks, will claim they value diversity, but to claim the suppression of anime art will do anything  but increase the westernisation and anglocisation of our popular art, is a lie on its face. A delusional claim made in appalling ignorance or malicious bad faith. Honestly, if the only two genders of representation I get to choose from in my subculture are a horny cis japanese guy who thinks chicks with dicks are hot, and some weird journalism major who stans Joe Biden, I find the horny japanese guy way less gross and offensive. I feel less “used” by his theoretical maturbatory fantasies. And honestly, even the horny shit is often way more cool or interesting to watch than Jules from Euphoria. 

Which brings us finally, to the horny shit. To the deeply problematic way that a lot of anime tends to sexualize a certain kind of innocence that comes across as offesnively pedophillic or just plain infantilising to women in general. This accusation cannot be in wholesale denied, after all, Anime is an entire genre of art with  diverse depictions, many of which are just plain indefensibly awful and bad. But it would be a bad faith claim, to say that even the specific parts of anime culture that trans culture has idealised, like Astolfo or Felix Argyle, do not exemplify a certain kind of veneration of cutesy innocence.

Yet, I still would ask this of many western critics. “What is wrong in YOUR culture, where innocense and being cute, is tied so closely and exclusively to concepts of pedophilia or children. Why do western women have to put so much effort into masculinizing themselves and de sexualising themselves to be taken seriously as adults in male dominated fields?” As Natalie Wynn puts it, why do so many college girls take weird pride in dressing modestly, yet still going for a “sexy in a stacy kind of way?” What parts of yourself has your patriarchal culture asked you to suppress to be taken seriously? 

Do we not all want to be cute sometimes? To feel innocent sometimes? To feel sexy sometimes too, to go back and forth, to be both at once? Are not those part of the feminine experience and mood? Yes, I can be serious, and grim, and professional, and androgynous, but must I be such things all of the time? Cant I be a slut if I want? Cant I also be a church girl sometimes without being catcalled or judged? Cant I just be a complete fucking person who feels the full spectrum of human emotions in different contexts times and places? Are you not asking us to lobotomise half our souls, to cut off half the sky of our experience? Cant trans women just at least, suffer and embarass ourselves riding the razor edge of the madona/whore social complex half of cis women have to balance between? Cant the artistic representation of that have cat ears? A creature whose name has become culturally synonymous in the west with female anatomy? Why must trans women always be serious, mature and sexless? I am jaded, I am cynical, I am always presenting in the kind of business casual attire and attitude requested from post grad students. Cant I just give a soft uwu on the internet in a mournful hopeful contemplation of the lost girlhood I never got to experience? Why do I need to keep up the fucking business casual mindset even on the godamm internet? 

Im weird. A neurodivergent communist queer, I dont fit in to most places, but I like fitting in with the culture of people who say uwu to celebrate that they dont fit in the same way. I think its cool anime has some many non gender comforming characters, I like that the characters are cute, I want to look like that kind of, not just a little bit because comparing myself to real life cis women hurts in a way that it doesnt to compare myself to the abstracted drawings.

I think its heroic how the internet catgirls know they cause people to cringe, but are fearless in being seen and heard anywhere, I think its heroic they way they challenge social expectation, I think its heroic that they dare to express their desires to be cute, I think its heroic the way they provide a light beacon for other people who fit in, not even just trans, but other queers and non queer good hearted weirdos as well. I admire the catgirls, at their cringiest, at their most pathetic 100 times more than I can ever admire fucking Nia from Supergirl. And to really draw the ultimatum, those really are the only two options, the only two options with the cultural clout to compete for trans subculture hegemony for whatever that's worth. So I ask all you trans, especially the femmes, to look in your hearts and ask what your feelings are inspired by, what you want and what you want to be. Communist catgirl who makes people uncomfortable, or neoliberal sockpuppet who can speak in public, but can't be seen kissing anyone on TV. 

This is my final point, my takeaways from my lengthy pro catgirl manifesto about television, anime politics and gender. Coming out was hard, I was so ashamed of coming out and being seen as an “ugly girl.” Finding the catgirl shit online, was the moment I realised, “fuck, im not the only one, Im not alone.” I ask you this, without the catgirl shit, in our current culture and moment in 2021, what could you show that sad tran in boy mode to inspire her to be brave enough to be cringe? Not enough to “uwu” un public, but to transition to their friends and family, to show her that causing other people to be uncomfortable with you isn't the end of the world? To show her that being weird and wanting to be cute yet sexy is okay? If we were to vote Tabby the catgirl off our island, who would take her place? Uwu."	"You wrote a whole uwu essay, uwu
Got linked here 5 months later and I wanted you to know how unfathomably based this essay is, thank you very much for sharing, I have saved this for future reference.

The catgirl manifesto has arrived!!!

Seriously, I'm saving this. This essay is beautiful and absolutely on point. We should be *proud* of living free from the standards of a society which ostracized and painted us as *The Other****^(TM)*** us for so long. You want to see other? We'll give you other alright.

Keep spinning. Uwu.
Honestly, as a neuro divergent technically bi, MtF politically unaffiliated, liberal progressive humanist that's obsessed with cuteness and loves cat girls, fox girls, and those cringy bits in anime that makes those people mad, I fully agree with this post, even though some of it did go over my head, I get the gist of it. Honestly uwu and nya culture is adorable and memetacular XD. There's a lot of people who identify with these characters and some even put on similar personas, and in some cases, fursonas. Honestly anime was my doorway into self discovery since my mom was one of the most over protective and controlling people I knew at the time. I didn't even know LGBTQ was a thing before I turned 14 and thought anime was cartoons like Danny phantom. I was such a lame ignorant normie back then doing my best to blend in cause I didn't know what was wrong with me or how best to describe it. Had LGBTQ people had more and better representation in western media I'd have learned what that feeling was far sooner. I had asked my friend if he ever wanted to be a girl and he looked at me taken aback with a surprised what? And I looked away nervous and said nvm it was nothing and left it well alone. I was 10 at the time and still had no clue what it was or why I felt the way I did. And anime helped guide me towards my answers indirectly, took me looking up some crossdressing anime characters and finding theories as to why they are the way they are, as well as anime like kamfer to find myself and discover what transgender was. Though it's a shame it took so long for me to figure things out. Then what lead me to learn about lesbians was Yuri anime and my god is that one of my favorites. Which honestly lead me to at first think I was a trans lesbian.  But I couldn't shake something for a while and I didn't really know how else to explain it. I wasn't attracted to men in any way shape or form, yet I found myself attracted to characters like astolfo, asuramaru, and Felix. Characters whom as you so bluntly stated was basically chicks with dicks.  I honestly have no idea how to describe it without it sounding like a fetish because I'm still very ignorant. 
I don't even know how to make sense of it. It wasn't until I learned of the identity Gynosexual/gynoromantic and another version which is similar that I recently learned of, neptunic. Both of which from my simple understanding are simply an attraction to femininity in general. Which I think more or less fits me. Though is that valid? I have no idea. Honestly to me it just kinda feels like bi with extra steps. Am I just lesbian? Or bi with a strong feminine preference? My journey started thanks to anime, helping me as a guide, and I've been figuring stuff out since then.
Damn... Just got linked here from another post, but... Damn... I want so bad to valiantly embrace my cringiest but most comfortable side of myself as you say here... Just for the sake of feel the most true to myself, even at expenses of other people's opinion... 

I need this, not only written, but put in practice by me... 

Have my free award, my fellow catgirl UωU ✨

Thanks a lot for the inspiration and the emotional rush! :'3
>The anti uwu folks, will claim they value diversity, but to claim the suppression of anime art will do anything but increase the westernisation and anglocisation of our popular art, is a lie on its face. A delusional claim made in appalling ignorance or malicious bad faith. Honestly, if the only two genders of representation I get to choose from in my subculture are a horny cis japanese guy who thinks chicks with dicks are hot, and some weird journalism major who stans Joe Biden, I find the horny japanese guy way less gross and offensive. I feel less “used” by his theoretical maturbatory fantasies. And honestly, even the horny shit is often way more cool or interesting to watch than Jules from Euphoria.

Fucking 🔥🔥🔥
I didn’t know anyone ever thought of cat girl stuff or “uwu” speak that highly. I just thought it was some crap creepy people use. Or what extremely childish people use.
Just wanna say I’m another person that got linked to this several months later and my god thank you for putting this into words so goddamn well, I may not feel exactly the same but this makes me feel extremely seen

Also tho I wanted to share that almost immediately after reading this I scrolled down and saw this post (but crossposted to r/gaysoundsshitposts): https://reddit.com/r/anime_irl/comments/tzp0sl/anime_irl/

And it immediately made me think back to your essay and like, does this comic feel extremely offensive problematic and out of touch? Yes absolutely, but does the person in it also look incredibly cute and absolutely rock that maid dress and make me wish I looked like that? Also yes absolutely
in the words of max0r, i may be cringe, but that makes me free
I'm not transfem, but live some of the boyness I've never had through strong, cute, honest shonen anime (and video game) characters. And I'm crying as I read this.
UwU is a need on this hostile world. Especially for non-normative folks like us neurodivergent, racialized trans and enbies.
i literally do not have the ability to read all of this

i am so fuxkibgw aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa
>astroturfing is when a subversive social movement is co opted by a business or government into a marketable and socially acceptable form that is no longer subversive or challenging to society.

Small point to the overall essay, but this doesn't seem like a very good definition of astroturfing. It's kind of the opposite actually. The point of astroturfing is to make it seem like it's coming from the general public. Astroturfing would be if the subversive movement, coming from the government or marketing itself, pretended that their position was public consensus in the first place. Co-opting a subversive movement, by definition, would be counterproductive because that would mean it's not public consensus. Similarly, if a point of view is being pushed by a show it is by definition not astroturfing because it isn't trying to appear like it's coming from the general public.
i feel so seen i am glad that i am not the only one who wants to be an adorable cat girl >w<. i'm going to keep uwuing and blushing because i love being cute so much >\\\\<

Bingo. I agree, very insensitive. But I also agree that the heart of the comic, the soul of the thing is promoting and idea of acceptance of gender non conformity.
I may be cringe, but that makes me free.

Good Omens has been a huge comfort to me during my transition. I present me GO inspired trans pride tattoo!		"Isn’t that a prime series (and book) with David Tennant? Good Omens , that is

Amazing! Comfort shows are such an incredible thing. :) I’m glad you could celebrate one of yours like this! I’ve been thinking of doing the same in my own way.

Good Omens? Never heard of it. 😅 I’ve been watching Sense8 lately...
It is! Like I said, it's been a huge comfort. Not even sure why it helps do much, but I wanted to honor its contribution to me coping with the stress of coming out.

Realized I didn't have anything to show my pride, so I decided to fix that!		"Yeah my dice goblin brain was like ""Oooo pretty click clack"" before I even realise they're trans coloured
Heartbeatdice.com incase anyone was wondering! I love my sets!!
If I were out I would get those.
Those are pretty, please clean your camera.
I love those! I should find a local DND group for trans folk, just so I can justify a set like that... or maybe I’ll buy them anyway and listen to TAZ and “play along at home” as Travis would say.

If you are lost, then listen to *My Brother, My Brother, And Me* and *The Adventure Zone* (the latter if you are into DND). The brothers are super-allies, and are also just generally awesome.
For me it's my bi watch screen
At least your brain didn't process them as candy like mine did
They do some amazing sets! Once I showed them to some people in my one group, they were looking at the demi and bi sets!
I bet you could get them without anyone noticing (unless maybe they’re also closeted) cishet people don’t really notice subtleties like pretty trans dice.
I managed to get their TRANSlucent transgender set...I couldn’t help myself with that one!
Yeah but I also have very intrusive (transphobic) parents who would have to watch me purchase them, and who would be very angry if an unknown package containing them showed up. Also they watch my credit card so like. Heck no.

Happy last day of Pride month! I went to my first Pride and drew a comic about it.		"You really managed to capture a lot of my feelings about the fear of being judged, but desperately wanting to wear and do whatever you want, while also being afraid of upholding the common stereotypes. Very good comic
This is really, really wonderful. Thank you for sharing it.
your art is amazing! i really relate to the comic, i hope you find the courage to be unapologetic. im working on the confidence to do the same
Pride isn't necessarily my kind of event, but damn those full color pictures made me cry alone.
Thought it said “corn this way” lol it looks good, good work
Sending hugs and support! :') also I LOVE these full colour panels wow
This is great! It's important to remember everyone NEEDS to go their own pace and that transition is not a race. I have been out and then closeted again though my life and I'm still working on myself constantly.
This was well drawn and well written
Amazing!!!!!!!!
Absolutely beautiful!! :)
have you dumped your therapist and gotten a new one? cuz that one sucks
this is beautiful, thank you <3
I thought it said corn this way 😭

Somehow this both surprises me and doesn't surprise me.

Closeted and been invited to a work event at a bar I've only been to as femme.	"My coworkers are going out tonight and are trying to get me to go. I'm not out at work and don't plan to be (well paying job in a ""typically conservative"" field,  don't want to lose it cause it is the first time in my entire life I am not below the poverty line), but the bartenders all know me from helping organize a pride event.

On one hand, I don't want to be the only one not going. But on the other hand it would risk getting outed and there's a chance I could be fired or denied promotions because of it (yes, that would be illegal but nearly impossible to prove and it happens every day). I'm just not sure what to do."	"Go as masc, and either stay away from the bar or go ahead of time and warn them. If you helped organize a pride event there certainly they would understand?
That's a crappy situation. Would you be able to go in ahead of time and talk to the managers and servers about it? If they hosted a Pride event I'd hope they'd be sympathetic and pretend not to recognise you.
Short notice events are the easiest to avoid due to pre existing plans, just make something believable up such as having arranged to go to the cinema with someone.
Unless your coworkers know otherwise you could say that you don't drink and don't like being around alcohol. It's hard for conservatives to argue against that position because it makes them look intemperate by comparison.
I would honestly just skip this event and avoid the stress of having to worry about being outed.
Do you think you can contact the bartenders before and clarify what's going on before attending?
If it's only the bartenders that know you- surely you could go ahead of time and ask them to be cool about it? Especially if they were helping with pride events in a conservative area?

If you absolutely have to go and can't trust the bartenders- do you think maybe you could survive going like *double masc*? Dress so differently than you normally do at that place that you're just a completely different human being to the bartenders? 

I get how that's not really a comfortable solution either though. If it were me I'd say I couldn't go because I had the runs, nobody ever wants elaboration after you say that.
I would fake a reason not to go - it's hella last-second anyways.
Honestly, this corporate culture bullshit is out of line in my opinion. Work hours are 7-3 for me and unless it happens within those hours I'm under absolutely no obligations and will not take any shit for it. If you don't want to go then don't go. No explanation needed. Just say no thank you, I won't be attending. This is your job not your life and you're allowed to maintain a distinct separation between the 2 things without having to explain yourself. A good boss will recognize that.
Could always say you caught covid
How do the bartenders normally act? If they are allies then I don't see them outing you. Or go another night and give them a heads up.
Depending on how accepting the bartenders are (I'm assuming they're accepting/understanding because of your history helping them with the pride event) I'd give them a heads up and explain the situation. Since the event is tonight, you could try calling the bar on your way there or some time this afternoon and tell them.

If you're worried the bartenders won't understand/aren't good allies, you could avoid going up to the bar, or just don't go to the event. Such a last-minute plan should be easy to get out of. ""I already have plans"" should suffice, but if you need to get more specific, you could say you have friends/family visiting from out of town or you're helping a friend move (something where you've already made a commitment to someone else and you can't possibly bail or invite them to the bar with your coworkers).

If you do go and you don't warn the bartenders ahead of time, it's unlikely they would recognize you. If they did, they might ask ""are you (name)'s brother?"" or hopefully put two and two together and just not say anything at all. If they recognize you AND call you by your name (the one they know you by), you can always act like you don't know what they're talking about and explain the situation afterward. They will likely understand since it's a matter of your financial security and workplace safety.
Go as fem and say it's in support
They won't even recognize you most likely
Say you will go. Then, 1 hour before, have a intestinal problem and stay home, or go another gay bar as your true self, whatever, dont go.
Probably just skip it. Even among drinking culture, it's not unreasonable to excuse yourself by saying alcohol makes you uncomfortable and you don't want to be tempted by it. 

I think if I were in that situation with my current mindset, I'd consider taking the risk just because of the rush, but don't risk a job you're really glad to have.
Do you ever male fail when presenting masc?  If so, I can see the bartenders gendering you correctly not realizing you are trying to be stealth.  If not, they hopefully figure it out and not say anything.  If you are fiends with any of them just message one and give them a heads up and let them know to tell the others
I understand your hesitancy.  Out of curiosity, what is the field you work in that is too conservative to allow transgender employees?
This is probably the best advice here.
Thing is, I don't drink. They still want me to go for ""company morale"" reasons.
If they're conservative that wouldn't work lol
Even better. I dont drink either. Just tell them you don't feel comfortable being around so much alcohol
As someone who also doesn't drink, I feel your pain. You could also offer to plan another event for the group that doesn't involve alcohol to show that you're a ""team player."""	th2o3t	trans	275	0.99	2022-03-18 14:29:51

I submitted again, and I’m glad you were able to get the css done. And question: I’m using mobile browser at the moment so I can’t give myself a role. Is there someone who could add a role onto me? And I feel this is the wrong term, but I frequent discord
Happy pride month 💕

A friend of mine drew pride whales based on the flags a few months ago. I hope you all enjoy them :-) (Note to mods, I wasn't really sure which flair I should use, please correct it if it's not the right one).		"Wait so is #6 also a Bi-leen Whale!

Lol but I love the art, I'd love to have one as a chonky little plush toy :3
Very happy they made an aromantic one. Absolutely would love to have an asexual or aromantic one of these as like a plushie
These (and your friend) are seriously awesome! The **\[Discussion\]** flair seems like a good fit, and **\[Celebration\]** would also work.
these are super cute,
sushi-whales
You should tell your friend to have them made into stickers because reasons
These are so cute🥰🥰
Da widdle babies!!! 💖💖💖
I need all of them as a plushie, tell your friend they're all fucking adorable

This is not optional
Aw thank you :-). He has said that he'd love to be able to get them made into physical items one of these days. I'd definitely love to have an asexuwhale plush myself.
I've been hearing a lot of people saying that they would love to have one as a plushie, pin, stickers, pendant, charm, etc. I'd love to have one as well. He has said that he'd love to do that one of these days. For the time being though, you can [follow him on his Twitter](https://twitter.com/omechus) if you have one.
Awesome, we appreciate it. I'll make sure to pass it on to him. And yeah, there wasn't an art flair or anything, so I kind of had to make a guess. Thanks for letting me know :-).
Aw thank you, that's very kind of you :-).
He has heard this a lot. Same for things like pins and pendants. He said that he'd love to be able to do that one of these days.
Aw thank you, that's very kind of you :-).
I know, I want to give them a hug.
I have sent him a screenshot of your reply. He is considering looking into getting plushies made, as well as things like pins, stickers, pendants, etc.

Edit: And of course he appreciates it :-).
That sounds really cool, wishing good luck to that friend of yours! ^(\^\_\^)
ngl something like this in a sticker form would sell well at an anime con or furry con but thats my personal opinon
I will be on the lookout for that {:
Aw, that's very kind of you :-3. If you'd like, you can [follow him](http://twitter.com/omechus).
He wants to make them be available as physical items one of these days honestly.
Of course. In the meantime, feel free to follow him on Twitter: https://twitter.com/omechus
thx, i will!"	tq0kpp	trans	253	1.0	2022-03-28 03:50:58

Ya gurl hung a giant trans flag in my office for our city’s pride weekend (not out)		"Suspicions have been raised, don't be surprised if someone says ""yeah, I kind of took the giant trans flag as a 'subtle hint'"" when you do come out lol.
[deleted]
You're out now!
Girl. Steam your flag!
I haven’t transitioned or came out yet but i agree. Good job
Ehhh, not everyone knows what it stands for.
I got a rainbow flag too, they know me as a “gay guy”, but also yea my coming out style is to drop subtle hints and not speak directly
This was exactly my neighbors reaction. 😂
That happened to me about a week ago with the little pin I wear.
No one’s asked (is communal office).   
They just think it’s pretty
I'm thinking listening to the Mulan soundtrack over and over might have tipped one of my coworkers off tho
At the very least I want to ensure it a safe space for anyone else questioning.
It’s Neapolitan Ice Cream! Blueberry, strawberry, vanilla
I'm.totally going to do this at work when I come out there, just have like a little trans flag standing up at my computer station for like a month, and then just like dress a little more femme each month.
But neapolitan is chocolate, strawberry, vanilla.....but this sounds better...on sooooooo many levels.
I'm dressed full femme at this point and not out at work apart from my superiors. No one voices any question."	i2g89z	trans	256	1.0	2020-08-02 17:47:00
Got my first pride flag! It's cheap but loved <3		"please iron your flags please I beg you 😭😭!
I love how cheaply you can get these online!
Please wash in hot water/iron it or I will :)
The sun lights it up nicely, too!
It looks awesome <3
I don't know how and it would be very awkward to ask my family.
Me too! It's just the best.
you can also just wash it in the sink, that also does the trick in removing the wrinkles"	12iu56d	trans	246	0.97	2023-04-11 19:10:55
"Happy Pride Month everyone! While I still don't fully know what I am gender wise and I'm not fully out to everyone about it either. It's nice to remind myself that I've made progress. 2 years ago I was a ""totally cis"" guy that was too nervous to buy a dress."		"Happy Pride Month!! I believe it’s perfectly fine to not know where you stand on the gender identity spectrum. You look pretty in that dress and hat.
I like your hat miss
You look amazing, happy pride!
We may not know what gender you are but you're daaaamm cute, I know that much! Your makeup and outfit are so cute
You look amazing, wishing you so much luck, joy and hope on your journey, stay strong and stay proud beautiful
You've got the selfie skills down to a tee, but i must say, that hat is just...phenomenal. It works fantastically with your whole look in these pics too 👌
Holy shit you look amazing
Omg!!! You look amazing!!! I got it!!! Amazing...amazing should be a gender! You nailed it! I am not transgender. I am here looking for ways to support my daughter, so I may have it wrong...but dang I know you got it right!
You're way ahead of me!! Good for you! 🙂
well done! you look great!

And your eyeliner is on POINT, sister!!
Congrats beautiful
Just coming out on Reddit. I had been attempting to post in other subs as if I were cis and was terrified of the backlash or chasers, doxxing, etc. I wanted to finally be free to say it

My trans pride look for pride this weekend Minneapolis.		"Nice! I avoided MN pride this year, (cause I'm still not comfortable in large crowds post covid) but I'll try next year. 

Did you have fun?  You look super pretty btw
Looking beautiful
Such a cute look! I love the jewellery <3
Love your look. Scanning back in your profile, your evolution is incredible, and you’re hitting your style stride as well.
Outstanding
You look very pretty. 

Is that a E molecule necklace you're wearing? If so, I got one myself, but it's a rose gold color instead of black.
Looking gorgeous!
I'm in Minnesota too!
I was definitely concerned about that, but have been fully vaccinated for over a month and wanted to get out and be around my community. It was fun.
For sure, as a fellow trans woman here in the twin cities, I understand
In Minneapolis myself! Nice to see I'm not alone.
Heck yeah!
Omg! Same! Well, near-ish by."	ondfaj	trans	244	1.0	2021-07-19 12:51:36
Revolutionary Pride in Stockholm held a ceremony yesterday during Transgender Day of Remembrance. In memory of all those lost to transphobic violence. Nothing forgotten - nothing forgiven.		"This really is awesome to see, it really is... but I do want to say one thing: please, please in the name of our allmighty feline overlords, DO forgive people. No, they certainly did not deserve this, but I will never remeber or honor the memory of someone by hurting others. And I will fucking haunt anyone who does this with mine.

The trans community has so much love to give, why not share it with the hateful ones, who need it the most. And if they don't listen, eh, we still got jails, right?

And yes, never forget.
you say nothing forgiven, but you will forgive. the moment cis people will start accepting you , you will forgive and forget and you will gladly live off the mercy of your former oppressors, or the children of your former oppressors 
This is not a helpful piece of rhetoric
helpful or not, its the truth
always think what you say. or you write. never forgive are very strong words."	9z27jz	trans	244	1.0	2018-11-21 10:51:47
Slight sunburn is my pride souvenir this year		"It's not fair that you look that good, that the sunburn is somehow just working for you.
You look sooooo cute (and hot but shhh)
Nice! Love that top btw!
haha yep, you forget sunscreen *one time*
Remember everyone, get just enough sunburn on your face to look cute and blushed, and not like a lobster
Your too cute. I’d like to ravish you
<3
You look great! I love that top!
Cute sunburn! 😘
I love that top! I crochet, did you make it? Do you have a pattern?
Very cute.

Happy 8th day of #Pride2022 🏳️‍🌈🏳️‍⚧️ Today I'm flying a Progress Pride Flag and a Genderfluid Pride Flag!		"[Today I'd like to highlight Trans Student Educational Resources (TSER)!](https://transstudent.org/) Trans Student Educational Resources is a youth-led organization dedicated to transforming the educational environment for trans and gender nonconforming students through advocacy and empowerment. In addition to their focus on creating a more trans-friendly education system, they aim to educate the public and teach trans activists how to be effective organizers. TCER believes that justice for trans and gender nonconforming youth is contingent on an intersectional framework of activism. Ending oppression is a long-term process that can only be achieved through collaborative action.  - [LGBTQIA WIKI - Genderfluid](https://lgbtqia.fandom.com/wiki/Genderfluid)  - [Flags For Good - Progress Pride Flag](https://flagsforgood.com/products/progress-flag) - [Flags For Good - Genderfluid Pride Flag](https://flagsforgood.com/products/gender-fluid-pride-flag)

My mom {who I came out to, almost two years ago} tried to ask me if I was trans in the middle of a mall food court	"So this weekend, my mom, and my dad all went on a trip to a bigger city, and we ended up going to this decent-sized mall, I asked my mom if we could go into Spencers, and she said yes. So we walk in and they have pride stuff out which I thought was cool so I figured I'd stock up on some, I picked out two pairs of socks with pride flags on them [one is the nonbinary and one is the trans pride flag] and a pin that says; ""trans rights are human rights."" So a little while after that me and my mom head to the food court to wait for my dad to come to meet us. I pulled out my socks and was talking about how pretty they are when my mom looks me dead in the eyes and says;
""[Deadname] do you have something you want to tell me?"" I was kinda shocked and didn't want to come out for the second time in a mall food court, so I lied. I don't think she believed me, but she dropped it. When I told my dad he just laughed and said ""I thought she would have gotten the hint by now."" So now I'm wearing my new pride socks and shaking thinking I'm gonna have to come out again.

EDIT: Woah this blew up! Thank you for all your kind words in the comments, it was pretty cool to hear from all of you. Much love <3"	"Denial is strong with her.

But your dad seems pretty cool though. :)
Yeah, some people forget this stuff, which is very disheartening to me, as it shows they didn’t deem my struggle to come out to be worthy of remembering, but… some people just have a bad memory. And some are in denial.
You're gonna have to come out REALLY good this time!

Send yourself some flowers that say ""You go, girl!"".

 Maybe other editors can help with some big and bold coming out ideas... You know, have fun with it! Make a family party out of it!
One time a friend might have came out to me. I'm not sure. I'm not friends with them anymore for unrelated reasons. So they were saying how they felt embarrassed to call and setup a therapy appointment because they didn't want to explain on the phone the reason for the therapy appointment. They said they didn't want to tell a stranger something very personal like ""I feel like a girl"". I just said therapists are professionals and you can tell them anything. Two weeks later I was brushing my teeth and thinking back to that conversation. I thought ""that was an oddly specific example"" then a light bulb went off in my head and I realized it wasn't an example... I felt too awkward to bring it up again. I could have handled that better.
Happened to me too. My mom acted so shocked when she found out I had a gf at age 14. I'm like bitch I told you I was gay when I was 11.
Yeah my dad's a little old fashioned but I think he's coming around :)
Yeah, it just sucks all around but I hope the next groups of trans kids don't have to deal with this
Have to come out harder next time so they know ya really tried
Yeah, I was going to leave a wiki-how on the table or make an ""It's a boy birthday!"" Birthday cake but I clicked out lol
*don't assume everyone here is transfem
Sounds like he at least has a little common sense and a functioning memory.

Don’t feel bad. Sometimes parents go into such profound denial that they literally block out a memory.  This sort of thing happened to me. I had to go back and find receipts to prove to my mom that I had already come out her her 1.5 years after the fact.
We love to hear it <3
That’s amazing really super happy for you also a bit sorry that happened :/
No gender reveal fireworks, though!!

A good cake though 😄👍👍🌈✨
Exactly
It's just kinda crazy that they do that, it's like a trauma response lol
Oh it's all good, I wasn't really upset just nervous about having to come out again 😅
Dang that was in the line up /j
I mean cake and all that sounds like the reasonable way to do things but ya gotta come out harder than that! Maybe blow up the whole town and make it erupt in colored fireworks stating your new gender

It's my birthday	Today is my birthday and it was amazing. I went to my first pride parade with my best friend, I dressed up nicely, I was waving my trans flag happily for 2 hours. I had a piece of pie, with my friend, made some jewelry and bought new jewelry supplies. It was so good, until I came back home. My mother talked to me. It was a normal conversation, until she misgendered me. I've been out for more than a year now and she still does it. She still calls me her daughter. I corrected her, and she took at as an attack and agression. I had a moment alone, but I decided to confront her. I said a lot of thing about how it hurts me. She does not get it. She still acts like a victim. I didn't thought that I would cry out of pure despair on my birthday, but here we are I guess. My name is Robin, I'm non-binary and I'm not a girl.	"Hi Robin 💕 Happy birthday buddy 🥰 I'm so sorry you had to deal with that, but I'm also glad you did get to enjoy part of your day before going home. We love you, Robin, and we're proud of you for standing up for your identity and being your authentic self. We're here for you if you need us 💖
Happy birthday!
Happy birthday, Robin!!
Hey Robin, happy birthday!!!!
Happy Birthday Robin.
Happy birthday!
Happy birthday Robin!
Happy birthday Robin! Im sorry about what happened bud.
Ask her if she had a name she hated in school, and deadnaming is like her being called that by family..
Happy birthday Robin
Happy birthday Robin! I'm so sorry about your momster.
Well, merry Birthday to you
Happy birthday! I hope things get better for you! All the best from some random person from the internet!
1st happy birthday.  By what I have heard it's hardest to deal with gender issues with family and close friends and partners. They already knew or had ideas of our issues and can be accepting.  Or they resist and ignore the future changes. Religion and politics don't help. But sometimes they just don't want to lose the child they raised. Many can't understand how hard life is for those that feel different and wish to transition. Their brain is locked into what they want and what they think as stable. Trans upsets that balance. 

My parents have past so I don't have to deal with that issue.  My sister has known I have had issues with relationships and self image. She is at least open minded.  Asking if I wanted to be a woman or how far I wanted to go. I'm still learning about that. 

Remember your journey will take time. And others around you need time as well to adjust. Some longer than others
happy birthday!
Happy birthday! I’m sorry for what you’re going through, I hope you can get through this.
Happy birthday Robin, I'm very sorry that happened to you, but at least the rest of your day was good
get up, take my digital hugs, and go out there and sting like an enBEE
Happy Birthday.
お誕生日おめでとう、ロビン！
Happy birthday, Robin! I’m glad you had a great Pride parade and pie fun with your friend! 💜🌈

Maybe you can make a talisman with your new jewelry making supplies?

Best of excellent good luck 💜💜🙏🌈🍀✨
Hello Robin! Happy birthday! It’s also my birthday too. I’m so sorry you had to go through that. My dm’s are open if you ever need to chat or anything
Happy birthday robin! I love your name!
Happy birthday Robin ❤️
Happy birthday Robin 💕
So..... and frankly IDGAF if this crosses a line.

Good on ya, happy to see you getting out there.

But I've read your feed and now I'm wondering how old you are and whether or not we live in the same country and if I have to be worried in a very adult and very professional manner.

I'm a social worker and darling, I want you to know that if there's ever ANYTHING you need to get off your chest with a trans veteran (10 years out) then do not fucking hesitate to DM me and I will do what I can.

I'm happy you got to experience Pride. I'm worried about your safety. 

Sorry, not sorry - but I take my professional code of ethics very serious.
Happy birthday Robin! Sorry that your mum is like that.
Happy birthday!!! Hopefully your mom turns around one day.
Happy birthday Robin! Focus on the good things of your day and don't let your mom ruin it
Happy birthday Robin and am happy you had an amazing time at the pride parade. It's so good thsg tiu got to do what you like. Sorry that you had an issue with your mom. Please don't let that get to you this is your day and no negative talk or comments should make be sad. It hurts me that you had to cry on your birthday when all you need to be doing is smiling and being happy. We love you friend and we always will. Keep being strong and enjoying the new year you have reached.
Happy birthday Robin."	wtbdwl	trans	212	0.99	2022-08-20 16:35:34

Happy pride month 💕🏳️‍🌈🏳️‍⚧️		"1) you look gorgeous

2) stupid question: is that running mascara look intentional or did something happen? cause it looks good and if its intentional i'd like to know how to do it.
Girl who made you cry
Looking so pretty and content ❤️
Soo pretty
😍😍🍓❤️😉Love your eyes 💓
You look great like Sylvannas Windrunner (ill pretend i didnt see it in your comment below and know who that is) lmao. Seriously though you look amazing, its my own fault for being too poor to play WoW growing up haha.
Did someone get lucky hehe
It was intentional! I was trying to go for a Sylvannas Windrunner vibe (world of Warcraft lol)
What’s the strawberry for 😭 emojis are so weird sometimes.
Banshee Queen 💜
Haha, I agree! Didn’t catch that on the edit. But I could bring us some champagne and strawberries 🍓 why not 🌹
Bet, strawberries and champagne sounds like heaven haha. Sprinkle some sugar on them too. I don’t really drink, but champagne is another ball game (cuz its like soda lol). I think North Carolina has the best strawberries ive had. I like making strawberry shortcake too with the glazed strawberries and whipped cream, but not just the glaze you get in the store. Making it with real fresh strawberries sliced up in it makes a world of difference for the cake. You get a pound cake and just smother it in that glaze and strawberries.
Wow you’re awesome in the kitchen girl! I am useless in the kitchen my self, older, alone and lost interest in cooking just for myself. I’m in Tennessee and close to the town of Portland, they have a strawberry festival every spring, parades and vendors everywhere selling jams. More natural obviously fresher than what you find in stores. 
But your shortcake sounds divine, champagne is optional."	v3cmlb	trans	210	0.94	2022-06-02 16:21:12
I had an awesome time at Pride this year. I hope everyone else did too!		"This is Colette! You look fabulous dear!
Ohhh i have those glasses
That's awesome.  Your beautiful.  You look badass with your glasses on. You look like a combination of sexy and kickass.
Hey!!! Hope you had a great Pride too! I’ll see you on Wednesday!

Attended a few LGBTQ+ meetups during pride month and I just felt like an outsider.	"Events included a drag show quiz night, screening of some queer movies and pride march in my capital city. 

I was hoping to find my tribe but I just felt like such an outsider. I guess I'm quite introverted and the events seemed really extravert orientated, so I was just really uncomfortable the entire time. I know being in queer spaces can take a bit of getting used to but as a trans woman, I just thought I'd just kind settle in and feel even a little bit at home. 

Wondering if anyone else has ever felt the same?"	"Not weird at all imo, I don’t like or understand drag at all.  I know there are some trans women who are into it but to me it comes off as more of a gay dude thing.  We share common issues being part of the LGBT umbrella but it doesn’t mean we are all super into a specific subculture.
I am not an introvert, but God thought he was funny given an extravert such crippling social anxiety that I get no relief anywhere. Pride events can be SO overwhelming, so much noise, the color, all of it, drives me crazy.

I found that I needed to look for that tribe during the ""off"" season. Find Pride councils in your area, participate in PFLAG or other Queer organizations. Find online spaces in your lived in area. 

When you go to large pride events, already part of a group, they are less intimidating, and easier to manage. Going to Pride as an introvert, or someone with crippling anxiety, to meet your group, is a recipe for stress and disaster.
I've posted on a few Trans reddit pages and felt like an outsider. Deleted posts now, but it felt so horrible to not be seen by people who are in the same situation. I'm also very introverted, too.

If you need to chat with anyone, I'm here!
I don't ever really go to any LGBTQ+ events because I don't fit it. I'll go occasionally if my sister or a friend wants to go to one. They're usually just full of a bunch of annoying gay dudes and as someone who isn't an annoying gay man I don't fit in at all. I feel just as othered and excluded at most LGBT events as I do just existing in society as a kinda somewhat passable trans woman. It's the same shit as every other place I go where I either get treated like a some kind of third gender freak or like I'm diseased and have leprosy or something and no one wants me around.
There are no pride events where I live, and even if there were I’d get disowned for going to one.

All things considered, I don’t really care for pride or tribes or any of that. I prefer running solo, that’s how I’ve always operated.

That being said if we went back to our roots of protesting and even rioting when they come for our rights, I’d join 100%
I never get along with other LGBT people at those kinds of events, even though I’m very extroverted

I just don’t understand them I guess?

There’s just this whole vibrant gay culture with all these different subcultures and groups and fandoms and I don’t know why but it just doesn’t make sense to me. None of it does, no matter how much I’ve tried to ask and understand

I’m at a point now where I just feel sad that I can’t understand and join in a lot of conversations that go on at these sorts of events. It makes me feel like I don’t belong. Like I still don’t understand furry culture or bdsm culture or drag culture and the thing is I’m by no means a completely “vanilla” person so I don’t know why these things don’t come naturally to me when they seem to make sense to everybody else…

There’s just so many experiences I feel like I don’t have, even though I’ve been out for years. I’m really fucking gay and I’ve done a lot of fuckin gay shit but I always feel like I’m not…idk, expressive enough or something at those places
All my friends are online. Like a normal person.   


This was heavy sarcasm and not indicative of any mode of normality.
Absolutely! There are some pride/queer events in my city too, but first, there are mostly elderly couples and I have a really hard time to approach people. Even if the anxiety wasn't, I'm so scared to come across like a creep and since I'm visibly autistic, I definitely come across as maximum off putting, even to ""my people"".

Last pride I went I ended up just sitting in a corner and feeling miserable about my life most of the time. I was lucky to run into an acquaintance which I didn't know was a lesbian, but honestly. That's not it.

And most orgs from the university are like mostly white girl hang out spaces with sparkly glitter. I'm sooo not interested in this...

All queer people I met was purely coincidental and also... yeah, very random people I don't have much in common with. I've yet to meet another trans guy irl at all and yeah. I don't know how other people do it.
I mean, where do geek LGBTQ+ folx go and gather? This also happens to me when I go to events because those are usually catered towards party-loving, extroverted people.
As an introvert I can relate to this, you are better off trying to find people with equal lifestyles. I grew up with a friend who would want to go to the club every time we hung out. That isnt for me and it took me far too long to realize that its not always a good thing to let people pull you out of your comfort zone. The truth is we are all different and that's okay. Be you and do what you do best. Most of all do what makes you happy.
I'm still trying to get it together after some traumatizing incidents the past couple years, so crowds are tough for me rn. Really want to be out at pride, and going to protest marches for Roe, but it's just feeling really difficult at the moment, and I sort of mentally/emotionally shut down. One of the incidents I'm working through happened in a queer space, so I'm still processing that and trying to be comfortable in community spaces again. 

I hope you can find queer spaces that fit your vibe, and make you feel safe and welcome.
I personally wouldn’t want to just go alone because thats not my jam, but if you can go with a friend or in a group it can be a lot of fun whether you “fit in” or not.  Many many straight cis people go and I assure you they don’t necessarily “fit in”.
Extrovert here, and I feel a lot of times as an outsider going to ANY new group or an event aimed at my interests or the like. It's totally legit.
I felt the same whenever I went to a pride event, but also each time I have talked to other trans women. It feels difficult to feel like an outsider.
No mater where I am, or when, I always feel like I don't belong, I guess when i feel the most like I actually am ment to be somewhere is when I am alone and on my bike.
I even think that being transsexual under the LGBTQ + umbrella is not necessarily beneficial, and all this hype around these groups has the effect of misunderstanding our problems by average people.  It is too loud and, apart from the right to tolerance, we probably don't have much in common.
Some people try to classify some things as defining for the LGBTQ+ community, and sometimes that can end up coming off hurtful. I can agree with the sentiments expressed in this post.
It’s normal to not love or click with every queer space, as frustrating as that feels. I bet you’ll find your people if you keep looking.
It’s absolutely valid to not enjoy drag, but this isn’t an accurate characterization.

Modern drag in the US / Canada comes from queer safe spaces (particularly from queer people of color in New York during extremely oppressive times). Watch the documentary “Paris is Burning”, which provides a good overview of how modern drag evolved from the ballroom scene, and how the transgender community played a key part in that.

In the latest season of RuPaul’s Drag Race - a show that has historically ignored transgender contributions to drag - nearly half the cast were transgender women or trans femme (including the winner), and many, if not most, drag performers are non-binary or genderfluid. Cisgender women perform drag, as do some heterosexual men (both cis and trans) who don’t conform entirely to the gender binary. 

It’s regarded as an art form and draws from fashion, design, cosplay, makeup artistry, illusion, music, and acting/comedy, some of which can be extremely high brow and intellectual. Drag artists have appeared in fashion magazines and have heavily influenced high-profile designers. Some drag queens (like Symone) have been powerful showcases for black culture and beauty. Drag kings are also widespread.

I’m a pre-transition transgender woman and discovering drag literally saved my life. I still present masculine but, at 33, I finally feel empowered to begin HRT next month - and that’s solely because of the validation I found in watching transgender drag artists. That is how much of an impact it can have on some of us.

You can dislike drag as performance art, or how it caricatures femininity. But it’s not fair to characterize it as a “gay dude” thing; it was born as a reaction / coping mechanism to deeply entrenched societal racism, homophobia, sexism, and transphobia, and that legacy permeates drag culture to this day. Drag is a political statement, and drag artists were at the forefront of fighting for the very rights we enjoy to this day. It’s not limited to any one segment of our community.
Yeah drag makes me super uncomfortable too, I’ve got a few friends who are into it so when I got some free tickets for a drag show I gave them away as soon as physically possible. 
The whole concept is quite offensive to me, a bunch of cis men dressing up with a whole bunch of exaggerated femininity, it’s everything I’m terrified I might be and it just makes me feel really disgusting. 
I don’t have any hate towards anyone who does it or enjoys it, I just want it as far away from me as possible
I don’t mind drag and can watch it and appreciate it but yeah, it’s mot something I have much knowledge about or too much interest in so I feel about the same way.
Not enjoying drag personally is part of it being a performance art. Its not my thing either.
Especially if you're still coming out, or a bit reserved, it can feel like you really don't belong if everyone else is open and energetic about it. It's like getting into metal and instead of finding a record and listening to it with your friends you go to a concert and get thrown into the pit.
You just described my experience today. My capital city had a huge pride festival today, I just recently realized I was trans. So I was excited with the thought of going to pride this year because oh I can meet people like me and start becoming a part of the community. I got there and walked around for about an hour and the entire time it was complete sensory overload within minutes I was completely overwhelmed by the sheer number of people and everything else going on. I was awesome to see that many people supporting the lgbtqia+ community especially I'm a southern state but it was a lot to take in and my anxiety skyrocketed until I was able to extricate myself from the crowd and leave.
Thank you for this open ended explanation. A lot of people really get the wrong idea about drag and it blows me away how many trans women and trans femme on this platform 👏 ASSUME 👏 that it's just sparkly misogyny or just for gheys

When RuPauls show first came out on LOGO in 2010, my cis friends would relate it to me and I would have to explain the differences which got tiring quick so I get the anger but that's on cis people. Not drag queens


As for OP, you don't have to be crazy into big pride events, some people aren't. Some people aren't into the club scene and that's ok. some are artists, some gamers, there's foodies, the burning man groups, the dolls, people who are just relaxed, theater types, people who love movie nights and there are others just like being on their own. There's always ways to find people who have similar interests who also are like you. Keep looking around
Like I said, not everyone doing drag is cis, but this is how I feel about it.  I’ve seen it once and was uncomfortable, the history doesn’t matter to me because I’m not part of that culture.
Right I always feel like I can’t express that opinion and I’d obviously never judge anyone in the drag space, but the entire culture just makes me super uncomfortable and a bit upset. I don’t think it’s exactly for the same reasons, I guess a lot of my problems with it comes from the attitudes around it if that makes sense. lots of it feels like some sort of sick comedy to me, like haha these big buff dudes are dressing up like exaggerated women and making fun of how women act is it so funny a dude in a dress. I don’t know I guess it just brings up a lot of insecurities and body issues and I know it’s not necessarily directed at the trans community, but it still hurts especially since most of the gay men I’ve met who are into drag are super transphobic and I guess I’ve just kinda mixed that association in with all of my other issues regarding the drag community.
Bold of you to assume they’re always cis. Sure isn’t very woke of you smh
I have no problem with somebody not enjoying drag as an art form, or feeling uncomfortable at the sheer extroversion of it (which can make me uncomfortable). My issue was that you referred to it as a “gay dude” thing, and I simply explained why that‘s not correct. You also mentioned that you didn’t understand it, which isn’t the same thing as saying “I don’t understand it, I don’t want to understand it, I don’t want to be further educated on it, but I inexplicably have this opinion on it that I want to share”.

It’s important to be aware of history if you’re going to convey opinions, and it’s important regardless of whether you’re a part of that culture. That’s how we learn to be inclusive and ensure we remain grounded in fact. “I’m not one of them so I don’t need to learn about them” is a strange argument when, as transgender people, we’re battling that attitude (and its effects) every single day.
It’s also just kind of bad comedy many times. Like haha he made a d*** pun, let’s all laugh! It’s like middle school boys humor in so many situations.
Yeah those things all bother me too, but I guess I’m more afraid of being seen as wearing drag and by extent feeling or being seen as one of those jokes
I mean, half of it was dick jokes and arguably most drag queens I’ve ever seen are gay men.  If that’s not a gay dude thing I’m very confused.  “Extroversion” does not make me uncomfortable, I’m an extrovert.

The history of it is the history of it, I’m not dismissing that or saying it doesn’t matter.  I’m saying I’m not part of that culture and it has no meaning to me.  More importantly, I am not personally comfortable with it.  If others are, more power to them.
Ya I totally get that, I don’t want people looking at me and thinking he’s just a dude in a dress or a fake girl or something. It especially sucks cause it’s kind of tainted one of my happiest trans memories a bit, the only time I’ve gotten to be as outwardly feminine as I am internally was a Halloween party a few years back where I got to dress up in this beautiful green prom dress and wear all of my makeup and it made me feel so beautiful and amazing but everyone just treated me like a dude in a dress although my mom did fix my eyebrows which was nice.
Aww that’s really nice, I can totally relate to that though. My first experience being feminine in public was in high school when a friend thought it would be hilarious to sign me up for the language departments production of Cinderella, can you guess which role I was given? 
It was honestly such a mixed bag as an experience cause all the behind the scenes stuff was so great and really positive, like actually getting to feel comfortable in some clothing for once and having a bunch of the girls in the play all excitedly gathering round to do my makeup but anytime I went out in the halls in costume it was horrible. I had people grabbing my ass and lifting up my dress and stuff (luckily I’d foreseen this and put shorts on underneath) plus going out on stage the legs of a satyr and this ratty ass facial hair I’d decided it would be a good idea to grow for some reason was horrible. 
And even after all that my dumb ass still took 10 years to figure out I might not be cis

My Sibling (I Don’t Know What to Call Non-Binary Siblings, Sorry) Got Me a Pride Flag but I Couldn’t Put It up on My Wall So I Put In in the Next Best Place		"I see, you put it in the closet. Ironic.
I mean the word is sibling no??
Just call em “the homies”
I ask my sis to call me sibling, sibby, sib, or sib sib. Neutral and fun.
Honestly i got kicked out for putting my trans and bi flag up on my wall so now im in an raoch infested apt. Downtown for $1400 a month...dont be scared to come out but unlike me try and do so around people you trust completely
cute !! 💘🏳️‍⚧️
Lmao
a nbling?
So I googled it And the non binary term for sibling is ""nibling"" tbh not sure how I feel about that.
[deleted]
So... amazing sibling relationship or only child?
nope, nibling is the term for niece/nephew. the neutral form of sibling is..... sibling
... sibling is gender neutral, niece and nephew aren't tho
😂👏👏👏👏👏
Only child
That's what I assumed but I was curious and googled it so idk wtf happened with those results.
Guessed it
Lmao waddup my niblings 😎

5 months on HRT c: I never use to smile like this. Ever ever. But these last few months, it's really hard not to. Happy Pride Month loves. ❤💛💚💙💜		"Happy Pride! Every girl is more beautiful with a smile! 😍😍😍🌈🌈🌈
Me too.  The first thing friends noticed about me as I never smiled. It took another year of transition before I folded them why I was so happy and they all have accepted me and the happy person I am now.

You look incredible and I'm jealous and happy for you in the best ways! <3
Haha thats so cute! I'm glad you're happy and it clearly shows! While I'm not out yet, I smiled, legitimately, for the first time in I can't even remember. So keep it up!!
Us Underwater Bimbos From Space stick together ‘round these parts. Sorry #shinfo
It's not just the smile, your eyes, they look happy
Ahhh!! Love yr shirt! 💗💖💚💖❤💙💙💗💙💗
Lovely! Nice to see a fellow ETIDiot! Happy Pride.
You have a really great smile. Happy Pride month!
There is no scientific or mathematical formula that is able to count past the level of gorgeousness you are holding. Enthralling.
Wow. You look great and that smile looks amazing on you! So happy things are falling into place for you.
Beautiful
WOW!  You look great!
oh my god you're soooo cute.
Gaaaah y'all are too kind. c: thank you so much for all these lovely words!
I'm really happy you're so happy ^-^ 
It's almost funny and crazy huh? Its really just developing into your own person, the person you know you are. For me the more  ""apparent"" the changes are, the more ecstatic and happy I get. I legit smile like a dork every time I see a new change or a new positive mood change. It's so overwhelmingly beautiful.
Happy Pride!
Dont be! I guarantee you look prettier than her and I combined. And I will accept no other say so! c:

Great, another reason to hate church.	"I'm not atheist, but I'm not really a believer in good either. I'm kinda in between. I've always hated church, with no real reason other than it was boring, and that I always had to be dragged to it when I didn't want to. 


Well today, I was doing what I always do every Sunday when we go to church, I just spaced out and I didn't pay attention. After a while of spacing out though, the pastor starts talking about DNA. I decided to pay attention a bit, since I'm taking biology for summer school and I wanted to hear what he was gonna a say about it. Well that was sure a bad idea. He started talking about how we all have our own DNA, and then he said he doesn't understand why there's people who are ""trans"" and want to change their bodies. ""You can get surgeries, change your body all you like but you can't change your DNA."" Of course we know that, and we know that we can never be biological men, or women. But then he said that this month, we should be talking all about God. Tbh, idk if he talked about pride month but this is OUR month. He can't he saying stuff like that when God is celebrated all year, and especially on December. He then started talking about nature, and how we need to accept ours and not change it. ""God made you like you are, and you shouldn't change your nature when God wouldn't want that."" I can't even begin to imagine what if would be like if we couldn't transition.  ""God"" is supposed to love everyone, then God wouldn't judge trans people. 

I'm sick and tired of church, I swear when I grow up to be older, I'll transition. Then, I'll quit going to church because I'm not gonna support someone who won't even support me, it makes no sense.

Tldr: The pastor at my church was like, ""Accept to be in the body you were assigned as. I don't know why there are people who are 'trans'. Your DNA won't change, no matter the surgeries and changes that you do to your body."""	"Ugh, fuck all that noise. How goddamn dare he say that shit in Pride month of all times. 

It's MY nature, I'll fucking change it if I want to. If god didn't want that, he shouldn't have made it this way to begin with. And you're right, he's supposed to love everyone no matter what, so what's it matter even if he didn't want that?

Religion and spirituality are conceptually wonderful things, but in reality are most often used to destroy others because they all tend to push theirs as dominant. Yet they wonder why belief in god is falling at a record rate.

Personally I subscribe to a type of pagan spirituality based on nature and science. There's no hard-coded fate, no grandiose will, only the things we can see and interact with such as the mother Earth and the sun. Our existence is what makes the universe meaningful. That existence is filled with errors, and it's part of human ingenuity to correct those errors. We learned how the human body functions, so if you're born in the wrong body you can take steps to change your body. And we possess free will to make that decision for ourselves. It's not the body that makes you who and what you are, it's your *spirit*.
we deserve a month to ourselves because yea god is literally celebrated every single day of every year. people just want to make more excuses to be transphobic and it's really annoying because they never want to say their feelings how they truly are. they always want to cover it up with something about religion or health stuff. and god is supposed to love all of his creations, and not shun them for being a certain way like many religious people portray to people
From what I've read of medical shit.. your DNA does change. I mean for fuck sake.. the only thing making people male or female is hormones.. the DNA just turns a switch for the production of one or the other. Fuck your pastor and fuck christianity and any other shitty fucking organized religion. You should stop going to church.
If god created people in his image and there are trans people in the world, then clearly god must be trans.
Don't get your science advice from pastors, kids.
He can shove his God up his ass.  God is a sadistic, evil motherfucker who gets off on ruining people's lives before they are even born.
Bigot. Accept yourself for who you are, trans or not. If you're trans, you can't change that. And God loves you for your trans self.
Yeah I split from the church a long time ago I was raised Christian but I never really liked the stuff the church did. I’m a Wiccan now because where I found only hate and old people who can’t accept change with the Christian religions I found love and acceptance in the Wiccan community. I never felt safe at church but now I especially wouldn’t feel safe there. You sound like you are young and live at home based on This post. If true see if you can come up with an excuse to miss church with your parents. Sending virtual hugs your way. You got this and eventually you’ll be able to avoid church all together
in a hundred or so years dna might be changeable.
This is why I'm an atheist. What makes anyone think #1 they know a god exists and #2 that they know what said god thinks and wants from us. There's zero evidence any god/gods exist and I'm tired of being told by others what their god wants or think about what we do. It's strange it's always people telling me what god wants and not god doing it.
I’m really sorry that you had that experience. It sounds like you know not to take it to heart. But specifically about the science, we should be clear about what thinks are changeable or not. Disclaimer, I’m going to talk more from a mtf perspective but it’s generally applicable either way.

Firstly, there is no single way to form a biological basis for sex. You have your chromosomal configuration, which is stored in your DNA. But there are more variations than just XX and XY like XXY. And it’s possible to have male gonads with XX chromosomes. You may have heard that we used to do self-chromosome testing in some science classes but stopped because a lot more people than you’d think have something other than XX or XY. 

If you determine sex based on genital configuration that is very changeable, and male and female genitals are very similar in terms of the parts that make them up. Consider also that we recognize a woman that has had a hysterectomy is still a woman. Clearly there’s more to it than having a standard genital configuration. And again consider non-standard genital configurations like hermaphroditism.

If we base sex on hormones, that’s also very changeable, and is largely responsible for the visible secondary sex characteristics we most commonly recognize a person’s sex from. And again we can look at things like women with PCOS where out of range hormones don’t automatically make someone not a woman.

When we’re talking about biological sex, it’s a lot less of a cut and dry one or the other and a lot more of looking at various indicators of sex and drawing a conclusion based on how many of those systems align more closely with our ideas of one or the other. And of course again Intersex people exist or people with chimerism. It’s been said that being intersex is about as common as being a redhead.

So biological sex is complicated and in a lot of cases very changeable and even if you don’t change it, it’s still not a reliable indicator of gender. It’s made up all the way down :)
Ima guess American Evangelicals/Prots

Anyways, those guys are the inheritors of heretics anyways so don’t care what they think.  If you shouldn’t change anything God made then we should be living naked in the woods.
A pastor talking about DNA in a sermon is hilarious to me.  

I thought science was the devil to religion.
If God made us the way we are, then he made us trans. He gave us that challenge to overcome in life. Telling us we aren't allowed to is what's going against God.

I definitely think that you should stop going to church as soon as you can, it doesn't sound like a good environment to be in.
This story makes me sad, especially with everything going on in the US at the moment. I think someone should tell that pastor that if God thought it was wrong to be Trans, than it wouldn't be a thing in the first place.
Do not wait to kick that church out of your life. Literally stand up and walk out in the middle of that nonsense. Do not tolerate intolerance. That's such absolute garbage. Fight that shit hard.
Let me tell you something about God. He is indescribable in every possible way. His love echos across existence and penetrates the very atoms that hold us together. He made everything cis, trans, intersex, gay etc. The crazy thing is we can’t comprehend him nor can we understand why we are this way but we are. Biology made us mentally one sex and physically the other. It sucks when we have gender dysphoria but when we discover ourselves and decide to transition we are bringing back who we truly are, the connection will be set and solidified. When we transition we are showing the world who we are within and expressing that on the outside. In a way it is a truly deeply spiritual thing about it. 

Some on the outside can’t comprehend why we transition and why we go through the process. They live outside the area of understanding. One has to get on their level so they understand it. When I talk to Christian I explain it on a Biblical level in terms they will understand.
reminds me of what happened yesterday

I was at church, we had a pastor and she talked about God's promise and that's pretty cool and then suddenly she changes her topic and starts talking about identity, and then she starts talking about trans people. Continues to say how this is unnatural and part of the devil's influence on the new generation yadda yadda yadda. This is already getting pretty bad but THEN SHE PROCEEDS TO SHOW A VIDEO OF A mtf DETRANSITIONER. Like, I almost had a panic attack right then and there(that would be real bad since transphobic country + transphobic parents). Then she talked about how believing in God can push all this ""evil stuff away"" and how man wanting to be woman is a sin etc.. Basically a ton of bullshit since there's literally a verse in the Bible that says ""there is no male or female for you are all one in Christ"". Despite that i know this is all just bs it was still a horrifying and traumatizing experience. Parents can't stop talking about it either so that's great, love life.

Now, as a trans person I'm still a Christian but like, this is probably the first time I really understand why Christians have such a bad rep and why are most queer people stay away from them. I feel betrayed ;w;
You know what, if you have faith and you are looking for a church, look up a church called ""Community of Christ"". I am an agnostic, but my dad is a minister for Community of Christ. They are essentially a left-wing church. Gay and trans people can be members of the priesthood (in other words they can be ministers) and they were one of the first churches to start officiating gay weddings (as far as I'm aware). I don't normally plug a church as an agnostic, but ...I do think people should know there are left wing churches. If you want to keep going to church, there are options. 

And on a personal note, when I was in high school I was suicidal. I was not aware I was nonbinary yet, but the continuous bullying over not fitting in with men (as I was not ""masculine"" enough) was exhausting. Community of Christ essentially saved my life. Queer people were welcome there. Indeed, many of my friends from CoC have eventually come out and been accepted as they are (so still members of the church). I actually think CoC was the most progressive place I had in high school (my high school was extremely conservative, my workplaces were all conservative, just generally the city I lived in was very conservative).
>....we know that we can never be biological....

What about my brain isn't biologic? Why does my presumed DNA over rule the way my brain functions. We are no less our gender than cis folk.
Ask him why people wear glasses or pacemakers. Surely they should just accept the body their God gave them?
Wonder if he would say that if he or his family needed a liver transplant etc.? Just drawing lines where he thinks they should be seems to me.
Don’t let him get to you. He is clearly uneducated. I know it’s hard but as someone who grew up and served in a church eventually I just learned to walk away and never look back. You can of course find an accepting ones all over the place!
Also I would recommend him or anyone in your life with that view some books. “Beyond a binary God” “transfigured, a 40 day journey” “queer’s the word”
My body is a temple, and I am the god to whom it is devoted to.
It's funny how science and evolution doesn't exist because ""God"" but it suddenly exists the moment it gives them the opportunity to be transphobic.
This feels weird, but I'm so offended right now *as a biochemist* by what he said. 

As a trans person, ehhh, hate is hate idgaf. 

I'm so over biggots who know the word DNA and nothing else.
Fuck that guy. Who needs 'em anyway? You can be whatever you wanna be, my guy. 

As a trans dude, I don't think my DNA needs to change? You don't see my DNA if you pass by me on the street. I just need the outside to look like who I am on the inside. I'm fine with my DNA for the most part. Sure, I have some less-than-ideal conditions floating around my gene pool, but I won't mind much if my bones are seen as part of a female skeleton after I die. Not like I'll be around to deal with it.
I suppose, then, that people born with congenital limb defects shouldn't get prosthetic hands or feet. They should just accept the body they were assigned"" by God. And kids born with congenital cataracts should just accept being blind, right? They definitely shouldn't get a simple eye surgery to give them the gift of sight. Clearly that would be in stark violation of God's will. Deaf kids obviously should never get cochlear implants. Oh, and kids born with an atrial septal defect should for *sure* not have heart surgery so that they can live a normal life. I mean, come on! Clearly God wants those kids to suffer.

If your pastor is really going to argue that we should accept the bodies we're ""assigned"", then he should also be arguing against all these other treatments. I mean, God assigned those kids those bodies with those defects! If he's not saying people should just accept all those conditions too, then he's just a giant fucking hypocrite who's trying to use religion to hate on trans people.
Do you feel comfortable of standing up in church and pushing back against hate? How would your parents punish you? Hopefully this will just get you banned from church. They don’t take kindly to dissenters.
Here's the funny bit about DNA.

Every one of us has DNA for both male and female. Its all right there. There's just a few tiny bits of the entire strand that sets the hormone production into motion which develops into male or female (or any number of intersex conditions as well). Once the body starts developing, its really all up to hormones and whether your body is testosterone dominant or estrogen dominant.

So, even though I was AMAB, my DNA has all the instructions to grow breasts and have female skin and hair, if my body is estrogen dependent. And if a person is AFAB, their DNA has all the instructions for a fabulous beard and deep voice if their body is testosterone dependent. Its all up to hormones.

The DNA argument is shite.
I left my charismatic evangelical upbringing behind soon after graduating high school, but never really processed how damaging being raised in a violent death cult was. Now I'm doing a lot of work on maladaptive trauma responses, and realizing that a lot of that trauma started while I was a kid, living totally under the influence and control of adults who bought into a violent, hateful, delusional, hyper political theology, and thought they had to brainwash me to save me from the fires of hell. 

Highly recommend cutting ties w the cult asap, and deconstruction work is important too, to reflect on the ways that their dogma rewires your emotions and brain.
Wow. Sounds like this pastor is rebelling against God's plan. After all, he made trans people didn't he?

To borrow a phrase from a rabbi I once heard speak on the subject, ""God made trans people, just like how he made wheat but not bread."" Which is to say, not everything God makes is complete. Sometimes it has to go through a process to get to what it needs to be, something it couldn't have been without that process.

I would ask him, why does he feel the need to question God's plan.
I'm an atheist, but this topic just annoys me.

What if God made you intersex? Then God is obviously fine with there being more than two genders. What if God made you with Complete Androgen Insensitivity? I guess God thought XY people can be women. What if God made you with de la Chapelle's syndrome? I guess God thought XX people can be men. What if God made you XXY? I guess God made you 1.5 people.

It almost seems like this pastor is not, in fact, basing his arguments on science or logic, but is using post hoc justifications. It's almost like that, because it is that. He doesn't know shit about genetics and how sex works in humans. He's starting from his premise, ""I don't like trans people"" and saying God is against that\*, and then making up vague scientific sounding nonsense to try to then reenforce THAT claim.

This pastor doesn't like trans people and is a hack, twisting the supposed words of God because he's a bigot.

There are five different genders in ancient Israelite texts. Eunuchs were pretty clearly not men, and not women, and treated differently in the Hebrew law; there's three obvious genders in the Bible.

Jesus hung out with the dregs of society, sex workers and the most hated, corrupt government officials. He used the story of Good Samaritan to demonstrate racism and prejudice is bad and to be kind to people. I don't believe in Jesus, but he had some good ideas. He'd definitely hanging out with trans people if he was here today, and there's no doubt this pastor would tell Jesus' that he was going to hell lol. Also, he had a lot to say about corrupt people, twisting scripture to gain privilege and power, and mistreating the marginalized and powerless. Methinks the pastor missed some important lessons from his homeboy Jesus. Maybe he needs to reread his favorite book a little more carefully.

\*show me where in the Bible it says anything about intersex people, I'll wait. It doesn't mention them. There are SO MANY rules about when and where and who can have sex. If it's not mentioned whether having sex with a woman with XY being a sin, or a man with XX being a sin, then it's not a sin. Eating shell fish is a death sentence. Picking up sticks on Saturday is a death sentence. God mentions some pretty petty nonsense to get in a tizzy about, but not one word on intersex people. If intersex people aren't mentioned, and it's fine for them to have sex with people, it's fine for trans people and this idiot can shut up. Even if there were a scripture against it, and there isn't one that doesn't require some real stretching, Jesus healed a man on the Sabbath (a death sentence and breaking the law) and said that the law was made for man, not man for the law. Rabbinic tradition has a principle called [pikuach nefesh](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pikuach_nefesh), that holds that preserving life overrides basically any law. So even if there was a scripture against being trans (there isn't) this principle would make that irrelevant. The incredibly low life expectancy of trans people would obviously warrant that. Again, no scripture, this is irrelevant, but even if there were a scripture it would not matter. If you care about that sort of thing, the Bible is not against trans people.
Your pastor is, quite frankly, a dope. 

I totally agree with you. A couple of comments on what the said,

1) God gave us free will, so the scriptures say, then we sure as hell have the right to question everything under the universe. It's what we do with that right and power that counts. 

2) Christianity is founded on the teachings of Jesus the Christ, or chosen one or annointed one. Jesus said nothing about queer people, Nothing. He said nothing about trans people. Nothing. 

He DID say to love God with everything in our hearts and to love our neighbors as ourselves----and that THIS was the greatest commandment of all.

Pretty simple isn't it. 

Trans people exist because of thousands and thousands of years of complicated  genetic couplings involving billions and billions of people. We can no more prevent transgender people  than trying to stop Donald Trump from saying incredibly stupid things.

So buck up. Go back to snoozing in church. 

Useless information, there. I felt the same way when I was your age...
[removed]
Not that I agree with the pastor, but he chose not to celebrate pride month he can talk about whatever he wants.  Freedom of religion.  I recommend a disciples of christ or a United church of christ denomination.  Those are accepting of gay and transgender people
I remember  braking the bad new to my grandparents  peacher that I saw a film of gay animals in the ocean in school. I had also saw some animals  change  sexes because of a shortage of the opposite  gender. It sorta of messed  up his day? I told him to read less Bible and more google.
I do the same, no deities to please or displease, just me and Nature. Also, that whole argument of ""God made us the way we are"" is easily turned in favour of those that engage in surgical transition. If God made us how we are, he/she/they/it also then created people with genders that are incongruous with their bodies, and if we ""correct"" things like cleft palate and ambiguous genitalia when they occur, to no iré of the imaginary friend in the sky, why then is doing such with a trans person wrong?
>You should stop going to church.

I want to but my mom is super catholic 😣 She literally forces me to pray everyday, (although sometimes I just lay down and do nothing while I ""pray"") and she's always praying to God before we leave as if he could prevent any accident that could happen to us during the day.
If there's an all-knowing all-loving god, they would know what would happen and so would make anything they disagreed with be gone right? As such, any trans, gay, etc. people must be at the very least, tolerated by god.
True, but I'm taking biology for summer school and my teacher literally said the same things to the class. At least he didn't seem like he did it to hurt us, it was educational and I understand that he didn't mean it as harm.
If God was really what people say he is, we wouldn't be stuck in bodies we don't want to be in, suffering in internal pain. (Unless we get surgeries and hormones)
I was in denial for a few months, I thought maybe if the thoughts went away I could live life like I always had been... but I couldn't. If God doesn't accept me for who I am then why should I praise him?
I'm catholic, since my mom raised me like that but I really wish I was born in a non religious home, religion is dumb and the people who are in one are dumb too.
Yeah, and maybe we could have kids of our own in the bodies we want.
>There's zero evidence any god/gods exist and I'm tired of being told by others what their god wants or think about what we do.

I just want to live life without being told what to do, or thinking that I have to listen to someone just because they say so. I agree with your thinking, but I'm not fully atheist, since the idea of God is still confusing to me.
>So biological sex is complicated and in a lot of cases very changeable and even if you don’t change it, it’s still not a reliable indicator of gender. It’s made up all the way down :)

I think this pastor needs to be educated more, especially since he thinks he can talk about our community like this and not feel a bit bad about it.
>If you shouldn’t change anything God made then we should be living naked in the woods.

You're right, but religious people will always have excuses for their way of thinking.
I know right, lmao it was funny but it kinda hurt me, especially since my biology teacher for summer school talked about these exact things a few days ago. Like I get it, I can't change my DNA. We all know that, but at least we can change our appearances so we can look like the gender we want to look like.
>I definitely think that you should stop going to church as soon as you can, it doesn't sound like a good environment to be in.

Well I'm still a teen, so its gonna be a while until I can stop going to church but I do intend to stop going when I can, and see how I feel after that.
I wish I could, and I actually was thinking of telling my mom if I could stand outside since I wasn't really feeling comfortable inside but I was too scared to do so. I'm not sure why.
>THEN SHE PROCEEDS TO SHOW A VIDEO OF A mtf DETRANSITIONER.

WTF. That is SO wrong and if they did that at my church, I wouldn't have hesitated to leave. Its sad that you live in a transphobic area but I hope things get better for you. Maybe you can move to a more safer area when you're older, especially since your parents seem to be transphobic as well.
He's just using excuses to be transphobic because he probably doesn't like trans people and thinks that saying stuff like this is okay because he's a ""pastor""
>Do you feel comfortable of standing up in church and pushing back against hate?

I'm a really shy person, something like this is a huge no.

> How would your parents punish you?

My dad could care less, he hates religion like me but not  that much. My mom though, she would probably take away my phone, and force me to actually pray with her because she makes me pray with her everyday but I just lay down and do nothing and she doesn't seem to care. She would probably also yell at me, like alot.

> this will just get you banned from church. They don’t take kindly to dissenters.

Actually, a few weeks ago someone disagreed about what the pastor was saying about abortion, so she left and slammed the door hard. I'm not sure if she's banned, but the pastor didn't seem to really care, so I'm guessing she's still welcomed back although I doubt she'll do such thing.
Scratch that we can
How old are you? Sounds like my mom when I was a kid.
Maybe you should pray for God to grant your mother the love and compassion Jesus taught everyone to show to one another.
I mean, I'll always have dysphoria.  The ""What could've been""s, especially in regards to my voice.  Not being able to get pregnant (though considering recent events, it's probably a blessing).  Feeling like an outcast within the lesbian community.  Feeling inadequate around cis women.  All the trauma of going through a puberty I knew I didnt want, begging and pleading with family to make it stop, and being laughed at.  Going through enough male puberty to have severe dysphoria, but not enough to be taken seriously as a man, which lead to a lot of harassment, bullying, and mansplaining before I eventually came out.  Decades of time lost.  Any chance at an actual career lost.  Lots of mental issues from years of trauma from untreated dysphoria.
God does accept you for who you are. It's a shame that many believers seem to understand God when they don't. It's very simple, God loves you no matter what. He made you how you are. Any 'pastor' who says otherwise is following their own agenda. All the anti LGBT bullshit coming from people who say it claiming it's God's will are sinning and actively going against God. I'm not hugely religious but I do believe a God exists. I don't know his true name, all I know is he loves you, and whatever man says about you is a test of faith. Be true to yourself.
>I'm catholic

Acceptance is the first step to recovery. I consider myself a recovering catholic...
well if we can ever as humanity move past cults, and groups of people that use an imaginary friend called god to try to inflict as much pain and suffering as possible on others then maybe we will finally be able to move foward and have true peace.
I'm not what I'd call hard atheist. I believe there could absolutely be a god type entity but I don't see any reason to believe it to be true.
I find that folks like that tend to have a point they’re trying to argue and will try to make everything else fit that argument rather than go into things with the intent to learn and share what they’ve learned.
*stupid people

The religion has nothing to do with their stupidity, it’s simply their tool, which could also be used for not stupidity
Honestly it sounds like scientists are no longer so sure they really know what DNA really does as well as they used to.
yeah i'm planning to do that next year, hopefully things work out and i can get on hrt asap after that\^\^ best of luck to you as well!!
Yeah, no kidding. I just want to make sure you can see the way in which he is being completely hypocritical and thus that you don't have to take his words as being worth anything. And to give you some ammo in case you ever decide to challenge him on his hypocrisy.
You have to do what you’re comfortable with. Leaving isn’t disruptive enough. I would suggest standing and pointing out this hate and representing more knowledgeable information. I’m considering protesting outside of churches the way antiabortion protesters do outside abortion clinics. I can envision lots of signs: “Reject Superstition ”, “Religion is a Lie”, “Reject American Taliban”.
I'm 16...
Maybe, but I've tried before, I want to just live life like a normal teenager but it doesn't seem possible.
Dysphoria will never go away, unfortunately. You can think about how your life would've been if you transitioned sooner, and the childhood you could've had as the gender you now know you want to be.
>I'm not hugely religious but I do believe a God exists.

I agree on this, I'm not atheist but knowing there are pastors around the world who are like this one is making me rethink religion as a whole and if God really is real.
I sure hope so, I'd love to live in a world where everyone accepts me for me.
THIS. You couldn't have described my beliefs any better.
Your right, even if these type of people were educated, they won't stop their thinking because that's just who they are.
Your right. They need to be educated better.
I know, I didn't plan on listening at him at all when I heard what he was saying, I was actually really mad when hearing those words, and it made me want to leave the place immediately but I'm pretty sure my mom would've gotten mad at me for doing so.
I see. Well, you can still see major changes before the age of 24. If you can hold out a other two years...
Well, yeah. You're not a normal teenager. You're trans. You have a particular set of challenges to deal with that 99 point whatever percent of your peers aren't going to have to deal with.

Of course ""not normal"" is definitely not the same as ""bad"". Too many people make that mistake without even thinking about it. Don't be one of them.

The sooner you accept that your life *isn't* normal and isn't going to *be* normal, the better. Because as long as you're holding on to ""normal"" as some kind of standard, some kind of goal or ideal to strive for, it's going to stop you from doing your actual job, which is to make the best choices you can, in your own unique life, to bring yourself happiness.

Which, ironically, is basically the *most* normal thing you can do. After all, what are cis people doing if not making the best choices they can for their own unique lives to bring themselves happiness? That's all *any* of us are doing with our lives. It's not about being cis or trans. It's about being human. And we all share that, regardless of how ""normal"" we may or may not be.

What's different about you and me versus our cis peers is not our struggle for happiness. It's that the particular choices we have to make to *get* happiness are different from the ones cis people have to make.
>the childhood you could've had as the gender you now know you want to be.

I honestly don't think it would've been that different. 🤔🤷 I had long hair til 3.  I played with Barbies at the neighbors (though had to keep it a secret, cause my dad would've FREAKED).  I had all the Disney princess movies.  I watched soaps with my mom.  I hung out with my mom and her coworkers. I was always treated like one of the girls.  So, I pretty much got a girl's childhood.  The rest of my family forced masculine stereotypes on me, but my mom never did, and I spent most of my time with her.

If I were AFAB, my teens would've been tough still.  I still would've been an outcast for liking punk, heavy metal, and video games.  I still would've been seen as weird for being autistic and ADHD.  I still would've dealt with homophobic bullying.  I still would've felt extremely uncomfortable in locker rooms.

Very little would've changed.  I may have even still dealt with dysphoria, because there was a time where I wished I had masculinized more, because I was sick of being treated like a child and being pushed around.  I was always rather androgynous.  I used to think my dysphoria was from me being small and weak.

I really just miss my 20's.  They flew by because I was drunk and disociating the entire time.  Wouldve been nice if I could've gotten help back then.  I was in therapy by 22, but they were incompetent and didn't see the GLARING, OBVIOUS SIGNS. 🙄🤦
Again, I believe these experiences are a test of faith. Remember that this pastor is a sinful human like everyone else. He doesn't truly know right from wrong either, and is subject to bias. His interpretation of the Bible is from the perspective of an imperfect, sinful human. I encourage you to rethink religion for sure, everyone should question your beliefs. But please don't let a sinful, unrighteous man give you negative bias towards religion. It's a shame, I know, but that pastor does not truly represent God. Noone can. Best of luck on your journey. Much love 💕
>The sooner you accept that your life isn't normal and isn't going to be normal, the better.

Yeah, but its still hard living my life not normal. I keep wishing it was and although I now know its not, there are things that can change, its just my mom refusing to do so. She literally was like, ""Why didn't you tell me you felt like this? You know I will support you."" When we talked about me being trans but she still deadnames me, says she doesn't want me to do on hormones, and keeps saying we'll go to a doctor when I know we aren't.
Thank you very much! I'll think about it for sure, because I'm not going to let one person dictate my beliefs.
Parents who say they're accepting and supportive but then don't want to actually help their kids get the help they need really piss me off.

Here's [a comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/trans/comments/vi0jmp/i_cant_transition_because_my_mother_is_in_denial/idfttjw/?context=3) I made last week on a similar post. Maybe that comment (or, heck, the whole post) will give you some useful stuff for challenging your mother about her actions versus her words.
Good on ya! You and I both know how important it is for our mental health to not reject our feelings just because they apparently offend others 🙄. I may not know much but I know you're not going to hell for doing what you must to survive

EDIT: NOT* Reject lol very important typo
Thanks, this might help although in regards to my deadname, I tell her to call me the nickname of my deadmame because I do not like my deadname. Here's something I actually posted around a week ago: 


Anyways, she called me by my deadname today again, and I looked at her annoyed. She was like, ""okay then, 'Danny'. But just know that you are *deadname* and not Danny. I don't get this. Like, 'Ricky'."" (The name of one of my cousins, and that's actually his name, not Ricardo with Ricky being the nickname) I told her, ""You said you wanted me to be happy huh? Well then call me Danny, when I'm called the other name, I don't like it."" She said, ""Well other people call you *deadname* and-"" I said, ""It makes me uncomfortable when they do that."" And then she said that we were going too fast? Maybe in terms of my transition but idk why she would even say that because she hasn't even done a thing to show she supports me in my transition.


So even if I did talk with her, she wouldn't be too supportive on using my name, even if I tell her constantly to call me Danny. Also, my dad rarely ever called me my deadname and ever since I told them both to call me Danny, he's stopped completely and just calls me Danny now. So her calling me Danny shouldn't be a problem at all, since my dad can do it. She's just choosing not to. Now, maybe it does slip but she rarely calls me Danny, and there are moments where I don't think it could slip because sometimes around people I get called Danny, but she still calls me my deadname even after hearing me being called Danny. 


This is something hard for me that I'm gonna have to overcome, but maybe if I push her to go to the doctors, she'll learn from them the pain that is a deadname, and what being trans really is. Until now, I guess I have to suffer in pain, while she just smiles like nothing is wrong."	vlgk87	trans	202	0.97	2022-06-26 22:48:26

Heading there from Seattle myself
I plan on it! Thank you so much! 💖
❤🧡💛💚💙💙 😁
Whoo! Have fun and be safe! Maybe I'll bump into ya 😁🏳️‍🌈
Oh yeah I live in NJ and visit often. It really is a great city with so much to do.
Thank you!! 💖
Yay! So exciting! Have fun and be safe 😊
[removed]
It's sooo expensive in Manhattan. That's why a lot of people commute from NJ. But even NJ is expensive to live. Just not as bad as Manhattan obviously. 
So much to do there. I've gone on day trips and literally spent the whole day in Central Park.
[removed]
lol oh yes. There are certainly a lot of characters in the city. Makes for good people watching 😶 lol
[removed]
lol oh yeah. In Times Square you'll see all kinds of street performers. Pretty sure the naked cowboy still hangs around there playing his guitar 🤣 lol 
It's definitely a city like no other. I've been there so many times but never for Pride so I'm super excited. It's going to be crazy! 🙃

Sure will!!! Happy Pride! 💖"	byaxdl	trans	184	0.98	2019-06-08 18:23:53
Hey-O I have a question/gen I’m a lesbian and was wondering if it was ok to put this quote on my flag “ dykes for trans rights “	"Thank you for the answers will post when I do it 🥰🥰


[pride flag 🥰](https://www.reddit.com/r/lgbt/comments/tar1b2/pride_flag/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf)"	"Yes please many of us are also dykes and go to Dyke March as well as Trans March
Sounds good to me
I see no reason not to.
Absolutely 🥰
Hell yeah
Hello I’m a dyke trans woman and I approve!
Yea!!!
Yep its ok☺
i really don’t see why that would be any different than people reclaiming and using the word queer. you’re a lesbian, you can use lesbian words if you’d like. all up to you.
Lol sure we accept allies !
Whats a dyke
Isnt that a slur? Or is this one of those reclaimed slurs?

I may be completely wrong in either case.
I mean black people and gay people call themselves these slurs so ill assume yes since your both... I would maybe not go shouting it around as anyone will tell you... you'll piss off someone one way or another
DO IT DO IT DO IT!! :D
love the concept n the design so much! trans n lesbian solidarity is so important 🤝
Yeah why not
I self reference as dyke
You can call yourself whatever the fuck you want 🤷🏼‍♀️
i really don’t see why that would be any different than people reclaiming and using the word queer. you’re a lesbian, you can use lesbian words if you’d like. all up to you.
🥰
It’s a reclaimed slur that lesbians are called/call themselves
Reclaimed 🙂
I thought it was a kind of water channel
Is it still a slur if someone uses it offensively? /gen I don't rlly understand how the reclaimed slurs work :0
(THEY’RE RECLAIMED)
Oh okay!

I have mixed feelings on reclaimed words. I won't be using them, I don't think. 

All the power to those who use them though! (responsibly of course)
It has two meanings, so you’re not wrong!! In the context OP is using though it’s a reclaimed slur
Yes
Use what your comfortable with 🥰🥰

I got misgendered at pride	I don't know how to not care how people see me. I don't know why it stung so much. I'm used to it, you know? I get misgendered all the time, I try to speak up. Sometimes people understand, sometimes they choose not to, they choose to ignore it, maybe they just don't understand. I know I don't pass. It's hard for me to leave the house every day, dysphoria creeps in every morning. I almost didn't go to pride, bc it's so hot out and I couldn't wear as many layers as usual. I tried to not worry about what I looked like too much.. I figured if anyone would understand, it'd be people at pride. And.. I don't know. It wasn't that I was misgendered so much as that when I spoke up and corrected them, they ignored me. I keep trying to tell myself they didn't hear me, you know..? But I just can't shake the sinking feeling in my chest, the lump in my throat. I feel so stuck in my own body. I'm so tired of having to correct people. I want to not care, I don't want it to hurt so badly. I feel like it shouldnt matter what anyone else sees.. because I know who I am. But it does matter, and it does hurt and I don't know how to deal with that.	"Oh I’m so sorry to hear that! Nothing stings quite as much as someone in your community not recognizing the struggles that are familiar to everyone in it. Being kind is hard and in the days when the people around you aren’t kind, that’s when you need to be the most kind to yourself
Misgendering is like a shot to the heart, it hurts at your core, especially when it's unintentional. Because it means they are not reading you the way you want to be read. It gets you thinking, is it me or them? Dysphoria kicks in, anxiety, anger, frustration, self-doubt it's hard. I'm with you and I'm sorry you had to go through it, especially at pride.
When I first started on hormones, I still presented male because I wanted to wait until I developed more feminine. I had purchased a pin of the trans flag with She/Her on it. I still got misgendered every single day. I kept quiet because I was too scared to correct them. Only if someone asked about the pin, I'd tell them that it was my preferred pronouns. But for the most part, people just misgendered me. I felt miserable and cried a lot. Especially when I thought back to how excited I was when I got my pin. It was going to be my way of coming out to everyone without having to actually tell/explain to them. But, nobody paid no never mind. Nobody cared. I know how much it sucks, and I know how much pain it can cause. But in time, with patients and persistents, you can get to the point of passing and being seen as the person you really are.
name and pronouns to affirm gender?
Sorry you had this experience 😔 I was too afraid to go to Pride today out of fears of not belonging and getting misgendered, so I went to visit my parents instead and ride my motorcycle as I’ve been severely anxious and depressed this past week. I hope it gets better for you OP ❤️
 Me too. Are you a trans man?
*Sending virtual comfort support hugs*
OF ALL PLACES
I'm sorry you had to go through that 😢
You as well
Sometimes it happens more in queer spaces because people don't know whether to read you as queer/GNC or trans depending on what you're wearing. If I wear a dress I get read as a GNC man more often than I'd like in queer spaces, but baggy jeans and a big Hoodie I get read as a cis female more. It's weird. 
  
Sometimes the lgbts are pretty bad at asking for pronouns too
Thanks. It was definitely a hard time that felt like would never end. I couldn't see things getting better but, eventually they did and continue to do so."	vflyzw	trans	185	0.99	2022-06-19 03:11:32
