In-laws showed up to our door unannounced after learning I am trans (MtF)	"Some background before I begin, my wife and I have been together for 8 years and married for 3. Her parents are incredibly conservative, outwardly racist and clearly homophobic. They do not know we are married; it was a courthouse marriage done for paperwork reasons, and we plan to have our 'real' wedding later. Her parents do not know this, as my wife assumed they would not take it well. For the last few years I have been on a bit of a process of self discovery, which led to the realization that I am trans, and I began HRT about 7-8 months ago. My wife and I have talked a lot about our relationship and the challenges and changes that transitioning can bring about, and we are happier now than ever, and plan to stay together.

&#x200B;

This past Sunday, my wife decided (after months of planning) to finally tell her mom about me transitioning on her weekly phone call. We expected this to go poorly, and our expectations were met. Basically, they don't view trans people as people, and don't believe that it would be possible for us to ever be happy together. Her mom was convinced that I would leave her for a man, highly unlikely given that I'm a lesbian (and we're married). Her mom cut her out of the family, saying anyone who wants to be with a trans person can't be a part of her family. Obviously this was sad and disappointing, but not unexpected.

&#x200B;

Monday (the next day) was my wife's birthday, so I made her meals and gave her gifts when she wrapped up working from home that day, a little before 5. We had just finished unwrapping when there was a knock at the door, and I saw her mom's frizzled hair from the window. I was in running shorts and a t-shirt with no bra, no makeup, and no shower after working out, so in no way fit to talk to people who have never seen me as a woman. Mind you, they also live 60-90 minutes away, so this was clearly a planned trip. When my wife answered the door, they walked right into the house and demanded to speak with both of us immediately. I was hiding in our laundry so as not to be seen, and begged my wife to make them wait outside or in their car for 10-15 minutes while I got ready. Eventually they moved to our front porch, where they stood staring into the windows.

&#x200B;

I went upstairs, tried to calm myself and change clothes, then went down to deal with them. They were waiting on the front porch, and when I opened the door to walk out, they refused to back up or give any room, so we were extremely close to each other. Now, I will tell you, I had kinda always expected something like this. I have never shared that I am very progressive in my politics, but over the years I have known them, they have always worked to push my buttons. I typically don't speak when we are all together, and they have never seen me actually behaving like myself. Tbh, they have no clue who I really am, and never cared to know. I figured one day they would push me over the edge, but I always thought I would be able to control myself and my emotions. Please know, dear reader, that when I tell you what happened next, that I have no hate for people who alter their appearance for happiness. Clearly, I am willing to do the same, given the amount of HRT, hair removal, and makeup I go through on the reg. But when I opened that door and stepped outside, the first words out of my MIL's mouth were, ""Nice breasts"". Almost immediately and without thinking, I scoffed and said, ""Well, at least mine are real.""

&#x200B;

So that's how the conversation started. Everyone gasped and took a step back (except me, since my back was already on the door). I think she was extremely taken aback, as she has never known me to talk back, nor do I think she was aware that I knew she had a boob job (they're not big). But I think it surprisingly made everyone calm down a bit, as she realized she wasn't ready for an insult fight. For the next 5-10 minutes, she talked about how we are terrible, lying children, and could never understand the pain we were causing her as a mother. They said that there was no way my wife could make the decision to stay with me, as she couldn't view it objectively since she was in a relationship with me. They tried to convince us not to get married (bit late on that one, lol) because, as they put it, ""it's only a 50-50 shot this even works out"", and that I couldn't decide until I'd ""finished all that transition stuff"". They said it was fine for me to decide to live a perverted lifestyle myself, but immoral to bring their daughter into it, and that my wife's mother had the right to tell her what to do. My wife was amazingly calm, and made it clear that she could make her own independent choices as an adult, and that we were very happy together. All the calm logic in the world wouldn't help, though, as my MiL is nuts.

&#x200B;

Then came the real anger. My MiL said that her sister was threatening to strangle me with her bare hands, and to 'just wait and see what happens when I tell the rest of the family'. She then took out some cheap-ass dishware that I assume she was going to give as a gift, and started throwing it on our porch to break, screaming that this is what I was doing to her family and her mind. She said that her mind was broken, and that she couldn't control what came out of it, and that I should be worried for what that might mean for me. After breaking all the dishes (or trying, she isn't very strong so some of the dishes survived), she said ""clean up your mess"". I responded that it wasn't my mess, it was hers, but that since I was a reasonable adult that I would clean it up for her, and not call the cops if she left. That really got her going, as she started screaming that she was not afraid to go to jail, that I should call the cops and see what happens. At this point, her husband, who had remained relatively calm, began to physically drag her away to their car whilst saying, ""you promised not to go crazy... You promised not to lose your mind!"" She was raving the whole way to the car, foaming at the mouth and all. Not a pretty sight.

&#x200B;

We cleaned up the dishes and tried to decompress after. In hindsight, I'm super glad we made her leave the house before talking to her, as she clearly had planned this to happen in our home. I think she probably would have broken our own possessions as well, given the lack of control she had. I was extremely proud of my wife for handling herself so well, and surprised at my own lack of control in the moment. Guess the lesson is that it's really hard to control 8 years of pent up anger, harder than I would've thought. Luckily, I only responded in kind, and never even thought of getting physical or yelling. We haven't heard much else from them, other than one ""damn her"" text from the MiL on the way home (which, honestly, props for using the correct pronouns, I wasn't expecting that). We have been cut out of any wills, family events (thank god, they sucked), or contact, but since we never relied on them for money or anything else, there's no real effect here. Now I won't have to plan and pay for their funerals when they die.

&#x200B;

PS- I have nothing against anyone getting a boob job. If I weren't happy with mine, I'd totally consider it, but for some reason my mouth managed its own response in this situation.

&#x200B;

TLDR: Angry parents ambushed us at our house, screamed and broke things until they were dragged away. They ended up looking like fools, and we're still a happily married couple.

&#x200B;

Edit: My wife filed a police report yesterday, we may pursue a no contact order or something similar, but we have put up a security camera and arranged some pepper spray around the house for quick and easy access. Naturally, if I ever hear from her again, I will update all of you accordingly!"	"Proud of both of you for handling yourselves the way you did. It's very brave to stand your ground especially around parents. So I commend you on your strength. I'm also happy to see your positive takes from this experience. Though I am sad that this is something you two had to deal with. Thank you sis for sharing this. I think it speaks volumes to those that are looking for the courage to be their authentic selves. Hugs and kisses. All the best on your ""wedding day"". My wife are in a similar boat on that front. We married in the courthouse for papers and our love as we couldn't wait, and have our 'wedding' planned for this September. No more taking off my wedding band. It hurts so bad to hide that.
Whoa, that's literally the craziest thing that I've read in a while!

You should think about posting this to r/insaneparents.
Omfg ""at least mine are real"" best response lol
Yeah the MiL needs‚Ä¶ something‚Ä¶ probably a psychiatric hospital stay if I‚Äôm honest. Yikes.

So glad you two are okay! üíô
> ‚Äú*props for using the correct pronouns*‚Äù

I lol‚Äôd

These guys are nuts, hope you and your wife are okay OP.
Honestly fuck your FIL for driving your MIL all the way there with plates to smash and then trying to say ""you promised not to go crazy"" like he didn't know exactly what she was going to do. He just wants someone else to blame when he dies alone in a cut-rate retirement home
As someone about to get top augmentation surgery, I personally gotta say I nearly pissed myself laughing imagining your quick and witty response, don't feel one bit bad about it.
I would have lost my shit when she stormed into the house. 

I used to be incredibly patient. This story only validates why we shouldn‚Äôt tolerate anything. Long before she appeared on your doorstep unannounced she made it clear she doesn‚Äôt respect either of you. 

I would call the police, and at least file a report. It would be nice to have that on record in case it happens again. Tho I would imagine when her local police knock on her door, and explain what she did wrong, it will most likely stop her from doing this ever again. If you don‚Äôt, she will most likely come back and do it again. Maybe even behave worse.
You're calmer and you're wife is calmer than I'd ever be if someone insulted my fianc√©e for being trans. Time for a restraining order! I doubt this is the last time MIL will go bonkers on your doorstep. Expect more. What a nut job. Sounds like my fiancees birth mom! We cut contact with her.
Good for you and your wife!  You are both so lucky to have each other.  

TBH you should probably report her uttering threats to the police anyways.  At the least they will go over to her house and put a little fear into her rage driven brain, and create a paper trail if anyone does ever try physical violence.  Don't underestimate crazy, it's always worse than you think.

My wife and I are in a similar position.  I haven't come out to anyone but my wife, and both our parents are religious.  My dad is fairly progressive but her parents are openly racist, sexist, homophobic, hateful people who only like people who are exactly like them.
[deleted]
Doubt I would have been able to remain calm in a situation like that, super impressive. May you and your wife's relationship only get stronger through this.
Wow. That's incredible, but sadly too believable. The nerve of them to do this on her birthday. Y'all handled it awesomely. I sincerely hope to demonstrate the same strength if ever forced to deal with something similar. Good for the both of you, stay strong and solidarity!
Proud of you and your wife standing up for yourselves

They can suck an ass for the way they treat you but you are valid no matter what :) üè≥Ô∏è‚Äç‚ößÔ∏è
Honestly this is pretty comedic, makes it clear who‚Äôs really the problem. Sorry you‚Äôre having to go through all this though ! Glad you have such a sweet supportive wife üíñ
And transphobes will say trans people are mentally ill


Sheeeeesh üôÑ



In all seriousness I‚Äôm so sorry you had to go through something like that, at least the trash took itself out though.
Proud of your wife and you for not putting up with the MIL's bull, and your initial comeback had me cackling. It's hard to stand up to family sometimes, but it seems like your wife and you are a great support to each other, so I guess it's easier that way.
Stay safe, OP, and congrats on the two of you getting that kind of toxicity out of your life. Much love to you both!
‚ÄúAt least mine are real‚Äù
*GREAT ENEMY FELLED*
About the boob job comment‚Ä¶ I‚Äôm enby and took HRT briefly. A relative told me changing how I looked was not god‚Äôs plan. She had a breast reduction surgery the previous month since it was causing her back pain. And I looked at her and said ‚Äúwell god didn‚Äôt plan for you to have smaller breasts but that didn‚Äôt seem to stop you‚Äù
You get all the hugs OP. Way to stick it out. And a little bit of sass looks good on you girly
I think you handled it nicely. I want to encourage you to stay nice towards them. They can treat you like shit but they can‚Äòt force you to dirty your hands as well.
I'd get a restraining order against them lol.
I kept expecting a ""and that's when [you/your wife] punched the bitch in the mouth,"" turns out you're more composed than me!
She sounds like a  grandiose narcissist, I love the dish she brought to demonstrate what you are doing to her. She says you are doing this to her family but she really means herself and her idea of what a family is. 

You handled yourselves perfectly, that one smart retort about her fake breasts put her back on her heels, she was not expecting that at all.. why ? Because she felt so %100  confident in her moral highgound she was thrown by your calling her on her imperfect world
I hope you both have endless happiness out of spite for such lowly creatures that shouldn‚Äôt even be compared to human.
This makes me so angry. Hopefully you can go no contact.
""At least mine are real""  
GOD THAT'S AMAZING

you go girl, don't feel bad about it, i probably would have said something worse
Ummm‚Ä¶ If I ever become so narcissistic and bigoted that I hop in a car, ambush my daughter and try to destroy her relationship ON HER *FUCKING* BIRTHDAY, please dump me into a pool of lava. The sheer audacity of this woman, good grief.
You promised not to go crazy! You promised not to lose your mind!

ü§£ Poor guy he probably just wanted to stay home and watch some sport ball too
that was really great and satisfying to read.
well done
Whoa. Great job keeping yourself together. I don‚Äôt know how I would react in that sort of situation. Also, nice burn!
You need to get no contact orders of protection against the entire family asap. They will try this again. They will step it up. They are insane, violent, and very dangerous.
Wow that's fucking insane!

Side note: I enjoy the way you wrote everything down. You reminded me of a character in a book , in a good way.
1. Proud of you for responding this way!! As calm as I am generally, if my MiL (or my own mother) acted liked that, I‚Äôd be hysterical.

2. I don‚Äôt think a response to ‚Äúnice boobs‚Äù (I rolled my eyes so hard when I read that) required anything more polite that how you put it. 
Don‚Äôt dish it out if you can‚Äôt take it!
Honestly this was kind of nice to hear for a vent. I mean that experience probably was anything but pleasant and your wife maybe doesn't feel too good about her relationship with her parents, but other than that it sounds pretty positive with you two continuing your loving marriage and them straight up making fools of themselves. 
That boob line may be a bit harsh for anyone not deserving of it and I get the feeling of regretting not being able to hold your tongue but in that situation it kinda was a killer comeback. (And as you said it even took the wind out of her sails for a bit.)

Can only wish you two the best ‚ù§‚úå
So sorry you had to deal with this but it sounds like you both handled it amazingly well. Your MIL is a not a healthy human and, honestly, I just feel bad for her that she can be so corrupted and disconnected from reality. 

I was in a similar situation where my partner's parents were not kind. My recommendation is to support your partner as much as possible and keep communicating. This is likely a very hard time for them. 

I love your boob comment and good on you. With irrationality, sometimes dishing some creative language is the only way to defend yourself and stifle a dangerous situation. 

I'm sending you and your partner all the best, and please be safe!
Funny thing is i had this happen but with my own parents they drove 6 hours to my place while my wife was home and i was at work so when i got home they tried to get me to move back and talk to a pastor lmao
Please take care of yourselves. I can‚Äôt believe people still behave like this. It‚Äôs 2022 ffs üò¢ 

Why can‚Äôt people let other be who they want and live who they want. X
It‚Äôs really nice to see that your spouse continues to support you in the face of their family. That is an incredibly challenging thing for someone to do. Even when their family comprises of psychotic cunts.
As someone who cut their parents out of their lives 7 years ago I would advise your wife to do the same. You can love your parents with all their faults and also have zero relationship with them. It‚Äôs not worth either of your mental health to have to deal with people like that. Just because someone is family doesn‚Äôt give them the right to treat you poorly. It‚Äôs truly liberating once you do it and realize how much stress is reduced in your life. If family truly loved you they would disagree with your choices but at the same time respect them and not act like this. I hope both of you have a great life together.
How did you manage to not burst out laughing when they said not to get married?
That is unfortunately - there is an increase of fascism, racist and cynicism growing in out country - glad you still together and let us hope progressive thinking wins this what I see war
Holy woah. Those are some wild in laws. I‚Äôm so sorry that happened to you - but major kudos to you and your wife for taking it so well!
Also your MIL sounds totally batshit MY GOD üòÖ
It's these kinds of stories that make me terrified to come out, and have no idea how to get HRT and not be homeless. You are amazing to have been able to put up with that crazy bitch, and I hope you never have to experience this again
op that was the best clap back.
While there‚Äôs nothing wrong with the boob job, the comment was certainly well placed. Seems to have shaken up her own confidence a bit, and told her that this wasn‚Äôt going to be a situation where she‚Äôd just be able to say or do anything she wanted. Shifted the power to you. So I think it was a good thing to have said anyway.
This is obviously a horrible thing to deal with but my takeaways from this are all positive. You sound like you are happy in your journey of self discovery and your identity and relationship and you have great support from your wife. That is the most important and is inspiring to read and makes me happy. Second you stood your ground without getting too aggressive or physical. It sounds like the incident could‚Äôve gone way worse and you handled it great. So did your wife. Plus now you have all these pent up feelings getting a bit of release, they saw the real you and you don‚Äôt have to pretend any more. Also you seem to have cut ties with a toxic relationship for your wife and yourself. Just be sure your wife gets whatever support she needs cause it‚Äôs her family, but I‚Äôm confident you are already doing that. I hope you feel all the positives from this and take pride in your strength and your marriage and your future. A lot of times I read stories on here that make me worried or sad for the person and this just made me happy and inspired and optimistic for your future! I wish you and your wife all the best for your lives together though I don‚Äôt even think you really need any help, you seem to be doing great.
Sorry you had to go through this. On the bright side, your wife sounds awesome!
>""at least mine are real""

OP you are my new hero
Maybe I'm so used to managing other people's feelings but if I was in your shoes my first priority would be to make sure my wife is okay.

I am estranged from toxic family that gets explosive like this and it takes years and years to process the trauma. Their transphobia is in no way excusable and I think you did a fantastic job of showing that you won't be pushed around for their stupid ideals. 

Take care of yourself, then take care of your wife. She lost her parents today. Even if she felt like she lost them a long time ago, the day I made my estrangement official changed how I felt quite dramatically, even though I already wasn't talking to them or sharing anything. 

I'm glad you're okay and the MIL stopped when she did. Monsters.
And they call us dramatic üò≠
Is it really loading control when you planned to do it hours in advance?

I mean, it sounds like the FiL believed she wasn't gonna, but she knew she was gonna have a fit when she bought those plates.
Personally not bodyshaming is only for people, and bigots aren‚Äôt people
Love the ""atleast mine are real"" comment, best I've gotten to use is "" atleast mine are fresh and perky, untouched by the hands of dozens""
""Nice boob job"" I just love that special brand of misogyny cis women reserve for trans women.
Your wife is an absolute boss!!  Wow

Also unbelievable catty instincts üî•

The boob zing was sooooo solid
well. congrats on both of you for staying reasonably calm and mature in that situation, im glad neither of you were injured and that you dont rely on them for anything at all.

i hope your wife had a nice enough birthday despite that, and hope that she isnt too emotionally hurt by her family xx
Wooow. You're a hero, OP!
Honestly you should notify the police about this and get some kind of incident report just so you have a paper trail started in case she decides to do something even more unhinged.
Doesn‚Äôt sound like you lost control. Sounded like you honestly and clearly stated your boundaries.
Oh goodness sending hugs and astral projected tacos!  I am sorry you had to go through this
That‚Äôs awesome that you and your wife stick by each other like that. I don‚Äôt think I could have been this calm if someone insulted my fianc√©. We are both mtf, and I know my parents are very conservative, so I have not even told them about our relationship yet. Much love sis.
Yall handled it perfectly! 

I would get done house cameras. We have blink from Amazon after my brother went off the deep end. It‚Äôs reasonably affordable compared to what‚Äôs on the market and motion activated, hooked to WiFi and you use an app on your phone. 

Unfortunately there is no reasoning with these people and your safety (and your wife‚Äôs) is paramount.  It wouldn‚Äôt surprise me if she comes back and does property damage.
Amazing story. Good luck with the rest of your transition
I would also add that the one thing I hate about this which in fact may hurt your wife but does makes your decision easier is that your MIL is putting her moral values and judgments above her daughter, they are more important then her daughter. They never got to know you at all before they found out. And they just bring the hammer down on both of you with no attempt at trying to understand who you are and what you are doing. It's all very impersonal to you and it's all about her.
Good for both of you! You each stood up and didn‚Äôt tolerate what was being thrown your way! Now if I could do the same and stand my ground with my in laws‚Ä¶le sigh. I‚Äôm FtM and yeah‚Ä¶they don‚Äôt approve of it. I met my wife before I started transitioning too, took them awhile to get used to their daughter being with a woman! Anyway!

Proud of you! Keep it up and don‚Äôt take anyones crap! üß°
Holy fuck, that‚Äôs awful of them. Absolute Trash Bags‚Ñ¢Ô∏è, full stop. Kudos to you and your wife, the strength and perseverance you two have is a testament to real love. üè≥Ô∏è‚Äç‚ößÔ∏èüòé
I just wanna say congratulations on standing your ground. Screw that crazy lady.
Oh. My. God.

I absolutely lost it at your father in law saying *""You promised not to go crazy"".*
And this is exactly what I'd be afraid of my parents doing if they ever found out. We certainly can't choose our family, but you'd think our family would choose us over their ignorant bigotry. I'm sorry you had to go through that, but it seems like you and your wife are handling it just fine so far. üíú
Kinda sounds worth getting a restraining order against the people who might be physically dangerous to you. I wouldn't expect police to take action for a ""family member showing up to your house"" unless you can also say they're not allowed to by law. You could diffuse the threat by telling those people that the restraining order is just for your safety, and if they want to bridge the gap, you can talk about it over text.

It is better to be safe than sorry
So sorry you had to deal with that. 

Honestly it sounds like you handled it incredibly well. Props. Not sure I would be able to remain that calm and reasonable.
Wow!!  That woman is a serious nut job.  Credit to you for standing your ground and refusing to be bullied.
I'd look into an order of protection. This doesn't sound like it will de-escalate. Sounds like she's rallying the troops for round 2.
I was literally talking to my therapist about my birth family today, and how I would probably never be able to come out to them, as they attacked and still don't respect my ex, who came out as a trans man at the time. While I know for a fact that I would only be making things bad by telling them, it still hurts a little to think that I can't tell them and have supportive, loving, non-hateful family members to talk with, go shopping with and invite over to see thier new gorgeous (IMO) daughter and maybe help her find her new style.
did i miss the part where you ‚Äúlost control‚Äù? as far as you‚Äôve written you said a single thing to the MIL. you were as cool as a cucumber from what i read!
am so, so sorry you had to go through this nightmare. you are so incredibly resilient in the way you handled the situation, though! hoping for the best for you and your wife! üíú
Congrats on getting married! And honestly your clapbacks were great. ""At least mine are real"" is a banger.

On a scale from 1 to ""hackles raised,"" what's the likelihood of them following through on whatever threats your mil made in her meltdown? They sound like empty threats from a madwoman, but I want to be sure you two are proper safe.
Don't deploy pepper spray indoors, pro tip from a seasoned security guard, just taze them
Uhhhh i read some real threats of physical violence in there. If you're willing, able and can afford it... if it were me... id get a g*n and make a safety plan for who to call and where to go in case shit pops off
First co grats on coming out and I hope you have a good transition. Second atleast mine are real made me fucking laugh so hard
Fuck your parents. I laughed at ""Well at least mine are real"".
I mean your a woman soooo *swing her by the roots of her hair üòà*
I feel like these are the kind of people who actually need ‚Äúconversion therapy‚Äù and by that i really just mean a proper education on why all of those assumptions are baseless and misunderstandings of who trans people are.
Well they seem to be threatening your well being so I would consider making preparations to defend yourself. It almost sounds like she is threatening to like get her family to attack you. If you live in a place where you can get learn firearm safety and your right about defending yourself and get a gun. If you can't get a gun maybe a knife or really anything. Cause they do seem to want you hurt.
Honestly this is why I'm not that into the whole family thing. My brother is an ass and if he shows up at my house I'm calling the cops. 

So disappointing. I'm glad you guys were prepared but I'm still sorry you had to go through that.
Shoulda called the cops
Thank you for sharing, it was educational!
That's awful! I can't understand how some people can be like that. Props to you two for staying strong during it all and let Love win! Also props to your writing skills. This was surprisingly easy to imagine. Ever considered writing as a profession?
I‚Äôm sorry you had to go through that. Also I‚Äôm oddly pleasantly surprised the dad was basically there to manage the mom and didn‚Äôt say much?
Hugs to you both!
Good response, 10/10 meow. Making us proud OP.
Woah sounds like something straight from a horror movie! Sorry you had to deal with that!
I am littrally going through the exact same thing now apart they found out off other people and now I‚Äôm the worlds worst and my gf is making the worst decision of her life blah blah blah
Tbh while my parents are homophobic for the most part  cus some people in my family are gay and I myself is Trans but hiding it. If someone did this to me I'd be the person saying they need to leave or I get the sniper to take the shot. Kinda like a way to avoid being followed
Wow. I'm impressed with how you handled the whole thing. I would have probably lost it. Lots of love and happiness to the both of you
Time to file a restraining order against them.
Just to let you know I'm happy for you both. And don't let people like your wife's mom and dad Get you down.
My goodness what a read! You handled that better than I would of (I only just came to the conclusion I am Trans, lots of things to think about) but your wife is amazing too! She handled that so well. It is never easy when family are not open-minded. My father (if he was still in the picture) would have lashed out badly. I commend you both on how that was addressed and wish you both a happy future together. Your comeback to her was sublime and by all means justified.
>She said that her mind was broken

She was not wrong. But it wasn't broken for the reasons she implied.
Word of advice: call the cops early.

It takes a minute for then to get to you and if things go south it‚Äôs better for them to already be on their way.

Cops would much, MUCH, rather deal with cases where they can intervene early and prevent paperwork from needing to be filed than fallout after-the-fact.

Stay safe
I am so sorry you both went through this. I think if this is really what her parents are like she could consider going no contact. That was straight-up narcissistic rage.
Yup, this is the craziest shit I've heard in a hot minute. Damn, girl. I'm so sorry. I hope y'all are hanging in there üíï
I‚Äôm not sure what country/area you‚Äôre from, but if it‚Äôs the US, please consider getting a gun. 

This woman is clearly planning on hurting you herself or pushing another family to do it for her.

A police order and pepper spray won‚Äôt do much if somebody shows up armed at your home looking to harm you and your wife.
This is more or less my biggest fear about being out to my extended family‚Ä¶ I have a lunatic grandmother who has done things, including, but not limited to: kidnapping the bride at a wedding that she apposed, trying to get my parents to divorce (twice), and screaming at everyone in the household over me saying one swear word (damn) and leaving in a rush. I‚Äôm terrified that she would haul her ass up from the south just to try and stop me from being me.

I‚Äôm glad you made it out of this situation. I hope I don‚Äôt have to go through something similar.
Thank you for the kind words! Idk if this post will help anyone else, but it was nice to at least vent a bit. Moving forward, the best thing is we no longer have to hide who we are from anyone, and no more awful family gatherings! Last one I went to I lost like 5 pounds from anxiety induced nausea, which isn't something I've ever had before. I hope your wedding goes really well, and you get to wear whatever you want walking down the aisle!
Yeah, it probably does belong there, but I feel like this community might be able to relate to it as well. I don't think I've ever had someone hate me as vehemently as this woman does, so that's a new experience! We're locking our doors a lot more these days
Thanks for the award, btw! I don't think I've ever gotten one before, at least not one I know about, so that's pretty cool
Posting this to a non-trans sub will draw in the transphobes like vultures to a fresh carcass.
That is the harshest thing I've heard in a while but kinda deserved ngl.
Yeah, a psychiatrist said it sounds like she has some undiagnosed and untreated mental illness, but it's never good to diagnose second hand. Maybe this will cause her to get the help she needs, but probably not. That's her problem now, though!
I figure it'll be a few weeks/months before my heart rate stops skyrocketing every time there's someone walking past our house, but the relief from not having to deal with them will last forever!
Lol- kinda my thoughts as well, my wife had a point when she said that at least he was largely in control of his conduct and emotions, but I pointed out how low the bar is if being a slightly quieter bigot is all it takes to get praise.
My wife filed a police report yesterday, to basically do what you said and establish a record of her behavior. If something else does happen, hopefully that record will make any future legal actions easier. I don't plan on pursuing anything as long as she never comes back, but I'll still prepare!
My wife filed a report yesterday after we cooled off which was probably a good idea. I hope if/when you do end up having that conversation, they at least don't act violently!

One of my favorite parts of the conversation was when I described how the first time I met them, they were talking about how bs it was that the Confederate flag couldn't be flown above state capitol buildings, and her dad's response was that he didn't recall that event, but ""yeah, obviously we support it, we are conservatives"". I was like, yeah, so maybe you can see why we were hesitant to tell you guys at first?
One juicy bit I forgot to add, but you may appreciate. At one point, she gestured around us (to our house, flowers, plant stand, front yard, pride flag, etc) and asked, ""Does this look like happiness to you?"" My wife and I just laughed and were like, you mean living our lives in peace with friendly neighbors? Yeah, this definitely looks like happiness to us. She goes, ""well, it may look like that now, but give it time. Things can change!"" And I said, yes, HRT has been a lot of changes, and they've all been really positive! I've definitely become way happier, so I hope that change keeps on coming!
You're definitely right, it took some effort to not write a snarky text to her, but it's not worth stooping to her level.
That's the hope! Unfortunately that seems to be largely up to her, and she has nothing to do all day other than stew in her own anger, so idk what to expect. I know they own a gun, so I've got pepper spray strategically located throughout the house. Plus some fire extinguishers in case arson is afoot...
I was thinking this too, like how was mil able to text on the way home? Block block block
Oh, it was tough! Especially once I realized their main goal was to stop the wedding from happening, it just became so clear how impotent their rage was. Like, I couldn't help you if I wanted, it's too late. We already did the big gay
I agree, I am more shaken up by it than I thought I'd be, but it's definitely even more personal and tougher to process for my wife. It took my mom a while to come around, but her reaction was nothing like this, so I can only imagine how it feels when your own blood is saying things like that to you. We are helping each other as best we can, plus therapy, so I think we'll get through it!
I'm kinda wondering if I'll find some fresh paint on our house or cars. I'm pretty handy, so hopefully I can deal with any damage she tries to cause, but we did also set up a camera and we're locking the doors all the time now, and the dogs are on high alert!
Yeah, I've certainly considered it, but honestly idk if I can justify the cost at the moment. I did put pepper spray all over the house, plus our dogs are kinda scary, so I'm hoping that plus home field advantage will play in our favor. Plus she's got bad joints, so I think I've got her beat 100% if we take it to the ground
[deleted]
That was my wife's reaction as well, he definitely had some opinions of his own but managed to keep his cool. If he hadn't been there, I doubt she would have left so soon or so easily, so probably good that he was!
Wow, yeah, that's very intense! Honestly I just don't see where they get the energy to be so damn angry. Not caring is the easiest thing to do! I hope you don't have to deal with her, she sounds like a menace
You‚Äôre probably right tbh. I wouldn‚Äôt venture too far out of trans spaces with trans stories. Because there are a lot of people on Reddit who want to make our lives permanently miserable or worse.
Yeah unfortunately I've already seen that sub in particular side with bigoted parents of trans kids/adults and giving them all the unwarranted uwus of ""ooohh but it's a big change for them give them time,"" so I would definitely stear clear of posting this to other subs. Alas. It does have very r/justnomil vibes too tho lol. 

Anyways, proud of both you and your wife, OP. You did good.
If you don't have security cameras, now might be a good opportunity to install some and a setup to store footage so you can keep an eye on things both remotely and to have a paper trail in case the MIL escalates things or contacts some irrational male relatives to harass y'all.
NP, yinz earned that:)

Stay safe!
Too true! Can‚Äôt help people who don‚Äôt want to be helped.
Maybe some outdoor cameras would be a good measure? Then if they ever show back up again, just immediately call the cops. :( I‚Äôm sorry you‚Äôre in this hypervigilant state because of her craziness. That shit is the worst‚Ä¶
Yeah it really is a low bar. Though if nothing else, at least them each reacting in that way led to the conversation ending before it went further. Your FIL being quiet and perhaps a bit embarrassed probably saved you a lot of headache.

If they both flipped out things could get scary, and if they both tried to be quiet but condemning, you could be dealing with passive aggressive bs for weeks on end before it reached a boiling point.

Wish you guys luck and mad respect to your wife for standing up for herself, her decisions and for you. It's horrible what her parents are doing to her by making this an issue at all and it takes a good backbone to recognize it's them, not her, not you, in the wrong here.

Side note, I'd be super tempted to use the shards of those plates to make some cool artsy thing after painting them with trans colors just to spite your MIL. xP
Sounds like you handled everything the best way possible. Hopefully you‚Äôre done with that bs.

Thats incredibly scary jesus christ. Id suggest buying a gun if you think they are that serious about harming u lile thay

My favourite Reddit quote to ever exist
Did you get to rub that in their faces?!? Oh I wish you had recorded their faces if so!! 

I'm so sorry lovely that this is happening. But you and your wife sound awesome and wonderfully supportive of each other. üíú
I would get a couple more cameras. The proof will help should anything happen.  Please stay safe!
You could install dummy cameras and motion sensor lights, those are cheap and can be enough to make someone think twice. Maybe reinforce the doors with a second deadbolt
Mossberg 500, if I may be so bold as to make a suggestion.

I think it's a possibility, unlikely but plausible. I plan to tell the neighbors as well so they know what to look out for.
How did you make it MORE american
Yup. I‚Äôve seen a lot of users experience that. I knew my my home state and town‚Äôs subs would be a toxic cesspit. So I don‚Äôt even bother. 

Too bad too. I‚Äôm sure I could meet a lot of wonderful queer people on there.

It's also a bad idea to frequent your home town subs on your main account (especially if you're queer) so that bigots can't pinpoint where you live

It is certainly a fucked up world out there"	vnguck	trans	3118	0.96	2022-06-29 14:15:32
My partner went to a transphobic counsellor and got pissed	"I told my partner of nearly 15 years that I‚Äôm trans about two weeks ago and she‚Äôs been incredibly supportive. There have been some understandable fears and feelings to work through, but in the end I‚Äôm very hopeful that our relationship will last through my transition, hopefully grow even stronger. 

She went to a counsellor yesterday to help process everything and it was not a great experience. She was told repeatedly that I was choosing to do this knowing that it would hurt her, that she‚Äôd survive the inevitable breakup, and that if I really cared about her, I‚Äôd abandon my transition. My partner got so pissed off and told the counsellor off and left the session early. I‚Äôm very proud of her and feel genuinely loved. Hopefully we can find her a less transphobic counsellor soon.

UPDATE: My partner reported the counsellor to the service that setup the initial meeting (it‚Äôs a service my employer offers to all of its employees). She told them how transphobic the counselling session was and has already gotten an appointment for another session with someone else. I passed on the recommendation of leaving bad reviews and she‚Äôs gonna think about it. I‚Äôm not fully out yet, so I don‚Äôt know how far we want to go with this at this time."	"Bro, people in authority who use their power to expand their hateful beliefs are the worst people imaginable to me.
I hope she wrote a bad review on some sites, so lgbt people won't end up around that awful counsellor. Also that's a very brave thing to do, I'm glad she's so supportive for you!
Your wife is a treasure <3
Your wife is a keeper. She supports you and doesn‚Äôt need to deal with trash like that. I‚Äôm sure you two are going to be fine and even stronger through this.
I am proud of your partner even just reading about them. Well done them. Counsellors can do immense harm. What a prejudiced fool that one was. 

Please consider registering a formal complaint with the person's professional body. Only details need be pretty much your post here and it's not hard to do. That person should be struck off, or at least educated about GSRD issues before taking someone on. 

Source: I'm a counsellor, counsellor trainer/supervisor and ethicist.
Please name and shame these counselors, and I say this as a mental health professional. Transphobes have no place in mental healthcare and are not welcome.
>I passed on the recommendation of leaving bad reviews

Leave bad reviews, it's the only way people know to avoid dangerous therapists like that.
Report them, they can get their license taken away for that.
Your partner is a gem! 

If you need help finding a better counselor, check with your local LGBTQ+ groups for recommendations. [Psychology Today](https://www.psychologytoday.com/ca/therapists) also has searchable listings.
Look for and find specifically lgbt affirming therapists for both of you separately or together or both. Just going to any old therapist when you're queer can be full of bad experiences. There are therapists who would give you a bad experience regardless of your gender/sexuality, but there are also a lot of therapists who would be good to cishet clients but not others. Searching for queer affirming therapists is essential
Just want to share that I came out to my partner almost 2 years ago and we are better off than before. If your partner is telling off a transphobic counselor, you 2 should definitely be fine!
I had a therapist go on a rant to me about how ‚Äúmy kind‚Äù was taking over the country and there were too many immigrants that‚Äôs why her kids can‚Äôt eat
Reminds me of the therapist who misgendered my partner eight times in a single session, no matter how often I corrected her. When I brought it up at our next (and final) session, she downplayed it and attempted to gaslight me. 

ome people shouldn't be therapists.
Sounds like you two will be just fine. I'm happy for you both.

F that counselor. Even with her difficulties processing, she stood up for you. That's not nothing.  üòä
This is highly unprofessional, unethical and frankly I‚Äôd be reporting that ‚Äúcounsellor‚Äù to whatever oversight board is responsible for governing their behaviour. Absolutely despicable!ü§¨ I‚Äôm glad your partner gave them their marching orders.
Your wife is awesome
I can't imagine.   I'm sorry you all have to deal with people.  I came here trying to find someone I can talk to about this. <Warning: This leads to a video that could be considered anti-trans, is about de-transitioning>  [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U7hxYBDcElc&t=499s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U7hxYBDcElc&t=499s)If she is saying what I'm thinking she is, this is REALLY not helping.  Can someone with experience look and see what she is saying, because it seems like she's saying that she did something she didn't do... You'll see.
Just want to say congratulations on your partner on not letting the counselor brainwash them. And yes leave bad reviews and report them.
A similar thing happened to me, My wife went to a councilor and copped all these what ifs, what if this,  what if that, well fuck the future what ifs.  We both love each other now and our relationship has never been stronger.  What right have they to try and throw ""what if"" spanners into the relation ship and marriage of 22years without knowing the whole story. My wife knowingly proposed and married me a trans woman who put her life on hold for 25 years to have a family. The what if should be what if I did not do that, would we still be together now. I don't think so.
I‚Äôm so happy she is going to stay and support you, my wife and I stayed together as well.  Things my get rough at times as you both try to figure out who ‚Äúyou‚Äù are, but ultimately things should be fine.  My wife and I will be celebrating our 13th year of marriage in June and I have been out to her for almost 2 years.
I'm a psych major. You wouldn't believe the amount of stupid fucking pos people are trying to become therapists and psychologists. The things I hear classmates say makes my eyes want to fall out of my face sometimes.
Hard agree. It's absolutely disgusting to be in a position of power like that and abuse it. IMO it's worse than the sheep that follow it, they're just dumb followers. The ones in power pushing them are the ones to be actively upset at.  
Completely unrelated, but I love how the top comment starts with ""Bro"" and the other day there were several threads about how people use ""dude/bro/my guy/etc."" to anyone regardless of gender and then everyone arguing about it. xD
It's a horrible experience, happened to me with a school concelour, I was forced to come out as trans to my mother because she discovered some of my friends where using a different name with me 

I was still not totally sure what my specific gender identity was (I layer realized I was bigender) and my mother didn't believe me when it tried to explain to her 

So now I can't mention anything trans that she has that look in her eyes and all that
the people who seek for power are not the ones that should be awarded it
It‚Äôs understandable to want to name and shame people, but sometimes that can make the poster feel uncomfortable by exposing their location somewhat. Also then they can be held liable for any harassment the counselor gets (even if it‚Äôs like 3 nasty voicemails, they can turn that on OP)

What would be better is for OP‚Äôs wife to lodge a formal complaint with the organization this counselor works for and leave a bad review on google herself
I second that.
Both of us are seeing people right now. I had my first session and my counsellor was really great. My wife got another appointment set with a different person, one who specializes in LGBTQ issues. We‚Äôre also gonna see a couples counsellor soon too. I don‚Äôt know why people avoid therapy so much, it‚Äôs truly wonderful.
I appreciate that. I‚Äôm hoping so. She‚Äôs a fierce lady who has said many times already that she will not let anybody fuck with me.
You may want to make a post if you want to get answers. Also if it isn‚Äôt too much to add can you include a content warning as some people are really uncomfortable with that kind of stuff for good reason.
very true
You're right, and it's absolutely up to OP. But if they do feel comfortable, it could protect a lot of other people from what is absolutely malpractice that could cause lasting harm to someone's psyche. I absolutely don't think anyone should harass a transphobic counselor. But people SHOULD have the information especially if this therapist is attempting to conceal their transphobic views to get people into session before bombarding and abusing a trans person or their partner with bigotry. These therapists are a real danger to our community and they hide under their professional titles while breaking every rule in their respective codes of ethics.
I understand.  Sorry about that.  I just know there's a lot of bunk around, and this is confusing the viewers, and I am really not equipped with the experience to counter it.  Let me look up how to set a trigger warning.
I agree, but it‚Äôs very unlikely in a sub this big that that information will be seen and used by someone in OP‚Äôs area. It‚Äôs far more likely that people, wanting to support their trans peer, will bombard the organization with bad reviews or emails or phone calls. And while that does work, it still requires OP to put potentially sensitive information out there.

Overall, I just don‚Äôt think naming and shaming will be as helpful in this international sub as it would be naming and shaming with their local queer community
If you just put for example ‚ÄúCW: video about detransition‚Äù or something along those lines before the link it‚Äôd be fine. For a post there should be a flair you can add
Point taken, you're not wrong. I just really hope we find a better way to hold these kinds of therapists accountable, but really it's not going to stop until conversion therapy is outlawed. The next best thing would probably be to report them to their licensing board, but that could also potentially have negative consequences for OP if the therapist decides to get nasty."	12jnre8	trans	1696	0.99	2023-04-12 14:21:37
Spouses transition.	Long story short my mother thinks my spouse should wait until our kids are grown to transition. I honestly don't care when she transitions. I just want her happy and smiling. Advice would be greatly appreciated. Thanks everyone.	"Short answer: No. They should transition when they want to do it. Transitioning or being trans is not some 18+ stuff or harms children.
I don't think you should allow your mother having a say into this. It's your spouse's life and, since your kids are yours, it's a matter that they should only discuss with you.  
Really, your mother should be totally out of this.
All I can add is my own experience.  I waited for my kids to get a bit older before I started transitioning. I hid it away for 10 years.
Basically I did myself (and my family) a lot of damage by doing this.  
I had a lot of internalised anger as a result that would work its way out and I honestly was not a very good parent.
The short time I have been transitioning both of my kids have acknowledged I'm much more chilled and a much nicer person to be around (basically the parent they would have liked 10 years ago).
Plus I have 10+ years of male image to now undo.
So if you feel comfortable with it and are willing to support her, then go for it. And encourage your mother to support her too, this way the kids will get the positivity from all sides and there will be no negative stigma to place doubts in their minds
In the least harsh way possible, she should really butt out.

The conservation needs to be between you and your spouse *alone*, other people's opinions are meaningless here.

As for 'confusing the kids', this is exactly the same fallacious argument people make about kids finding out that someone is lesbian/gay/bisexual. Kids can actually pick up on sexuality and gender stuff *very easily* and for the most part don't care in the slightest - it's only adults that have the problem. Source: I have several nieces and nephews ages 7-12 and none of them care in the slightest that I'm married to a man.
Why is your mother involved? I'm sorry, but this should be between spouses when it comes to upbringing. Your mother isn't a part of your marriage bed and she needs to know that. She isn't making the legal, health, or providing full time around the clock sole financial or otherwise care for your children. You and your spouse are. Even if this is about kids, they typically understand concepts easier than adults if they're quite young. Around teenage age they may have some figuring out to do and possibly may need to talk to someone outside the family, but it still wouldn't confuse or harm a youngster. It's adults typically who backlash due to they have ingrained stereotypes and notions of what anything should be.
Kids are way less stubborn than adults are when it comes comes stuff like this. I doubt they‚Äôd have a complete meltdown over her transitioning
Those kids won‚Äôt be nearly as confused as your mother is, kids are very impressionable and accepting. If they have questions, you seem like you‚Äôre more than capable of answering them. Your mother doesn‚Äôt deserve to revoke your or your spouse‚Äôs right to bodily autonomy
The kids most likely won't care. Kids are much less hard to get the message through than even adults. If they don't want or try to understand, you're their parent. It's your job to make sure they understand and to not be hateful of different people. You're the parent here. These are your kids. Most little kids out there arre able to understand this.
My son started calling me mommy before I even started transition. No problems at all
I cannot think of a possible reason why it would ""confuse"" the kids that doesn't boil down to transphobia, and I would love to hear one. When people argue that things will ""confuse"" kids, they almost always mean ""I am afraid of X and I am uncomfortable about the idea of kids being ok with it."" The only thing that might confuse the kids is why their grandparent is transphobic.

""Teaching kids about gay people will confuse them"" = I am a homophobe 

""Teaching kids about evolution will confuse them"" = I am a creationist.

""Teaching kids about America's history of racism will confuse them."" = I am a racist.

""Teaching kids about other religions will confuse them"" = I am a religious bigot.

""Teaching kids about trans people will confuse them."" = I am a transphobe.
My children are my biggest supporters! They also respect me more for being honest. I suggest you let your spouse decide for herself , she is very lucky to have you by the way. May smiles be abundant in your lives.
my grandma said i should wait till she was dead to transition. fuck that noise, your life works on your own timetable. kids are adaptable. moreso than most people. it might take some work and explaining, but they'll understand.
Hello!   I am 33 and my fianc√© is 38 and is now transitioning to female.  Our youngest is 18 months and 3 years old.  

I think you need to have a serious talk with your kids depending on how old they are. Also have a talk with spouse and ask for a timeline ish what they want and what there plans are 

Right now my fianc√© is starting HRT and then will be wanting surgery in 2-3 years depending.  

In everything aside how will this effect your kids.  Guess what it doesn‚Äôt negatively effect them.  They will grow up to more understanding and compassionate for other people no matter who they are.  

Just think of what life would look like to them.  Would you rather have a miserable person just making it through life because your not ready.  No!  Be happy and everyone else will also be happy too 

Your mother doesn‚Äôt have to go through this directly rather indirectly through you.  So truly she will not know how it feels to be in the trenches and what needs to happen.  

My fianc√©‚Äôs dysphoria is so bad a lot of days are suicidal until HRT starts.  I think you just need to look at a kids point of view and a lot of kids don‚Äôt care in all reality.  

One thing you do have to talk to them about is who is safe to tell.  Not everyone is understanding and still have to be careful.   Good luck!
Your mother is wrong. My daughter was the fastest to accept me, the most accepting of me, and truly, if anything, prefers me as her mother. Believe it or not two happy moms is much better for a family than a miserable dad. She just has a hetero cis normative view of what a family should look like.
Your mother sounds like a real piece of work. Advice: tell her to mind her own business and stfu.
My 3 year old nephew doesn't seem to care that I am auntie. My 9 year old niece doesn't seem to mind. I'd actually argue it would be harder for them to understand when they are older than when they are young.
Tell your mother to keep this to herself.  

Their mom's transition will not hurt your kids, but their grandmother trashing their mom behind her back will.
Kids love you unconditionally, transitioning isn't gunna change that. Yeah they'll ask more questions but that's what kids do. Transitioning is literally mental health care. Your mother is either being discriminatory or has been misinformed by dangerous sources.
I think it would be so much better for your children to have a happy mother who‚Äôs transitioned than an unhappy parent who‚Äôs constantly hiding a part of themselves. Kids aren‚Äôt stupid, they know when things aren‚Äôt quite right. Being trans isn‚Äôt some super secret NSFW 18+ only thing, there are plenty of trans kids themselves and having a parent who is openly and comfortably themselves, whatever stripe of the LGBT rainbow that might be, can only be a good thing. 

I‚Äôm sure your mother meant well but it just shows she doesn‚Äôt understand about trans issues properly - maybe this is a good way to try and introduce her to it more and help her learn? At least if she‚Äôs open to that.
Hi, Cis Het dude‚Äôs opinion, feel free to ignore it (since we get the floor more than we deserve). I think your mum should mind her own business. If your partner is ready to transition, it‚Äôs your partners decision. 

I guarantee the thing that will be best for your kids is having two happy, self actualized and realized parents. 

Tell your partner I (for one) support her decision.
suppressing who you are to make others comfortable is a horrible standard to set for a child

not that it's bad to debate it, if anything it's a very selfless and noble thing to consider and your partner is very kind. but would you rather teach your kid to hide themselves and judge others, or to be themselves and accept people that turn out a little different?

(also your mom needs to realize it's not a fetish, it's not going to disturb or confuse the kiddos if you just explain a little)
I started transitioning when my kids were 5 and 1 and they have been fine. Kids really don't care as long they are loved, they aren't confused, they aren't disappointed and they aren't transphobic. Your mother sounds like she is though.
Don't listen to her, for a start it's got Jack to do with her, but also she is 100% wrong.
Yeah that‚Äôs a bad idea. Transition now. Kids will be happier with happier parents.
Tell your mother that it's not up to her. She doesn't know what it's like. Your spouse should transition when they're ready to. No sooner or later.
As a kid of a trans person no it won't confuse the kids (what might confuse them is the fact that certain people hate trans people just for being trans or might call their mom a man with the purpose of trying to hurt her feelings), just explain that their mom was born in the wrong body so she is taking medicine to make it better, depending on how old the kids are. My mom transitioned when I was about 7 and because of that I was introduced to an amazing community, if she hadent been such a bad person I probably would have figured out that I am trans sooner. 

I think explaining it to a kid at a younger age will make them feel safer in their house if they turn out to be lgbtq as well, and even if they aren't lgbtq it still gives them a definite safe space to explore who they are as people as they get older. 

Besides how your kids will react to it, it's also not your moms choice, it's your wife's decision.
Children will generally roll with it if you just communicate with them and don't treat them like they're stupid (not insinuating anything of course, but as a parent you problably know the little buggers are like bloodhounds in that regard)
Waiting will only make it more painful for her.

 Why drag it out? In fact, It'd problavly be easier for the children to grow up with their mother that way instead  of knowing about it because all that time and problaby supporting the mother the whole ride while she's not doing anything so she doesn't compromise their upbringing?

Utter poppycock if you ask me  let her be her and let the children have the parent be who she wants and needs to be.
Your mother can go pound sand. It's not her call to make, and she's being ignorant.

It's best for your kids if they have two parents who love them and are generally happy with their own lives and being true to themselves. Kids can understand a transition if it's explained to them in an age-appropriate manner, and it's great if they learn young what ""transgender"" is and that it's not something to hate or fear.

Being true to oneself, in particular, is something it's HUGELY beneficial to model for one's kids.

(my sister and I met our trans aunt and were told that she's trans at about 13 and 8, respectively. We didn't get scarred for life by the experience, or confused beyond what a little Q&A could resolve.)
If the parents are scared they should at least let her start hormone blockers. That way she won‚Äôt be exposed to too much testosterone when she doesn‚Äôt deserve to, and later change her mind if she grows out of it. (Assuming she‚Äôs amab)
Your spouse should transition whenever she's comfortable! And if anything, it will be harder for your kids to accept when they are grown compared to now because they'll have known your spouse as one way for much longer.
Our kids were 3 and 5 when I started to transition.  There was no confusion whatsoever.  In fact, I think the younger the kids are, the less ‚Äúconfused‚Äù they‚Äôre likely to be. Just be sure to devote extra time to connect with them when you explain the transition (i.e., devote a whole weekend to getting close to them) so they can really feel that they‚Äôll always be loved and that will never change.
I think your mother should not have an opinion on your partner‚Äôs transition
Thank you everyone. I knew in my heart that she is being homophobic and hatred. ""If you are so accepting of everyone you need to accept the trumpeters"" I laughed and said no I don't but if you keep your mouth shut I will never know you are a bigot. My mother doesn't keep her mouth shut for anything. She will voice her opinion. makes me wonder if my grandparents are rolling over in their graves.
I came out to my kids recently and regret waiting so long. They were really cool about it. My daughter(15) smiled and said 'Oh ok, what are your pronouns.' 

So much time wasted feeling shitty, being angry or telling them off more than was necessary. 

My kids are happier and we have a better relationship now.
Where is the logic in specifically setting a false impression of yourself for your kids entire lives just to transition when they are grown? Not a knock on people who aren't ready until later in life, but if you are ready to transition, and you are going to do it regardless, why should you arbitrarily wait until your kids have grown up? It's the things you hide from kids when they are young that they will be ill equipped to handle later. It's people who grow up with trans identities being stigmatized that grow up to be transphobic, kids who grow up knowing openly trans people never have an issue.
your spouse should be there true self for both themselves and the kids
Transition when your spouse wants to transition. This has nothing to do with children. This has everything to do with her happiness. There is no argument here. I don‚Äôt want to disrespect your mother but that way of thinking is very harmful. It is harmful because it displays a judgemental way of perceiving others. The children should learn to accept people as their true selves, not what society deems fit for acceptance. It‚Äôs also harmful for your spouse if your mom is showing that she is not supportive of the transition as your spouse may feel that they are then forced to live as someone they are not. I believe it to be a very confusing time and one that should be supported with love.
Faster the easier for your kid
I transitioned when my neice and nephew AND my husband's kids were young, maybe 3-5 years old. My sister-in-law had the same concern about them being confused. They told my niece and nephew as soon as I started transitioning - it took a few weeks but they eventually got it and all was fine. We didn't tell my husband's kids until this year (they're 12 and 14) and they didn't care at all. 

Long story short, kids don't care. It's all about the adults' perceptions and assumptions. Do what makes you and your family happy and your kids will learn that they should do whatever makes them happy. <3
My kids are 8 and 12, and they were the most supportive out of pretty much anyone other than my partner.  My 8 year old just said thats ok, i just want you to be happy and have your inside match your outside.

I have some words for your mom...
Who cares what your mother thinks? Is she paying your bills?
Short answer: I would tell your mother, as politely as I could, to back off and leave it up to your spouse. That is your spouse‚Äôs decision, not hers.

Long answer: I have a trans woman friend who is  in a nasty, terrible situation where her mother manipulated and told false information to her ex. I won‚Äôt go into much detail but I start seeing red when I see this stuff because she‚Äôs the sweetest woman and she‚Äôs hurting because of what a parent did to her.

It is not your mother‚Äôs place to even speculate on or share her opinions. It is your spouse‚Äôs. 

I‚Äôm glad you‚Äôre supportive of her, it seems. Keep sharing that with her. My personal advice: The best thing you can do to help, as a cis person, is tell people when they are out of line and need to stop so that she doesn‚Äôt have to. It can be exhausting.
Dude, kids are kids, they won‚Äôt care if your partner transitions. Hell, I‚Äôd say it would be easier for them if you did it while they‚Äôre younger, so the kids grow up and when their memories are more solid, all they‚Äôll remember for sure is their mum, it‚Äôd make it easier for them to digest. I wouldn‚Äôt sweat it.
Fuck your mom.
This is something you and your partner needs to decide and proceed on your own. 
You sound so supportive and your children will be as well. Much like you, I'm sure seeing their parehappy is far more important. 
You should also visit r/mypartneristrans you will get more support thereüíñ
They should transition when they want. The earlier they start the easier time they will have.
I'd say she should transition when she wants to, will probably make her much more happy and it's not like transitions are some kind of adult secrete.
She should transition when she wants to plus doing it earlier than them turning 18 kinda makes explaining it to your kids a bit more easier because they're not little assholes who've been completely tainted by outside hatred
Okay. I see red when I read about Mom‚Äôs being dicks  to their own children who need to transition. 

This‚Ä¶‚Äùquality person‚Äù thinks she gets to tell a grown ass adult she doesn‚Äôt share blood with what they can do with their own body?  It‚Äôs none of your mom‚Äôs fucking business!

You support and love your partner with their transition üëäüéâ
kids are incredibly understanding and will be much happier if both parents are happy, dysphoria could have heavy mental impacts on your spouse which may in turn effect your kids, she should transition in her own time not when others think it‚Äôs right
Your mom has no say in this because it's not her life.Just stick by your spouse and support her through her transtion(that may even mean cutting people out who don't support her.).I read one of your comments saying your mother thinks it'll ""confuse the kids"" but I promise it doesn't.It's a different situation but when I came out, I came out to 4 kids who knew me as female before.Their ages were 2,4,4,6 and 5 years later none of them are confused.Kids are kids and all they want is the people they love to be happy.Just tell them it makes their parent happy and they'll understand.Good luck to you and your spouse on this new part of your lives!
Short story short, your mom can fuck off. It's none of her business. Your partner should transition when they feel ready. How your mom feels is firstly, irrelevant, secondly, fucking transphobic toxic garbage.
See, short story kept short.

ETA: My partner is a trans woman and our son has never been confused. Not once. He is now almost 17.
Hi. My husband stated his transition about 2 years ago, and our kiddos are now 16 and 13. The kids didn't take long to adjust. Take the time to have frank, but age appropriate,  conversations with them. Let them ask questions and it's okay not to have all the answers. Having unanswered questions will lead to more conversations later. As for the parents request; you do what's best for you, your partner and your children. Love wins.
Your mom needs to stfu and educate herself. Sorry not sorry.
kids are really more flexible than you think, waiting to transition till their older will probably cause more trouble as it will cause them to feel guilty/make them think transition is shameful/unfit for children so my advice is to transition while they‚Äôre younger and use it as a teaching moment of self acceptance and the trans community, heck you might help your kids if one of them is lgbt themselves :), I just realised that it‚Äôs your mom that‚Äôs worried- short answer, that‚Äôs really fcking messed up your mom needs to grow up and stop being lowkey transphobic
Tell your mother thanks but no thanks for her opinion.
The parent's mental health is important since it affects the kids too, better just transition, it's not hard to explain to a kid and the kid grows up more accepting and more decent person, if the parent is caught up fighting with their own mental health like dysphoria or depression the kids might start feeling like they should take care of themselves as the parent is emotionally unavailable and that is the real thing that fucks up kids' mental health. Your spouse should transition when she wants to.
Your mom should but out; it‚Äôs not her life
She has the right to transition whenever she wants.
Leaving it will make it worse. Kids are young and move on fast, transitioning now will mean they spend more of their lives knowing your spouse as their real gender. It's less confusing, and really this is  just your spouse's mother's anxiety about her child transitioning. To be real blunt, not transitioning affects so much of a person's life and sense of self and ability to be happy ( a lot of the time) that that's a real stupid reason for someone to tell someone else not to transition
Waiting just amounts to more time in pain. That‚Äôs a super transphobic thing to say‚Ä¶ how would she feel if someone said to just wait for cancer treatment until (enter arbitrary point in time here)?? Unacceptable üòí
Kids seem to deal with it way better than adults. I've seen many a story of adults being pricks to trans people, but much much fewer about kids.
Fuck what your mom thinks
I started when my kids were 3 and 6 and they didn't have an issue understanding and it helped my oldest to connect with me more. Especially after I told her we will have the same middle name.
A happy parent is a good parent :)
Also it's rlly none of her business when or if your spouse transitions
My own mother has said this to me on a couple of occasions. 
""But your boys are going to get bullied and made fun of at school,  just wait until they are 18.""

And I'll be almost 60 ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è If I could hold out that long.
What does your partner want? What will make her feel supported and therefore allow her to be more present, attentive, and loving with the kids?
Like I get it's your mom but she is being transphobic by saying something like that, I'd be furious if I were you. The ""it'll confuse the kids"" argument is one the most bullshit arguments I've ever heard - kids are pure, they can accept and handle things like that better than most cishet adults unfortunately
Would your spouse being miserable, possibly suicidal and full of self hate make a good partner and help make a good environment to raise children? I don‚Äôt personally think so. 

Your spouse being happy will lead to a better home environment for everyone
Transitioning makes people happy. Happy people raise better kids. 
Why wait? 

Over simplification but still
She should transition as soon as she feels ready! Transitioning is not something inappropriate for children and I think it would be good for your kids to be exposed to positive queer role models. It will help them understand how to be compassionate to any queer or gender non conforming people they meet and boost their confidence if they end up being trans themselves. Good luck, and congrats to your partner on coming out and starting her journey of transitioning!
My 3 year old understands and supports my transition- she still calls me ‚Äúdaddy‚Äù because I‚Äôm her bio-dad and that‚Äôs fine with me- she‚Äôs my kid she can call me king fuzzymitts for all I care! Point being your mom has no clue what she‚Äôs on about and is likely projecting her own concerns onto your children. There are plenty of resources such as children‚Äôs books addressing the topic and if my 3 year old can get it I‚Äôm sure your kids will with some time! üíú
In my first-hand experience, kids are totally fine with it. It‚Äôs the older people that can sometimes have a harder time.
Teaching kids that queer folks need to hide themselves ""for the good of others"" is about the worst possible thing you can teach a kid. This is doubly true if any of your kids are LGBT themselves.
Oh, god, no, she shouldn't. The sheer pain and humiliation of waiting for years to transition? I can't imagine living like that. She should transition whenever she feels ready, and not a moment before or after.

Good on you for your support, though! Your response is absolutely correct -- you just want to see her happy.
I think your spouse should get a say, but your mother shouldn't ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
Your mother's advice is irrelevant to the timing of your spouse's transition. It sounds like it is based upon a judgment that it will harm your children. Whatever hardship they may face, it will not be lessened if they are adults -- it will just be different -- and maybe worse! I am a transwoman transitioning with two children in the house who are 7 and 10. My wife and I are staying together. I choose to see my transition as a possible benefit for my kids. They get to see their parent express incredible courage; they get to grow up knowing that they will be loved no matter what -- regardless of any identity uniqueness that comes up or error they may make. And they're going to make amazing allies for their friends in school. I think having a trans parent is an asset.
If you two aren't planning to conceive more children, the sooner your spouse transitions, the healthier she will be. Your kids will understand, but your mom may have to catch up. Hang in there <3
""my mother thinks\[...\]"" well I think that's none of her damn business, no offense to you via insulting your family
It kinda sounds like you already have it figured out. Let your spouse do what they need to in order to be happy. 
Your family can be full of a bunch of different kinds of people but as long as you're all happy that's all that matters.
F*ck what your mum says, trans people are not confusing to kids and not something to hide away from them either. Tell her to ignore your mother.
I'm such a better parent because I transitioned as my kid grew up. It showed them that they can talk about their identity and pursue their happiness.
My kids are 5 and 8 and they are totally cool with it.  It‚Äôs the adults you have to worry about.
Hmm. Don‚Äôt wait for your kids. Do it for yourself to be a better you for your kids. Do it for your kids.

Hope this makes sense.
Lol, my mom told me that same thing about my transition.
Ima keep it short an blunt

If she doesn‚Äôt transition it can lead to health problems as well as mental problems that will worsen
Children are remarkable for their ability to adapt. Having a child grow up around someone transitioning will teach them empathy for others and the critical thinking needed to put themselves in someone else's shoes when speaking to them. This will make them better, more caring, more loving, and happier adults that impact their communities in positive ways.


This does not mean there will not be challenges. All change comes with challenges. That is what family is for. To help each other overcome those challenges and grow because of them. 


Telling your spouse to wait is just a tactic to save face. Tell me, would you rather have your children grow up with a spouse full of self hate and doubt? Or one with love and confidence in themselves. Both those options will impart lessons on your children.
I'll just add to what so many have already shared at this point, but holding off on transitioning isn't good for anybody. I started in my 30s with two sons, and not only were they obviously fine, but my own personal growth over the last several years has made me such a better person, parent and partner for my wife.

There's always some request to just ""wait until"" something, we had these discussions as well. My wife originally thought it best to wait until the kids were older, my parents wanted me to wait until grandma died. I'm so, so glad that I moved ahead, for everyone's sake.
Why does your mother think she gets a say?
Kind of a novel, sorry! 

My heart really goes out to you: realizing I was trans was such a terrifying/mind bending revelation for me and the anxiety of it all haunted me for months before I even began to process it. 

It didn't seem to hit my family as hard, as everyone I came out to was supportive, but I imagine, especially with a spouse, it can be a lot to take in. If your spouse is asking you when you think they should transition, take their question to heart. 

Think about it, think about why you personally would want to go forward with it or why you would wait. They're lucky to have a spouse who is supportive and willing to learn, and neither you nor them need all the answers now. There's no rush. There's no urgency. You're on each other's team, and you'll figure it out together.

 Personally, once that shelf broke for me, it was very hard to pretend things were normal. It took a lot of bravery and leaps of faith. I'm a cautious person by nature, but you kind of have to start taking steps right away or the sudden agony of realizing, of letting it out into the world, can start to eat you alive. There are trans helplines that can give you resources like the Trevor project. 

As far as *when* your spouse should transition, as far as how it will affect your kids, I know that my niece, who is loving and beautiful (but very young) stuggled with understanding how a boy could become a girl. My sister and her husband are allies and they work on it with her, but she's a kid and I just have to extend her grace and love because she's already internalized a lot of society's messaging about gender. 

Unfortunately, the strain it may put on your family does need to be a consideration, but with the right mindset and love, it doesn't have to be a world ending event. You're the parent, your spouse is the parent, and you'll make the best decision you can for your kids and your family. 

At the end of the day, I'm not in your position, so I don't know for sure, and as a trans woman, it's not easy to guess who will be supportive and understanding off the bat, who will need time to come around, and who will flat out refuse to be supportive. Kids are resilient and they can take big changes gracefully if they feel loved and supported, but you know your family's needs better than anyone else.

My only advice is to keep your needs in mind too, and make a decision from the place where you want things to happen. It's kind of selfish, but being honest with yourself in the short term, even if it's uncomfortable or politically incorrect, will make the long term play out easier.

I hope this helps and I'm sorry you're facing down such a monumentally scary event, but I'm happy your spouse has figured this out. I personally know what a weight it is off your shoulders to finally understand yourself like that, to finally feel light, to feel excited to move forward into a life, body, and role that feels natural to be in. Focusing on on that joy and relief helps keep things in perspective when you have to make these hard decisions.

Thanks for reading!
I agree that to start transition now and guid the children threw it make it a positive thing for the whole family
This is a fun topic for Trans Parent Day.
I started transitioning a couple years before having a kid (we froze the little buggers). We now have a 3 month old and he loves his two moms. We have met a ton of other queer couples in our neighborhood and a even a couple that had a kid a few weeks after we did. It has been a wonderful journey and has made me happy in a way I have never been. I never wanted my kids to meet the depressed version of me. I existed in the VOID and I would have never been able to feel like I can know. Good luck to you on your journey:)
I started transitioning publicly when my son was 5 and he didn‚Äôt get affected by it and thinks it‚Äôs amazing that he has two moms now.
However, do explain it to your kids.
They will be suprised.
Children are actually really accepting and surprisingly understanding. The haven't had time to fully develop stigmas. 
I lived with my niece at the start of my transition (she was 9 at the time) and my psychologist said try to include her in my transition, make up together and painting nails and ask on. Helped a lot.
Not so sure the advice or comparison  is directly relatable but the general notion that kids will be fine with it is the same ^^
Happy parent, happy kids.
A spouse transitioning isn't a traumatic event for kids. There aren't any massive changes to their lives involved. It's not a divorce. If anything, kids being a part of it will grow up to be more open and tolerant. I'd even argue that it's easier on them when they're younger.
As a gay male if my spouse wanted to transition to female it would be bye bye‚Ä¶you‚Äôre no longer what I want and quite literally negate what it means for me to be gay..it‚Äôs the same if a women transitioned to a man‚Ä¶I don‚Äôt see them as a gay man‚Ä¶it‚Äôs not hate‚Ä¶.it‚Äôs simple what it means to be gay
Not your mothers circus, not your mothers monkeys.
Being trans isn't something that's inherently inappropriate for kids. It's actually probably going to help the kids out, long run. Having exposure to change and diversity young is really important.

I hope your wife is happy and that your kids grow up to be wonderful people, OP.
I agree yasuho
I got told by my family to wait ti 18 to make that decision, which i think is fair, om 17, he told me that on april when i asked if i could get therapy regarding that topic, he also said ""i dont think youre trans"" and ""i think its a phase"" both in the same day i told em i was possibly trans. Its november and i still dont have a therapist.
She says she is looking out for the kids mental state. Because it will confuse them.
OMG yes.  The kids already know more than anyone thinks.
Pretty much the same for me. For the first 4 years of my child's life I was pretty terrible as a partner and parent. My wife has noticed a 180 since admitting it to myself and others and an even bigger positive switch since starting HRT 2 months ago.
Right! My daughter came out last year and my mother's respond was ""it's like losing a loved one I need time to process this"" and I'm like WTF this is your granddaughter. How about support her and love her like you claim.
She is always into everything. She thinks she is looking out for the kids.
Wow, that's a new one for me. Pretty toxic.
She is always like this and it's like it's our lives let us live it.
She feels she is looking out for the kids. Spoke with her yesterday and again we got into it.
Fr I woulda loved to have parents that understood how this stuff worked instead of the half hearted ‚Äúoh I was bisexual in college so I won‚Äôt disown you but I think being trans is weird‚Äù response I ended up getting from my mother and the complete lack of reaction from my father
>Having exposure to change and diversity young is really important.

So much this. It took me so damn long to figure out that I wasn't a man in part because I was never exposed to the idea that that was a possibility. I was, however, deeply exposed to the idea that being queer is wrong undesirable, among other hateful ideas and bigotry. 

I wish so much that I could've just had any sort of diversity around me instead of the homogenous straight, white evangelical Christians filling my head with insidious lies. Who knows, maybe I would've been able to start puberty blockers or something.
I also agree
I mean I‚Äôve had more troubles explaining it to adults than kids. And a lot of kids are just like ‚Äúcool‚Äù and might have some questions but Like explaining their transition isn‚Äôt gonna like break your kids yk
Confusing how? They are likely to be a lot more accepting if they grow up with this than if they grow and then have it thrust upon them as adults.
It hasn't confused my 4.5 year old at all. We got some kids books that explain gender identity and they pretty much switched to calling me mommy immediately.

They now say they are non-binary which has confused grandparents... but meh.
This just means it confuses your mother
Kids are confused by everything. I can guarantee your kid will be more confused by algebra if you sit there explaining it for 4 hours than if you sit there for 30 explaining your partners transition and why its important. Children have spongy brains meant to absorb and learn. Waiting will be more harmful to them and your spouse. The sooner you tell them, the more mailable their brain is, the better they‚Äôll understand and accept.
your mother is the one who‚Äôs confused, with all due respect. kids are information sponges, and getting to see someone transition in the safety of their own home normalizes that it is okay to be trans in any stage of life. your mothers mental state is the opposite. 

also, your mother (and everybody besides your SO, really) has absolutely zero say in how/when someone transitions. that‚Äôs up to the person transitioning.
That's actually a kind of homophobic statement used as for shielding oneself. It's understandable that given her age she's wary and not really open to accept that, but she should get 2 things:  


A) It's your spouse's and your life, not hers. Not of her business. Including your kids. So she should stay on her own things.  


B) As u/Gnome69420 said, kids get it easier than adults. It's just about one person deciding to be what they want and choosing to be happy. You only have to explain to them that sometimes you are born with a body and you simply don't feel like living under the gender identity you were assigned. It's up to you to build your identity, and this means you can dress as anything you want, feel like anything you want, and you can even change or not your body, depending on how you feel.  
Like... If people go through plastic surgeries in order to change how they look and feel ok with their bodies, why would it be wrong to change anything else?
Nah your mother is just buyung into some of the stories people make up to discredit trans people. It'll probably be less confusing if she transitions while they're young since they won't have their whole life time thinking your spouse is their agab
It confuses her. She's projecting. That's not to say she's a terrible person and you should never talk to her again, but yeah even if the spouse involved was her wife it still wouldn't be appropriate for her to decide when or how. She's still in director mode because she's used to having that kind of control in her children's lives. She needs to be reminded this isn't her decision gently but firmly and the only thing she needs to figure out is how *she's* going to react. The rest of it is in your and your spouse's very capable hands.

Edited to add- I'm the mom of a handsome (trans) boy- it took me a minute too even when I was completely okay with the idea academically. As soon as I figured out it was about my fear (for his safety, not punishment or what their neighbors might say- fuck them) and not his fear, things got a lot smoother. I have a soft spot for moms that are trying and I hope she figures her emotions out so she can help support all of you.
That‚Äôs literally ignorant hate speech.
She is projecting her own confusion onto your kids for sure! Kids are way smarter than people give them credit for, also way more open and accepting if we allow them to be.
A lot of things confuse children, that's how being new to the world goes for a while. Let them ask questions, give them honest answers, and it won't take too long for the confusion to be resolved. It's not harmful to children for them to experience confusion, ask questions, and get answers.
kids are incredibly adept at handling things like this. whats important is that you explain it properly and dont shy away from answering any questions they might have. whether your spouse transitions now, or in 5 years, or in 10 years, youre gonna have to answer the same questions.
As a aunt who started transitioning while her niece was like three, it has not effected her mental state at all
In my experience people who say this kind of stuff typically use ‚Äúconfuse‚Äù to mean ‚Äúmake less bigoted‚Äù
Everything confuses children, no offence but they know literally nothing until it‚Äôs explained to them or they see it happen if you explain it clearly and in a way that makes sense to them then they‚Äôll go along with it, children‚Äôs brains are basically information sponges the sooner you teach them about this stuff the better cause they‚Äôll learn and be more open to new stuff later in life
I wanna say I transition and all my little brothers and sisters and nieces and nephews weren't confused they're ages are 8,9, and 3. The whole family explained it and they learned and carried on,Like nothing ever had happened.
I am a trans feminine (mtf) parent to 2 kids, ages 7+9. I came.out to them at 4+6 and heard the same thing from my wife's family.


Being myself made us all happier, brought us closer, and taught them a great deal of empathy and understanding. It has been nothing but positive and hasn't been inappropriate, confusing, or negative in any way. Anyone suggesting it is inappropriate or not good for the mental health of children is instantly sexualizing this and transition is not a sexual thing except in the strictest sense. Happy to expand on that if it's not clear. ‚ù§Ô∏è
Your mom seems to be the only one who is confused in this situation
Kids adapt. What‚Äôs gonna confuse them is why your mother is saying terrible things about someone who is clearlier happier and more comfortable, and that‚Äôs the issue here
Kids adapt. My 5 and 6 yr old grandkids were discussing me this summer. One said ‚ÄúPapa is a girl.‚Äù The other said ‚ÄúNo he‚Äôs not, he‚Äôs a boy but he is becoming a girl!‚Äù They love me regardless.
> Because it will confuse them

Most things confuse kids, and they turn out just fine. Nothing about them being confused is going to hurt their mental state...
I worked with young children as I transitioned. They were as a rule FAR more receptive than adults. Nobody was confused, not ever.
Does your mother watch FOX news, by any chance?
nothing that hasn‚Äôt already been said but only adults cling to held ideas and beliefs in a way that would make transition confusing.

when we explained it to my 4yo, he had a couple questions. after we answered them he was like ‚Äúokay!‚Äù and carried on doing whatever he was doing. since then, other than slipping up occasionally, refers to me as his mom without skipping a beat. 

kids are already absorbing and accepting new knowledge every day, if they‚Äôre confused about something they WILL ask questions (because that‚Äôs what kids do).
Assuming your spouse is AFAB

""Mommy doesn't feel like a girl anymore and wants to be a daddy instead.""

honestly, kids are super understanding and if you tell them to call you daddy instead of mommy they mostly will. Again, I don't know what your spouse was born as, I'm mainly just projecting there.
my sister transitioned when my little brother was 5. all we had to do was explain what being trans was and he got it. kids don't tend to care that much, and honestly take it better than most adults do. your mother is wrong
it's really not that confusing
There should be a book or website or something? Scarleteen.com has trans resources. 

Kids are fine. They accept as normal whatever you present as normal. They want your partner to be happy..

Your mother has a problem and she's using the kids to manipulate you and your partner. You're an adult, time to stop living under your mother's thumb and stop making other people cower under her. Least of all your spouse who has been going through this journey her whole life. She IS a woman and always has been. This is just torture.
Adults are way more confused than kids. It will be great for the kids to see your spouse happy and free. ‚ù§Ô∏è
Being a kid *is* being confused.  Attempting to mitigate that by simplifying life into absolutes does them no favors long term.  Most people are cis; some people aren't.  This fact is a microcosm of life in general.  Teaching a kid to fit into the normal at any cost - which is the only real lesson that might be taught - means when they invariably discover the set of things about themselves that place them in the minority on that issue, they will be inclined to deny their own truth.  That's a road that only leads to self harm.

When the default state is confusion and the default response is seeking information, the *truth* is just as easy to swallow as a convenient lie.  It is only the adult - the *teacher* - who might struggle.  And when they struggle, it will be because they once accepted a convenient distillation of messy life into absolutes.

And when all is said and done, if the goal long term harm reduction, what kind of damage do you think will happen when they're adults and you have a conversation that goes ""I've known for a very long time that I needed to do this but I didn't for your sake?""  It's too easy to find the addendum ""because I didn't trust that you could handle it"" in between the lines.
This is a topical transphobic excuse. Teaching your children that trans people exist and what it is in a controlled environment and seeing what it‚Äôs like in a real life setting will make them more understanding, accepting, and knowledgeable about it.

The ‚Äúwait until they are 18‚Äù line is an excuse. People who say that will always find a new reason that a trans person shouldn‚Äôt transition. She doesn‚Äôt actually think this for the sake of your kids. She just doesn‚Äôt want to confront something that makes her uncomfortable.
No. She's projecting. SHE'S confused. Boomers don't understand dick about basic psychology and they piss me off to no end. 

With a massive amount of love: STOP TREATING HER LIKE SHE GETS A SAY. She has 2 options: get ENTHUSIASTICALLY ON BOARD or FUCK OFF UNTIL SHE CAN. Christ knows she could probably use a shrink anyway so tell her in no uncertain terms that SHE'S the busted one here and needs to learn how to properly support family. 

Goddamn old people and their busybody bullshit, man...
Why do you still allow this woman around your family when she is so clearly trans-homophobic? Cut her ass out. Tell her that she can get therapy to deal with her trans and homophobia or she never sees your family again. Stop letting her do this shit to your family.
That's when you find out that their life is more about their comfort than their families well-being. It's an ugly thing, and I truly hope she figures it out. I had to cut off an entire branch of my family tree because protecting my son's mental well-being is far more important than their sense of propriety.
So shes homophobic and says she no longer views your daughter as her loved one and you are taking her views on your wifes transition seriously?
Your mother us wrong. And frankly it sounds like she is one who needs to be kept away from your kids.
No your mom doesn‚Äôt think that, unless she is absolutely unaware of herself. That‚Äôs just a justification to hide to her bigotry (or alternatively her desire to control everything).The hate comes first, then the justifications follow. That is bigotry 101. This is no different.
She's full of shit. Based on your other comments about her, she's looking out for HERSELF and her REPUTATION. 

Honey, this person sucks. Why is she in your life?
Ugh, the ‚ÄúI experimented once in college, so I can speak about LGBTQ+ struggles and how they‚Äôre over exaggerated‚Äù
My mom is one of those false ally liberal Karens and she misgenders me on purpose and has been mean to me about coming out, and my dad is one of those idgaf people so he says having a relationship with your mother is important so I can't live with him
I also also agree
True. My youngest is 7 and she loves dressing up her mother. She is more girly than I am so. Make-up, dresses are her thing.
There's this story I read one time about this trans woman, she was watching some kids and one of  them asked ""are you a boy or a girl"" the lady explained that she was in fact a trans girl to which the kid replied, ""Ok, cool. Do you play minecraft?"" 

Edit: I think I remembered it wrong lol
For realz; Kids > Adults any day! I told my 11, 13 & 15 year-olds this spring; their reactions:

- 15: I'm so proud of you and support you!!!

- 13: OK. I love you

- 11: Looked at me and listened, but never stopped eating their ice cream.

- Wife: Glowered and vibrated from the other end of the table.
This - my young nephews were hands down the most understanding and quickest to adapt of our extended family when my daughter came out.
Hell I‚Äôm not even out to my family yet and my 7 year old cousin legit stares into my soul and lays it out flat and tells me that I may look like a girl, but I‚Äôm actually a boy (I‚Äôm ftm but I haven‚Äôt said anything about being trans) and his little brother makes gay stuffed animal couples despite LGBT topics not being discussed around them. People often worry about ‚Äúconfusing‚Äù kids by talking to them about LGBT stuff but even when we‚Äôre kids our identity is innate. In my opinion not discussing these things as they come up and pretending like LGBT people don‚Äôt exist will be what causes children to be confused or even worse, cause them to think that something is wrong with them and cause issues with their self image.
Closed minded adults project their closed mindedness upon children or situations involving children, despite scientific evidence that the minds of children are much more malleable than an adult's
Oh the horror of open minded freethinking children!üôÑüòë
It only ‚Äòconfuses‚Äô people who‚Äôve grown up with homophobic and transphobic ideas drilled into them, and even then they could totally understand if they were willing to listen. It‚Äôs an excuse for transphobia disguised as protecting children
yeah now that I see this is a pattern, that‚Äôs a big yikes from me
This 10 billion percent.
She is only looking out for herself by saying she is looking out for the kiddos. She made that evident last night.
Holy shit it rlly irks me to no end. My mom literally tried to relate to me by saying they‚Äôd probably burn our house down if people found it if she was bi when I confronted her about her being transphobic af like that was of any relevance. I‚Äôm in a better place now tho far away from that nut, can‚Äôt say the same for my siblings sadly
[deleted]
That‚Äôs exactly my situation except my dad understands my mom is an unreasonable person and I think he just doesn‚Äôt understand it but definitely doesn‚Äôt oppose my transition. My mom loves to explain how victimized trans people are and how hard life is gonna be and idk if she thinks she‚Äôs gonna scare me out of being trans but knowing her that‚Äôs probably not far off. Pretty sure she‚Äôs a terf cause she used to give me so much shit about how easy life was for guys and now she sees me as a threat to her understanding of the world. Eh either way idc she can be a hateful little garbage person 200 miles away from me cause I want no part in that lol
I also also also agree
Yah your mom is sadly just projecting transphobia it would seem. There is absolutely 0 scientific evidence to suggest that having queer parents negatively impacts their children. In fact there is more science to support the opposite to my knowledge! It's important to show your children the different ways people are so that they can grow up to be more tolerant towards others.

Besides, there are more negative mental health impacts for your wife holding off on her transition that *could* potentially impact you and your kids. It's important that their mother's are happy and able to support them fully. Your children will adjust, don't let anyone downplay just how intelligent and empathetic a child can be!

I hope this helps you two!!! ‚ô•Ô∏è‚ô•Ô∏è‚ô•Ô∏è
This is the exact scenario with my wife and me with our daughter. My daughter was always very girly and my wife is very much not. Like she'll wear makeup to a wedding but that's about it. I on the other hand in much more girly. My daughter absolutely loves having a mother that she can do those kind of things with. My daughter was seven when I came out as well. She's nine now. It's had nothing but positive impacts on her. Aside from having a parent who's into some of the same stuff she's into now, I'm also much happier and less depressed so I am a better parent overall even in the gender neutral aspects of parenting than I was before.
Doesn‚Äôt sound like your youngest is confused at all. My 12 year old and 10 year old were just fine too. Grandma is just being a silly old lady.
Ironically was thinking about my conservative dad, and a friend‚Äôs conservative catholic mother
i wouldn‚Äôt say liberal‚Ä¶i‚Äôd say SJW mom
200 miles is 321.87 km
I'm not a parent myself but as the child of a parent with untreated mental health issues (primarily of the depression/anxiety sort) and similar but treated issues of my own, I definitely think it's better for kids to have parents who are addressing their own issues and living a life that doesn't make them miserable and depressed all the time. My mother's depression and anxiety caused me a lot of spillover problems, growing up. 

I know how much better \*I\* function with my chronic depression appropriately treated, in all aspects of my life. And it definitely would have been better for me to grow up with a mother who was that degree more generally functional. 

And while my mom's depression (and a large chunk of mine) isn't due to gender dysphoria, at the outward-effects level depression is depression is depression regardless of what causes it.
[deleted]
It really do be
Not only is it important that parents can deal with their issues, it's also just as important for kids to see that it's normal for people have issues they need to deal with and for them to have a good example of how to deal with them.
yeah i think i‚Äôd know that by now, but thanks for the sociology lesson. i wasn‚Äôt ‚Äúdecoding‚Äù. i was adding to the conversation. i am in the lowest part of the middle class and queer as fuck i know how white cishet high middle people act when they‚Äôre around us
Absolutely! Trying to pretend that everything is easy for you all the time does kids a great disservice. Visibly dealing with your shit in healthy ways so your kids can observe you as a role model for how to deal with shit is the best thing you can do.

your intention isn‚Äôt always going to be a persons interpretation."	qottd1	trans	1684	0.99	2021-11-07 17:53:00
I hate how cis women always have to make trans-inclusive language about *them*	"I don't have the energy to elaborate much, but basically- my existance as a trans man does not ""erase"" the ""female experience"" or whatever the fuck

Acknowledging that I have a uterus, am capable of becoming pregnant, that I still need to access """"female"""" healthcare (cervical cancer screenings and the like) does not ""invalidate"" your identity as a mother or as woman, because *women are also people*, and *being a woman is not defined by your ability to bear or raise children. This is basic feminism for the love of GOD*

I don't *care* if you call yourself a mother. I don't care if you make groups for mothers. I don't care if you casually refer to pregnancy as something that happens to women. I care if the acknowledgement that uterus-haver != woman is treated as stupid, or worse, ***oppressive***, *somehow*, to the point where a legally transitioned trans man can't even access the right type of healthcare because of it. It's not *about* you, for fucks sake

Seriously, there's so much *actual* shit that women have to face for being women and being pregnant. ""Pregnant people"" as a phrase is not one of them"	"So. True. And then some will have the audacity to be like ""why can't we just keep it as 'women' in these legislative papers, it's not like it's hurting anybody!"" As if trans men and nonbinary people with that anatomy aren't literally being turned away from healthcare that can prevent diseases and save lives because they don't fit in that definition. Of course insurance won't cover it if you don't match what's on paper exactly -_-
What winds me up even more about the cis women who complain about this is that often the official guidelines on these alternatives is only to provide the neutral terms so that *if* they happen to treat a trans man or non-binary person then they have those terms already.

Like the whole chest-feeding thing, people ran with it and said that they're ""banning"" the use of ""breastfeeding"" when actually they never did that, they just said ""hey, if your patient isn't a woman, here's the alternative term to use""
oh while we‚Äôre at it I hate the fact I‚Äôve have multiple cis women ask when i‚Äôm getting ‚Äúthe surgery‚Äù like It‚Äôs 20k, risky, and i‚Äôm only 3 and 1/2 months on hormones I couldn‚Äôt even If I wanted to. idk it annoys the f out of me when I get asked this
I am reminded of a joke (bear with me, I'm not making light of your complaints, I'm treating them very seriously):

It's the middle of the night. A guy is standing under a street lamp, looking around with a worried expression on his face.

Another dude walks up to him.

""Hey, is something wrong?""  
""Uh, yeah, actually. I think I lost my watch.""  
""Aw man, that's too bad. Maybe I can help you look for it. Where'd you drop it?""

""Oh, over there,"" the guy points to the distance, ""in the forest.""

""Why would you look for your watch here, then?""

""It's brighter over here.""

\----------  
In terms of oppression and systemic or societal problems and looking for solutions, many people - and that very much includes transphobic people - tend to take a ""it's brighter over here"" approach. Will trans women in bathrooms somehow lead to more sexual assault? No - if anything, the opposite. Is referring to a person as an uterus-haver or a pregnant person going to make healthcare related to pregnancy worse? Again - no, probably the opposite in the long run.

Why say awful things about trans people, then, when it helps no-one in a tangible way and doesn't even make much sense? Why make up oppression where none seems to exist? Well, it's brighter over here. Cis people don't have to wander to that dark forest to look for things that would \*actually\* benefit them.

This is not exclusive to trans people, I'm pretty sure this misplaced hostility happens to any oppressed, marginalised or disenfranchised group. But it sure as heck is prominent in the context of trans people, recently.
Just want to say you're right, and your voice deserves to be heard.
It's really unacceptable too, the number of people who think this is all somehow designed to spare trans women's feelings when there are trans men literally suffering and even dying because of the lack of appropriate medical care.
My aunt was talking to my mom about this. Ugh it made me so mad, it was a conversation about periods and how trans masculine or nonbinary people that have periods or something are erasing her experience as a cis woman. I don‚Äôt know her exact words or what it was all about, but it was something along the lines of that.

I‚Äôm done with that crap, I don‚Äôt know how trans people having other terms for things effects her at all. That was like the first time I‚Äôve ever experienced a bit of transphobia from someone close to me.
Just sexism boiled down
Big huge hugs, this is one of those things my wife struggles with.  One of the harder reasons is woman in their 50+ were still fighting hard for ""Womens rights"" like the right to own a credit card in their name separate from their husbands.   And Women (or people) are still fighting for the right for choice over their body and pregnancy.  And that's a HUGE deal in many parts of the world still.  It shouldn't be but it absolutely is.

So unfortunately some woman are afraid of angry patriarchal men taking away these rights (and others).  And they fear any change in the wording of ""Women's XYZ"" is a potential slip against the male patriarchy.  

I don't know how you solve this problem in the short term.  Trans people deserve to have the right to be people in all aspects of their lives.  But unfortunately hateful patriarchal men (and women willing to stand behind them) have created an absolute shit show for all of us.  We're all fighting for our rights, but getting written and embraced in law together has become an exercise in fear for any step back on either sides problems vs the patriarchy.

I really hate it, but all we can do is say and fight for what's right for all people.
fr tho. go to r/TrueOffMyChest and there are soo many posts from cis women complaining about trans-inclusive language like wtf.
I really just gave up on them a long time ago.
Just more reason to keep it to yourself whenever possible.
I feel like I might know what triggered this. That post was a bunch of TERFs and closet TERFs finding another excuse to complain about trans people. Because somehow the existence of us, whether masc or femme, is DEstRoyInG BIoLoGIcaL fEmAlEs.
Agreed - as a trans woman, I find it ridiculous that my health insurance keeps spamming me with reminders to get my pap-smear ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è The healthcare system really needs to wake up and provide better integration and support for groups other than cis white men and cis white women.

I‚Äôm so sorry you‚Äôve had this experience ü´Çü´Çü´Ç
I wonder how much of it is a subconscious reaction to patriarchy. Like, we trans men always existed of course, but the social expectation until very, very recently (and let's be honest, still is), was that only women can get pregnant and be mothers. I wonder if to a subconscious level it feels like men are trying to intrude in a space that traditionally is one of the few fields where women can shine and get attention and recognition.
I have the opposite problem, as a trans women, people exclude me from conversations about male reproduction and female ones too lol. I will probably be having my kids with my better half with my own tools since I have little desire to medically transition but regardless, i often have to remind people that i deserve an opinion in such things too
[deleted]
I once took part in a ""Diversity in Public Health"" conversation where this came up. The person running the event said they decided to default to ""pregnant women"" because ""In our focus groups, we found that women resisted gendered language like 'pregnant people.'""

And then there's me sitting there dumbfounded, trying to figure out why they called ""people"" gendered language, but not ""women.""
The trans experience is basically just a footnote to cis people problems. People insist on misgendering me, it happens most places I go. But the poor cis people can't use 2 word think of the children!!

Sorry had to get that of my chest üòÇüòÇ
JK Rowling is shaking.

No but you are a 3000% correct, honestly it‚Äôs just straight up stupid. They get defensive before being attacked. IN SPITE of being attacked, rather.
I feel this as someone who uses ‚Äúpregnant person‚Äù and ‚Äúbirthing person‚Äù and gets accused all the time for erasing women, like no I‚Äôm literally just trying to be inclusive of my and other trans mascs birth experience but go off
THANK YOU!
So true, unfortunately. I'm a cis woman who is still a virgin and I feel you. I will be more careful about this.
Well said.
Jesus christ I am so tired of this! I am soooo fucking tired of this. I absolutely 10000% agree.
Some people make everything about themselves. You can only shake your head and move on. Not to excuse it, but people often feel these ways because they themselves are closeted trans people. It sounds a lot to me like ""I'm not totally satisfied with my gender, but some aspects are comforting to me. If this person wasn't satisfied and they transitioned, it erases my struggle because I'm not transmasc""
yeah, i remember a post on r/trueoffmychest that was about language surrounding people who have the ability to bear children. it sucks and I hate the fact that subreddit has a negative post about trans people almost everyday, and the comments are always burning dumpster fire. at this point they have to be karma farming troll posts; i'm sure these people don't actually wanna have genuine and understanding conversations about trans people. 

I thought that argument was stupid and all people who can have kids should be comfortable during the pregnancy and birth, according to their health needs and their gender. I feel like women feel like something is being ""taken away"", but thats a foolish thought because trans masculine people and trans men having babies doesn't change the fact that most babies are made by cis women. We deserve to have inclusive language, comfortable terminology and a happy experience if we choose to have children as people with uteruses, and it is unfair we do not get that chance.
since it seems most other people have responded better answers than i could come up with.

&#x200B;

isnt it != not =! ? (also isnt it funny most people who have transitioned or transitioning are programmers :P)
This reminded me how TERFS boycotted a cancer charity for saying people instead of women üíÄ

Apparently to them women aren't people lol
As a cis woman...I have to admit that I find this ultra stupid because those people care only about one certain version of womanhood. 

Women =|= baby-machine 
Not everyone who can have a baby must be what they perceive as a woman. 
Not everyone who corresponds to their definition of a woman needs to be able to or want to have babies. 

A person with cancer is a cancer-patient. We don't call prostate cancer-patients ""men"" as a whole either, do we? 
A person with a bun in the oven is a pregnant person. Easy. It's a fact. 

To me, all of this sounds like fake-outrage from some people. Detailed and specific language is for the better...we don't call any non-white person ""a savage"" anymore either. 
üôÑüôÑüôÑ
This is what lat√≠n American TERFs have been screeching about recently, I saw one of them missgendering a trans dude when he explained her why those terms exist.
Literally. I just HATE when they say ,,female healthcare"" ,,women experience"" or ,,female struggles"". Why they always refuse to include trans people. We share the same struggles, yet they act like it's just theirs. That's just unfair.
this is so hard to follow im a bit confused what the real issue is here that is being expressed
Bunch of self centered scared manipulated people running around on this planet right now ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
Fuck transphobes and TERFs. They are not feminists, by definition. Just transphobes pretending to speak from feminism, the bunch of covert narcissists who always want to be perceived as the victims, while their only binding goal is perpetuating gender-based *abuse*. Transphobes calling themselves feminists is a serious insult and at this point, injury, to feminism.

And obviously to us. But their false pretense of feminism is too much. They are exactly like ""pro lifers"" who say their goal is protecting babies, when it's really harming women. Terfs say their goal is protecting women, when it's really harming trans people.

They wear costumes of decency to commit acts of harm. 

The costume is there not just to inflate their influence, but to assist their control tactic of keeping the 'good person/innocent/victim' role squarely on themselves in the public eye. It's a version of DARVO (Deny wrongdoing, and Accuse the person who called them out of being the ""real"" wrongdoer, Reversing Victim and Offender.)

Accusing real victims of being the real abusers is abhorrent, which is exactly what they are doing to us, then DARVOing onto us, in order to claim that such abhorrent things are *only really* being done to THEM by the Bad Trans.

They are textbook **covert narcissists**, as in clinical **narcissistic personality disorder**, displaying common behavioral results of narcissistic thinking patterns. I think it would benefit anybody's social defenses to look up info sources that dig deep into those bolded terms (there are many!) to learn to spot each part of their universally similar sets of manipulation tactics, in order to learn to understand them for what they are when you encounter them!  Studying this topic, and joining various ""dealing with narcissists"" subreddits (...there are too many to list), has helped me more than I can briefly say.)

TL;DRish: Don't believe TERF's good-guy costumes, words, or self-applied labels, especially the 'feminist' one, and anything to do with having scientific or medical expertise, nor with having the support of feminism or of other women in general. It's all just triangulation manipulation. 

Believe their actions, and the intended real-world consequences of these actions. That makes their true goals clear, despite all the bullshit. And applying this to TERFs shows just what they are: a single-issue hate group who wishes to cause harm to trans individuals.

Under all the smoke and mirrors, TERFs deserve no more legitimacy in debate than the KKK, who differ mainly in who they target for harm. They are no less full of shit than a klansman trying to explain why they are good and people of [race] are inherently bad, trying to give their bigotry false merit via triangulation of pretending to be backed by studies and research from prestigious institutions (which actually destroy their arguments, had they fully read or understood them).
I understand your point. 
But in my point of view it also has a sense: Law-Stuff. When it is needed to refer to the (ex)pregnant-people. Then the term 'Mother' terrifies me.
It fucking IS hurting people that‚Äôs why! But my favorite argument is: ‚Äùshould be change it just for a few people?‚Äù Uhhhh so you WANT minorities to be treated like shit, huh? Is that it? You just fucking HATE minorities and having to accomodate ANYTHING for them to feel even a LITTLE bit more included. Maybe we should just go back to calling everyone a man then? And not give a crap about women again? Fuck. You. It drives me insane. Stop being so triggered that there are other minorities that ALSO have issues. Jesus.
Not to mention that they're also implying I'm not a real woman because I *don't* have a uterus.
[deleted]
God IKR

They're acting like they're oppressed because SOME people use neutral language

litcherally 1984 /s
And while we're still at it I've seen some of them (talking about MtFs in this case) saying TERFy shit and going ""less than half of them ever get tHe SuRgErY and that should tell you all you need to know"". Yeah, that it's expensive, inaccessible, and highly uncertain, and that for some people social transition is good enough?
Did you get the surgery yet?
Put another way, trans people are much easier targets than the actual oppressors.
As a cis ally, I will take this to heart. I, too, am a marginalized person (I was given a bogus medical diagnosis at the age of 2).
Thank you
Yes, TERFs especially seem to think this all the time. I think it's because they have a much easier time hating on trans women (who they see as predatory men) while pretending they pity trans men (who they see as naive, misled girls). All their talking points boil down to ""the sort of sexism feminists were fighting in the 70s"".
I had to explain to a room full of cis health professionals at a talk that pregnancy is not a personal concern for me as a trans woman. A large number legitimately didn't even know that I couldn't get pregnant because they didn't know what ""trans woman"" meant; that's the level of ignorance in the room.
I will say it: burn the patriarchy!
There was one trending a few days ago, that's what this is partially in response to
TBF I haven't actually had any *direct* experiences with cis women saying this to me, I've just seen a lot of cis women online repeat the same BS (like that post on trueoffmychest that was trending a while back)
But I thought trans men were supposed to be poor confused little autistic girls, not scary male invaders! /s

Oh, right. Their portrayal of us shifts to whichever makes us a more convenient target. Not to mention the number of people who think this is for trans women's sake, somehow

(Not saying I disagree with you, your point is valid and it's an understandable (?) gut reaction for a cis woman to have. key word being ""gut reaction"")
it's interesting that you say you're excluded from both discussions, while trans men are often lumped into women's spaces. Reminds me of [this essay](https://nothorses.tumblr.com/post/665231771105902592/embed)

Dunno if the link works, but it's about how manhood is viewed as a competition, whereas womanhood is viewed as an obligation, which is why trans people (""failed"" men/women) are treated differently
Absolutely! Enby afab, although my ability to safely carry a pregnancy is negated by my uterus and tubes throwing a tantrum (yay endometriosis üôÑ). I'm not a walking baby factory and this terf shite needs to find its way into a black hole, taking JK with it.
[deleted]
the mental gymnastics you have to do to think ""woman"" is less gendered than ""person""...
Occasionally when someone says that I am this ü§è close to snapping and being like ""oh you think the word people is erasing women? So you don't think women are people? Thats kind of sexist."" It's not very nice and a deliberate misinterpretation of what i know they're trying to say, but I'm tempted sometimes.
Yeah that‚Äôs‚Ä¶weird of them. They‚Äôre *literally* included in ‚Äúpregnant person‚Äù and ‚Äúbirthing person‚Äù.
üëä You‚Äôre a real one ‚ù§Ô∏è‚Äçü©π
Oh, it probably is lmao, I'm not a programmer I just use it because I don't have a symbol for the crossed-out equals sign
A lot of cis women wrongly believe saying ""pregnant people"" erases and oppresses women. They insist on language that excludes AFAB people who aren't women. That's a major problem because it increases the risk that a trans man with M as his gender record might be denied important services by ignorant doctors and insurance companies.
Yeah, sorry if it's hard to read. I wrote this as a rant, I didn't expect it to get as much attention as it did
you have some good points, but I feel like straight-up armchair diagnosing them with NPD is shitty. Most abusers are neurotypical
Wdym? I'm not sure I get your point
Many people don't really think through their political beliefs, they just go by whatever they have a strong emotional reaction to. Whether or not its contradictory or leads to bad outcomes doesn't matter.
You're so right, and that makes it even worse. They're really sprinkling a little bit of ""let's just invalidate and hurt everybody in the trans community"" in, huh?
Because governments have demonstrated good judgment, the ability to take in new information and react and be accountable to those they represent.     

What has government done to earn such trust and devotion?
I just dont like surgery at all. The idea of being out and under a knife for like half a day and then the recovery process scares the shit out of me. I would never consider it tbh.

(I've also put off getting my wisdom teeth removed for this same reason, I just hate surgery and anesthetic)
In simple words, yes.  


It's easier to punch down and make oneself feel a little better for a while, and even feel like one is Making a Difference For the Better.  


It's a lie, and an insidious one, but it's clear where it sometimes comes from.
agreed
> health professionals

Geez, that's concerning
[deleted]
They didn't push their ideals on anyone. They said we shouldn't reduce *all women* to their potential or actual pregnancy. Nobody said ""No woman should want to be a mother or stay home.""
you wanting to be a mother (good on you!) does not equal your worth being directly connected to your potential babymaking. you're fighting the wrong people here honey
Wtf you really got that internal misogynist vibes üíÄüíÄüíÄ
I mean what other implications are there to them thinking the word ‚Äúperson‚Äù excludes women? I think it‚Äôs just the natural progression of their hypocritical bs lol you would be NTA for pointing that out to them
A real what? I don't understand.
ok thanks yea that is not a good thing to happen. I always wondered about the whole gender neutral terminology in reference to health care typically used for women like as in who it applied too. I never thought about it being for trans men who still might do those things or need that type of care and the word women doesn't apply to them. I always love to learn new things.
Lol u good i am dyslexic so lol üòÇ
FARTs really do make everything worse.
When I was a kid I was so terrified of surgery I used to say that if I had a life threatening condition requiring surgery, I would just let it take me. I also put off my wisdom teeth surgery for years (got it in my early 30s) because I was so scared I‚Äôd never wake up. I hadn‚Äôt been under general at that point but I sucked it up and let me tell you, it was awesome! I had the most beautiful dream/hallucinations that when I woke up I told the nurse that she and I had been walking up a mountain in the sun set and everything was pink and purple and beautiful and we were in the clouds‚Ä¶ and then I burst out crying because I would never see purple mountain again. I cried and hugged all the staff when I was leaving and in the Uber on the way home I asked my partner why we can‚Äôt take general anaesthetic every night before bed because it‚Äôs AWESOME! 

However, they only gave me a few days worth of pain killers and I was in massive pain for two weeks. I had to go back for more *and* use some spares I had. This was for an ‚Äúeasy‚Äù surgery that removed all four teeth in less than 30 minutes (but left a large shard of tooth in my gums that was fighting its way out). Everyone reacts to surgery differently but I hate pain and it was such a crap recovery, especially as I was told I‚Äôd be fine by day 5 and I was still calling in sick by day 10. (I have fibromyalgia though so everything hurts more.) Currently I don‚Äôt have health insurance but I was recently told I have a deviated septum, nose polyps and the only way I‚Äôll be able to breathe normally is surgery. I don‚Äôt have any prospects for that now and it‚Äôs still terrifying even though it might solve a bunch of health issues for me, so I guess until then I‚Äôll just struggle to breathe.

So yeah, in our society of nip/tucking and excessive surgery people think it‚Äôs no big deal but it‚Äôs a big decision to go under the knife, especially if something isn‚Äôt life threatening (though I know for many people not getting top/bottom surgery *is* life threatening). It‚Äôs not a decision to be taken lightly, plus on top of that I understand that many surgeons require hormone therapy cessation temporarily (for 6 weeks?) before surgery, which can be scary. And if anyone makes a judgement about not having surgery, I mean are they going to fucking pay for it? Again, people act like it‚Äôs no big deal to have 20K lying around or like taking out credit or a loan for that much is easy. 

Surgery is scary. People who opt for it are very brave, have the means, often have/need good support systems for afterwards, have job security or prospects that they can look forward to afterwards etc. Not everyone is in that position. You do you and screw what anyone else says. I know that‚Äôs easier said than done, but people need to mind their own goddamn business.

"With the ""Don't Say Gay"" bill possibly passing, how do you think your life would have been different if there was education around LGBTQ+?"	"TW/RANT/DISCUSSION

&#x200B;

Ill start this off by saying I am all for education teaching students about LGBTQ people.

I didn't start transitioning until 2019/age 22. The biggest reason why? I had no idea that I could. I have had these feelings for as long as I remember. As early as 4th/5th grade. I used to look up spells & magic to find out ways to turn myself into a girl. I once wrote a note on a rock and buries it because that was one of the spells. (Newsflash, it didn't work). I even had found a website where you ""sell"" your soul to the devil in order for a wish. That didn't work either. 

For years throughout middle & high school, I crossdressed. I would wear man clothes on top to hide it. I even wore some makeup, and passed it off as being emo. But that was it. That was all I could do. There was no information or anything, that was all I was going to be. 

Fast forward to when I move out of my parents. I no longer had to hide crossdressing from them, and did it on the daily in my own place. This was right out of HS. I was in such a great place that I decided to call PP. Unfortunately they said they didn't offer trans care. At the time, I didn't realize I was trans, but that's what they told me. 

Maybe you're wondering. How could I crossdress, how could I want to be a girl so badly, but not realize I was trans? Because I had never heard of it! They never taught it. Being gay was popular at the time, so everyone knew about that, but nothing of transgenderism. 

I then googled trans people and fell into a dark rabbit hole. I saw the worse of transgenderism. I saw people who didn't pass. I saw what just looked like fully grown old men with beards, muscles, etc, in a dress. Basically, I saw what every Terf wants people to see. 

I didn't want to be that. I would rather be stuck as a man forever than to dress up as a woman and look like that. So for several more years, I kept it in. I repressed it. I hated myself and everything about the 'trans' version of me. I ended up moving back in with my parents for a bit, again, no longer crossdressing and keeping everything in. This led to very bad depression, though I didn't realize that it was because I was repressing everything, 

When I moved out of their house, 22 at the time, it all came flooding back. I had all of these urges to dress like a girl, and decorate my room like a girl, and be feminine in every way possible. Thats when I went down the rabbit hole again. This time, I found out about HRT. I found out about surgeries. I found out that I could LITERALLY turn myself into a woman. I was so surprised. I didn't know that any of it was possible. The extent of my knowledge was that I could dress up as a girl, while being a man. I had no idea I could actually BE a girl. 

Fast forward to now. I've been on HRT for 2 years. I'm 2 months post op from SRS. I have fucking boobs. BOOBS. I used to tape my chest so id have cleavage. I HAVE BOOBS. Sorry lol. 

Long story, I know, but I wanted you to understand why I feel education is important. Had there been education revolving LGBTQ, my entire life could have been different. I could have started transitioning so much sooner. Yeah, 22 isn't a bad age, but fuck 15 would have been a lot better. 

People are so against the education of it, thinking it'll create trans people, or gay people, or etc, but in reality, all it is doing is pushing these people deeper into 'the closet' only for them to have more and more issues as their life progresses. 

I almost killed myself so many times. I was a cutter, my arm is lined with them. I had terrible depression. So much more. All could have been avoided had there been someone to educate me, and tell me I'm okay. That I'm normal. 

Sorry for the long rant, but yeah. What do ya'll think?"	"When people ban discussion, it only highlights their own fear of the inadequacy of their own words.

Additionally, the bill will allow the schools to out children which will definitely result in abuse if not murder.

They‚Äôre afraid of boys being girls but are fine with dead kids.
I would‚Äôve been able to be myself as a kid. I started transitioning when I was 21. It would have been so nice to know that I wasn‚Äôt alone as a kid and that I had a valid reason for feeling what I felt. I could‚Äôve started transitioning sooner and been so much happier.
I'm about the same age as you, as when I was growing up, I was not aware that anything LGBTQ+ even remotely existed, except to know that Gay was considered a curse word. As I got older, I became aware of gays and lesbians, and 'transvestites'. The message was that gays & lesbians were crimes against nature, and against god, and trans folks were too, but even more so. When I was an older teen, the message changed again - gays, lesbians, and bi people were okay, at a distance, so long as they kept it to themselves and didn't try to 'indoctrinate' kids with it. Trans was still wrong, and I recall the argument/story that 'transvestites' were mentally ill, and that the hospitals/ facilities that performed gender affirming surgeries refused (or in some iterations it was outlawed) as it apparently made no difference and didn't 'cure' trans people.

Obviously, this is all a very negative, toxic outlook. Had there been education, I probably would have realised I was trans a lot sooner, and I would certainly hate myself less for it. But, in the eyes of my parents, and the community I grew up in, I would have been 'indoctrinated'.
I would‚Äôve known that I was trans and interested in women as a lesbian, sooner‚Ä¶
i want people to make lgbtq+ school so we are able to be ourselfs and don‚Äôt have to worry about bigots
I spent my entire childhood thinking I was asexual- actually trying to enforce my own asexuality- because it was easier than coping with my own body in context with other people.

 I didn't see a trans man that wasn't getting pregnant(which was like body horror to me at the time) in the news until my 20s- and now I still have trouble knowing what I want. Probably won't ever, because my brain finished growing while I was still confused.
Oh, completely.

If I'd had any competent education about gender and sexuality as relates to personal identity, I'd probably have figured out I'm a girl decades earlier.

And since the hypothetical existence of such an education implies that there would have been resources available to *help* me, yeah, I'd probably be living a completely different life and overall probably would have been a lot happier.

I 100% agree that a proper gender identity and sexuality curriculum would not only help, but would save, a lot of lives. On so many levels.
the entirety of my 4th through 6th grade was at a private Christian school and 7th and 8th grade i was homeschooled. during that time i hardly knew what trans meant, and of course the world around me frame all trans people as predatory men wanting to be women and girls trying to be trendy and cute by identifying as trans. but in 8th grade even tho i was still homeschooled, i got a phone and started actually learning about the world and deconstructing the illusions built by the church and my parents and the internalized phobia i had from being taught that. the more i learned about LGBTQ the more i identified with it, the more i identified as trans. i started identifying as non-binary, and went i went to a real public highschool the next year i found a few people who accepted me and later that year i came out as a trans male.

if there was any actual education about LGBTQ+ people, not only would i have realized i was trans and come out wayyyy earlier, but the world around me probably would have been way safer and way more accepting. the don't say gay bill doesn't ""protect"" kids from learning about LGBTQ, it just prolongs the discovery of their identity and/or make it *less* safe for LGBTQ kids.
When I was growing up Michelle Bachmann introduced a similar law that made it illegal for school employees to talk about anything queer, even if that meant they couldn't talk about their own family with their students, in the school district right next to mine and I grew up hearing about 11 suicides of kids like me one after another.

Even though my school implemented two LGBTQ clubs in response because they didn't want the suicide contagion spreading to our school I still knew I wasn't safe. And I knew about trans people and even had 3 trans classmates who were out and a 4th who was still closeted but taking HRT in preparation of coming out after graduation. And there was still bullying in my school and our counselors and principle were still so useless i just said fuck it and graduated early to escape, but my closeted trans friend ended up getting held back so she was alone and stuck at home even longer because of the mental toll it took on her school performance. 

Everyone could tell I was some kinda queer, especially the kid who made a beeline to my locker to call me a fag every day for 2 years, and even though I now realize I'm a gay trans man I buried that down deep and just said I was pansexual so the only queer cred I got was being the ""practice girl"" for any cis girl who wanted to sexually experiment and that fucks with me because they got to be authentically queer but I didn't, not really.
I didn't expect this to get so much traction! I'm both glad that I'm not alone in this, but also very sad that I'm not alone in this. It's such a tragedy that so many of us have had similiar situations regarding this one topic. I wish that was enough to prove to everyone else that education is needed. 

I'll respond to comments as I can. But I see you. Thank you <3
I probably (and a lot of other older trans ppl I know) wouldn't have suppressed it for so long and could've started earlier, also I might've not been gone so deep into depression. But I did get a better sense for ppl so I know who to keep at distance :)
I think a lot of things would have made more sense. I've never felt that I fit. If I'd know about trans people were a thing then that would at least have gone some way to explain a few things. There was no representation of trans people for me growing up let alone non binary people. The only time you even heard anything were slurs.  Something to be looked down on. :(
The scary thing as well is that on top of people not being educated, it will probably make it seem more socially acceptable to simply laugh and joke about LGBTQ+ people. Like it was when I was in school.

... Like a million years ago :p
God this is so important. I'm so stressed out by this bill
Nothing would have changed for me. I knew it was all real stuff (limited understanding granted). 

I just thought I was different. Coming out to myself with or without education was a struggle. But ofc this shit needs to be discussed in schools cause fuck the education system in general.
I just started transition a couple months ago in my mid 40's. The desire has been there since I was a teenager, but I didn't even know what transgender WAS until I was much older. I didn't really know what was possible with HRT until maybe a year ago. I just had no idea. Like, I thought all trans women had implants. Had no clue. 

I spent a LONG time being unhappy before I figured this shit out on my own. One of my biggest regrets in my life is all that unhappy time. My best years, wasted on depression. Seeing all the pics from 18 year olds asking if it's too late for them... All of this could have been avoided if I had even the tiniest bit of information as a kid. Of course, that's why conservatives oppose it. They'd rather see trans kids kill themselves than BE themselves.
I will never forgive my (devout LDS) parents for depriving me of knowledge that could have made my transition happen earlier. When I had my first gay (at the time I still though I was a man) experience, and expressed I might be bisexual, my mom laughed in my face and told me that wasn't a real thing. Not conflating gender and sexuality, but I knew I didn't live in a safe place to assert that I was different.

I leaned so heavily into the emo/scene kid phase, and it took years for me to realize ""oh fuck, I just liked wearing girl-cut clothes, makeup, long hair, etc.""

So many fuckin signs were there, but ""gender is an eternal characteristic of identity and purpose"" was literally framed on the wall of my house (a normal thing for Mormons, no seriously.) I am still in the process of forgiving myself for waiting so long, and I will not ever forgive them.

Education in a public setting would have potentially saved me years of suicidal identity crisis and a former pill addiction.
If there was more LGBTQIA+ education, I would've avoided a lot of hurt and trauma. Kids would be more supportive and tolerant of me and my friends. Instead, I was bullied. Majorly. One kid saw me holding hands and cuddling with my girlfriend at the time during lunch and he outed me and them to the entire grade/school. People would tell us all the time that we were weird or disgusting for being a same-sex couple. 

On top of that, I was also trans (non-binary). It was a constant battle of hearing people misgender and deadname me. If there was more LGBTQIA+ education, they would've known that gender is a social construct, and therefore there are an infinite amount of gender identities out there. It's why transgender people have an alarmingly high suicide rate because people aren't educated and they bully them.

I'm not sure if I live in the area where the bill is in the process of being passed (I hope it doesn't get passed) it's stressing me the fuck out. All of my trans friends or just any lgbtqia+ friends please stay safe out there, and I'm proud of all of you <3
I had education about it and I‚Äôd wish that on everyone. It wasn‚Äôt perfect. To me it always felt more like gay/trans people exist and you should respect them then maybe you are gay/trans too. I though asexuality was a hypothetical orientation and definately only associated bisexuality with celebrities. Also I remember being 11 and discussing with my classmates if someone could be both trans and gay or if that would cancel each other out. But I got the general gist of it that queer people exist and just let them be, which is a great start (also the idea that teachers hide the gayness of ancient greece feels so weird to me. My teacher was very vocal about his problems with the fact that the movie Troy made Patroklos Achilles‚Äô cousin)
You literally explained my entire situation perfectly everything besides the moving out part was literally me word for word. I had wanted to be a girl since elementary school and used to secretly cross dress when people weren't around and whenever I'd say or mention anything slightly feminine people would react strangely so I shoved it down and hated it for years but no matter what I did it wouldn't go away. Then I sort of learned what trans was but yeah I saw the guys dressed like girls and I was like ew no, or I saw girls with guy parts, and that's all I thought it was forever. I'm 19 so I haven't moved out yet, but recently I decided to finally figure out that part of me instead of shove it down and try to get rid of it. Did some research and was had the same reaction as you pretty much, I was like damnnnn I can fr be a girl wtf, no way and now I'm starting hrt in 2 weeks and I couldn't be more excited or happy about it
I wish they would have talked about it when I was in school. Then maybe I would have realized all the feelings and thoughts I had were normal. I‚Äôm 35 now and just realizing I‚Äôm trans. ü•∫ü•∫
God fucking dammit i needed to hear this so bad 
Ive canceled so many first appointments because ‚Äúi can never be a woman‚Äù. At least not like those other tf girls who always look absolutely stunning . Today i shaved my face (and most of my body- its a forest now x.x) for the first time in months. I i put on a feminine outfit that had been sitting in its amazon packaging for like two months, unsure if itd even fit me. 


Looking in the mirror i started crying because i saw exactly who i needed to be to finally achieve true peace. Since that moment id bounce the hrt thing back and forth, terrified of getting stuck in some inescapable trans purgatory id fabricated from ideas of people who would never know what its like to be me. So much fear‚Ä¶ and for what? 


Then i read your post‚Ä¶. Im shaking and crying as i write this but because of you and this post , along with every other absolutely beautiful person in this sub who has been brave enough to share their journey, im doing it.


IM SCHEDULING MY FIRST VISIT FOR HRT RIGHT NOW!!! 


Thank you, OP, for fighting these so called false norms and loudly realizing what i feel so many of us need to. Some of us (like myself) just cant help but be stubborn with ourselves. Posts like yours have so much power to change that ‚ù§Ô∏è 


Also thank you to my wonderfully supportive girlfriend who i cant wait to join me on this journey herself :,)
I hope she sees this too :) im gonna go give her a big hug as soon as i catch my breath.


And thank you so much to everyone else sharing their stories as well as their progress. If they ban discussion we‚Äôll fucking start our own. You can‚Äôt silence those on the path to self enlightenment and happiness. Especially when you shout from the towers of fear, loathing and misery! The governments with anti-trans agendas will make it harder , they always do, but when have they ever effectively stopped shit. I mean the war on drugs seems to have certainly worked okay üôÑ 


(Im sorry for the potentially nonsensical rant. Im so used to apathy and lack of emotion, that im having trouble even thinking clearly now ffs)


Tldr: OP, im starting my HRT journey id put off for so many years thanks to your post. I know it wasnt the main topic but god damn you struck a nerve in me T.T
Thank you again ‚ù§Ô∏è


I love you all so gosh darn much. ‚ù§Ô∏è

Im tired of being a woman pretending to be a man because society decided thats where i fit. And im tired of seeing my ‚Äúcondition‚Äù as anything but a facade being forced upon me by soulless masked faces. No more, this girl is ready to be happy :,)

Im ready for this mask to be gone once and for all , and fuckin hell ill be loud about it - bills or no bills.
This, only 40.

Growing up in the 80's, I never knew just what could be done until I stumbled onto it here a few years ago.
This was a great sharing story. Thank you!  I had similar experiences as you, but I didn‚Äôt find out about these things until my late 20s, and even then, I repressed my feelings and felt trapped in my life path. YouTube trans vloggers really helped me. The internet was nascent when I was 15 and my parents technophobic tendencies kept me from a lot of resources as well. Education would be amazing. But unfortunately there‚Äôs a lot of education to do for the people making education decisions, and they‚Äôre way less open to ideas and change.
Are-..are you me?

I had such a similar experience of just ‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt know this was an option!‚Äù. Growing up in the south as well we didn‚Äôt really have this kind of visibility in the first place. And the first time I learned about it I didn‚Äôt have enough information to really process and accept it and had that same experience of googling and subsequently thinking ‚ÄúI wouldn‚Äôt be able to pass so I think I‚Äôd be even more miserable‚Äù. Like. I didn‚Äôt see hope at the end of that tunnel. Then after repressing it‚Äôs for a few more years and being depressed, learning more about it, and actually having available information this has been the greatest choice of my life.

Also turns out my family was suspecting it since I was 3. Still lil salty they didn‚Äôt let me in on the secret sooner lol
Thanks for sharing! I relate so hard. I'm 27 and just starting and was oblivious to the trans option until a few years ago. I grew up in Poland, completely sheltered from gay people or people of colour etc. - any mention of trans people was maybe an occasional joke on the tv.

Only after moving to UK in my teens and spending a lot of time online have I slowly cured that toxic conditioning.

I wish trans education was more common both now and then. I'd know sooner, and maybe wouldn't be so worried about my family to come out. 

‚ù§Ô∏è
Knowing what ace is would most certainly have helped a lot. 

Knowing I am a Transfem Enby would have spared me easily 10 years of depression, possibly more.
[Section 28](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Section_28). I lived with it. 

To avoid any accusations of ""promoting homosexuality"", there was no mention of sexuality or gender at all.

It didn't stop people realising they were other than cis-het later in life but did lead to some confused, closeted, often self loathing people. These days, at least there's the internet.
Free speech, until it comes to what they don't want to hear. I fucking hate these bills.
Well, I didn't know being anything other than straight was a thing until I was 13. After I'd had my first kiss with a ""same sex"" person. And I only knew that being trans was a thing until I was 21 (I'm 29 now, haven't started transitioning yet and don't know when that'll be because I come from a toxic, conservative family that has fucked me up in more ways than one). And then when I was 23 I was like ""okay, think I'm not cis, I may be enby and uh okay so maybe I'm not straight..."" because it was just easier (and I was afraid, please don't come for me saying this is bad rep for the community, everyone's lives are different). And I only came to the fantastic conclusion that I wasn't enby when I was 25, and it's been a nightmare since then. Because again, toxic family, if I come out in any way, I'll be ostracised and I have CPTSD (from the toxic family) and am not neurotypical so that wouldn't be good. I'm just trying to survive, I guess. But in what ways? Well, I think I'd have been miserable much earlier. I'm sorry this isn't an inpirational tale of earlier self-discovery. I showed signs of being masc since early childhood but I simply didn't know.
Without this Reddit page and educational websites my many misconceptions about being trans would‚Äôve taken many more years to be corrected, would‚Äôve been miserable. And as for my sexuality, I‚Äôm currently grappling with my being aroace and I can guarantee it would be a lot easier with more education and representation. I‚Äôm kind of relying on Jughead and Todd Chavez here
Maybe. I‚Äôm just now getting some understanding in my late 20s. 

I certainly didn‚Äôt have a full understanding in my teens. But I had the internet. I did quite a bit of reading on wikipedia and google. The information online even in the late ‚Äò00s was nowhere near as good as it is now. I knew that surgeries were a thing. I knew that LGBT people existed. I knew a few people in the gay-straight alliance in high school, and I knew about gay people from TV. Hell, I even knew that I probably wasn‚Äôt 100% straight. But for me, changing gender was something that mostly existed in the sci-fi novels I read. I didn‚Äôt ever think transition was something available to me. I didn‚Äôt know that trans communities existed, I didn‚Äôt know any out trans people IRL.

In college, I did meet and befriend some gay people and trans people. I encountered egg memes, and I was a little afraid about how much I related to them. I listened to podcasts with stories of trans experiences (shout-out to This American Life, Snap Judgment, and Risk!). I thought I might be agender, *maybe* genderfluid, but I still never considered transition as a possibility. A lot of the trans stories I heard were deeply tied with suffering, trauma, depression, etc. But my experience was more numbness, and bottling-up my feelings. 

It wasn‚Äôt until a couple years later that I started to encounter more stories similar to my feelings. And maybe more importantly, stories of trans joy. Combined with that, I finally was out of school, I had a somewhat stable career, a place to live, and I felt like I had space to work on myself. To try and become more honest, vulnerable, and in-touch with my own feelings. It was a combination of listening, reading, maturity, and life circumstances that eventually led to the egg cracking.

So for me, it‚Äôs hard to say how much my life would have been changed if I had more education about LGBTQ+ stuff in school. I wish I might have been more comfortable experimenting with gender presentation, but I was already so obsessed with blending-in and looking ‚Äúnormal‚Äù that I probably wouldn‚Äôt have changed. But even if education didn‚Äôt speed up my self-discovery I think I would have been more understanding of the LGBTQ+ people around me.

And anyways, I don‚Äôt feel any huge amount of regret for starting ‚Äúlate‚Äù (as if your 20s is a late time to start *anything* in life). I mean, more than the physical aspects I just wish I had figured out a lot of the emotional stuff way earlier. But I guess I was protecting myself emotionally from an environment that didn‚Äôt seem entirely safe. 

TLDR: I really don‚Äôt know if better education would have helped me transition sooner. But either way, it probably would have helped me be a better person.
Pretty clearly unconstitutional and federally illegal.

Not only does it violate the 1st amendment; it also violates the civil rights act; of which LGBTQ people are covered under as per a SCOTUS decision.

Really... the concerning part is the intention might be to get this into the SCOTUS, to reverse that decision.
I didn't even know HRT was a thing until I was *25*

Needless to say, my life would have been very different if LGBT education had been a thing
God this is exactly like me. Not knowing what being trans is, finding out and seeing only non passing trans women, freaking out, repressing, finding out about HRT and finally transitioning. If only I knew sooner.
In the UK we had Section 28 which banned anything that could be construed as ""promotion of homosexuality"". It was repealed half way through my schooling but the damage was done. Didn't primary school thinking I was pathetic for not liking the same things the other boys did, then in secondary school hid my gender identity so much I ended up burning out and becoming a shell of a person. I don't know if what I like doing now is purely for the love of it or if it's cover. LGBT kids in my school were relentlessly bullied and little if anything was done about it. Things have changed, there are more of my schoolmates who are living their true lives now, but I do think we would be much more tolerant without it.
I knew I was trans at 15 or 16.. the signs started when I was in like 6th grade.

I was told that I wasn't because I wasn't straight afterwards. Knowing I'd never get the hormones needed to pass I tried my best to play the part and be a guy. I never fit in. I never felt ok. I missed all the time people spending learning who they are, and constructes a facade.Now a little over a decade later I'm transitioning.

I wouldn't have a kid. But I would have my hair. My voice. My face. I wouldn't have spent so much of my life feeling lost worthless and hating myself and my body.. I probably wouldn't have picked up self harm. I'm facing years of expensive and painful surgeries just to have a _chance_ at who I wanted to be. Who I **should** have been.
Well I knew I was trans in 1973, but I was at Tanner 2 in 1971, so yeah if education and blockers had been available *especially for the adults* I would have lived a very different life.
Seconding what you are saying. I could have known myself so much better had I just been allowed to know the truth. I grew up in a very liberal area that was relatively LGBTQ + friendly. But I never really understood that I didn‚Äôt have to be a boy if I didn‚Äôt want to because no one told me I could. Education is so important and so many aspects of life, Socio political issues, racism, the queer community. The more we learn the more we can understand, and the more we understand the more loving and tolerant we can be
Your little life story in the description is (unfortunately) very relatable. I was referring to myself as ""a boy in a girl's body"" as early as elementary school. I knew nothing about trans people other than transphobic depictions on tv, so I thought there was no way I could be that. I wasn't like those depictions. I was a real person. I was given no indication that transness was a real-people thing, and I even less knew what the hell it actually *is*. I basically thought it was crossdressing because that's essentially what those depictions showed it as. Men who refused to get out of their dresses. Something to laugh at.

On a similar-but-different hand, gay people (as tv told me) were only men, men who loved other men in a shallow way, with voices that made every word sound like it was written in pink glitter pen. Any same-gender attraction of any other sort was not anything I ever saw. And asexuality? Forget about it.

I found out I was bi when I was about 13. I found the word during a random internet scroll and didn't know what it meant. I read the definition and immediately knew it was me.

Finding out my transness was a bit trickier. Once I found out it was, in fact, a real thing, I was... 15, I believe? I clicked with it but all the transphobia I internalized over the years made me hesitant to declare myself a man. I wouldn't be decently comfortable doing so for another two years. And I'm still doubting myself after all this time.

My point is... if I were taught these words, and their real, unfiltered, non-stereotyped definitions... I probably would've had my whole identity figured out by age 8. No struggle. Minimal uncertainty. Schools can and should give this education. No one should have to deal with this confusion.
We live in a messed up world.
When I was a child, I had no knowledge of what transgender was (born in the early 80's). So to answer the question, I likely wouldn't have felt shame over cross dressing and I wouldn't have kept it a secret (immediate family is accepting). I could have gotten therapy to help me understand what I was feeling (didn't know what transgender was until I was 15 or 16). I wouldn't have felt the need to keep everything bottled up inside until I was in my late 30's and I would have been able to lead a happier and far more productive life.
If, when I was a child, I had people in my life who told me that trans people exist and that it‚Äôs okay to be trans, I feel like I would have come out much sooner. This bill is bad for so many reasons, and forcing that message out of schools is going to result in long term heartache for LGBTQ+ youth
Maybe I wouldn't be the disaster of a human being am I today.
I‚Äôm 28 and just started HRT, about a month and a week into it now. Your words, especially about just not knowing trans was a ‚Äúthing‚Äù down to the terf propaganda and suicidal ideation was my experience exactly. 

What saved me was an amazing and loving partner who helped me find the information and resources, and now three months after coming out I am happier than I have ever been in my entire life, and I haven‚Äôt had a suicidal ideation SINCE I came out. 

I absolutely agree that there needs to be public education on this. My conservative grandparents threatened me countless times for acting gay or feminine and it took me until 28 to have a safe place and be myself.

Nobody should have to wait to be themselves. Cis people don‚Äôt.
I would‚Äôve learned how to genuinely love myself rather than just acting like I did. I would‚Äôve learned that it‚Äôs not normal to hate everything about your body the way I did. I wouldn‚Äôt have grown up hating myself and feeling dissociated from myself. I would‚Äôve been able to be me, unapologetically, and sometimes I grieve the life I could‚Äôve lived had I known about being trans sooner.
Gods I wish there was discussion about being transgender and being transgender wasn't stigmatized. I probably would have immediately identified with it if I was shown materials as a child.

If you asked me if I wanted to wear a dress and be a beautiful girl when I was 3 I would have said yes 1000 times. I wouldn't have spent 30 years of my life depressed that I couldn't dress the way I saw other girls dressing. I wouldn't have not had any friends because I could never relate to anyone.

My life would have been so much better. I don't understand why society wants to impose misery onto LGBTQ+ people. It's just so lame.
I grew up in the 90s with very little exposure to LGBTQ information, nor a support environment, and that definitely had an impact on me not hatching as a trans person until I was 44.

Education, visibility, and acceptance are vital.
If there was I could have definitely avoided the past 2 years of trying to piece my brain back together, I still kind of am but not so much that its driving me mad anymore
I grew up in a pretty conservative area.  I barely knew that being trans was a healthy thing you could be vs some sort of mental illness to be ashamed of until I was in college and I didn't speak to a trans person (that I was aware of) until  I was an adult.  If I knew that it was something you could explore I probably would've transitioned sooner than my earlier 30s.
You would think this bill came directly out of the Kremlin
Someone in my class said today ""that's it ladies, gentlemen, transgender men, transgenders and the the other parts of the lgbtiqa+ community"". 

Pretty sure it was supposed to be a joke but I didn't know you're no longer a man if you're gay, I thought that was a thing
I grew up in a small town where LGBTQ topics weren‚Äôt really talked about, outside of church that is, even in the early 2000s things weren‚Äôt good. It wasn‚Äôt until I started working in healthcare that I got proper sex education and a view of the world outside my bubble. I learned there are people who exist just fine outside my own ideas of what ‚Äúnormal‚Äù was. My favorite patients were the ones who made me go ‚Äúhuh, I didn‚Äôt know that was a thing that could happen‚Äù and challenged my narrow view of the world. I remember walking home from school one day and seeing a pride flag, I sorta knew what it was but just thought ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not sure how I should feel about that‚Äù, because that‚Äôs what I was taught.

This bill doesn‚Äôt JUST negate LGBTQ education, it enables homophobic/transphobic dogma, and not everyone is able to leave that bubble until after it‚Äôs cemented.
All I can say is thank God for the internet. Banning discussion of LGBTQ issues will do nothing and will only create negative feelings and bad blood. 

Also, people who ban things are never the good guys in history.
Oh if I had learnt anything about trans people as a kid I probably would have transitioned before puberty. My childhood was basically full time disassociation from dysphoria (which I didn't even realise I had), which lead to bullying, which lead to more disassociation. I remember thinking several times in 4th/5th grade ""I wish I was a girl."" One of my few strong memories dispite all the brain fog.

In any case, I'm 22 now too! Still pre everything but would love to start HRT this year. Congrats on your progress, I'll have to catch up!
I wouldn‚Äôt have wasted half of my life, failed relationships, and lived in absolute depression and misery until finding myself.  I would have been a smarter, more productive worker, and my work ethic is considerable to begin with.  My faith in God probably would have been preserved.
I don't have much to add here - I just want to say thank you for writing this out. I'm 28 and my experience wasn't all that different from yours, although I only just started HRT this year.

A lot of what you wrote about just hits home. I just wanted to stop by and say thanks and that I hope everything is going great for you! Cheers girl üíú
I don't know if my life would've been great or anything, but certainly a lot better.

I often wonder how my transition would've turned out if I could've transitioned at 16 instead of 30. Would I pass? Would I have more feminine features? Would I have lived a more fulfilling life? Would I be happy?

There are so many what-ifs that I'll never have answers for. And it makes me sad... Sometimes I don't know what to do, except move forward with my life today.

It fricking sucks knowing I can't have that time back. I feel robbed of my life. And it sucks. I hate it.

But I'm glad that things are changing, that people will have the choice I didn't get. That gives me hope. At least future generations will have the ability to decide for themselves if they're trans. I'm glad about that.
I'm honestly fearful for all of my American trans sisters and brothers. Still not perfect but in the UK being trans is a protected characteristic under hate crime laws along with sexual orientations and ethnicity or subculture.

Even so I wish there had been at least some education about lgbt+ when I was in school.
If there had been I'd not have suffered and tried to take my own life so many times before finally being clued up not just on lgbt but exactly what it means to be transgender and that I'm not a monster nor ""broken""
I‚Äôm against the idea of teaching a kid this or even introducing this same as bible in school I feel as a parent you need to educate those situations. I love the gay community and have no issue with my kid asking questions or even being gay. What I don‚Äôt like is a group and I mean any group telling someone what they should feel or think and this goes across all fields.
The ""Don't Day Gay"" bill reminds me of an action in 1992 NYC on a very similar matter, where a provocative activist group, the Lesbian Avengers, handed out balloons that had ""Ask About Lesbian Lives"" printed on them.    

A four minute video from the [action](https://youtu.be/dzIbGdP7MDQ)
If I had been taught that shit in middle school I would have 1) transitioned earlier and 2) feel so much less gross since I wouldnt have discovered being trans was a thing by stumbling across porn
I think things would‚Äôve been really different for me. I probably would‚Äôve started pursuing transition in high school or college. I didn‚Äôt realize transitioning was a real thing. My only exposure to trans people was transphobic jokes in film and tv, and my family making fun of Chaz Bono. And a little later we started entering the cringe and anti-SJW era or the Internet, which I now realize was mostly just making fun of trans, gay, neurodivergent, furry, etc. folk. If I had seen celebrities who were trans or text books with photos of average trans people, and if I had known about the possibilities then I probably would‚Äôve realized that my feelings were actionable. 

Same thing with sexual/romantic stuff. Maybe I would‚Äôve gone out with those cute possibly bi boys who I now realize were repeatedly flirting with me in high school. Even as someone who has an explicitly homosexual person in their family, gayness seemed like a different universe at the time. Prior to adulthood, there were only a handful of people I‚Äôd ever met who were out of the closet, and they were both the stereotypical gay man and lesbian, and simultaneously social pariahs. So like, if I saw the wide variety of ways gay folk can be then maybe I and the undoubtedly many other queers in my high school would‚Äôve felt empowered to be ourselves. 

Even beyond gay stuff, I might‚Äôve been more sexually open if I had been told that sex other than PiV sex is cool. Like, if I had been told I didn‚Äôt need to penetrate my partner just because I have a dick then maybe I would‚Äôve been more amenable to the idea of having sex. 

There‚Äôs a lot of ways that people could benefit from even just a little more education. I know I could have, and I‚Äôm positive that I‚Äôm not the only one.
In the UK LGBTQ+ stuff wasn't able to be taught in schools until section 28 law was repelled in 2004 when I was 14. So I had no education on queer people, and I wasn't good at the internet I did come out to myself when I was 19 but put myself back in the closet when I found out how hostile people here are..... Then I came out properly in 2019....when hostilities towards trans people is far worse. 

I am lucky that I have a fairly feminine face but I still get started at a lot...
whats the context on said bill? i havent heard of it yet (i am european)
I never hid who I was. I got beaten and spit on for it, but I never hid the fact that I was transgender. I think that having an education including trans awareness would have at least made me feel less like an alien. I just never thought that I fit in at all.
Yeah I didn't figure it out til I was like 27 cause I just didn't know the options. Would've saved myself a lot of misery if I'd been informed earlier.
Hey I passed my style off as emo too back then, yet I am transitioning now days. Thought I was the only one who did that hehe.
I was raised Jehovah Witness and learned early to not talk about ""those feelings"". I barely knew how to put those feelings together except that I thought good would kill me because of them. I wish I had proper education and maybe I could have started transitioning earlier in life.
If I had actually been taught (properly) about LGBTQ+ it‚Äôs not an exaggeration to say that my life would have been drastically improved. I probably would have realized I was trans way earlier. I also could have cleared up my confusion with my sexuality sooner. 

I literally think about it all the time how if someone in an educational/therapy setting asked me the ‚Äúbutton question‚Äù at a younger age my egg would have immediately cracked. Just like we screen kids for all aspects of their life, physical, mental well being etc, there should be a ‚Äúscreening‚Äù for gender dysphoria. I had all the signs but didn‚Äôt put it together because I had to discover it on my own.
Sorry that I haven‚Äôt been paying attention but what bill?
honestly would have been amazing for me and a lot of my old class mates, would have created a more accepting enviroment, and i would have started questioning my identity sooner, that is assuming the best ofc, it would have helped me a lot
Well, I was actually taught about trans people in middle school. At age 14. We saw some documentary about it. But it took me a further 3 years to realise that I was trans, after I got in the same class as my now best friend who‚Äôs also trans. I had a lot of signs of being trans but I never pieced it together before meeting someone else who was and hearing about their experiences
I've struggled with mental health since I was about 6 years old, pretty much when I realized people were forcing me to be a girl and the entirety of society had their back. I was defiant about dresses, the color pink, marriage, etc. I came to resent femininity as a whole and became toxic to my lady friends who began to explore overtly feminine presentations. I was around enough good people to cut that shit out, but the wound remained.

Only at 30 years old did I realize that nonbinary was an identity. I spent more than two decades filled with resentment and pain that could have been entirely avoided if that was presented as an option. I probably would have been more comfortable with people different than me (feminine people). 

I was always confused because I never wanted to remove body parts, and that's the story of trans people I was sold. ""Being trans is when your body doesn't match your brain,"" said my trans male best friend. I fully believed him in the name of solidarity, but that narrative kept me stuck in no man's land for longer than necessary.

The growth of the trans conversation during COVID has saved me from a lot of hate. It needs to happen. Queer people will keep existing, whether we acknowledge it or not, and the sooner we accept that reality, the healthier society will be.
I would be sitting around. Depressed, wondering what was wrong with me. 

Did the bill get passed?
they're passing a bill that makes it illegal to talk about LGBT people? pardon my ignorance as I'm out of touch with politics (for good reason), but if that's really it then that's fucking hilarious.

the party of ""free speech"" finally mobilizing and limiting free speech when they don't like it. how long do you think it'd take until the ""I'm standing up for our oppressed rights!"" crowd finally starts building labor camps and throwing minorities into them under the guise of ""degeneracy"" or ""protecting the country"" or whatever nonsense?

my god it really is like Lord of the Flies out here.
the only reason my school has ever brought Lgbt in a positive light, was the fact they were legally required to.
I'm really happy for you. My story has a lot of parallels and I totally agree with you. Had there been better LGBT, emphasis on the T education when I was younger it would have saved me decades of misery.

I hope we can get it right for the kids that are just starting now so they don't have to go through all of that.
I‚Äôm wishing for a positive teaching of people who are different to accept them or shall I say us gays crossdressing and transgender all of us our bodies are for us not others to tell us how we should be
I'm just getting started at age 23 and didn't start properly asking the questions I needed to until I was freaking 20 for the same reason. I pretended I was a girl online for a couple years before this and never made the connection. I just had no idea trans people existed. First I ever heard of it was Jenner and... I have a lot of negative feelings about her that I'll set aside right now, but- yeah my exposure was limited. What's worse is I grew up in a southern conservative town. Boys were gay (which in that town was a bad thing, they felt) if they wore a pink shirt even once. The only reason I even thought to try was because my friends in college put me in a dress and it just... clicked that something was so, so right about it.

Had there been education, I'd have been able to start teaching myself how to pursue my transition even sooner. Mom still wouldn't have approved and I'd have still had to escape that damn town, but I'd have probably started at least a couple years sooner.

Education is essential.
Lots different.
I can't say whether I would have realized I was trans significantly sooner, but there at least would have been *a chance*. Maybe knowing that there were *options* would have led me to idly question just out of ""curiosity"", and maybe I would have realized ""Wait, that...sounds kind of nice, actually?""
I would just have figured out that I liked men, women, and enbys way earlier than I did. Never really cared about who I was attracted to, I just got attracted to people. As for my gender, I probably wouldn't have lost the one person I've dated that I aftually loved because of misinformation, and I would have figured out my gender like, 2 years earlier .
Such a disgusting fascist bill
As I'm still somewhat new to the LGBTQ+ scene I had no idea what is/ has happening/happened in LGBT politics. Had no interest in it, regular politics much less. So I did some looking up on this and holy hell. I'm horrified by the thought processes of some of the more prominent Republicans.

That being said: I would have been able to start exploring this part of me much, much, MUCH earlier in my life. I had known being transgender was a thing only after Kaitlyn Jenner was the big name in media. At that point I still didn't understand what it was. Until recent years it was still so alien to me. Until transgender rights advocating was really being shown in media, I didn't understand the jealousy I held for the girls in my school growing up, my sisters, and other women I had in my life.

I've had multiple thoughts of attempting suicide growing up because being dead was better than hating myself, seeing a stranger in the mirror. But as the years went on and I felt more and more ashamed of who I was. I forgot about it. I forced myself to play a role. So much that I ended up repressing my identity crisis and essentially forgot about my feelings. I still had the dreams though.

Last year my egg cracked, I don't know what caused it, how it happened, but I started remembering all of these repressed feelings.

I wish I had known sooner.

But...
If I had, I wouldn't have the greatest love in my life, my son. I wouldn't have the friends I do now. I wouldn't have the most supportive and loving partner I've ever had the joy to love. And if transitioning much earlier in my life meant losing what I hold dearest in my heart now,  no thanks.
I thought the bill was going to be killed like the last time? I haven't heard of it getting any traction in The house or Senate outside if the same small group that supported it the last time?
I didn't knowingly meet a trans person until I was 28 when a girl at my work came out. My egg cracked 3 months later, meeting Zoey saved my life, it snapped me out of that disassociative fugue state I had lived in until then. If I had known earlier I wouldn't have missed my life up until now.
Gonna throw my story on the same pile of ""(a few months before) 22 wasn't a bad age, but 15 would have been a lot better"", because that's basically what my story was too.
Well since I live in the UK where it wasn't discussed but everyone accepted that queer people exist no I don't think education on LGBTQ+ topics would've helped me what would've helped me is instead of being forced to learn pythagoris theorem which I never did learn because it confused me and because my country's response to neurodivergent kids is to stick them in a special school where they learn primary school level maths in their 3rd year of high school learning about my country's history would've been much more worthwhile since I'd actually remember that but no instead we were taught about the evils of the British Empire abroad and absolutely nothing about the evils of the British Empire committed against it's own people and yes of course the evils of the British Empire abroad is important to learn about I never learned about how the English soldiers butchered Scottish civilians based on nothing more than a suspicion that they were a rebel which guess what a lot of the time the English soldiers did suspect a peasant farmer to be a rebel so what they'd do is burn down the peasant's farm leaving them destitute if they were lucky if they were unlucky they'd be killed or arrested and tortured the English's hatred of the Scots was unleashed on full display during the Jacobite Rebellions
I feel like there is still a distinct lack of education around the LGBTQIA+ community. I was doing research around the trans community and only JUST discovered that being born with another genders brain ISN'T just a metaphor, and is actually how the brain develops. I feel if we had this education ready in classroom environments there would be more acceptance around this beautiful community and less drama about small niches in the wider community.
I would've known I was trans
Had this been a thing that was taught at young ages, I would have been able to start doing stuff about it back in 2nd grade when I first started experiencing these feelings. 

I think it‚Äôs a great idea to teach about it before there are the effects of puberty that make transitioning so difficult at later ages. And any part of the process that happens when you‚Äôre a kid is completely reversible, so the ones who mistakenly think themselves to be trans can just stop at any time and just continue on like nothing happened. This would help many LGBTQIA+ people and would not cause any negative effects for anyone who is cishet.
Very disappointing to hear about this. I have not heard of this ""Don't Say Gay"" bill until now. Like you, I would have known I was trans much earlier if I was simply educated on the subject. I would have been transitioning for at least a decade by now if there was proper education on being LGBTQIA+. Your story brought up a repressed memory of mine. Despite going through a journey of skepticism at the same time, I also found a website full of spells and attempted to use them to change my sex. You would email them and ask them to preform a spell for you, and I begged them to please turn me female, even if only for a day. I guess in a way I got my wish, just a little later and with far more time and energy üòÖ
I was told in middle school, public education early 2000s, that you cannot change your gender or like people of the same sex or gender.
The school shunned and frowned upon individuality.
I lost many friends from self harm and suicide due to such a negative stigma around it.

I feel if LGBTQIA+ topics were discussed and supported in schools I wouldn't have had to mourn the loss of so many of my friends.
I probably wouldn't have waited till I was in my 30s to transition out of fear of being murdered, beaten or disowned by my family.
Still to this day my childhood upbringing effects me with internalized issues that will take years of therapy to overcome.

The people I work with and clients that I interact with don't treat me with nearly the respect that I believe I would recieve if they were raised with a level of acceptance and understanding of LGBT+ issues.

I wish for a better future for all kids in this country. It's the future they deserve yet some butt hurt politicians would rather see LGBT folk dead or suffering physical and emotional trauma than create a healthier nation for everyone.
I probably would have known I was a man earlier. Growing up I never quite thought about my gender very much, part from being annoyed at how different I was treated from the boys just because they said I was a girl. I knew of trans people but the few stories I heard didn't match my own experience and so it didn't occur to me that I was trans. 

I've lived a pretty turbulent life, bouncing around from work to work around every 3 to 6 months for most of my young adult life and never really had the time or energy to reflect on my gender and identity. It wasn't until I was almost 30 that my life settled more down and I had interactions with people that forced me to take a hard look at myself. And I fought against it because of various reasons. It wasn't until I by pure chance joined a few non binary groups on Facebook that I found people with similar experiences. It changed my world. 

I'm now 32, turning 33 this year. I've legally changed my name, working on the papers to change my gender and have an appointment with the gender clinic in May to hopefully start T this year. I wish I had known earlier. Cause thinking back I have suffered from dysphoria all my life, I just didn't know it. And it's also probably the reason for my lifelong depression. 

I'm also asexual. I thought I was broken. Again I knew about asexuals but the only info I could find was that ace people are repulsed by sex. And I don't fit in there either. There really needs to be better education on lgbt matters cause that can help someone like me not feel broken and damaged
Same ‚Äî most of my life was spent saying everyone calls me a boy, so I must be a boy? Guess I‚Äôll just suck it up and make the best of things. I simply didn‚Äôt know that I had any other options. 

I don‚Äôt think my sex ed was particularly anti-LGBT (I grew up in CA in the 90s) but I don‚Äôt particularly remember trans people being a topic. I‚Äôm not sure if learning more would have helped any ‚Äî I suspect figuring it out in high school would have been too much for me ‚Äî but I wish I had learned more about the topic at an earlier age. Maybe I would have spent more of my life actually living.
I tried to kill myself at least a dozen times before I was 16. I'm from Omaha and the extent of knowledge I had growing up about transitioning was 1.That I was probably going to be stuck as a boy forever. And 2.That if I somehow magically transitioned, I'd end up a gross punchline of a sick joke about a ""chick with a dick"" or ""dude dressed like a lady"". The only reason I began to understand why I'd always known I was in the wrong body, crossdressed, stuffed my shirts, tried on my mom's clothes, etc, is because I figured out how to clear the internet search history and would continuously google ""I want to be a girl"" when no one was home. I remember reading articles about a young Kim Petras and thinking, ""yeah, I'm just like her. I'm not broken and I'm not a monster"" just the sheer knowledge that other trans people existed was enough to quell my most self destructive thoughts. Education matters, and kids are confused as hell sometimes due to plain old lack of education on these subjects. All this legislation that lawmakers are trying to push is just so disheartening and I feel that in the majority public eye, us trans folk are still in the ""it's just a decision"" phase, implying that we are all just cis people actively choosing to be trans. UGGHHHHH. The world pisses me off.
I'm so happy that you ended up being able to be yourself and not have to worry that you aren't 'normal' or whatever. But it pisses me off that people just don't educate their kids or students about this kind of stuff, and even (like with this bill) ban the topics from being discussed altogether. I was so scared and confused when I was younger because I had always known I was a boy, but my family was Christian, I live in the South, and it was hard to find help. Luckily I had some great friends who educated me and helped me be who I am today. 

This bill absolutely disgusts me and makes me want to puke. Especially with so many people supporting it. (TW) Do they realize that this bill will probably end up causing a lot of LGBGTQ+ kids to commit suicide because they felt like you and me did - alone, scared, confused, and hurting?
I had no idea that nonbinary people existed for most of my life. I knew for most of my childhood that I ""wasn't like most boys"" but I also didn't feel like a girl so I had no idea where I fit in. It probably doesn't help that my first exposure to trans people was through pornography, so you can imagine what my perception of the trans experience was. I could never see myself like that, so even as I got older and learned more about trans people I still didn't think that could be me. I had a period of time where I described myself as ""90% man"" and I wonder if things would be better now if I had known what nonbinary means back then.

I also had no idea people could actually be asexual. I just thought I was ""more mature"" than my peers because I didn't get distracted by sexual attraction, when it was really that I didn't even feel sexual attraction. I even had someone in high school call me asexual once, although it was from a position of ignorance as they compared me to an amoeba, and it took a long time for me to separate that experience from the concept of asexuality because I had to educate myself.

As a nonbinary educator, this bill would almost certainly mean the death of my involvement with the public school system. I'm just so nervous that the mere act of asking students to use they/them pronouns for me could lead to conflict with some parents. I have a few contacts at the school district so I can talk to them about options, but I don't want a misguided bill to ruin such an important part of my life.
One thing first off, can you elaborate on the 'don't say gay' bill you mentioned and on how/where it's possibly passing? I'm not familar at all- üôÉ

I agree wholeheartedly though. If I had trans-positive information about trans people from a young age and it was just common knowlege, I would've gotten to start actually *living* already. I was an egg for such a long time;

\- I 'pretended' to be a girl on omegle all the time for no consious reason, though I probably rationalized that 'oh most people don't even talk to men on this site so I have to say F if I wanna talk to anyone' even though most people I ended up talking to were horny and talking to people there wasn't always the most plesant thing.- every D&D character I've ever played as has been a woman- I tended to play female characters in games- My friends were categorizing our group into Naruto Akatsuki members in HS and I got Kisame because I like water powers a lot, but I hated 'being' him (I rationalized it that I don't like his character), and I asked them if I could be Konan instead, even though they already assigned another one of us to be her because she's a girl.- I then proceded to COSPLAY Konan for Haloween that year- I joined an RP discord server and my character was a girl, and they assumed I was a girl bc I apparently type like a girl, and that made me happy. I invited some IRL friends to the server too, and told them to not tell them my name or that I was a guy (because I wasn't, little did she know- haha).- I straight up had thoughts for a couple months in like freshman/sophmore year of HS that were straight up 'man my life would be so much better if I was a girl' and 'geez it would be so awesome if I could be a girl' and 'wow I wish I could be a girl that'd be so great'. And those thoughts only faded away when my emotional plate filled up more and I had less space to think about it.

The exposure I had to trans people was t-slurs in anime, and my friend dated someone one time who came out as transmasc and he told us about it (but I never connected the dots). Besides casual transphobia and awful exposure that I'm sure I was exposed to but have no memory of, that's it, that's all I can remember.

Then when a content creator I liked a lot (Eskay) came out as trans, I was like 'yo thats awesome!! I'm happy for her!' and then the next several months was a very very slow and gradule ""wait-""

I don't have much memory of my childhood, but had I been exposed to trans-positive info and been educated about trans people as they are and not the shitty stuff like t-slurs in anime and stuff, I probably could have come out much sooner. Not that I know for sure, but possibly even when I was in the single digits.

That would have changed my life. I won't go into it, but I feel Existential Dysphoria really fucking hard. Shit sucks :(

*(*[*the idea of Existential Dysphoria is explained here by the Gender Dysphoria Bible*](https://genderdysphoria.fyi/en/existential-dysphoria) *(amazing resource go read doesn't matter if you're trans or not))*
As I am a knowledge whore, I would have loved to learn about this far earlier. Knowledge shouldn't be shunned because some people disagree or don't like it.

I didn't really take good care of myself, or care in school, I half assed everything (except my personal interests). I even dropped out like 3 months before graduating highschool cause I couldn't be bothered, and I was completely apathetic towards basically everything and everyone. In the last ~6 months, after coming out as nonbinary, and then realizing I'm a trans woman, I've taken so much better care of myself, mentally, physically (maybe I'm still a little lazy), emotionally, hygienically, etc. I feel better as a person, and I started actually caring about life in general. I can't imagine how much that could have changed me to realize earlier on, idk if all of these are directly linked, but thinking about the doors I closed because I didn't care and was generally unhappy is saddening. And if I came out as trans earlier maybe I my life would be completely different.

Learning about LGBT+ is literally life changing for some people.
I completely agree. Finding out certain things are options only open the door for those who are already inclined to do so. Finding out writing with you left hand doesn't magically turn right-handed people into lefties. At most, they'd try it once and realize it isn't a good fit. Same goes for gender and sexuality. There might be a handful who try the new option briefly, and realize it doesn't fit them. For sexuality, that might mean a date/one night stand/or just imagining what it would be like. For gender, it might be a new haircut, new clothes, or at the very worst (and lowest percentage) medical transitioning before realizing it was a mistake. But that, along with forcing yourself to use you left hand when you are right-handed (or vice versa), comes down to some other factors, just as the small percentage of detransitioners are still mostly trans people forced to detransition due to social factors (left-handed people forcing themselves to write with their right hand to avoid punishment/ostrization/etc.). But even then, the vast majority won't even try out 'writing with their left hand', because they know that isn't who they are. 

For me, I didn't know trans men existed until my mid-twenties. I had heard all the awful, transphobic rhetoric about trans women growing up in a fundamental christian religion/conservative area. And I believed it. I never understood why anyone, let alone someone born with the body type/anatomy I always wanted, would want to be a woman. I had convinced myself that most women were basically resigned to their fates, because that's how I felt in my body. But then I found out trans guys existed. Suddenly, I didn't have to be resigned anymore. I could get the deeper voice I always wanted. I could gain the same muscle as cis guys working out as much as I was. I could grow facial hair. I could have a flat chest, or even a penis, the smell of a guy, the internal body heat of a guy, and so, so much more stuff. Stuff I always wanted, always saw that I SHOULD have, that my brain expected to have. And once I saw it that way, I could easily see how trans woman would want the same but reversed. The same way I finally understood that women, cis or trans, were just as comfortable in their bodies as guys are in theirs. It just wasn't the right fit for me. I finally got to write with my left hand (metaphorically, in this case). 

If I had known earlier, I still likely wouldn't have been able to transition much earlier. The house I grew up in...it never would have happened as a minor. And the only way I left was by joining the military, which also isn't the best environment. Still, knowing earlier would have improved a lot of mental health issues for me, just knowing transitioning was a future possibility. We can't go back and change our past. The only thing we can do is make the present and future better for those who come after us. This bill would do the opposite of that, and deserves every bit of opposition and criticism it gets. More, to be honest. I always thought it was pretty ironic that the 'right' are rarely ever on the 'right side of history', either in the present or when looking back on the past.
Cool so more people might have the possibility of ending up dead or in the hospital several times from people tryin to kill them. Happened to me. All happened in high school. Went thru 6 before I found one where I was just a nobody rather than being tormented, punched, stabbed, drag by my book bag from a running vehicle...having my arm broken and my jaw dislocated and called every name in the book.
And never had one teacher on my side. Was it cus they were scared or were they just as fucked up as the kids I went to school with ..guess I'll never know LOL
100%. they should be held liable when bad things happen. I wouldnt doubt we see a rise in suicide. Especially with the other bill that wants to check students genitals before allowing them to play sports. 

Though we all know, theyll blame those suicides on being LGBTQ rather than their own ignorance pushing people off the ledge.
>but are fine with dead kids

they love dead trans kids! what are you talking about?

less people to be disgusted with is obviously what they want.
100% where I'm at rn. I really feel like I got cheated out of the last 20 years. I really wish I could go back and relive them as a woman, or even as a trans woman with the knowledge I have now. :/
Hard same. My trans education was watching Ace Ventura at 9 years old, and it shoved me into the closet for 26 more years. I‚Äôd give almost anything to get that time back.

I wonder every day what my life would have been like if I‚Äôd had access to the resources trans kids have today. Taking them away is ignorant, irresponsible and cruel. Those kids will still be trans, they just won‚Äôt realize why everything in their life seems lifeless and empty.

It‚Äôs child abuse, pure and simple.
Sounds like a good idea until you realize Gathering a strongly hated population into a small building is a recipe for hate crimes and arson etc. tis a shite world we live in
Haven't multiple countries tried this before with black people and white people?
I ran for a few years in being asexual too. Eventually realized it's because I just wan unable to come to terms with using the equipment I was born with. Why would I want to have sex with these bits? I don't even want these bits. 

Now I feel like I'm stuck with a sexual awakening while transitioning. Just doing everything 10 years too late.
Something that helps me is to remember that just because my brain is done *growing*, it never stops *changing*. I have PTSD and that hope is what keeps me going. I'm a better person than I was last year or 5 years ago even though I'm a full-ass adult.
omg im crying! Im glad my post has helped you so much! i wish you the best in your journey :)
Same here +10 years... *sigh*
Exactly!
How is a bill like this on it‚Äôs way to getting passed in present day?
I agree with your general sentiment but I think the logic starts forming cracks when you get into the details. 

When we put queer kids into context, they exist whether we teach them about themselves or not. 1 in 6 children in the US are facing child abuse regardless of identity. That number gets bigger with queer kids.

So, more than 16% of school kids have unsupportive families right out the gate. More than 16% literally do not have guardians that will teach them much of anything. So society *does* have a major role in the education of themselves & their identity. Society has neglected that role, and that's one of many reasons why queer kids have hard lives.

In other contexts, that can apply to black kids who feel out of place & not understanding why, or even positive things like encouraging the trades or STEM or teaching empathy and social conduct. Kids need society to fill in for the failures of their families, regardless of how we feel about interest groups. 

I know you support the gay community as a concept and I think you were alluding to keeping religion's values out of the classroom (which I completely agree with). But I've seen this kind of logic used against the queer community as well, so I think it's important to look at that.
lmao its insane how many of us have gone through a lot of the same stuff!
A bill that would ban education/talks regarding LGBTQ stuff in school
Passed the house, i believe
it passed in the house, if im not mistaken
wtf that‚Äôs a total breach of privacy letting them check KIDS genitals. wtf is wrong with this country.
>Especially with the other bill that wants to check students genitals before allowing them to play sports.

What the actual hell.
it‚Äôs already bad enough going to the doctor for the yearly check up shit and having them look at your dick you never wanted
Correction- They love dead trans kids, they don't care if the kid is cis.
Feels!
Ah but you see the cruelty is the point. Conservatives need someone to oppress in order to feel good about themselves. Now they're even going after the Furry community.
i did not think about that. maybe school officers and stuff? we have those in normal schools here anyways
Because we live in a world of immoral sadists who only act on impulse
Well said.
The right wingers are the real pedophile cabal and are just projecting it on LGBTQ/leftists/etc... via conspiracy theories to shift the blame from themselves.
TLDR: a lot
Yeah we don't want to start on the rabbit hole that is ""what's wrong with the United States"" unless you have actual days to burn. It'd be far easier to list what *isn't* wrong than what is.
I will say that when I first heard about this I thought they meant like literally having them drop their pants in front of some gym coach and was terrified, but I'm at least thankful it's not that (of course this is still a trash idea tho). Last I heard, they just want a doctor's confirmation or a letter or smth that the kid is indeed a girl/boy and that they're not being ""brainwashed"" or smth by their parents or on hrt üôÑ
I remember learning this, god it still makes me wanna puke
There is no way this will pass Constitutional muster.
yeah my bad
Sadly schools with police on site have higher rates of incarceration and police brutality for black and POC kids for infractions that white kids get detention for and the queer community isn't exempt from racist attitudes that fuel the school to prison pipelines.

We shouldn't have to all be the same to get respect and honestly it'd just set kids up for failure once they leave school and their hit with all the homophobia from people who liked us better when we segregated far away from them.
Just make it a secret gay school we will send invitations to all the gays via pigeon
Unfortunately they're inefficient as it is. It'd probably be worse
I mean they‚Äôre standard in every school, but that‚Äôs not gonna stop a legion of inbred dudes from states you‚Äôve never heard of from converging on the school and overwhelming the 3 police officers. It would be impractical in our current society, lgbt clubs should be a standard practice tho
true tho
I'm trying to think, fuel prices maybe. Though that is slowly cooking the planet so maybe that's wrong too? But yeah, most of the essential things in the US are a bit a dumpster fire.
yay i love the gay pigeons!
Ah, an educational coo."	soerrg	trans	1309	0.99	2022-02-09 14:22:32
I‚Äôm starting to realize the outcome of me being trans	"I‚Äôm 17 (MtF she/her) and realized I was trans 2 years ago and came out to my parents about it a year ago. They were extremely resistant about the idea but thankfully my mom came around and generally accepts me. My dad on the other hand is a closed book to the fullest. I don‚Äôt want to explain more than I have to but he is extremely transphobic and homophobic towards me as a result. 

I talked to them a bit about wanting to medically transition and while my mom was open to the idea my dad was furious. They both got into a heated discussion about it and eventually they decided to decline me the care I needed. My mom just abandoned me there for my dad because she felt it was the right thing to do for the general good of the family. I understand her sentiment but I just feel so betrayed because of it. 

Everyday I resent them more and more for how they treat me from not using my name, misgendering, and turning blind eyes to every scenario possible. I‚Äôm almost 18 and about to set out on my own but as I‚Äôm starting to get my stuff together I realize more and more that why I‚Äôm doing and what I need to do is something that they would never approve of. I seek my independence from their unforgiving behavior and am starting to realize the consequences it will create. They always yapped to me about family and doing what‚Äôs right but from what I seen of them they only look out for themselves. 

Now that I‚Äôm looking out for myself and my identity they are becoming increasingly more hostile towards my abandonment of their beliefs and I know it. They wish for nothing but what they want but I won‚Äôt let it happen. I deserve to create agency for my identity and my life as who I am in my own way. This abandonment will leave me without a family, inheiretence, money, or relationships but that‚Äôs a sacrifice i‚Äôm willing to take. They never supported me and I know they never will but I know that I have to do this for myself. I have to do it for her."	"Right on.  You‚Äôre the one who lives your life, not them.
This is a powerful ode to liberation. What you have recognized  I believe is a gift. Not that many of us find the ability or good fortune to be able to stand in complete naked, transparent, and unflinching solidarity with our true self for all around us to see. 

The relationships around us reshuffle as we become aware of the true meaning of love and we recognize who loves us and who doesn't. Because to truly love is love without ulterior motives, to love one not for what they do or how they fit into our lives, or what they do for us, but for who they are. 

This seems simple, but when we are not being our own authentic self, we are unable to recognize all the relationships in our lives founded on falsity, or all the ways convince ourselves that we are loved even by those who really don't love us at all. We are a bit like the King of Rohan with our eyes covered in cataracts and evil voices of ""loved ones"" whispering in our ears what we feel and who we are.

When I cane out as trans, already most of the family relationships I had had melted away. Shortly after, I lost the last one. Don't get ne wrong, I did some of the pushing away. Being trans is kind of a superpower. 

It snapped into sharp focus the idea of the dark side of love that this person dwelled on in the way the hay treated me for so many years! I saw them for who they are! 

I like this song by Palace Brothers ""No More Worhorse Blues"". The workhorse is the perfectl metaphor for the person who lives their life for others until they change their mind and realize they must live their own life and throws off the yoke of their work to be ""a grazing horse...a racing horse...your favorite horse!"" Everyone's musical taste is different and although the musical zeitgeist of the early 90s raw indy voice and guitar may not be to your liking, I hope you can hear the lyrics. I will post this elsewhere.

 I hope you forge ahead becoming you, strong and lovely and super powerful. You are loved and will be loved. You have the unique gift of recognizing how truly alone most of us really are. Love is real when you feel it from here.
If you have known this for two years. I don't imagine that this will ever go away. She will never leave you, as she is you. 
Take care, be careful this is a long hard road. Keep an eye on education as you move through this as it is a powerful tool to give you the resources to be successful with everything even your transition. 
I wish you a peaceful transition.
Unfortunately, this is a reality many of us face. It's difficult, but we get through it, and we build families of choice along the way. That said, I will give you a bit of practical advice as I've been where you are before. 

1. You're about to turn 18. It is important to prioritize your transition, but it is also important to prioritize your next steps into adulthood. Are you planning on going to college? Do you have somewhere safe to live and some money saved up? The freedom you will experience when you leave your parents' house will be wonderful, but you'll also need to prioritize your safety and wellbeing (insurance, housing, a phone, etc.). I know many people who made the decision to not totally disown their parents until they were completely financially independent. It did not keep them from being out to their friends and colleagues at college, and it kept them safe until they could provide for themselves 100%.
2. Some parents come around. Some never do. I am completely no contact with my father. There will come a point where you may have to say ""I cannot accept this type of treatment and therefore, I will not spend time around you unless your behavior changes."" For me, it was valuable to be able to say to my father, ""I have warned you of these consequences and your behavior remained unchanged."" And then... our relationship was over. And I was free. And honestly? It's better than I could've ever imagined.
3. Which brings me to this point. Right now, everything seems so big and so scary. And in many ways, it is. But please believe me when I tell you, your life will contain so much more joy and love than you could ever dream of. You will meet so many wonderful people and find so much peace in getting to live more fully into yourself and get to know the young woman that you are. The work you are doing now will pay off, whether it is preparing for college or beginning to calmly set boundaries with your parents. I wish you the best on this journey, but seriously, it's not all gloom and doom. It's gonna be okay- it's gonna be better than okay- it's going to be really, totally wonderful.
You know who they truly are now. Pretty sad and disappointing to realize. Still, you will always go further with the truth. Go for it young adult!üíï‚ù§Ô∏èüòä
I am not sure if it helps; but quietly asserting your right to ownership over your own body is a part of becoming a woman, and its a stressful time for cis and trans women alike. Sure there are unique challenges to being trans, but there are also unique challenges for cis girls. 

My point is, find reassurance that what you‚Äôre going through is unfortunate and scary but normal, and if you approach it as such it will get easier for folks around you to accept you. People (even parents) respond to confidence. Keep your cool, don‚Äôt give them the fight they want but keep your focus and go toward what you want. You‚Äôll get it ü•∞
This is so relatable did our parents get a ""unsupportive course"" or something
Good on you for realizing this. I turn 30 in a few months, and after going no contact for several years with my parents, I tried so hard to make things work, but absolutely nothing changed with them after 5 years of no contact with a 2 year reconnect. I finally blocked them yesterday, and this time I know it is the right call, and today I feel free. Some people are absolutely capable of change, but it is not your responsibility to manage them, and your health is the most important in your life. 
You deserve to be respected, and treated nicely! I hope you have a good day! c:
It's terrible that so many people have to give up their families just to get proper medical treatment, but as much as it hurts, it will be for the better. They are selfish, and you deserve happiness. ‚ù§Ô∏è
Make damn sure you can fully support yourself (food, shelter, utilities, job) and have an external support network (friends willing to, say, let you crash at their place for a month) before you burn that bridge. Take what your parents are willing to give you, hold love and forgiveness for them in your heart without compromising your boundaries, and be prepared to live your truth! You are you, and nobody can take that away from you.
Insert* ""you do it for her"" lyrics -steven universe
I‚Äôm proud of you, girl. My dad was/is also a homophobic and transphobic POS, and I was nearly twice your age when I started my medical transition: still loving every minute of it.

Like you, I lost all support and chances of inheritance: I currently live in a camper and wait tables @36. The comfortable life I could have had came with too many strings attached, and I would rather be a poor trailer park girl than a middle class repressed ü•ö.

Follow your heart, and live your best life. Also capitalism must be destroyed.

If you disappear for a while after you turn 18 it‚Äôs possible your mother will come around.
Good for you. Live your best life, sis. 

If parents can‚Äôt support who their kids are, the kids aren‚Äôt going to stick around.
Absolute goddess mentality ü´° 

I‚Äôm really sorry your parents are transphobic. That sounds agonizingly difficult and I wouldn‚Äôt even begin to know what to do in your situation. You are an incredibly strong woman. She will prevail ‚úä
Your situation is sad but not uncommon.  In the end, you'll have to live the life you desire....one that fits you best.  Life is really short and being happy cannot be undervalued.  There's hope you'll find peace with your parents.  My experience was similar to yours but because my parents divorced long before my transition they didn't have their own marriage to save.  Mom was supportive and dad was not.  I pressed forward and did what I knew was best for me.  Fully transitioned......including work etc.  Everything worked out over the course of some years.  I have high hopes it can for you as well.   If possible, try not to be too angry with your parents.....they'll need time.  In the meantime, begin making your plans with the assistance of anyone in the right places to help you.
I am on the same boat. However, I‚Äôm almost 22 in two months and still live with my parents. I‚Äôve been out for 4 years and medically transitioning for nearly 2. In the meantime of trying to get accepted into a job and doing what I can around the house, my family makes my transition about themselves. That I‚Äôm ‚Äúselfish‚Äù and that the entire world doesn‚Äôt revolve around me, and if someone declines to call me my preferred name and pronouns, that‚Äôs ‚Äútheir boundary‚Äù. Any boundaries I make regarding to being respected gets thrown out the window. I either have to submit to being called my deadname and ‚Äúshe‚Äù all day, or resort to unnecessary drama all because of a fucking name and pronouns. My mom is trying to come around but resorts back to deadnaming and misgendering, it‚Äôs a frustrating cycle. 

My advice is apply to as many good paying jobs as possible. Save up and move out when you can.
You have to pay attention to that hostility. That is the dark side of love right there. That is the true face of their love, a self-serving love betrayed. The veil is lifted and maybe the first time in your life, they are showing you a deep essence of their true self, maybe the most sincere thing they ever showed you, next to the joy they expressed when you most perfectly matched or exceeded their expectations. 

But I think it's important at the same time to see it with some compassion and some hope and to not mistake it for the totality of their love. They may change. Limbic creatures detest change and will fight it tooth and nail, but some of us are also eventually capable of being human.
If youre in the US they are legally required to have you inherit 1/3rd of their money if you are their next of kin.
so much love and strength to you. ‚ù§Ô∏è
You are such a strong woman
I'm so sorry you are on this situation. I came put at 45 completely independent and kind of had the same reactions. Mom not comfortable and dad rejecting. Eventually my mom came around but dad is stuck in transphobia. My mom is avoiding to take much sides and ultimately she lives with him. If I had come out at your age I would have had the same situation that you are having plus violence. 
It's sad to realize you are losing them more every day but in the other hand you are working on your own happiness. You won't be happy without transitioning, so you better understand what lies ahead of you. ü´Ç
I'm so sorry you're in this situation. I'm in something similar. My parents are less outright hostile, and I""m older, but it rings true too. Please, when you are able to get out of there cut them out of your life and don't look back.

Your family sucks, but it won't be the same. You will make a new one. You'll find people that actually care about you and make you feel happy. People call the concept a found family, but regardless it's real. <3

PS: Make sure you have your documentation, like your ID and birth certificate, any money you have earned, and anything else with you just in case. Some people can be cruel. And that their names aren't on any accounts you have. If you have a bank account as a minor I believe you have to have a parent/guardian open the account with you.

Good luck. You'll be able to be yourself soon enough. <3

Been there, good luck on your journey, it's a difficult one, but definetly doable!

Quick tip: make sure the place you move to can be set as your homeadress, otherwise your parents will get your post, and can use this against you.
I‚Äôm so sorry man. Goodluck, do it for yourself. People who truly love and care about you for you will come around.
Same lol
Same lol
You're already so self-aware and that's a great start! I'm really hoping you have somewhere to go at 18, because I wouldn't live with them 1 minute more than I have to. For them to deny you that is cruel at best, these are the types of parents that claim to be good parents but then wonder why their kids don't talk to them. Trust me, this is tragically more common than it should be. But you've already got a great head on your shoulders, I know you'll do great out there! And once you find a space of your own a massive weight will be lifted from your shoulders. Hang in there!
are you me? this is my exact situation, ages and everything. i will read the comments religiously
I get that feeling. No family or friends close enough to call that.
That's so strong of you, I could benefit from a fraction of the guts you have üíúüôèüèª
This post gave me a lot of hope. I‚Äôm also seventeen, and in a nearly identical situation where my parents don‚Äôt accept me, especially medical transition. My parents have the same dynamic as well. I‚Äôm FTM not MTF but I‚Äôve never related to a post more. You‚Äôre not alone OP, and I wish you a lot of luck. ‚ù§Ô∏è
do it for her!! YES!! i‚Äôm so sorry this is happening, and i‚Äôm so sorry it‚Äôs such a relatable and universal experience for most of us. i‚Äôm wishing you only the best for yourself!
Thank you for making this. I'm in a similar position and christ this made me feel like what I'm doing with myself actually makes some sort of sense haha. I'm still getting used to being me and this really did help me. I wish you the best of luck, and seriously thank you for making this. I'm sure I'm not the only one who needed to read this. Just remember you're never alone and that you're also a total badass in my eyes :)
I legit had to look my father dead in the face and say, ""you either accept me as your son and stop your shit, or you can bury me in the ground and have no children"" course I was 21 but it still hit him hard and made him think about what I ment to him.
I'm sorry to hear that :(
If it's of any help, I'm a trans girl about to turn 17 and dms are always open if you need someone to talk to üíú
Happy cake day
Thank you, I appreciate the kind words.
Wow this is a beautiful comment.
This is really good advice! Prioritize your education; it will make transitioning much easier and will make it easier to find other trans people and sources of support and found family.
This comment is so beautiful, I love this community so much
Thank you for saying that. I will admit the journey ahead is gonna be pretty rough but I‚Äôm willing to accept whatever comes my way to secure my happiness.
I can‚Äôt describe how much it pains me to have to live into my older years and look back on a childhood I never had. The fact that all of that was denied from me and actively so, hurts so much. I feel like if my dad could, he would be actively more violent towards me being trans but thankfully the laws are a thing. I just can‚Äôt shake the feeling that I have to inevitable live with all this baggage that I feel no one will ever be able to truly understand.
Delete this shit.
Am nearly 40, the only thing that hit me like a rock is how sweet my life is without kids.
I think he‚Äôs just transphobic. And this comment is generally pretty dumb.
Op is the only one who decides if they have children or not. Pretty simple right?
You're so very welcome.
Thank you üôè

It‚Äôs an overwhelming generalization based on your personal experience. Some people have kids in their twenties. Some people have kids in their teens. Some people never have kids. Some people choose to bank sperm in their twenties because they‚Äôve fully and seriously considered the kinds of family planning they want to do. Some people just wing it. Some 18 year olds do what is best for themselves. Some 18 year olds make big, stupid choices. Any post that generalizes about what everyone does in their 20s is a pretty dumb. Don‚Äôt you think?
I briefly went through your profile history/comments and noticed you casually dropping slurs such as the f slur and the r slur. After a dumb comment like this i had to check and now im curious why are you even here?
Based on what you're saying op would already be familiar with this concept so ... What are you adding to this conversation? Rather than just distracting from ops valid points by implying they should sacrifice their mental heath for their parents opinions and biasis. And your own opinions and biasis.

We need to talk about Arkansas...	"I've been trying to escape this state for years. I always end up back here. I've always hated living here, but now I simply HATE the state itself.

I'm currently trying to transition MtF. I have a very close friend here who is FtM. My best friend has a non-binary child and a FtM child, who both struggle with anxiety and depression.

Arkansas has already overridden the veto for trans care on peoples under 18 years of age...now they are trying to pass a bill so teachers can be protected while refusing to acknowledge a person's preferred name or gender!?!

As much as I want to raise my voice and fight against this bigotry...I just want to disassociate with this state and get out. If these bills say anything to me, it says this is going to be one of the most dangerous places to live as a trans person. I wish I was rich so I could just move my friend's family, my trans friend and his grandmother, my wife, and myself out of this awful state.

What are some of the most trans-friendly states in the US?"	"The preferred name thing is so asinine and is very discriminatory considering how many cis people have a preferred name; Michael-Mike, Matthew-Matt, Caitlyn-Kate, or even people that prefer to use a middle name instead of their first name. 

I am not in Arkansas, but the bills they have been passing truly anger me and give me concern about other states that may try and use these as framework for their own bills.
I think the most trans-friendly state is California, though any majority democrat state is (usually) friendly to trans people (which..hmm...very weird how most anti-trans states are Republican...)

but yeah, fuck Arkansas. at this point I hope that backwards cousin-fucking hellhole of a state crumbles.
I've heard Washington, Oregon, New York, New Hampshire, Vermont, etc are great. I used to live in FL and a lot of the people are awful, but esp around Orlando there's pockets of huge acceptance. Also they have great laws for legally transitioning, its one of the easier states. I just hope the Republicans never realize that's the case
Maybe, any state is better than Arkansas? But yeah, getting out of deep red states would be a huge help. The GOP is pushing this anti-trans b.s. nationwide, so expect similar garbage bills showing up wherever Repubs are in power. (at least for the next few election cycles. I just don't see this anti-trans junk as the big election winner that the right hopes it will be).
I'm sorry you and your friends are stuck living in that state. I just want to send you all some love from the north, and I hope you find yourself living somewhere that deserves you.
I mean NY is a good place, i havent had that much discrimination against me, and it also has the most socialist legislators, as well as we just legalized merryjewwannas, and im here, and ill totally give you a hug.

**Colorado** has lots of legal protections for trans people. I (enby they) live with my husband here. Trans medicine is covered by insurance. I'm out at work. The **Denver** area and also Boulder are very trans friendly. The biggest general cons of Denver are cost of living and air pollution; there are also racism issues here, but perhaps not as bad as some other big cities. I find gender neutral bathrooms more in the city and nearby towns as far as Nederland, CO. The schooling here supports trans and non-binary children, but I don't have personal experience with that. 

Feel free to ask questions - I'll try my best to answer or provide websites to relevant resources
California and Colorado are two good ones
If you‚Äôre looking at California, look at areas outside the Bay Area and LA/Inland Empire. Their cost of living is too high right now. Colorado is similar. Denver is a little too expensive as well. However, there are plenty of good options on both coast, so do some research and you‚Äôll find a better place.
My (MTF) spouse (AFAB, NB) and her daughter (neuro diverse, LGBTQ questioning) got out of Arkansas years ago thanks to their ex-husband. They escaped to Connecticut. It's the only good thing to come from that marriage, and we're grateful every day. We can't imagine what their lives would be if they were still stuck in that hellhole. 

We need an underground railroad for trans babies.
In 2021.
What the actual fuck, Arkansas?
Arkansas is worse, but Iowa doesn‚Äôt seem far behind. I too hate the state I live in. I‚Äôm actively looking for employment outside of here so my girlfriends can secure trans health care for themselves. I‚Äôm lucky, my private insurance is ran through Michigan. I‚Äôm covered, but I‚Äôm willing to give that up and move with them for a better life where we don‚Äôt feel hated for being us. 

But if I have to give that up and move to somewhere like Chicago, Denver, or the dream of California then I‚Äôll do that, I‚Äôm not abandoning my friends or letting them abandon me. 

It‚Äôs not only that, but the active transphobia we see when trying to date‚Ä¶ we‚Äôve just had enough. You win bigots, the scary trans people are moving.
Northern Virginia

We have the legendary Danica Roem protecting us.
Lucky for you, I am also from Arkansas and have good news. ACLU is filing a lawsuit which means the law will remain unenforceable until some higher action is taken. Speaking of course in reference to HB1570 (SAFE my ass)
Washington and Oregon are good,  though I'd describe Washington as gay and Oregon as queer. Keep in mind though,  they're starting to develop fire seasons with super bad air 1 month out of the year. I'm talking the states' air looked like the Mad Max opening,  maybe worse. So if you have health concerns, east coast may be the way to go.
I live in PA and never had an issue. Maryland and Virginia to the south are very friendly as well. With any of these 3 states they have their red part and blue part. Choose the area carefully. 

I am sure their are friendlier places but this is where I know. Philly, Baltimore, DC areas don‚Äôt seem to take issue with us.
Massachusetts has a clause in its state constitution that prevents laws that cause anyone to be treated as a second class citizen. And this has been used to fix all sorts of LGBTQ+ issues here. It was used to legalize gay marriage here years before it was nation wide.
I would also like to know
I live in CT and it's very trans friendly.

I've heard good things about Delaware. Great nature and cheap housing, plus no tax shopping. :D
I live in Wisconsin (Madison specifically) and it's great. My whole City is super chill and the UW Health system is amazing regarding trans healthcare and transitioning issues.
I live in Denver and apart from random shitheads that live everywhere its been very accepting for me. I'm still very early in my transition and the places I frequent have all been very good at using my preferred name and pronouns.
Are there any pockets of liberal cities or counties?  I live in Kansas, and while there are plenty of assholes, there are also places that are very progressive.
I live in Minnesota and my wife is mtf. Helped her get her permit and driver‚Äôs license last year, and they didn‚Äôt even question her when she asked to have her gender officially changed. Says female with the state now. And we were married back in January and they let her change her ‚Äúentire‚Äù name (first, middle and last) without question. We‚Äôre a little bit outside the twin cities so there is ‚Äúsome‚Äù stigma out here, but people are too busy making money and living good in this state to really care. And if you live ‚Äúin‚Äù the twin cities, especially Minneapolis, it‚Äôs an LGBT haven. Jobs pay good out here, and if you stay just outside of the metro or anywhere rural the cost of living is incredibly cheap.

But probably the best experience thus far was when she got her first speeding ticket. The officer looked at her license and called her ‚Äúma‚Äôam‚Äù the entire interaction and was extremely respectful. This happened on a rural highway going to Brainerd. Since she moved in with me not once have I worried about her safety, and my health insurance through the Union is going to cover a lot of the cost of getting her back on hrt amongst other things.
You need to escape that place, Hon. Arkansas is the home of the KKK. That says a lot about Arkansas.
If we are talking about the Midwest. Minnesota is still pretty good for trans folks. Unfortunately it‚Äôs surrounded by hateful assholes. So there‚Äôs that‚Äôs. In general the west coast and northeast are the most lgbt friendly states in general.
Come to South Australia, we'll be very glad to have you! I hope things work out for you and your friends m'lady
I‚Äôd check this out to get a better idea of which states are safer: https://transgenderlawcenter.org/equalitymap

TLDR; these states have the most legal protections for trans people: California, Oregon, Washington, Nevada, Colorado, Minnesota, Illinois, New York, Vermont, Maine, Rhode Island, Maryland, Connecticut, New Jersey, DC

Arkansas had a negative rating, along with a lot of the southern states. 

I can personally vouch for California, I‚Äôve been living here since I came out and started transitioning and haven‚Äôt met any medical or legal resistance. Some things have been pricy (the court order to change my name and gender marker was over $400) but the legal process itself was simple. I‚Äôm about to move to Minnesota to be closer to the accepting side of my family, so I hope this map means things with be just as simple there. 

I hope this helps some, and I hope your friends and family can find a safer place to live.
This Wikipedia page gives an excellent state-by-state rundown of various legal rights for trans folks. https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transgender_rights_in_the_United_States

The west coast is generally going to be your friendliest option. I‚Äôm personally targeting a move from Michigan to Seattle. However, I will say that Michigan has excellent rights regarding trans healthcare. I was able to start HRT without any unnecessary gatekeeping via the University of Michigan, which has a superb gender health services program. https://www.uofmhealth.org/conditions-treatments/transgender-services
I agree this place is become terrible in all honesty the entire US is becoming something of a shit show! I also live in arkansas being GF myself it scares me to think how people would react seeing me more feminine I've gotten to the point I dont want to go out in public feminine even with people who support me by my side in fear of being attacked but ive already bought a house and can't leave though desperate I am so ive decided to help our community in any way possible! Im gonna start protesting and educating others in hopes to make a better future for my lgbtq+ family!
[Check out this article](https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/2020/06/19/the-best-and-worst-states-for-lgbtq-people/111968524/) \- I don't blame you wanting to leave Arkansas. Those bills are direct hit jobs against our community.
start a YT channel addressing How shit and transphobic these states are, then if you earn enough you can move states
I am m2f and moved out of Arkansas just a few months ago.  I knew it was transphobic, but I did not realize that they were the leaders in transphobia.  

I recently came out on FB, and everyone seems to be trying to understand, but they are still insisting on using the wrong pronouns and dead-naming, and supporting parts of this legislation.  

I probably will not be going back for any visits due to all these hate laws.
I live in northern Maryland and it's pretty chill here from what I know but it's expensive
never left this state but from what i know, maryland is a good place
Come to Massachusetts! Boston is so full of gays we're like a giant extended family - ""oh you know so-and-so? That's my roommate's friend's ex"" 

Pride is nothing but dodging exes at Govn't Center every June 

In all seriousness, I hope you're taking care of yourself. There's not much I can do to help (already sent a few emails) but I'm sending as many good vibes as I can from the east coast :(
Well it might take a bit, but realistically none of their bullshit is going to last very long. They will be challenged in court and ultimately we will likely win, but I would definitely still get out of a deep red state if I financially could. The problem is, blue states have way higher cost of living which is why all the rich suburban Republican bigots and old people stay there.
Maryland is pretty good with trans folks. (stay out of pg county. and the more rural areas.) PG is just where a lot of the sport legends and their families come from for some reason, so if one thing leads to another then a trans person could get their ass beat here. I‚Äôd stay in Howard County, maybe Columbia. It‚Äôs pretty pricey, but the quality of everything is amazing there.
Ugh, I also escaped a red state, and it was such a relief. A few years back my grandmother suddenly thought I should go back and kept pressuring me to do so, and I seriously was a mess about it. It's not hyperbole to say I have lasting trauma from living there, not to mention from moving elsewhere and having people constantly ask where I was from. These days I still find myself being elusive about where I grew up. It's really bad.
Colorado is a much better place if you need to go somewhere
Colorado is fairly safe. If you want as mush protection as possible, go for Boulder. It's known as one of, if not, the gayest town in Colorado. But it's kinda expensive to live there cause it's a college town. Just don't live in Aurora. It's expensive and not super safe. Arvada is good and so is Louisville. Golden is also great! Make sure to do research on where to live.
Wichita Kansas is actually pretty good with the people. I haven't experienced hardly any hate. We have a legislator who is mtf (and happens to be the wife of my therapist). Kansas in the rural parts is dangerous. And our government is also happily passing bills similar to Arkansas.

All of this terrifies me. I started my transition a year ago, at 46. My depression is gone, and I finally have what I've always wanted, or am at least well on my way. The other night I had a full on anxiety attack. I was crying and shaking uncontrollably for an hour. All I could think was ""I'm finally happy, and they're going to take everything away from me""

These politicians have no idea how harmful these bills are. Or they just don't care, because we are not real to them.
As a friend from next door, I agree with you, and I wanna get out of here too
I‚Äôm in the Chicago area and we‚Äôre pretty friendly. We‚Äôre also an informed consent state so you don‚Äôt need to involve any doctors to get HRT. It‚Äôs definitely not as cheap as Arkansas though. I lived there back in the 90‚Äôs and was able to pay my bills working as a carhop. Can‚Äôt do that here.
you don't have to be a hero. leave if you can.
They're trying to pass a bill to allow teachers to be protected while not using someone's preferred name or pronouns?

My temptation to straight up delete Arkansas from the map is rising fast.
I suggest Iowa. We're pretty safe here, and we don't have any rules against bathroom usage or our rights being restricted. [Laws regarding schools](https://educateiowa.gov/resources/legal-resources/legal-lessons/equality-transgender-students) are pretty trans-friendly here, and there's plenty of places to set up HRT through. It's pretty rural out here, so there's not much danger of being attacked for being trans. I live in one of the bigger cities more toward the Wisconsin and Illinois separation, and it's been a good place for acceptance of LGBT+ rights. Apartments over here can be a little expensive sometimes, but if you find one that's pet friendly it's usually cheaper.
NJ isn‚Äôt that bad in the Trenton area.  We aren‚Äôt really supportive more then we just don‚Äôt give a fuck what you identify as.  In saying that I mean we don‚Äôt care what you want to identify as because it doesn‚Äôt affect us.  I‚Äôm still ‚Äúin the closet‚Äù with my family but that‚Äôs because I live with my 80 year old huge bigot of a grandfather.  Though my aunt is lesbian and I have multiple friends who are gay/trans/queers.  I mean Hopewell Valley Regional School District has a lgbtq club for middle/high school students.  All that said most of the state is very pricey
I‚Äôve lived in Arkansas for over twenty-five years now, but I‚Äôm originally from TX. There are many well-deserved stereotypes in AR, but it‚Äôs not fair to paint the whole state as ‚Äúcousin-fucking‚Äù trans-phobic rednecks. Certainly, there are many insensitive and self-righteous people here, just as there are in other places; however, Eureka Springs, AR  is one of the most trans-friendly towns in the entire county. There are also a few cosmopolitan areas in Arkansas like Fayetteville, etc. 

I‚Äôm a life-long cross dresser and more transgender now.  I enjoy a Female-Led Relationship in which my wife is the acknowledged head of our household. Her happiness is paramount, but I‚Äôm not her slave. She was born and raised in Arkansas, and has come to accept my feminine inclinations and dress. I support her and contribute to the household income, plus I take care of most of the domestic responsibilities. She appreciates my support, sensitivity and my desire to defer to her decision-making authority. I don‚Äôt flaunt my femininity in public (probably would not in any city or state) but I do present my femininity in subtle and submissive ways in public, which anyone who looks closely enough could realize. Most people don‚Äôt care one way or the other. Even her mother who is of a much older generation is comfortable with me wearing my nightgowns, etc when we visit her. I don‚Äôt detect any adverse judgements on her part; in fact she has fun sitting around with me in the evenings and mornings having a ‚Äúgirl party‚Äù and it all seems normal. Neither my wife, nor her mother knew this side of me when we married. I think living anywhere is what you make of it as long as you‚Äôre sensitive to others - it goes both ways. 

As far as the politics, I‚Äôm more libertarian and not a fan of governmental intervention in our lives. The governor of AR is trying to convey that he too is not a fan of governmental intrusion into our personal lives. He just doesn‚Äôt want minors making unilateral decisions about SRS, etc., without the due diligence, consent of parents, and medical and psychiatric professionals. It doesn‚Äôt mean that a minor child cannot move forward with transition if the parents agree. And teachers should not have to fear a lawsuit for not using a student‚Äôs preferred name and pronoun; however, teachers should be as kind and considerate of transgender students as with anyone else.  Government legislation is not the answer to the way we conduct our personal lives, as long as the way we behave doesn‚Äôt endanger others.
Come to the west coast! Oregon, Washington and California are pretty great depending on the area (always gonna be best near a big city) I think Seattle has been my personal best experience and I have lived in all three states. But that is Seattle proper, there is a lot or red rural Washington that isn't as accepting
I‚Äôm very nervous about these bills showing up here in Wisconsin. The republicans almost have a 2/3s majority in the assembly and senate
>but yeah, fuck Arkansas. at this point I hope that backwards cousin-fucking hellhole of a state crumbles.

So much this. My mother brought me here as a kid. I detested it then...and I have left a few times as an adult. My wife's family is from here, which is the most recent reason we returned(2018)...and we've regretted returning since.

I am now the last person of my own family still in this state, and it hasn't been for lack of trying. If I'm being honest with myself, I carry a bit of resentment toward my mother who just up and left to be near my sister saying, ""I never saw myself staying in Arkansas forever."" (Really? But you were okay basically dragging your children here, kicking and screaming?)

My biggest concern with Cali is cost. I always wanted to go to Colorado when I was a kid. I have family from there and always dreamed of living there as a kid, however cost of living is growing there as well.

For being in a bottom-feeder state, these concerns become much greater, considering jobs here pay diddly-squat, so trying to slide to basically any other state requires much more savings and preparation than otherwise.
Can confirm, I just moved to the Bay Area and it‚Äôs everything I could‚Äôve wished for. I‚Äôm no longer alone, and people on the street don‚Äôt seem to question me every time they see me, like they did back home. 

Also fuck Arkansas, all my homies hate Arkansas
Lifelong WA resident here. Washington is *excellent* for us. That and don't forget our almost unfair amount of natural beauty.
I live in Washington and yeah it's pretty great overall. Unfortunately, I'm in a pretty conservative part of Washington, so that sucks, but it's not conservative enough that we are denied healthcare
My dad is homosexual and lives in West Palm. I consider all the time living near him...but it is such a red state in some places, it still becomes truly terrifying to me at the thought of just going from one hateful state to another.
MA isnt bad. MN southern part actually has a really decent community too. MN was  **first** U.S. **state** to outlaw discrimination based on sexual orientation and gender identity in 1993,
My dad is homosexual and lives in West Palm. I consider all the time living near him...but it is such a red state in some places, it still becomes truly terrifying to me at the thought of just going from one hateful state to another.
There are several states that are trying to be worse, though.
The best! But it's an expensive place to live.
Just because they want that doesn‚Äôt mean you have to do that. FYI. 

Your life is your life, careers aren‚Äôt predetermined by your parents.

I‚Äôd say get the hell out when it comes to college. Apply out of state to wherever you want (Just make sure it‚Äôs a welcoming state to us) and never look back. 

Of course visit if you‚Äôre on good terms with your parents **and** it‚Äôs safe for *you* to go there.
Also I currently live in the South Bay and there's way more conservative people here than one might think. I rarely get gendered correctly at my work and I'm pretty positive some of it is intentional. Half or more of the people at my office voted for Trump
I was actually thinking of something similar, kind of a mashup between the underground railroad and the houses from ball culture. There could be an app that helps organize the whole thing, with the intent of finding people to provide lodging on the way up, somewhere to stay until you get situated, and perhaps even find housing, support services, and jobs once you've transplanted. 

It would have to be focused on families and people old enough to go out on their own, though, and moderating it would be hella difficult because human trafficking.
Denver is nice. I live here (i also have another top level reply with details)
They‚Äôre trying though. 

See PA HB972‚Ä¶

I'll second PA in the Philly area. Philly's actually a big destination for trans folks, since it gives protections, has a decent number of healthcare options (the admittance lines are getting longer, though), there's still affordable places to live, and most people are quite agreeable.

That being said, the roads here suck, the PPD are very racist, and (as u/Elizabeth-The-Great notes) the state legislature is a big turd.
[removed]
I think about this all the time. My FtM friend in Eureka Springs agrees to do a YT channel with me. I will be starting my HRT soon, hopefully...so I fear it may be some time.before I'm comfortable enough to be in front of a camera.

My wife and my temporary solution is to be in the Fayetteville and Eureka Springs area, which is the most trans-friendly area in Arkansas. We have family and friends there too. 

This would hopefully be a easier means to escape the state, as I may actually be able to work in the field of my degree, unlike where I am currently located.
I identify with this so much! I'm so horribly embarrassed about the state and town I'm from, that when asked I tell them, ""I'm from all over.""  Which isn't completely wrong. Moved around a few times...but always in red states...and I've always wished differently.
I'm actually scratching my head....wondering if you are my literal friend and family practically next door.
Just copy me to a new folder before you hit delete.
Similar thing in SC
I mean NC is already pushing a similar bill (just 21 instead of 18) through, and it's 69/51 republican/democrat so it's likely to pass, and if it passes in NC it's likely to sweep into SC as well
I‚Äôm also worried, if Arkansas gets away with it, Utah likely won‚Äôt be far behind. I want out of this cesspit of religious conservatism for many reasons, but at least I guess they‚Äôre mostly the passive-aggressive kinda bigots instead of outright-aggressive. Small comfort but there‚Äôs probably worse places to be trans, even if here also sucks.
I'm in Wisconsin myself and it's getting scary.
I always feel bad thinking about leaving bad states because then it just lessens the number of people available to fight against the bullshit legislation, but when something as severe as this garbage pops up, it might just be best to dip. I've been sticking around Utah and doing what I can do advocate for trans rights where I can. There was a bill like arkansas I think but it failed here fortunately, so there's still hope. But also I think Utah is starting to trend blue according to some predictions
For what it's worth, I think Colorado is actually quite progressive.
The problem with states with ok people is that they are expensive. You could try Vermont.
I hear NM is pretty decent on the trans-rights front. They have informed consent HRT from what I hear, anyway, so less bullshit medical gatekeeping hoops to jump through.
You could try moving to New Mexico, it's pretty trans friendly especially in cities like Albuquerque and the cost of living isn't too bad
Yes yes San Francisco area is really lgbtq+ (I want to go to Cal when I‚Äôm in college!) 

I live in SoCal, in a more suburbs area and there‚Äôs more republicans and conservatives here than the big cities of California, but it‚Äôs still really accepting. I had a couple trans classmates :)

For sure. Luckily my area had a good little pocket thst protected its insiders but everyone else was so hateful and insane. Southern FL is just complete trash honestly, and the north and panhandle gets the same way.
Hehe, Utah.
I don't see it as a state thing. This is a GOP trying to keep a slim tiny winnable majority thing. There's nothing grassroots about ""HEY LET'S ALL FREAK OUT ABOUT THE TRANS IN BATHROOMS NOW!!!!"".
[deleted]
Weird. I get the occasional strange look up in Redding but I have no real problems so far.
Yep. I know. But the people here are nothing but supportive. Unfortunately the State Legislature are republicans and the governor is Democratic... the state is hugely divided thanks to the urban centers in the state. I highly doubt it will pass... nor more restrictive measures. I kinda feel like the bill is a fuck you to the governor who did everything in his power to turn this state blue last year. My kids schools in a have trans and rainbows all over them. For reference I live in central pa and have lived in Philly. I am so surprised at the support my kids have even in this rural part of the state. For reference my daughter is gay and her school was very supportive. My kids are also mixed race... There is an entire gay community in the school. So much diversity in a little town... very surprised how welcoming this place was. 

I believe (don‚Äôt quote me) PA Republicans are some of the only ones at federal levels to vote pro LGBT (at times)
The whole situation sounds terrible
Oregon and Washington are two of the best states to be trans in
On the east coast, northern VA, MD, and Southeast PA are all pretty good.
I wish you the best of luck for the future and I hope to God you get the body you desire! Godspeed rebel
Wait, are you me? ""I'm from all over"" is my go-to as well. We lived in some cool places until we moved for the last time when I was 10. The worst thing is, we moved around for my dad's education, but ended up going back. So i was born in the shitty state too. Of course my cister was born in a really great, progressive state, and but she lives in the stupid state still, and has no intention of leaving.

Ugh.
I wish, but I'm from next door statewise
Same like utah looks nice from a state park standpoint but I can handle how conservative the state is
Well, Utah already has the House Bill 302 trying to ban trans athletes. They were already on their way down that road. Arkansas just beat them to it. I‚Äôm with you though, I‚Äôm getting out of here as soon as I can.
You must have spent your time in Denver, Boulder, and/or one of the ski resorts.
ish. There is a bit of an independence streak in coloradoans, which helps progressive issues when the answer is to keep laws from being created. There are also good blue strongholds as well, but there is a good mix in the state.
Can confirm the Burlington area in Vermont is pretty supportive. That being said, it absolutely is expensive and getting a decent full time job is one hell of a struggle as a younger person.
This is actually a huge surprise to me. My homosexual father and hsi homosexual twin sister grew up in the Roswell area. And they talk about the absolute fear they had/have of anyone there ever finding out...

Then again, that was around 50 years ago, so that probably makes a big difference.
I have lived in the Bay Area all my life, and no one blinks when someone is LGBTQ. It is wonderfully diverse ethnically, culturally, weatherwise (don't like the weather? drive 20 minutes), and foodwise. That being said, we have a housing crunch, and it's expensive to live here. I wouldn't live anywhere else, though, unless you can't afford it. That's why we have a Plan B for retirement: house in Portland.
thank you bot
Surprisingly the Governor seems to be less transphobic than the legislature, so that's nice.
Very true. This is a Republican thing and it's a problem in Republican dominated states.
Also, you can own a house in a state you don't live in. get an education, get out of your state, rent the house in arkansas out to someone or sell it. My parents have the same plan for me with their place in newhampshire, but I'm **not** living in the sticks my whole life. I'm considering making it a family vacation house, where any member of the family, aunts, cousins, etc. can go and stay in the mountains for a long weekend, bring any friends they want, and we all share the cost, making the upkeep minimal/a shared responsibility. That way the house stays in the family, like my parents want, but I don't have to be tied to it
I've only really experienced this in my work place, whenever I'm going about my business and in the public everything is pretty great so I wouldn't say it's the dominant culture in the area by any means, just that there are pockets of conservatism like this. And even in the office it isn't terrible, I haven't had anyone say rude things to me, just the passive aggressively misgendering and occasionally deadnaming (I think mostly it's not intentional but I also know that sometimes it is definitely intentional).
I figured as much, but it gave me a good laugh realizing I don't know their reddit usernames.
I lived in the Denver/Boulder area for about 5 years.

If I ever retire, it is currently at the top of the list of locations.
Yeah, actually Portland, Oregon is another one like that."	mngndz	trans	789	0.99	2021-04-09 12:59:28
"umm... so I just found out my ""dad"" is trans"	"I just wanted to share because I'm not really comfortable talking to friends about it. He told me this morning while eating breakfast of all things. Apparently he has been identifying as a woman for 10 years (since I was 5) and I always felt that something was off. (I've always known him as a man.) He always kept his private life when i'm not around very vague (my parents are divorced.) I asked him if he would like me to refer to him differently and he said I could call him whatever I like so I guess I'll still call him dad? I don't know. It's weird to think of my dad completely differently, but of course I support him. He said he has no plans to transition so things will stay the same for a while I assume. I love him and I want to support him but I don't know how to navigate this. Any tips or advice? (I'm 15m)

&#x200B;

Edit: I talked to her this evening and she shared some new things with me. She does not always present as a woman, but when she does she would rather be referred to as such. Otherwise, she doesn't care at all. I'll make sure to come back to this kind subreddit in the future if I have any more questions or concerns. Thanks so much to those who helped me deal with this. It's been a rollercoaster of emotion that was sprung upon me and I never expected that the caring words from strangers on the internet could make such a difference."	"As a dad who may one day come out to his kids, I would say this: Be supportive in whatever way you can. If you are female are there ways you can encourage him, with a mother/daughter dynamic? If you are male, are there things you two like to do together that are not heavily gendered? Just don't pull away. That is my biggest fear with telling my kids. That they will never speak to me again.
I good place to start is to practice using she/her pronouns when you talk about your dad. Maybe you can also call her your parent instead of your dad, that's a bit more neutral.
I'm not sure how much you know about being trans but [this website](https://genderspectrum.org/) is a good place to start.

I don't know if the pressure to keep it hidden was from within, from your other parent, society, or more than one of those things, but here we are, now.

Your dad is in a fragile place right now, doesn't know if you'll be fully accepting, and really won't put pressure on you to do anything or call him anything else unless you put forth the idea yourself, probably.

So, when you think you *are* ready, put forward the idea yourself of practicing she/her pronouns for your dad, or look up some alternatives to ""dad"" which are more feminine or neutral that appeal to you, and maybe choose one together from a list.

Thank you for sharing, and thank you for seeking advice.
if she identifies as a trans women then she is a women, her saying that you could call her whatever was probably a way of saying I don't want to force you into this.
-Zero
Well calling your dad with she/her pronouns might be a good start.
I always thought it'd be fun to fuck with people by saying ""she's my dad""
I would just say as a reminder to appreciate the trust and vulnerability your loved one just showed you, that was probably such a scary thing to do.  Nobody wants who they truly are to cause them to lose connection with those they hold dear.  Your parent is probably still figuring a lot out, I appreciate that you came to a friendly reddit like this for advice, it's really heartwarming to see.  I would say don't expect them to have their identity all figured out, and just trust them when they tell you what they do know about themself (theirself? idk lol!), and be rooting for them in the process!

I also wanna add the reminder that you're still their kid, and figuring out things too.  It's not all on you to nurture your parent in this time, but just appreciate also that you are able to have a role model in self-honesty and emotional bravery yknow.  It's pretty tight imo.  Best wishes to you both.
Hi, OP,

I‚Äôm MtF and a father of four. I waited till my children were all grown before I transitioned. Oddly enough, when I told my son I was trans and that I was going to fully transition, he answered, ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs about time, Dad.‚Äù It turns out they had known since they were little. 

I say this as a long way of saying just to keep loving her. You‚Äôre off to a great start by asking questions in non-judgmental ways.

Should she eventually transition, do take into account things like calling her ‚ÄúDad‚Äù in public spaces. 

Best of luck to you!
My kid (6yo) still calls me dad. I don't mind it. I told her if she wants to call me something different all she has to do is say so. I went this long (started transitioning 8 months ago) as her ""daddy"" Im not even all that keen to not be daddy.

I did tell her though that I really do *feel like* a mom. Always have. She's the best though. She loves telling friends and teachers etc ""my daddy is the prettiest girl!"" so.. it's complicated lol

I can almost guarantee if you are supportive in other regards, sticking with ""dad"" won't be that problematic for her. The real important thing you should discuss if nothing else is what words are safe to say in public. That's kinda her call. It's a safety thing.
I came out to my kids about two years ago. For the most part they have been supportive. They still call me dad too. I pretty much do the same activities as before. The only real change is my hair, makeup and wardrobe. My kids are 14-28.
So wait, is your parent MtF? Or FtM?
Just remember, your Dad loves you and trusts you. Be his (now her) rock to rely on. People all have their paths in life...as long as you two are still family and have a good relationship,  that's what matters - whether he is ""Bob or Bobbie"".
Hi! Im FTM and my dad is also MTF however my dynamic is much different. I would recommend by starting to referring to her as she/her, you can still call her dad but she might have said you can refer to her as whatever as she was probably scared you wouldn't accept her. Try thinking of ways to make your dad more comfortable, maybe encourage to go shopping for feminine clothes and go with, have her get her nails done, maybe some makeup or hair stuff too. 

She may just be scared you don't accept her. Show her that you do and love her very much.

I wish you the best!
sometimes some trans folks dont wanna feel like a burden by asking you to use the pronouns they‚Äôre actually most comfortable with. i have a feeling she would probably be very happy to be called she/her, regardless of what she said (ofc i dont know your parent but i think it‚Äôs possible that ‚Äúyou can still call me whatever‚Äù is just to make you feel comfortable, which is sweet, but if you‚Äôre able to, i would recommend trying to use she/her)
I'd say have a discussion with them about their pronouns and if they'd prefer to be called dad or mom and if they still say ""whatever you like"" you could test out calling them mom, see if they start to prefer that, and if they're not sure on pronouns you could always use they/them. When I started coming out I asked people to use they/them around people I wasn't out to cuz it didn't lead to questions, it's like the safest bet imo, anyway that's probably what I'd do, wish you two the best! <3
Just keep talking. Keep those lines of communication open- they are so important. If you can keep talking, everything else will figure itself out.
First tip: You don't support your dad of you can't refer to her using the correct pronouns. Get it right. Second tip, look up resources online. Find some books to read that were written by trans women. You can probably find free pdfs if you look hard enough. Finally, do something nice for her. Ask her what her name is and bake her a little cake with that name on it, or draw her a picture, or write her a poem, or literally anything that can show her that you are willing to put effort into loving and respecting her.
I love this. I‚Äôm MtF and only out to a handful of people. I have two little boys who are under five and the biggest thing I think I would miss after transitioning is being their dad. I know I will always be their dad in some ways, but it would change in a lot of other ways if I transition. They get to be tougher with me in ways they can‚Äôt with their mom. Even today, they were drawing all over me and when they were drawing on my nipples my wife said that they definitely couldn‚Äôt do that with her. 

So maybe your dad is just sharing this intimate part of himself with you because he‚Äôs ready to share and you‚Äôre ready to understand. And maybe even if it‚Äôs foreign to him, he loves being he/him and dad with you. I always felt neutral at best about being one of the boys until I got to be one of the boys with my little guys. 

I don‚Äôt know where your dad is at, but being trans and dealing with gender dysphoria is a complex and confusing thing, so everyone deals with it in their own way. Keep talking with him about it and I bet you‚Äôll see sparks in him you never saw before even if he never asks you to use different pronouns, because you‚Äôre starting to see more of who he is deep down and in many ways that‚Äôs a she. You clearly love each other and that will continue and is a wonderful thing for your family.

You constantly look for ways to be supportive without judging while using this as an opportunity to identify the ways in which you can improve your understanding and acceptance of the world around you. We seem to have an epidemic of people ruled by irrational fears. Be the future.
I'm male and we do things that are generally seen as more ""masculine"" activities like playing baseball but I wouldn't want to stop doing that stuff :(

&#x200B;

And, hes my dad, and I will always love him/her/whatever. Things might be awkward for a little while but we'll get over it. And don't worry about coming out to your kids. I'm sure they will be understanding.
I can't disagree more.

You need to be guided by what the person wants, not what you think they should want.

This person asked their dad, and their dad said that their child was fine to keep using what they are comfortable with.

A parent child relationship is like nothing else. A parent should always put their children first and it is likely this persons dad is thinking more about their child than themself at this stage and it isn't our role to second guess them.
I guess, but I asked and he said I could call him whatever I like. I also just don't know who knows and who doesn't so...
I will obv try my best but I don't want to try to force the idea that he should be called anything other than ""dad."" Is it possible that he really just doesnt care or even likes that title? I wouldn't want to try to move him or me along to fast.
I love that idea. Like ""dad"" is just a job title, anyone can do it regardless of gender!
Good for you! Yeah, other people were saying that he might want to do more feminine things but honestly I can't see his interests changing much. I don't think he was pretending to be into football, baseball and comic books for 15 years!
mtf
Fuck you. First of all, he said he didn't care which pronouns I use and I'll respect that. I'll use them interchangeable depending on the situation most likely. Second of all, she hasn't told me her name yet and most likely doesn't have one. if all you want to do is come on here and tell me I don't care then don't come on here at all.
Well I guess just don't assume anything. Keep an open line of communication. I'm sure he just wants to still do everything with you. If you have questions, make sure to ask. Telling you was probably one of the hardest things he has ever had to do.
if your parent likes doing that stuff then it should still be possible imo? maybe tell them that that's something you're feeling and that you don't want to stop doing those things with them regardless of their gender cause you enjoy doing them with them? if it was my kid it'd definitely be something I'd want to know 

this is a little bit different cause it's siblings rather than parent child but my brother and I still do the same stuff we always do since I've come out to him cause it's what we like doing, he just refers to me differently now than he used to, so there may be some stuff that changes but there's a lot that doesn't have to as long as you're both enjoying yourselves :)
I think there is no such thing as ""masculine"" activities, just stereotypes. You can parttake in whatever you want regardless of gender. So if you identify as female you don't do baseball?  If you are scared you should bring this up, and I bet they'll be more than happy to do those things with you.  Them being happier should make your relationship better.
You know, you just said something amaizing and supportive about your parent.. i think those are words you should tell them. :3
Him her whatever? Yeah don't say that shit again. That's some mad disrespect.
Yeah, I want to respect his/her wishes as much as possibly honestly. If their wish is that I use what I want then I will. (although they did say that if shs's presenting as a woman she would rather be referred to as one, so of course I would respect that.)
She probably sed so because she's a afraid that you wouldn't accept her. I sed about the same thing to my parents but in reality I'd love if they would call me by my preferred pronouns and name
I don‚Äôt know what in specific the two of you talked about, but if you haven‚Äôt I might ask something along the lines of, ‚ÄúI know you said I could call you whatever I wanted, but what would *you* prefer? Would you prefer to be referred to as Mom and with she/her pronouns? If you would prefer to be referred to with feminine pronouns/words, it may take some time for me to adjust because I‚Äôve always known you as Dad, but I‚Äôll try my best to use what you prefer. Also, are you out to many other people? I wouldn‚Äôt want to unintentionally out you to somebody who doesn‚Äôt know.‚Äù Although from what you described in the post, it sounds like your dad probably isn‚Äôt out to many people.
That's fair enough, whatever they feel comfortable with at the time, go with that.  I know when I first started to realise that I was trans MtF, I didn't want to be referred to as she, and still took he.  Over time, I started to adopt they/them until I was comfortable enough to feel ready to use she/her.  For this reason, I've found that I've been increasingly using they/them to refer to other people.  Use whatever pronouns he/they wants at the time.

As for another comment about losing the father/son activities such as sports, transitioning does not have to mean that it should end.  I still do some of my very 'manly' activities like welding and working in the workshop on hobbies.  I just do that as a girl now.
You might wanna just straight up say ‚ÄúHey, I do want to support you in this and if you want me to call you mom/she/her I will try to do that.‚Äù So you‚Äôre still leaving the ball in their court but then they know that it IS okay to ask for that. That‚Äôs definitely not being pushy about it, that‚Äôs just making sure they know how you feel.
Yes, I've heard of parents wanting to retain their title. But it's very common to be ""rechristened"", too, so to speak. 

Don't leave it unspoken, though, just ask when you feel open to the idea of a new title. You won't know your dad's true desires until you ask. Your dad will likely not bring up these things unless you do, first.
May I add [the gender dysphoria bible](https://genderdysphoria.fyi)
I always thought of ""dad"" as more of an idea than a strictly male thing honestly
Right?!? I still love hockey and baseball.
I mean, as long as you're clear that you will love him no matter what and that really you're just pleased he knew be could tell you, you certainly don't need to dictate to him what pronouns he should use or tell him he needs to fit a stereotypical gender role.  If you want to be supportive, just tell him how proud you are and that you will always love him no matter what.
Wow, that's so respectful and kind. I can really tell you care about your transgender parent and what advice the community has to give you üôÑ bro you can get mad all you like but trans people aren't obliged to coddle you. You came to US, not the other way around. I never insulted you so get your sensitive ass over yourself.
yeah, thats what I thought. Can someone who identifies as a woman not like baseball and other masculine activities? That just seems discriminatory imo
dude idk why people are downvoting you, you're literally so right.
as a trans guy, whenever someone is like ""her/him/whatever"" i always feel like they are being real disrespectful. i always feel like they dont see me as who i am and they're angry that im trans.
It's also confusing to use she/her pronouns with a gendered title like Dad. Plenty of trans dads do j
It, but I get the confusion. His Dad has also set no boundaries, which is going to make being respectful that much harder.

That said, I would 100% advocate trying to switch to she/her pronouns until your Dad tells you otherwise.
Not necessarily.

That's literally how I tell people what to refer to me as.

""Him, her, whatever, anything you fucking want"" is my standard response.

Parents with their kids will handle this substantially different than someone in any other circumstances would.
Context clues‚Ä¶.
i'm not sure... It seems the parent did not yet specify if op should use any other pronouns when op answered [correction], ""dad"" even used ""whatever"" herself according to the opening post[end of correction]. Hence there were possibilities that she would have wanted to be refered with pronouns out of the binary, shortening those to whatever and including that doesn't necessarily have to be disrespectful towards op's parent, quite the contrary obviously op does think it doesn't matter to him which pronouns his parent will choose and no matter which then will be used. And later on parent did choose she/her, it makes sense to me to use those from that on forwards without correcting the opening post completely, as that way someone stumpling over the post won't assume everyone who answered before that change missgendered the parent.
Just keep doing what you're doing.

Your dad matches me. I want to be referred to as whatever I'm presenting as. 

My kids are substantially younger than you but they can call me whatever they want.
I would be cautious with assuming that the motivation is likely the same
He honestly doesn't have that many friends, hes super socially awkward. The only people he mentioned that don't know are my grandparents but he wants to bring it up to them soon. I'l ask tonight again whether he would like to go by she/her and see what happens. He doesn't ever like confrontation or feeling like hes making people do things so my bet would be that he says he would rather keep his present title/pronouns.
They can totally like baseball and fishing and sumo wrestling and making chili! üëç
He may be socially awkward, in part because he hasn't felt like he fits in. Also, being closeted puts up walls, in fear of being found out. That adds to the social difficulties. 

He just needs a safe space with you right now. Over time, things like pronouns may change."	tcq2pw	trans	660	0.98	2022-03-12 20:27:10
I Cut off my Mom	"Hi. This is long. I just needed to get it out.

A little background, my mother and I have always been close. We rarely went 2 weeks without talking. I've lived all over the world, and we have always kept in touch regularly. When she comes to visit (she's out of state), she stays with me. She visited in late April 2022...

She's the first person I came out to, end of April 2022. I cried and asked if she would still love me if I was a man. She cried and said ""I see your soul, I will always love you."" I hadn't come to accept that I was a trans man yet, I thought maybe NB? I started to explore my transition options (binder, haircut, masc nickname). We still talked regularly.

FF to end of May. I'm shopping for clothes and not having a great time. Called my mom for support, she says, ""you could just be a woman with short hair and men's pants."" All I could think was, No, I cant. I'm not a woman. If I needed another ah-ha moment... there it was.

We stopped talking as much, definitely didn't talk about my transition bc she seemed uncomfortable with it. She did say that if I tell anyone, I should tell them in person, its respectful.

Beginning of July, I call her. She's a couple states away so in person isn't really viable, so video chat instead. I tell her, I'm a trans man. I go by Davis. I use he/him pronouns. She cries. Says it will be an adjustment, but she loves me and wants to be supportive. In the same conversation my step dad walks in, asks who she's talking to... I get deadnamed and misgendered. She didn't even attempt to explain that I have a new name.

Throughout July, I come out to my family. My brothers and my father. Two brothers are fine, then one refuses to acknowledge it at all. Not denial but refusal. I cut him out of my life. He called our mom. Mom called me. We had a huge argument. It ended with her needing time to 'mourn her daughter'. And I figured I'd just give her space.

I told my dad 2 days later. He was surprisingly ok? Like he doesn't agree, but he'd rather have a relationship with me this way than no relationship. To him, I ""used to be his daughter but thinks he's a guy now"" (quoting my sister in law from a conversation yesterday). And considering my very conservative father... I'll take it. He at least gets my name and pronouns right. Yes, its a very low bar.

I was surprised my mother didn't call me to see how it went with my dad (dad and I have never had a great relationship), but figured she's still upset so let it go.

4 weeks and 1 day from our argument, she contacts me.

She said my dad has been trying to call me all month but I keep blocking his calls. (aside: I'm not blocking his calls, I talked to him, he has 2 numbers stored for me and keeps calling the wrong one.. I've had the same number for 8 years). And she says that she was afraid to contact me because my dad having blocked calls must mean that I've blocked everyone. And here's the run down of her discussion with my dad:

Dad: deadname blocks my calls

Mom: I don't know why she would do that

Me listening to this from her: I don't know why \*she\* would do that either... I thought \*she\* was dead, since you are mourning \*her\*.

Mom: what?

Me: You are mourning \*her\*, you said so. I'm not sure how a dead person is blocking calls.

Mom: I'm talking about you!

Me: I get that, but I'm a guy.

Mom: You are a woman.

Me: Ok, <moms legal first name here>

Mom: Don't disrespect me like that! I am your mother!

Me: Don't disrespect me like that! I am a man!

Mom: You cant make me change my core beliefs!

Me: I wish you a happy life Mrs. <moms legal last name here>.

Then I hung up.

\---

So TLDR: She said she will always mourn her daughter. And that I am a woman and cannot change that and cannot change her core beliefs. She said its disrespectful to try to force this on her and change her beliefs. I'm guessing she doesn't see the irony that she's disrespecting me at every turn.

I was wondering, AITA? But I don't think I care anymore, I'm mostly I'm just tired of her shit.

Edited for formatting."	"This triggered something within me because I recently came out as trans and have had similar experiences with my family. I am so sorry that you are going through this, it is never easy to cut off someone, especially immediate family. 

I want to tell you that I am so proud of you for standing up for yourself and setting boundaries. You did the right thing, and even though it's difficult, please stand in your strength. You do not owe anyone anything, even your mother. If she cannot respect you and your identity, she does not need to be in your life. You deserve to be surrounded by people who accept you for who you are. Lots of love from a fellow trans üè≥Ô∏è‚Äç‚ößÔ∏è‚ù§Ô∏è
You're not the AH here. I had to cut of my so called ""father"", but more a lack of question. Kinda similar like what you told. He just refused to use my proper name and she/her. We haven't talked in soon 5 years.

VERY much on your side in this. Our sides in this.
Fucking hell. Somewhere along the line she forgot you weren't her property.
I don't think you're an AH. You didn't ask her to completely come around. You gave everyone leniency and patience. And even those not accepting you, you continued to give time and space so they might eventually fully come around. Your boundary is that they have to at least try to respect you. And your mother refused that. So you cut her off.   

I came out to my dad 7 weeks ago. I asked him to start using my name and pronouns about 3 weeks ago. He hasn't yet. But he's getting a therapist to work through all of this. He keeps telling me ""I'm not ok with this."" And it sucks because he and I were close. But I always knew he was transphobic, though he of course didn't think he was. And if he doesn't come around in the next few weeks, I'll be cutting him off as well.  

I'm out to almost everyone in my life now and I'm not going to spend time with people who won't respect me for who I am. I don't care what their excuses are. By not using my name or pronouns, you're reminding me of how I was born. Something I can't control, but something that hurts to think about. I need to move forward and I need to be the woman I should have been born as. And I'm not going to play games with people who don't want to support my happiness.  

Being trans is hard enough without people being casual bigots around us.
You‚Äôre not the a**hole here. You can‚Äôt choose how they handle their stuff, but that doesn‚Äôt mean you have to just sit there and take the bull. I went through something similar with my mom a few weeks ago. They‚Äôre going to be in pain because we‚Äôre setting the boundaries we need, but there‚Äôs nothing to do except violate our own boundaries and mental health for them. Honestly kudos to you for being able to tell them that stuff over the phone üòÇ I literally couldn‚Äôt and had to mail them a letter telling them I‚Äôd only talk to them on mail for now.
You must find the courage to leave the table
If respect is no longer being served

‚ÄîTene Edwards


I‚Äôm proud of you.
Very similar to how it went with my mom, apart from the last bit where she fully denied that you're a man and refused to change her core beliefs. But I did recently hear from my older brother (who accepts me completely), that our mom had said to him something along the lines of ""no wonder he's having mental health issues with the stuff (testosterone) he's he's putting in his body."" The mental health issues are completely unrelated to my transition and are something I've struggled with for years, even before I knew I was trans, and additionally tried to get help for in high school, but my mom kept me from seeing a therapist.

Suffice to say, it added to the pile of reasons to cease contact with her. I don't think I've fully decided and/or committed to it, but it's been well over a month since I last talked to her and whenever I think of calling I'm none too eager.

Good on you for making that call for yourself. Plenty of people will tell you that it was the wrong choice or that they would have done differently or that you should forgive her, but ultimately it's your life and you should not sacrifice your happiness for the sake of someone who does not respect you. If you feel your life would be better without her in it, then you made the right choice.
I cut my mother (and soon it‚Äôll be all my family) out of my life completely years ago and I have no regrets, nobody should have to put up with being belittled, abused or whatever it is just because you share some stupid dna. I personally have much less anxiety and shit to worry about now and nothing will make me go back.
Fuck im sorry you had to deal with that. Its never good whenever either parents that aren't supportive. Whenever I came out to my mom she told my dad and then did nothing to help me. They didn't try to call me by the name i felt more comfortable with or gender me correctly. They wanted to act like I never said it
You have been patient and reasonable.

If people won't accept who you are and are happy to cause you pain and suffering in the process, cutting them out of your life is a completely valid way of dealing with that.

Maybe they'll learn from it, maybe they won't. You have to do what's right for you.

You don't know me, but I'm proud of you for standing strong.
i don't have much to add, but it was kind of jarring seeing your name because it was my deadname lmao. never met anyone else with it, its fun :)
‚ÄòMourn her daughter?‚Äô Huge red flag already just from that eesh. I hate people like that
Family need a long LONG time to adapt to a family member transitioning. It sounds like they have been pushed through their own transitions faster than they can either individually or collectively cope with. A month or so is just not remotely enough time. Hell, a couple of years at least is needed. Sadly, it sounds like these relationships have broken down badly.

For what it's worth, even giving family years doesn't ensure a better outcome. I was estranged from my father right up to his death and I'm now estranged from the rest of my family too. So happy endings are not the norm or even common.

Wishing you peace of mind with your decision to transition. That's the best you can hope for. Hugs.
>You do not owe anyone anything, even your mother.

Thank you. <3
ü§£
>And I'm not going to play games with people who don't want to support my happiness.

I keep being told that I'm choosing this. I'm choosing to be trans. I'm choosing this and making everyone else get in line or get out. \*sigh\*. 

Like, I didn't choose to be trans. I chose to start living as my true self, and you know BE HAPPY.

Good luck with your dad. I'm glad he's seeing someone. Its hard for us and its hard for them.
Yeah, I'm transitioning quickly. But I shouldn't have to sit thru purposeful disrespect just so they can have more time. I get that it's a change... but I'm being told they won't change at all and I don't see a reason to keep someone like that in my life. If in the future they can remember it's He not She, my door is always open.
""Family need a long LONG time to adapt to a family member transitioning.""

Not in my experience. My brother, who I fully expected to react badly, just started crying and apologising for all the hurtful things he probably said to me growing up. Five minutes later I was his sister who he would love, support and defend.

So the whole family requiring extra time because they are family is just bullshit. You're either accepting and love someone unconditionally or you aren't and would rather guard your own insecurities than support someone who really needs you.
I would even argue ""especially"" your mother. Sending you lots of love ‚ù§Ô∏è
Thanks.   

Yeah, I see the same situation constantly. Even those who support me often think I'm ""choosing"" something. Like, I'm really not. I'm just trying to be myself without extra stress and anxiety. It must be nice being totally comfortable in your own skin and having the right hormones coursing through your body. But I don't get that luxury. So I have to medically intervene.  

If legitimate medical treatment upsets you, then maybe you shouldn't have that pacemaker or that tumor removed? Maybe you shouldn't be on depression or anti-anxiety meds and take your chances with your blood pressure?  

I'm not ""making"" anyone do anything. I'm *asking* for the people who claim to love me to just respect me. Treat me like a human being with feelings and thoughts and intelligence. And as someone you trust and believe and who wouldn't do something so drastic just to piss *you* off. Like, what a selfish thought pattern.
Remember to keep reiterating that to them... It's important. But you also need to give them a reason to want to make the transition too. No one accepts unwanted change willingly. After about 7 years I was able to talk with my mother again. My entire family blanked me for years after my transition. Unfortunately, the superficial vaneer she had painted over who I really am wasn't enough for me and the relationship subsequently broken down when I got married because she wouldn't attend my marriage. Same went for the rest of my family. Not a single family member attended my wedding. Zoe and I have been together since 2006 and married for the last 5 of those years. Yet my family can't accept who I really am even though I transitioned in 2003. That's a long, long time to accept who I am if they gave a shit. My point is, it's a tough road to walk and there just may not be enough between you and your family to pull you together again. I hope there is though because it's a cold stone in your heart if it isn't.
If you are in a supportive family... That is truly awesome for you! Sadly, the statistics put that as exceptional rather than the norm. Perhaps do some background research on family integration of transitioning family members.

Books like [this](https://www.taylorfrancis.com/chapters/edit/10.4324/9781003001881-10/transitioning-families-butch-losey) for example.

Supportive families are becoming more 'common' but family transitions are still very much a thing. Typically with rejection of the transitioning family member so that the family unit can retain its world views.
>Treat me like a human being with feelings and thoughts and intelligence. And as someone you trust and believe and who wouldn't do something so drastic just to piss you off.

Yep. In hindsight, I think my mom saying I should tell everyone in person, was almost a dare. Like, OH, they wont really do this. They wont REALLY tell their dad. And then I did. And I started on T.

I told her about T, she didn't ask about how it would affect me, she asks, have you had any side effects yet? Like, wtf? I'm thinking she might have read that terf book about FtMs.

Like if someone is getting medical treatment, you ask, how are you feeling? not, any side effects yet?
>give them a reason to want to make the transition too.

How about, they love me?
But I‚Äôm not in a supportive family. I will likely never speak to my parents again. My point was that whether or not a relationship is familial has no relevance for how long they need to adapt. 

People either love and accept us unconditionally or they don‚Äôt - its that simple.

I also don‚Äôt require education on transitioning and family. I have lived it thanks.
My dad has yet to ask me if I'm happy. If I feel better. How the transition is going. It's just about how he can't accept it and can't call me his daughter and is worried what his parents will think.  

Luckily, he's pretty much alone so far. Him and his parents are likely to be the only ones in my life who aren't supportive. His wife (my stepmom), my sister, the rest of the family, my wife and her family, and all of my friends fully support me. So he can sit in a corner and mope alone when the holidays roll around I guess.
Yeah, if people 'actually' had unconditional love in the first place that would be a given. The truth is sadly, that unconditional love really means that you continue to live within the social framework that they live by. Transitioning throws that out of the window, so in their eyes, you broke the unwritten clauses in that 'unconditional love' contract. Also, very few parents and siblings actually do love unconditionally, even by their own terms of reference! Mostly, it's a veneer of convenience... Make of that what you will.
Then I can only wish the best for the future!
They really do think that we just drop a nuke into the center of our lives, for funsies. For the lolz. Because we were bored on a Tuesday. 

Wake up. Make Coffee. Be trans just to piss everyone off. LOL!
I prefer to be trans BEFORE my coffee bc then I'm extra moody about it.
I told my partner that coffee makes me less stabby. He was like, you're not functional before coffee (ie you cant be stabby). I was like, ok, it makes me more stabby? hahahahahaaaaaaaa!"	wo923r	trans	636	0.98	2022-08-14 15:30:24
My friend died	"No one I know really cares so the most that I've been able to do today is scream into my pillow. I was her only friend. We met at a support group for trans people, and she was great help in keeping that group running. She was in school to become a nurse because she loved helping people. She was an avid reader and could go on for hours about stories she enjoyed. 

I knew *her.* Her family manufactured an identity for her and tried to force her into the role. To them, she is a boy who studied to become a software engineer (she started that but abandoned it when she started her transition) and knew everything about computers (she was not, she only googled tech problems). If you asked her parents, they'd claim she was a movie buff(she hated movies but watched them as a child to appease her parents). Today, their social media is spammed with sympathy, but it all uses the wrong name and wrong pronouns because none of them cared who she actually was. 

She wanted, above so much else, to one day be accepted by her family. When she came out to them she was thrown out of the home she grew up in and allowed back only if she detransitioned. They mocked her chosen name and refused to call her ""she."" But she was convinced that one day she'd be able to educate them enough and that they would welcome her back, that they would view her as a daughter and a sister. 

She went home for the holidays this year, which was the first time she'd been home in years. Her parents wanted to see her, and she thought it was a sign of progress. I encouraged her to go, even drove her to the airport. She came home miserable. No progress had been made - they wanted her home because they wanted to drag her to church and convince her to return to the  faith. She spent two weeks with people who denied and spat on her true self. 

And last night she killed herself. 

I have done nothing today except doomscroll social media. Her family mourns a name she didn't use, they plaster their profiles with pictures from before her transition, they claim they miss her and love her and don't mention the fact that they made her homeless for months because she had the audacity to be born in the wrong body. 

No one else in our support group really knew her. She rarely spoke at our meetings. I informed them of her death and they can only offer empty sympathies. 

I don't know what to do anymore. Society is regressing backwards and we suffer for it. A large segment of people out there don't want us to exist and will do all they can to hurt us. I'm so tired of it. Tired of my support group growing smaller as the months pass, tired of waking up to headlines about some fascist somewhere proposing a bill to strip away our rights."	"Thank you for telling her story.
It sounds like you were a true friend to her, and that's what we really need in this life. I am incredibly sorry to hear about your loss, unfortunately as I didn't know ow them, all I can do is add to the pile for sympathy. Just know that while she was having issues, you were like a lighthouse in a storm to her
That‚Äôs so fucked up and honestly I would go so far as to say with the context that it wasn‚Äôt just that she killed herself, that her family pushed her to suicide. Her death is on their hands and then they‚Äôre trying to seem like victims. I‚Äôm not surprised, but that‚Äôs really heartbreaking. I‚Äôm sorry you‚Äôre going through this but I know that you will honor her life well.
Its good you wrote this down, expressing your frustrations and feelings. At least that is what my therapist tells me. 

We are all in this together. So sorry for you loss and wish you the best.
Those parents need a punch in their noses so hard ü§¨
No one can blame you for being distraught over this avoidable suicide. Her family will continue to live in denial over their lack of suooort. It‚Äôs great she had such a great friend in you and the support group. It was probably her biggest blessing. I am truly sorry for your loss of such a great friend. You were obviously very supportive and affirming. Such a gift. Sharing her story might just give insight to others who read this. It might produce something very positive for another family. Thank you for sharing. I do hope you will hold soace for self-care as you morn this terrible loss. Prayers for peace and comfort for you and her support group. I wish I could give you a Mom hug. My heart breaks for those who knew and loved her for who she really was. You were a true and great friend. I do hope you will take care of yourself in this painful loss.
Religion is a cancer on this planet. I'm sorry for your loss.
They killed their child
Your friend didn't kill herself. She was murdered by the hate of her ""family"". All it would have took to save her is for them to love her. They obviously couldn't do that and now she's gone. It's their fault. I would tell them that. 

I'm sorry for your loss.
If you can, separate yourself from your phone and computer for a while. Looking at all that stuff is going to keep you in a bad cycle. You‚Äôre vulnerable right now, allow yourself to take a step back and just do what you need to do to grieve. If not for yourself but for her, because you can honor her memory. So please make sure to eat, drink water, get some sleep if you can, ask for help from people you are close to. Do this so you can fight for her memory and fight for progress to help prevent this from happening again. For what it‚Äôs worth even thought we didn‚Äôt know her we can mourn her together
I‚Äôm heartbroken for her, and feel your pain and suffering. I have nothing to offer but sympathy and condolences. You are a true hero to her and I thank you for sharing her story. Please take care of yourself, you‚Äôre a great person!
I‚Äôm so sorry, this is an honest tragedy. You sound like a great person and i‚Äôm sure you managed to ease some of the pain your friend felt at certain points in her life. 

It‚Äôs good you can get your thoughts out, as painful as they might be, because that often helps us process traumatic events. Hopefully you can carry on your friend‚Äôs memory, she seemed like an incredibly sweet person. 

I can‚Äôt believe the audacity of her family. One of my fears is being misgendered and deadnamed after I‚Äôm dead. I finally changed my legal name, but still, most of my family doesn‚Äôt know. Your friend‚Äôs family seems terrible and the fake concern they show after your friend‚Äôs death is an insult the the beautiful person I‚Äôm sure she was. I can‚Äôt help but think they won‚Äôt even ever recognize the damage they caused. 

Please take care of yourself. The world is a grim place but I hope you find comfort eventually. The pain of a loss like that will never leave. I hope you can find a way to grieve and honor your friend. Sending hugs and well wishes
Could you maybe submit her real obituary somewhere? My worst fear is dying with nobody acknowledging who I am.
Her blood is on their hands. They chose to push the ~~‚Äúson‚Äù~~ they never had instead of loving and cherishing the *daughter* they always had and that lead to the loss of her life. I hope they realize that someday and feel absolutely ashamed and disgusted by themselves and their actions!

Their daughter will live on in our hearts! <3
Sorry for your loss :(
I'm so sorry for your loss.
Thank you for sharing her memory. She won‚Äôt be forgotten here.
She'll always live on in are hearts because you were able to tell the story of her, and even if others try to hide it, we'll always know the person she was. I'm so sorry for your loss, I hope you recover and feel better as time goes on <3
Say her name üíî fly high sis... R.i.p
It's sad and heartbreaking, the family is responsible and has no remorse and don't even seem to notice.
Completely different circumstances, but I‚Äôve lost two friends to suicide as well, one during highschool and I would overhear a few people talking poorly of him and making assumptions even though they never knew him. Another was a few years ago. It‚Äôs heart wrenching, I wish I could offer more to comfort you. If you aren‚Äôt already, try seeking a therapist or someone to talk to about it
Thank you for sharing that part of her with us. <3
I‚Äôm so fucking sorry for your friend. That story broke my heart, she sounded like an amazing woman. Thank you for sharing your story. Losing someone is never easy ü´Ç
She didn't kill herself, her ignorant and frankly morally bankrupt fucking parents drove her to that point. 

Imagine having the fucking GALL to post your child after they pass away, not even having the decency to respect who they were even in death. I'd argue its fucking evil. 

You did the absolute best you could for her and I bet she always cherished what you guys had. I'm so sorry you've gotta deal with this to start your new year. I'm available if you need to talk with somebody.
I am so sorry for your loss. You sound like you were a great friend to her
May she rest in peace, no longer having to endure the pain and frustration of other people‚Äôs ignorance and hatred. She deserves so much better from her family but she does have one real friend and now her trans community knows and will mourn her too with you. R.I.P to one of our butterflies.
Do you mind telling me her name? I‚Äôve got a friend, an ex really, whose parents berated him for his orientation until he couldn‚Äôt take it anymore. I was in the room. He was the first person I loved, and the first person close to me to die. I still write letters to him, and hope that there‚Äôs an afterlife of some sort where he sees them. I try to tell him the others I‚Äôve lost to this and hope he can help them or show them to someone who can. I know it‚Äôs probably all nonsense, but I have to believe there‚Äôs something after this, that the victims of this bullshit get some justice, get the peace they deserve. I don‚Äôt know if any of that is the case, and I strongly doubt all of it is, but I do know that I‚Äôm running out of patience. Every time I close my eyes, I see him. I haven‚Äôt gotten a full night‚Äôs sleep since it happened and I‚Äôm not even the one who actually went through it, I just saw it happen. I can‚Äôt accept that there‚Äôs no justice for what he‚Äôs suffered, but there‚Äôs nothing I can do for him now. So I write him letters and hope.
Stories like these make me seeth with both rage and sorrow. Have people no compassion?? Thank you for telling her story, losing people is never easy, especially when it could‚Äôve been so easily prevented by people that are supposed to love their child unconditionally.
Thank you for sharing her story. 
If I may give a few words to her:
Though her family was not supportive or kind to her throughout her transition, we in the trans community understand and feel her pain. We know what it‚Äôs like to be repressed, censored, told we‚Äôre hideous, exaggerated for being trans, among many other things. Today we mourn in honor of her. She was a person who, like many of us face the daily struggle of being trans, and even being closeted for some of us (me included). All she wanted was love and acceptance, like we all do. We are only asking for the basic right of respect and dignity. We only ask to be treated equally, with love and kindness. Too many trans people have been lost in this journey. Too many of our fellow trans sisters, brothers, siblings have we lost. Here‚Äôs to a more cheerful, hopeful future. One where we can finally be accepted, and may learn to love each other. May this unfortunate circumstance serve to us as a reminder that you are not exaggerating when asking to use the correct pronouns. You are not going through a phase. You don‚Äôt need to ‚Äúatone for your sins‚Äù for being trans. Yes you are trans enough, yes you are just as valid as cis people, yes you deserve love. I‚Äôm currently crying as we speak and mourn for your friend today. As a side note to this , I had a fight with my cis friend because he still doesn‚Äôt fully use my preferred pronouns. I thought to myself I was exaggerating and being dramatic because I felt quite invalidated for being seen as a just a man. I am an AMAB nonbinary person who use he/she/they pronouns. This message given to us by the OP reminds us that yes it‚Äôs valid to feel hurt by people not using our pronouns and deadnaming us. I am very sorry for your friend, she deserved better. Thank you again for sharing this with us and hopefully sharing this has given even a little bit of closure
I say copy your very eloquent post to the profiles of the family who rejected her. Sure, they're happy to lie to themselves but deep down they know. I'd ask myself what I had to lose by sticking up for her even at this point. Especially at this point. I'm so so sorry.
She sounds like she was an incredible woman who loves more for others in need than for her self. Why is it that the best of us seem to leave so soon? The world is blind to the bright light that people like her being and it is tragic. Thank you for sharing, at least her memory lives on in you and the story that you shared here.
I am so sorry this was done to her. Thank you for sharing her story
My deepest condolences for your loss, she sounds like an incredible person by the way you describe her. This may sound like empty words from someone who doesn't know you and didn't knew her, but I just want to say that even though there are many people mourning for someone who was not her, as long as there are people like you who will remember and mourn her for who she truly was, then I believe she is able to live on through you. She may be gone but she will never be truly forgotten because she had you who will always have known who she was. You're a good friend, thank you so much for sharing her story with us.
I'm so sorry for your loss, thank you for sharing her story. Sending you love x
Im so sorry for your loss, she seemed like a great woman. I'm sure she'd want you to keep fighting, to not get dragged down by the terrors of this world, it's why she wanted to be a nurse, and why she helped in the support group. Take a step back, take the time you need to grieve, but also cherish your memories. Cherish your friendship with her, the fun you had, her interests, her genuine self. Her wicked family may only remember their son, but you will remember their daughter.
Don't let her true story be covered by the fake one that her family made.
Could you post something on her social media that tells people what really happened? So it doesn't gets lost in time?
I am sorry that she died.
So sorry for your loss.
Sorry for your loss.
I literally cried reading this. I want to share my condolences üíê this is a tough read and I can‚Äôt bear the thought of what she wells thinking in the time of events. I can‚Äôt imagine it but it sounds so familiar to me because I‚Äôm a trans woman too and I hate to talk about myself in this segment but I noticed that people really are innately selfish to point of outing trans people as if literally taking away their human rights! It‚Äôs downright disgusting. Sometimes, I don‚Äôt want to live but I don‚Äôt think I have the guts to take it that far considering how bad people can be, but even worst family members. 

It‚Äôs sucks doesn‚Äôt it? We live and then after all the effort and shit we‚Äôve been through we thought life gets better‚Ä¶ but it doesn‚Äôt really? People will always try to bring each other down like crabs in a bucket. 

We live a dog eats dog society. When you‚Äôre trans the dumbasses stood out more for some reason.

Once again, thanks again for sharing her story and you will get through this. God doesn‚Äôt judge. People do.
Not a trans person myself, but one of my best friends is & is also dealing with a family that isn't very supportive of her. All I can do is give you as big a hug as I can. You did the absolute right thing by sharing her story, you're a true friend. I wish everyone in your friend's life was as supportive as you are.
Her story will be told by me secondhand for the love and drive she had. 

I will tell of a girl of great strength and determination. Compassion and empathy. 

She will live on through your tellings, of saying her name in the darkness, the early morn, the bright sunlight.

You know her truth, and you know her soul. Keep her alive in thought and memories. Tell of her to others, and it's as if they met her too. Stay strong dear, she still stands beside us as we move forward through our lives. ‚ô°
Don't have the words to tell how sorry I feel for her and for you nor how angry I am at her ""family"". Stay safe, take care of yourself, hope you have good friends around to support you <3
im so sorry for your loss. thank you for telling us about her
Poor girl... How her death wasn't an incredibly late wake-up call is just so sad. She doesn't deserve this...
[deleted]
My heart breaks reading this :( rip poor baby. What makes my blood boil, is that these shit stains she called a family, will never realize it was their bullshit that killed her. like they would even care. Theres a special place in hell for these pieces of trash. Sorry‚Ä¶ im furious >.>
Well, that's just wrong on so many levels, what her family did. Thank you for sharing and I'm so sorry for your loss. U nerd a hug. *hugs*
Thank you for sharing her story. She will never be forgotten üíú
I‚Äôm so sorry üòû
I am horrified and terribly sorry for your loss. We really need true friends in life, and you were a true friend to her.

Parents like that make me so angry.
I am so so sorry for her loss, maybe try and find people from her school that knew her maybe make some sort of group. The world has lost a wonderful person and her life being cut short was truly a tragedy. Also remember to take care of yourself, I‚Äôve been told the worst day isn‚Äôt the day they die because at least you have something to do, it‚Äôs all the days they stay dead so make sure your healthy and ok. I am so sorry for you loss.
I am so sorry for your loss. You knew the real her, telling her story is the best way to remember her. Thank you for sharing her story with us. Please stay safe friend.
The best you can do is keep her memory alive. we all have to fight to improve the world for future trans people.
Condolences for your loss. Thanks for sharing. If anything ever happened to me, I‚Äòd wish my friends would somehow tell my truth as well somewhere. That way we‚Äòre remembered at least by our communities as who we really are.
I‚Äôm so sorry for your loss üíï
They didn‚Äôt deserve her. I am so sorry for your loss.
I'm so sorry, that's absoloutly horrible. I understand not being understood by family and them outright just not accepting me, thankfully they are getting better though.

I wish you the best, and I just know that spreading her story as much as you can, is what she would've wanted you do.

This horrific violence committed to our community needs to stop, all these laws and shit are just a mass genocide.

It makes me so sad everyday to know that we have to deal with ignorant people who have such a problem being educated and just saying he instead of she, she instead of he, or they.

To me that's not a hard concept, but to them it seems like the end of the world to respect someone's wishes, and it can end in someone dying.

Wishing you the best, I'm really sorry and I hope she can get her story heard by the people who were deadnamimg her (not on purpose)
Im sorry you lost your friend, thank you for sharing her story.
I love you all
I am so sorry for your loss and wish you well in your goals moving forward will be hard I know if you ever need someone to lean on I will always be there for you in anyway I am capable
You‚Äôre a great friend and I will say that despite everything she‚Äôs still with you. Her rebellious and caring for others spirit is within you - never let that go away

Please, make a memorial for HER not the bullshit the parents will came up with. You know her true self and she would be happy to know she didn‚Äôt left us without being memorized for who she actually is

I can‚Äôt imagine the pain you‚Äôre going through, but I beg you to never back down. They want us to be hopeless and suicidal, but we will always prevail with caring people like you, be a light that will warmly hug someone in the darkest moments 

Thank you for being a true friend
You expressed what i felt reading this even better than i could...
Oh i think they deserve a little more than that ü§¨ üò°üòí
I second this
Religion is not a cancer. It can give hope when needed, an answer to believe when there are none from science. But weaponized religion, like what we see with so many Christians and Muslims, and assuredly many more faiths, are what plague this Earth. They enforce their own absolutes onto others, they allow their faith to judge someone before they can get a chance to. They drive people that their religion educators tell them they should hate or convert to suicide, like what's happened here. Christianity is the worst in historical measures; they've used their faith to excuse an extraordinary number of moral and ethical crimes. Hell, they built the United States on these crimes. And now, people weaponize their religion for hatred and discrimination of minorities of all kinds. These people are ethe plague on this Earth. 

This one story gives light to the many, many stories of other victims who have fallen prey to weaponized religion. It's sad to know of one person, one life cut short by discrimination. It's sickening to know that's it's not just that one life.

I cannot offer any words other than empty sympathies for this loss. I did not know her, though by OP's description she sounded like an amazing person with a really shitty family. Live on in her honor and memory, tell her story as much as you can as to give her a legacy.

As a note, I'm sorry if I have said anything upsetting. I wanted to voice my opinion and give condolences but I am painfully bad at reading what may or may not be appropriate for any situation.
Agreed. Pushing one's own child to suicide should count as a form of murder.

Got into an argument with my wife about the new Harry Potter game‚Ä¶	"Have y‚Äôall seen the new game? It looks amazing. 

And JK is a fucking TERF. 

Background: I‚Äôm genderqueer, present male, and would like to wear more feminine clothing. I have confessed my non-binary gender identity to my wife. She understands. She has made it very clear that she cannot handle me presenting as anything but male.

So I spoke to my wife about how incredible the new game looks and how it seems to deliver on all the delight and promise inherent within the Harry Potter universe, but I‚Äôm torn because I don‚Äôt want my delight in the game to support a TERF who already uses her wealth and influence to try to make it harder for people to express their gender identity. 

She said she doesn‚Äôt care about all that, and the hate for JK is just twitter rage. She decided I didn‚Äôt know anything about it all, and I should just be quiet about it. 

I walked away. 

She came back, told me she read JK‚Äôs 2020 essay full of dog-whistle rhetoric and said she agrees with 90% of the points. 

I don‚Äôt dispute that women need exclusive safe spaces. I don‚Äôt dispute that women are disproportionately the victims of abuse. 

Wife told me that she agrees with JK because wife, as a *woman* (emphasis hers), can decide what‚Äôs best for women. And that *men*, again emphasis hers, pointing at me, cannot possibly understand the concerns of women. 

Wife proceeds to bring up a bunch of TERF-ish  talking points supporting her position, which I calmly refuted with sources, and she just blew me off. I‚Äôm incapable of understanding, you see, because I‚Äôm a man. 

We have 2 trans kids. She‚Äôs supportive of them, but they‚Äôre FtM. She asserts that the current trend (her words) of girls transitioning to men is because it‚Äôs not safe to be a girl in our society. Okay. 

My wife has made it very clear that she‚Äôs not going to be my ally. My internal life seems like it will have to stay private unless we split up. I suppose that‚Äôs sort of a gift.

--------------------

Edit: This blew up in a way I didn't anticipate. Rather than responding to every one of you delightful and concerned individuals who are overwhelming me with support, my wife and I have been negotiating around the edges of divorce for a while now. Issues like this, among myriad others, make it clear that we're not terribly compatible, and things have likely run their course. It's just a matter of figuring out how to end things amicably with minimum impact for the kids (2 mentioned in the post, and a few more...)"	"Your wife is forcing you to stay closeted for her comfort, you have bigger problems than HP, you need an actual divorce.
that's a genuinely kind of fucked up situation to be in. your wife is being extremely dismissive and transphobic to your kids and you, putting her comfort & love of JKR over you all and using TERF bullshit to justify her bigotry. i'm sorry you're in the thick of it. you and your kids deserve better.
I‚Äôm a woman and I agree with you.  Women of every flavor deserve to use women‚Äôs spaces.  JKR and her legion of terfs are doing the same thing to trans women that white women did to black women during the suffragette movements and it‚Äôs disgusting.  Anyone that agrees with anything she has to say is literally siding with white conservative men against other women.  All of those terf talking points are straight from conservative think tanks that are actively trying to strip women‚Äôs bodily autonomy.

I‚Äôll gladly sup on their transphobic tears as our trans siblings get more acceptance, rights, and protections.  They will look just like any other hate organizations in the eyes of history.  Children will look back on them with utter disdain and disgust just like we do with the KKK now.
So ah... you need a divorce.

You're wife is bigoted, infantalizing her FtM trans kids, invalidating your identity, and actively keeping you in the closet for her own comfort. There's no salvaging this. You need to make arrangements to split.
Your wife just told you she‚Äôs a TERF, but she has a trans spouse and two trans kids? And she calls you a man & claims your kids are part of a ‚Äòtrend?‚Äô You‚Äôre being forced into the closet and your wife doesn‚Äôt believe you or your kids are who you say you are, please get out of there and find a partner who actually cares about your guys‚Äô identities.

edit: spelling
D I V O R C E

Your wife cannot possibly be loving and supportive of you OR your trans kids. She needs a TON of work on herself, TONS of learning and reconditioning...literal years of self reflective ego work, and effort...thats all IF she realises she needs to do it all... Unlikely, seeing as the best way to change someones mind is from the position of good/loving friend/partner, and she is unable to change her mind or understand why she needs to.

Once more... 

D I V O R C E
You have 2 trans boys as kids. You NEED to protect those children from your TERF wife, and I'm sorry, but your wife is a TERF. I hate jumping to ""divorce her"", but this woman is ACTIVELY harming you and your kids with these beliefs. Your duty, as a trans parent to trans children, is to model good behavior and good morals. That means bouncing TERFs out of your life for their protection. You know how dangerous rhetoric like that is. I'm sure you know the suicide risk for kids who don't have supportive parents, and that still stands even if one is a transphobe. By staying with her, you're showing your children that it's okay to have these beliefs, and it WILL harm them.  

For your children's sakes, and your sake, GET OUT. She doesn't deserve to be a mother if she thinks your kids think it's a trend. Your kids deserve better, and so do you. Get. The hell. OUT. If for no other reason than your kids' lives are at risk living with a TERF.
First, your wife is transphobic and you should definitely rethink your relationship for the safety of you and your kids. Second, I was also excited about the game, but I found out that in addition to a neo nazi being heavily involved in dev, the plot is about the goblin rebellion and you get a house elf‚Ä¶IDK if I want to play it now knowing the weirdly racist parts of original HP that have now been recognized as problematic are put in such focus. Just my two cents, would love to hear what you think on the matter.
you need to not be with her to be yourself and she clearly doesnt respect your kids either. it's sad there's people like her
you deserve to be however you are and want to be as do your kids.
your wife is very clearly a terf and not actually supportive or you or your kids. i‚Äôm so sorry- focus on protecting your mental health and that of your kids over all else.
Tbh just do you. If she can't handle it that's her problem and she isn't the one, she sounds like an icky person anyway
You need a divorce ASAP. Sounds like her beliefs can be harmful to your children.
Get. A. Divorce.
I'm so sorry to see this and your edit. Sending you so much love, support and solidarity ‚ù§Ô∏èüñ§
I think for the mental health of not it‚Äôs you and your trans kids, but the rest of your kids who might be gender non conforming or queer in any way, you should probably get a divorce.

My parents aren‚Äôt accepting of me at all, and it‚Äôs driven me to some very dark thoughts. Don‚Äôt let your wife put your kids in that position. 

Good luck either way though :)
Don't let your wife dissuade you from presenting as female. If she wants, she can fuck right off. She's already shown what kind of person she is: a TERF! She's putting her bs ahead of your happiness.
If she agrees with JK then she‚Äôs not supporting her kids
Sorry but your wife can screw off. I dont have patience or sympathy for her or people like her.
I take it that if your children were MtF she wouldn't be be very supportive of them... The problem here definitely lies with her not only being transphobic, but also quite sexist, too. And for her to dismiss anything that you say, while everything she says is automatically correct definitely reminds me of my transphobic parents.
Obviously everyone here is saying to get a divorce, but I personally wouldn't take an action like that immediately. Not saying that you won't have to eventually, but you might want to try other options first.
Fuck J.K. Rowling and fuck anyone who agrees with her.  
I‚Äôm so sorry, OP.
Leave her leave her leave her.

She‚Äôs a TERF and TERFs aren‚Äôt safe spouses or parents for trans folks. Keep an eye on the kids too.
I would also point to JK‚Äôs recent support to a trans and homophobic woman called Caroline Farrow who refuses to acknowledge her trans son and refers to him as her daughter. Also Caroline Farrow who has tweeted about hating homosexuality as it‚Äôs a sin and is against the non-biblical rainbow. But then supports lesbians because of the trans lesbians out there. 

There are some awful people out there and unfortunately it sounds like your wife is one of them. I feel sorry for your sons having a mother like that. I also seen your edit about the possibility of divorce. I think you do need to seriously consider that and get your sons away from that woman
I don't want to be extremist, but leave her, she is forcing you to stay miserable so she can go on with her stupid fragile nonsense ideologies.
Based on your last sentence, it seems like you're already in the decision to end things with her. If she doesn't support you and eventually won't support your children (judging by the examples of her personality in this post), I would also suggest looking at getting out of the relationship. 

People forget that as humans, we are evolving and changing creatures. We need and deserve to surround ourselves with those who will only add something good to our lives, especially those who are minorities of any degree. Your happiness, mental wellbeing and development are much more important than a relationship where you already sound limited and discontent.

Of course, this is all only judged from this post alone. No matter your choice in the end, OP, I only wish you happiness.
honest advice. I think you should rethink your relationship to someone who is unwilling to support you, and understand your struggles. if you decide to stay, I wish you the best on this, as terfs are usually unable to listen to reason, and seem to be more focused on fighting already oppressed groups than fighting the establishment
Some other Harry Potter things worth knowing about... https://youtu.be/-1iaJWSwUZs )
>Wife told me that she agrees with JK because wife, as a woman (emphasis hers), can decide what‚Äôs best for women. And that men, again emphasis hers, pointing at me, cannot possibly understand the concerns of women.

Tell her that as a \*trans\* person, you know what's best for trans people. And that \*cis\* people, point at her, can't possibly understand the concerns of trans people.
I would watch [James Somerton's](https://youtu.be/xLuNGhQPDHM) video on Rowling. She doesn't get paid in royalties from any of the HP franchise products and instead gets a large lump sum as payment up front. 

As such the only harm done is to the game company that signed on to make the game well before Rowling began making transphobic comments. It sucks for them because this was the sink or swim game for them so they couldn't just drop the game.

The company making the game as such has done what they can to distance themselves from Rowling and she's had no input on the game at all. 

Because of that I am ambiliviant on people buying it. On one hand not buying it helps to move the current zeitgeist away from the HP series and in doing so moves Rowling and her veiws away from being seen as relevant. On the other hand a trans positive small game company may very well suffer because Joanne chose to be a bigot after the game was already well into development. 

I lean towards the former as the game will likely do well enough despite people boycotting it but knowing what I know I'm not going to be too harsh on people buying it because a trans positive company is potentially invaluable in it's own right.

Edit: Oh yeah, your wife sounds like she's found herself on the GC pipeline. I'm sorry that your wife is not being supportive and has fallen for gc propaganda.

 Hopefully, you can get through to her with the resources others have provided but if not or if she further ingratiates herself in the GC ~~cult~~ movement then it may not be safe for your sons and yourself.

Given the horrid things gc's say to the cis parents of trans children to try and turn them against their children I would be worried.

 [Calien Conrad](https://youtu.be/pwI6py78gsI) is in the process doing a 3 part deep dive in how gc's do their recruitment and indoctrination and it's honestly eye opening. It's long but it's worth setting aside the time to watch. Best of luck with your spouse.
You deserve someone so much more accepting
Wow this escalated quickly. So you are telling me that your wife not only doesn't view you as any different from a cis man but also your sons as daughters who basically hide from a life as a woman? 
I'm very sorry but you really need to evaluate whether this marriage can have any kind of future. This doesn't sound like a healthy environment for you and your children.
Your wife by the sounds of this doesnt deserve you or your sons.
If she cant handle the way you'd like to present, she isn't a good wife. I'm so sorry. 

Get those kids out of there too.
I have to be honest, this sounds like an incredibly toxic environment. Y'all need to either get some counselling  because that is not an okay situation. And if she's not willing and able to make a change then you owe it to yourself, your kids and even her to end it.
It really seems like she doesn‚Äôt know any trans women besides Caitlyn Jenner, and the only picture of trans women ‚Äúout there in the world‚Äù she thinks much of are  those ‚Äúhulking predatory men,‚Äù without realizing we‚Äôre just like her. Sending us into the mens room doesn‚Äôt keep her any safer, it just puts us in harms way so she can have peace of mind. I hope one day she‚Äôll realize how harmful her mindset is, and officially barring trans women from women‚Äôs spaces doesn‚Äôt stop or reduce predatory men from forcing themselves in anyway. I‚Äôm really sorry you and your kids are having to deal with this in the meantime.
So sorry. Wife is wrong, completely wrong and bigoted. Her reasoning seems completely crooked, ftm yes mtf no?! Like sorry..??? I would almost think she just has this opinion because she doesn‚Äôt want you to change. She will never get away with this once your kids grow up and understand what happened...
While everyone else is commenting on the obviously more important issue of your wife‚Äôs bigotry, here‚Äôs my two cents on less important issue about the game. If you get a used copy you won‚Äôt be financially supporting JKR, that‚Äôs my plan.
You definitely can‚Äôt not transition for her. Even if you don‚Äôt go nuts, you‚Äôll resent the hell out of her. My wife and I had a lot of talks and tears. It can work out. Don‚Äôt give up hope.  Maybe try counseling?  The kiddos make it worth a shot. 

And on the game, idk, if it gets good reviews then I‚Äôll probably get it.  lots of people other than JK will get $ off the purchase. The gender options seemed a little tone deaf to me. I was thinking about rolling a Female Wizard, as I understand it that means you‚Äôll look like a girl but will room with the boys. It‚Äôd be sort of a reflect off howI felt and lived all throughout school.
Mmmm kinda sounds like Misandry and a lot of transphobia coming from her. I‚Äôm not one to offer relationship advice but I seriously believe you guys should sit down and discuss your relationship. Only reason I don‚Äôt say divorce right away is because obviously you two love or loved each other at some point and that‚Äôs why you‚Äôre married so speaking on the same level may give you insight into the next step which sadly might just be divorce anyway ;-;

But do not tolerate this behavior from her. If she truly believes all of this, they you‚Äôll just have to say ‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry, I‚Äôm not the person for you and you‚Äôre not the person for me.‚Äù
I have similar problems with my girlfriend. We met before I started my transition and I‚Äôm constantly having to prove myself. What I noticed is that she will never really understand and I don‚Äôt need to deal with that. I know it must be hard having two children with her and being married is entirely different challenge but please ask yourself if you are safe yourself. The last thing you want is to be hiding yourself because of someone else‚Äôs wishes. Regardless of your relationship status or being a parent you need to be yourself unapologetically ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è
Maybe try couples therapy, if not I think you two are just not too well suited for each other at this point in your lives and it's time to move on :/
Regarding the game, I agree. I've heard that there are ways to _get_ a game without paying for it, especially if you're on PC, but I wouldn't know more about that of course *wink *wink
I‚Äôll just keep peeing in a can in my truck
Divorce and take the kids (jk)
My understanding is that jk rowling will not get anything from this game
Get rid of her
Get the fuck away from her. What a piece of shit human being.
This made me very angry. I have a three word response for her:

FUCK.OFF.BITCH.
There is someone who will love you as you are. And for the woman you are at times. I hope to see that update here at some point. Good luck. üíúüíú
>She has made it very clear that she cannot handle me presenting as anything but male.

fr forget the annoying wizard lady, OP you and your spouse have stuff to work out here
This is absolutely right! My wife stayed with me through my transition because, in her words, ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre still you, and that‚Äôs the person I love‚Äù. OP needs to leave the situation, because ‚Äúwife‚Äù obviously has no respect for OP at all. This will only get worse in the long run and damage the relationship they have with their sons.
I was crestfallen after I managed to get the courage to speak to her about the way I am inside, and she made it clear she wanted the inside to stay where it is.

We've been together for a long time, and it's very likely we've just drifted too far on our paths. I get a little sad when I think about couples that make it 30, 40 years or whatever, but that's not everyone. And when you're in a position where you start to feel that it would be better to be alone than to feel so goddamn lonely all the time, that's a sign.
Even if OP were a cis man wife was nasty and dismissive of them. Yuck.
Yeah. The goblins are an active slur, aren't they? And if my first option *isn't* to give my house elf a sock, then I'm not okay with it.

I didn't know about the nazi on the dev team. Dang. 

HP gave so many young kids a way to escape the daily little torments of being a kid and live with whatever it was that made them *weird*. It breaks my heart when I think of all the things that make it problematic. Like, it's an amazing wonderful world, but it you stop and think about it for 15 seconds too long, it all falls apart.

The more I think about it, the more I can't feel good about a potential purchase of the game.
couples therapy is an option, but make sure the therapist is trans-inclusive and won‚Äôt put you in an invalidating situation based on your gender
I would be perfectly happy to buy her a one-way plane ticket anywhere she likes. Is that the sort of option you're suggesting?
[removed]
Nice! But I wasn‚Äôt ready to go nuclear‚Ä¶

Will I ever be ready? Maybe. I‚Äôll have to out myself to my kids first. I‚Äôm kind of a coward in this regard, TBH. On a rational level, I know they‚Äôll accept me, but my wounded inner child is afraid of the consequences.
Thanks. I‚Äôll give that video a watch. I always like to learn new things.
Not gonna lie: we definitely have problems relating to each other.
Being trans is such an easy shorthand for ""deviant"" and ""mentally ill"" that's seeped into the culture. As I understand it, Rowling wrote a trans villain into one of her mystery novels? Stupid, lazy shorthand. Really tipped her hand there.

I lived through the time of Matthew Shephard. He was two years younger than me. Me and my queer friends were actively harassed whenever we went out in Dallas. I've seen bad guys. The bad guys weren't my friends. We just wanted emotional and physical safety. The bad guys were the assholes protected from any real consequence by a gay-bashing society.

Fewer Caitlyn Jenners. More Eddie Izzards. That would be a good start. More visible role models who aren't taking any shit.

Sorry. Rambling.
There's an idea. Though the developers seem to be doing so much to take a lot of the toxicity out of the world for this game. Several of the choices shown in the ""State of Play"" video were obviously selected to demonstrate that. So, *they* certainly deserve support. But they still have house elves... And the goblins have always been a problem. I'm probably going to end up avoiding it. Rowling just makes me ill.
Thank you for the kind words and insight. I need to figure out how to navigate this. I'm going to start with wearing things that make me feel better underneath my current social uniform. We'll see how it goes from there.
Thinking about it more, if I can't give my house elf a sock, then I'm not going to consider it. There are enough strikes that I just can't feel good about it.

As for the therapy, I think this ship has sailed. I'm not quite giving up yet, but it's hard to muster the will to try any more.
Why ""JK?"" This person absolutely needs a divorce, and their children should not be with their mother.
Literally anything that has harry potter in its name will make jk money. That being said, for anyone who wants to play the game but not support her, you can check out r/piracy for safe ways of doing it.
No JKR is not involved in the game's development. She does profit off of it though as it uses her IP.
promoting & buying that game (and other HP merch) keeps her in the public consciousness, making investors want to invest in her and people approve of her because she's attached to media they like. she uses the money and power that affords her to hurt trans people.
Yeah like‚Ä¶holy shit. I can‚Äôt help it this this woman is going to cause (or has already caused) trauma for their two trans children. Since she obviously doesn‚Äôt view bring trans as real and had to find some TERFy excuse as to why FtM people exist.
Kid comes first. That is the deal you sign when you create them and/or agree to watch over them. Unconditional love. And if you truly love your child then you ALWAYS second guess every decision involving them no matter how right you think you are because a lot of the time being right isn't even really the true issue. You are supposed to playing the long game which should be more about not leaving marks than bashing the clay into shape. When you bash things they tend to explode. All real parenting is done by example anyway. If you lead and they don't follow it is probably because they have a will and life of their own although there is always the possibility that your way just sucks? If you aren't always keeping that in mind you aren't doing it right.

Sorry if this seems ranty, its really just general parenting advice that should apply to most things.
>She made it clear she wanted the inside to stay where it is.

OOF. üíî I wish I couldn‚Äôt relate to this. But unfortunately I‚Äôm guessing many of us here *can*. As hard as it might be, we have to let go of the people who are unwilling to see us for who we truly are. Otherwise we‚Äôre just letting them take up the space of the ones who would.
Nah. I was just trying to be a bit more optimistic about her understanding, however I know from experience that it's very difficult for that to happen. Do what needs to be done, and best of luck.
? I think I misunderstood something, I was refering to her transphobic ideologies, or am I just confused?
what are you, OP's wife?
Being scared to come out is completely valid. I couldn't admit I was trans and accept it til I was 17 despite my mom being very supportive since I was 13. Take your time and I definitely recommend seeing a therapist. And remember, you're a valid bean deserving of love and respect üíñ
Eddie Izzard isn‚Äôt a saint by any stretch of the imagination as she defended JKR.  She‚Äôs more interested in defending folks under attack in her social strata than standing up for trans folks.

https://news.sky.com/story/amp/jk-rowling-isnt-transphobic-says-gender-fluid-eddie-izzard-12177312
I‚Äôm a supporter of you! I‚Äôm sure you got this but know we are here ‚ù§Ô∏è
This is precisely the point my eldest child was suggesting.
For better or worse HP isn‚Äôt going anywhere 
I‚Äôd rather people enjoy stuff that they like and let the relationship with the author die than try to extinguish the giant franchise
I understand. The kids don't have to seek my approval. They know that they have it unconditionally. They're not afraid to speak their mind with me. They don't fear repercussions. If they say something hurtful or generally tone-deaf, we talk about it. If I say or do something stupid, they call me out. I think we have a good relationship. They're wonderful people whithout a great deal of experience. So, we work together -- me and the kids -- to help them get the experience they're going to need to be independent, functional adults. 

What's more (and this is the part I'm really happy about): they're *kind*.
A logical extension of the ‚Äúrule of no‚Äù. 

You have to say no to a thousand things, so you can say yes to the really important few.

Goddammit.
death of the author is all well and good if the author is dead and/or doesn't benefit socially or financially. pirating a game is ethical, buying fanmade merch is ethical, but no one should expect trans people to be comfortable with anyone advertising their enjoyment of a franchise made by the UK's premiere transphobe.
Sounds like you've got it! Sorry to hear about your situation. I've been with my almost 30 years. She has BPD which she treated with alcohol for years until it almost killed her. That turned her around and we've been headed back up ever since. With you on the kindness thing too, its one of the best yardsticks and how I met my wife.
Being honest, I'm not sure, but she is trying to force them to present how she wants them to present, says that trans people are justs a trend and agrees with J.K Rowling and is generally telling them to hide who they is, I thought it was safe to assume she was somewhat transphobic
Buying most good isn‚Äôt ethical. 
If you want to fight that fight it‚Äôs fine
But I‚Äôm not going to be mad if others don‚Äôt
[removed]
Believing that trans people are just a trend, that J.K Rowling is right or that trans women are a threat to cis women is a transphobic belief, so I will gladly take that advice you just gave me and throw it out the window, there are moments when you shouldn't assume anything, but there are moments like when your wife is literally ranting about trans people or saying we're a trend when you can already know what she thinks, you could talk her out of it, people can change, but if she is forcing you to be someone you are not because it makes her uncomfortable then she is not worth it."	ti1rxc	trans	517	0.94	2022-03-19 18:41:13
I got misgendered by my doctor and it was awesome	"Hey, everyone.

Before you make any assumptions based on the title, please allow me to tell you my tale! :)

I had an appointment with my doctor to whom I came out last year. Today she misgendered me and the conversation was like this:

Her: ""Are you feeling nervous?"" (Using feminine pronouns)
Me: ""You mean nervous? (Using male pronouns)""
Her: (visibly embarrassed) ""I'm so sorry! Yes, that's what I meant! My gosh, forgive me, I'm still forgetting about your pronouns.""
Me: (chuckling and honestly happy af about how considerate, caring and sweet she was): ""It's quite alright!""

Then she misgendered me again:

Her: ""But are you feeling tired?"" (Using feminine pronouns)
Me: ""Ahem. Tired. Hahaha."" (Correcting her, using masculine pronouns)
Her: (chuckles a bit) ""Oh my gosh, I'm sorry! I'm not trying to do this on purpose nor anything! I just keep forgetting! But you, keep correcting me, always! So that I can get it though my head that you are a he/him!"" 

So yes, it was awesome, wholesome and amazing. Sure, she misgendered me, but do you see how considerate, comprehensive, sweet and caring she was? She's an incredible doctor and I'm so grateful for having her in my life, I appreciate it a lot that she corrected herself afterwards. Plus, she's fun! We managed to have a good laugh about the situation! :)

BONUS: My first appointment towards my transition is this year!!!!"	"Is this one of those languages, in which verbs have male and female forms (like my native Polish)?
Being misgendered sucks but if the person doing it immediately apologizes and is actually making an effort, then it really isn‚Äôt that big a deal. The only time it really bothers me is when somebody goes out of their way to make fun of me
TBH it sounds like you're the one who's awesome and handled the situation like a boss!
My Rheumatologist both times that I have seen her since coming out, while being pleasant in demeanor has misgendered me when doing the post appointment summary for her records. She rapid fires the masculine pronouns and it's like having a pallet of bricks getting dropped on your chest repeatedly. I don't think it's done to be malicious but it still hurts none-the-less.
Yes, precisely.

Edit: Misread the question, haha. No, only our nouns, adjectives and substantives are gendered (feminine and masculine). Our verbs aren't gendered. But in my talk with my doctor, we were using adjectives. 
I'm so sorry for the fuss, everyone, haha.
dzien dobry
I‚Äôm glad I half ass tried to learn German so I could know other languages have gendered words
Yes, exactly. My point is sometimes these things can go right and even make us feel good - because there are people out there making an effort to do their best to respect us, our identity and who we are. 
Same here, I absolutely hate when people weaponize pronouns aka deliberately misgendering someone just to hurt them/get to them, it's messed up.
This is huge
Really? Thank you so much, haha!
I'm so sorry to hear that. That's awful, I know what you mean, maybe you could try correcting her or reminding her what your pronouns are? And if she cares (hopefully), she'll respect them and do her best remember who you are. 
It's most likely not meant to be malicious, but yes, it does hurt, I understand perfectly. Which is why I really suggest you bring this topic into discussion during your next appointment, so that you don't feel anymore unnecessarily hurt. You deserve to feel good and respected.
French?
Witom :3
Jak siƒô macie siƒô?

M√≥j polskie nie jest dobry.
French is a Romance language, which uses gendered nouns and adjectives, though not verbs.
Nope, haha.
I feel excluded here
C‚Äôest ma langue maternelle lol

Pis c‚Äôest laid comme langue

(It‚Äôs my original language and it‚Äôs ugly)
You have gendered forms for verbs in french, which are based on the gender of the subject

""My cat traveled to the library, it drank a lot of tequila and died""
correct? (spanish is really close to french after all)
My cat works in the library. He drank a lot of tequila. He is dead.

I used to work with a lot of Mexican ladies that didn‚Äôt speak English. I pieced together this ridiculous statement from my brief study of Spanish in high school to make them laugh. It worked every time. :)"	svrufi	trans	496	0.98	2022-02-18 20:39:40
A message to those who worries they are a 'transtrender'	"Do you remember that first time you looked at yourself as another gender on FaceApp and felt all warm and fuzzy inside? Do you remember the time you got called ""mate""/love"" by someone in the store and it felt wrong? **CIS PEOPLE DO NOT. I REPEAT DO NOT. EXPERIENCE THIS.** They hate the idea of being seen as any other gender, they WANT to be seen as their gender. They would never feel euphoria over being a woman. They could be gender-fluid, but that's not cis. So even if your euphoria isn't as strong in one moment, that doesn't invalidate the times it was.

And, another thing: **DYSPHORIA DISGUISES ITSELF AS OTHER CONDITIONS.** Did you ever feel suicidal and had no idea why? Did you ever depersonalize from your body and feel like it didn't need taking care of? No wonder. It can mask very well as other things but that doesn't change the facts.

Hey, It's normal to feel doubt, to feel like your invading, to feel like you're not the ""real"" version of the gender you're starting to identify as, and the worst part is that the anxiety of being the other gender can often feel like dysphoria, because dysphoria feels uncomfortable and anxious, but that doesn't mean you're actually experiencing dysphoria, you could just be feeling anxious and scared to show people your real self! It's confusing, I know, and if you're still not sure, you can ""soft-transition"" in a way which is completely reversible, until you become more certain.

Take your time, there's no rush, some times you may feel like you want to buy everything and do everything typical of your gender, and other times you'll question yourself and pull back. That's normal, it's an experience, and it's scary, but a cis person would not feel euphoric about being the other gender, and certainly would not feel put off by acting in a way typical of their assigned gender. You're valid, and i love you xo

EDIT: As /u/kidunfolded has pointed out, it's completely valid if it ends up you are cis! don't force yourself into any box or label that's what i'm trying to say here!"	"When it comes to doubts the thing I keep coming back to is this: CIS people don‚Äôt worry that they‚Äôre wrong.
I have known (or at least had a strong suspicion) for awhile, but the first time a stranger called me boss as a greeting I was so euphoric I rode that high for the rest of the night
I think it‚Äôs important to remember that ‚Äòtranstrender‚Äô is a term made up by transphobes to make us all sound like we‚Äôre weak minded at best and mentally ill at worst. The word was made up by people who hate us and want us eradicated from society. It‚Äôs bullshit. Don‚Äôt let it get to you.
Thanks for this post, saved for dark times. So validating.
Yeah, honestly I had one of those moments that kinda solidified it for me. I came out as questioning leaning heavily towards mtf and basically, she and I were talking and she offered to do my makeup and eyebrows and like we're gonna go get piercings together and she's even gonna let me try on a dress of hers. I had the biggest fucking grin on my face at 2 am and at that moment I kinda had no way to rationalize it
Yes to all of this except Faceapp. That shit creeped me out lmao. Uncanny valley üòñ
yeah this totally makes sense. but I'd be careful of the narrative that ""cis people don't question their gender,"" because they're just not true. it's toxic and misleading to tell a cis person who is questioning their gender that the simple act of questioning means they're trans. sometimes people just question and come to the conclusion they're still cis. and that's okay. not that you're making that narrative! just something important and something I see a lot
I really needed to hear this thank you.üòä well read i guess lol
well i had the doubt... went to therapy  and I have gender disphoria... now I am on baby steps.
What is ""soft transitioning?"" I'm terrified of making a big decision and regretting it
How to know if you're a ""trans tender"".
You aren't, this is just an invented problem by people like Blair white.
I have been in a lot of doubt recently because I am still ‚Äúdiscovering‚Äù myself. So excited to finally  talk to a therapist next week. I think it might help justify my feelings.
Thank you for this! I've been going through a lot of doubt as of late and been feeling really down on myself. Its definitely a long process and a large part of me wishes I wasn't afraid to explore this earlier in life. It would've saved a lot of heartache.

That being said the more comfortable I get with myself the better and less chaotic I feel. I'm finally on my way to finding peace and it's all because of amazing people like you OP that I even get the chance to.
Omg thank u so much for this!! There are times when I'm really scared to say who I am in public but this have me the confidence I need!! Thanks so much!!
I must confess I sometimes, over the years, thought maybe it's just my way of dealing with being with another guy, then I realize I have no problem having a boyfriend anymore but I have a big grin when someone calls me madam from behind because of my long hair.
It's one of those ""time to look into the next move"" moments, that convince me I'm doing the right thing, and that being depressed is NOT a normal state of being.
Only took 45 years to actually do anything but hey I'll only human, mostly.
idk if it's a good idea to like, try to put so much stock in the notion of dysphoria (or even suffering in general). the idea of dysphoria is a necessary medicalization of our condition which does not benefit us.

the truth is that gender is a social contrivance, one that causes us misery to adhere to, at least as we're commanded to. i think trying to chart out whether or not dysphoria is ""disguised"" as something else is admitting that it actually isn't dysphoria in the first place. it's an attempt to try to expand this one category across all experiences and that just won't work.

simply put, people can change their gender for any reason, and they don't need to experience medically-legitimate suffering in order to justify the change. even if they're not uncomfortable with their assigned gender but would prefer a different one, that's valid.

otherwise, great post.
I am crying. Thank u
> Do you remember the time you got called ""mate""/love"" by someone in the store and it felt wrong?

I'm oddly pleased to see that I'm not the only one who sees ""mate"" as gendered
>Did you ever depersonalize from your body and feel like it didn't need taking care of?

fuck
>Did you ever depersonalize from your body and feel like it didn't need taking care of?

This week on: Depression or Dysphoria?
cis people wouldnt start a reddit account off of their main to stalk trans reddits and explore their identity

oh fuck...
 So is it normal to have any of some sort of fantasy to be the other sex? Because do cis people not really think about being the other gender? And there is this scary thought ""is this a just phase?"" Because I really want to be the other gender but there is always that thought that I might regret it when i'm older like later in my twenties.
>DYSPHORIA DISGUISES ITSELF AS OTHER CONDITIONS.

I've had anxiety symptoms for about a year and i never knew why, until about a month ago

Which coincidently was when i started to accept myself for who i am

Still learning so much, but i know myself pretty well, and am proud of who i am.

and the whole doubts thing, i get doubts quite a lot so seeing this post was quite reassuring :)
I was having doubts but somebody sent me this post and I did some reflection. To say the least I‚Äôve definitely had some obvious signs such as literally cross dressing when I was younger and I could get away with it, idk if this confirms anything but ima try to get my hands on femme clothing and just see where that takes me
This is going to help so many people. Actually it has helped me when you stated that being anxious about being the opposite gender doesn‚Äôt mean that you‚Äôre not trans it just means you could be scared. I‚Äôve been feeling a lot of anxiety about becoming a boy and I‚Äôve been linking it with the fact that I‚Äôm scared to show my family who I am. Thank you friend
Im still scared and confuzzled, lads
Cis people don't spend time on this sub relating to the content.
exactly!!!
Yes, we do. All the time. Then we move on.
YESS!! and that's the moments we live for!!
YES! YES! AND YES! Though on the flip side, don't ever feel pressured to fit yourself into a label just because you once thought you were that, no one deserves to put that much pressure on themselves  üòò
Who puts themselves through the agony of coming out trans for the sake of being trendy? No one! People are coming out more because we actually feel safe. If id have felt safe in 1996, I'd have been wearing dresses in pre school!
No problem, and this was a little self-validating for myself too, so if you ever wanna vent just message me personally and i'll listen xo
Love those moments!! Like where its so hard to sleep because you're so excited to wake up the next day and present as your true gender, its so special. Being trans is always betrayed as being a really horrible thing in the media but there's so many happy moments like that so I just can't relate üò≠
Haha that's fine too! Just because you don't experience everything I typed out that doesn't make you any less valid either üíóüíó
same i really just didn‚Äôt like how i looked lmao
Okay sooo, i totally see where you're coming from!! but i also think that we should still include those who are questioning because well, two reasons primarily: a. thats what the Q in LGBTQ+ stands for, and b. they are still going to be facing issues which we face. i mean if you're questioning your gender that means you're going to be tackling with understanding dysphoria/euphoria and what gender actually *means.* I understand what you mean though, i'm gonna be more careful in the future i think.
Making changes to your gender identity and appearance that dont require a big commitment so you can see and experiment with what youre comfortable with. They can be things like getting a new hairstyle, wearing the clothes of your gender occasionally, changing your name on the internet, etc.
SAY IT LOUDER FOR THE PEOPLE IN THE BACK
hahah, depression is also a symptom of dysphoria so it could be both, but if you relate to other symptoms it's very likely dysphoria.
From what I'm aware, this is not normal behaviour for cis people. But I don't know. My advice is to use FaceApp to see how you luck as the opposite sex, see how it makes you feel if you were to be seen like that everyday. Also expiriment with wigs and women's clothing. If it makes you feel really good inside, chances are you're trans. but, that still won't stop that nagging feeling, it'll only suppress it. good luck xx
That's where you're wrong! 
  
I check Egg_IRL every day for new relatable content and I'm cis as hell! 
  
Checkmate. 
  
Wait. 
  
Oh god.
uh... \*looks both ways\*
Around this time, 96-99 my mum asked me one night if I wanted to be a girl (there were some signs) ... I said no, chances are if things were more like today and I felt the rest of my family to be accepting my answer might have been different.
for real though. those who think transitioning is trendy.... have no freakin' idea how scary it is, and just how much privilege as a *human* you lose.

the best quote i've read on a subreddit regarding this is... we spend so much of our time and money transitioning into the bottom of the social hierarchy.

trendy... lmfao.
Internalized homophobia to a degree. In our culture feminine for a male is synonymous with being gay. And yeahhhhh culture sorta teaches us to avoid being marginalized if possibly. It‚Äôs like in the back of our minds. I know that sex and gender are completely different but yeah I dunno. Would we have so many people transitioning if we just lived in a society that wasn‚Äôt so vindictive towards men expressing femininity? I feel like once your trans you have more permission to do what you want. I‚Äôm certainly not cis, but does that mean I need HRT? I‚Äôm kinda okay with being in the middle when I want and passing as a soft male most the time. As long as I can mostly pass when I choose to express and dress.
mmhmm I totally agree! questioning people are valid and belong with us! their problems are our problems. my point was just, it's okay if those people stop questioning because they've arrived at the conclusion that they're cis/straight. we shouldn't make the case that a ""true cis person"" wouldn't question their gender, and that doing so makes you trans. glad you agree with me!
Ah ok, thanks!
Ok thx for the assurance. Now all I gotta do is not get caught by my mom.
haha same... errr... shit.
That could very well be it for you. However, it's important not to dismiss the trans experience as internalized homophobia, as it could give phobes a weapon to dismiss how we feel and who we are. If you are okay without HRT, there's no rush to. You can go as far as you feel you want to, and assign yourself any label/pronoun you want. good luck xxxx
ohh okay yeah I might edit my post, u make good points :)
cool! nice talking to you friend :)"	m6mzw3	trans	490	0.99	2021-03-16 23:55:33
Mom made me feel really f*cking gross on vacation...	"I'm (30mtf) on vacation with my family and my mom pulls me aside and tells me how worried she is about me. Says she's worried about me selling my house, changing career paths, etc like this all seems like a ""step down."" Then she starts going into all these trans people she knows and works with and how they all seem so much happier and relaxed after they transition, and how I seem more stressed out and unhappy. I love her and I know she's trying but... oof that one hurt. I hate how much we have to ""prove"" our happiness to cis people in order to be valid.

I feel really gross and invalid right now, and I feel like this just shows me that she doesn't know me at all. I think I'm gonna get on a plane and head home early, and tell her I need space for a while. I'm worried about how she'll react to that. Could use some validation and support in the meantime.


EDIT for more context and clarity after sleeping on it (long):

Honestly this was kind of a last straw. Many members of my family have said and done things that show me that they do not understand me or trans people as much as I thought they did. Based on what I've seen of how they communicate, I'm not sure if trying to have a heart-to-heart with them will help or make things much worse, and rn I don't think I am in a place for that to happen. I've been very anxious around them and the thought of spending another week with them is starting to make my stomach churn. I think this is what she is picking up on.

Also, I AM happier. Much happier. I am also sadder, more excited, more nervous, more angry, more awake, and more connected. I was numb before and now all the emotions that I surpressed for 28 years are coming out all at once, and that's not always pretty. I've explained this to her multiple times and it hurts and confuses me that she doesn't see that. 

I'm changing careers because I experienced AWFUL transphobia at the old one, and I'm selling because I can't afford the mortgage anymore due to the career change (I'm going from being a teacher to being a hairstylist). And yeah, that's stressful and scary. I'm trading the safe and secure white picket fence upper middle-class lifestyle for something that feels more real. Trying to lead that life was killing me and she won't see that. It's starting to feel like she cared more about me living that life than my own fulfillment.

In any case, now is not the time to address this because this has put me in such a bad place. I need time away to process what kind of relationship I want with my family and how to communicate that."	"Just because you are transitioning doesn't mean you're automatically gonna feel happier and that be your only emotion. Your life has other variables and other reasons to be stressed out. Your choices in life are the choices you choose, and even though they might be stressful, you know whats good for you. I understand her worry but she would respect you're very much an adult and that you know what you're doing. I'm not sure what she is implying here but either way you deserve space from her if you feel you need some. 

I hope things go alright for you and that space apart helps out!
Am I happier being trans? Yes. Does that mean I'm always happy? No. Are cis people always happy?

One reason those other trans folk might be happier is that they also might have the love and support of their family. My transition has been so much easier because of the wonderful people who support me and that sure helps.

You are awesome, sister, hope you can enjoy the rest of your vacation or get out of there if that's what you need to do
Sometimes transition solves 90% of your problems.
Sometimes it solves 10%.
It might be worth talking to her about it. You say you hate having to perform happiness to be seen as valid but she may not have been questioning your validity. It really sounds like she's just worried and is trying to understand why it seems harder for you than for others.

Also it would be good to remind her that she doesn't see all the messy complexity that the other trans people she knows are going through. Being trans can be hard as hell.
Your life is YOURS and you don‚Äôt owe anybody anything. Tombstone gonna have your name on it and nobody else‚Äôs. Live your life, sis! We don‚Äôt owe them exuberance, femininity, nothing.
Tell her that transitioning is wonderful, but also not a happiness button.
idk if this is the case for you but my parents always tell me i seem more unhappy after ""coming out"" to them as trans, when i should be relieved that i don't have to hide that part of me anymore, but in reality i can never gush about the thing that make me happy about being trans because they're not supportive and get uncomfortable so i always have to shut up about it.
With other supportive people in my life i feel more comfortable to talk about my identity and expressing the things that make me happy.

Maybe your mom hasn't built a safe space for you to feel comfortable expressing happiness for being trans around her.
Have you given her any reason to think you're unhappy or is she projecting? If you're happy with your life then tell her that! If she doesn't believe that you are happy with your life that's her delusion. It's your life live it for you.
She‚Äôs got mom tunnel vision and is only taking into account parts of your life she directly sees. Just like she‚Äôs only seeing the outward parts of the trans people she works with, she has no idea if they cry themselves to sleep every night or are generally unhappy when they aren‚Äôt faking it at work. Clearly not factoring in the state of the world, which is absolutely miserable, and how hard it is to be 30 these days. If you already have a house which you are in a position to sell, you are clearly doing well for yourself. Our parents never had to switch careers when they were our age and now it is extremely common and almost expected for people to switch careers multiple times between 20-40. Change is hard for everyone but necessary to survival. Go home if you want to, maybe if it makes her feel bad she‚Äôll learn to not make unsolicited comments like this. But if staying will make you feel worse don‚Äôt put her feelings above your own.
If you don't feel comfortable telling her how much her words hurt, then yea might be an idea to go home early.

You shouldn't have to put up with that sort of nonsense, she's your mother and needs to learn how to support you properly instead of making you feel worse.

I hope things work out better for you ~
You really need to communicate with her. Running and getting ‚Äúspace‚Äù when she is worried for you as a mother seems extreme if you haven‚Äôt at least tried to talk to her. 

I mean, it‚Äôs obviously possible you‚Äôre leaving out other issues, but the way you described her makes her sound supportive but concerned about your happiness and mental state, not suggesting you shouldn‚Äôt transition. If you don‚Äôt communicate with her, she can‚Äôt possibly know that either A) you‚Äôre actually happier or B) the reasons why you might still seem stressed.
When I (34) came out to my parents, I was surprised with how little they seemed to understand me. This was because I had been hiding myself from them for most of my life - since I was young, when they told me I was too sensitive, or ‚Äòsmarter‚Äô than getting a B+ in fourth grade math. The over-achieving quiet ‚Äòmature‚Äô obedient woman they knew was not the real me but a repressed, depressed, numbed out version of me. Now that I had shown them a new side of myself, they‚Äôre reaction made me realize I would regress and be stifled by them if I didn‚Äôt take some time and distance from them. I think you have a better idea of what you want from life than your family does. Do what you got to do, with an eye towards, hopefully, one day reintroducing yourself.
I‚Äôm just saying this as a reminder how you showed yourself to others before transitioning to after beginning. From a parents stand point they have no idea what you‚Äôre going through as it‚Äôs given them the most information was that you weren‚Äôt happy who you were before. logical reasoning you were unhappy . Now that you are transitioning they can try to learn more about who you want to be.  Parents are going to worry, even if you didn‚Äôt tell them things are going bad for you . Any info they get about the trans community that is negative they are going to worry if it were to happen to you. Because one thing I‚Äôve heard in the past is that some that do transition   Leave their past life behind as who they used to be a do not wish to associate with you they were. But you‚Äôre knew you the best at that time . (Generally speaking :just depends on time of transitioning that differs) help them understand how you feel now and things will be better  and find a balance to what you share with them. But at some point in life your parents will want to reminisce of the past but if you deny it as it both had some good and bad memories  do it for the parents that love and support you throughout your life on all fronts

You could tell her there are definitely trans people who are much much happier because they cut off unsupportive  family  and that *she* is one of the reasons you're stressed out and anxious :) 

I know I'm kinda snarky and wording it that way would probably make it worse but living your life on your terms means making changes and change is hard and scary and stressful. I hope you can convince her to back off
Sometimes I read these stories and wonder if I'm the lucky one my whole family just outright disowned me (minus my brother and sister).
You deserve to be treated better, and I'm glad you're setting boundaries around how you will let yourself be treated
Also sorry if this doesn't make too much sense or repeats I just woke up-
Happiness begins when we go through much healing and finally feel in a safe and secure place with our lives and futures. I have many happy days compared to what I used to have, but I‚Äôm not always happy and am stressed a lot cause some of these conditions aren‚Äôt met.  But I agree OP is very much a adult and ops mom shouldn‚Äôt be trying to make her feel bad about her transition, its awful that she did that ):
Also, she works with the other trans people. They‚Äôre not part of her family. She‚Äôs only seeing one side of them. I know that when I‚Äôm at work I tend to only show a ‚Äúhappy‚Äù side of myself, whereas if I‚Äôm with family or close friends it‚Äôs a lot easier to take that mask off and express real emotions.
And if you‚Äôre unhappy, is it simply ‚ÄúI am alive in the Roaring What the Effs‚Äù? Because with inflation and gas prices and the supply chain and (the rest may be US centric) one senator basically ending hope of climate change action from the government as red states race to make the most extreme laws and‚Ä¶ 

When the world is off-balance, we get off balanced. Unfortunately, people outside ourselves tend to blame effects of world stress (possibly combined with pressures in your job sector that are universal, and whatever other groups you‚Äôre in where outside factors shifting changes plans) on. Whatever they see as our chosen or most recent personal choice. 

Or personal trait, as usually it‚Äôs been whatever disability of mine forced me to use some accommodation that I probably forgot about 5 seconds after I finished the task but reminded them that I am in a minority somewhere and like, surely we must assume that the average of every minority is above average in happiness, generosity, grit, intelligence, and every other positive trait (especially when 2 positive traits are actually impossible to do at once! You must give the shirt off your back and never spend a cent on a not totally necessary shirt and up cycle the scraps of the shirt that gave at the seams from age while always presenting neat and tidy!)

No, Grandma, x isn‚Äôt because I‚Äôm vegetarian now. Yeah, this professor‚Äôs grading metrics are well known to be impossible and everyone plows through this requirement while complaining, liberally. They just redid the algorithms for this site I need to promote x, and I need to figure out how to adjust, that isn‚Äôt related to LGBTQAI, Mom. A jar of peanut butter is what? Well, guess I no longer digest fatty foods comfortably‚Ä¶ 

They never ping the stressor correctly for me. It‚Äôs life.
Omfg you just described my current situation to a T. Thank you so much for sharing your story.

For me to get them to understand who I truly am, I would have to go to back so far in time and explain how much I repressed around them that the thought of their reaction to that gives me a ton of anxiety. I don't think they'd believe me. I just understand so little about myself still, and I seek their approval so much, that the only way for me to truly understand myself is getting some distance so I'm not living in their heads so much. And right now I just have to live with them not understanding that.

Good luck in your own journey, I hope that you find somewhere where you can express your true self, whether that be with your biological family or chosen family.
Not only does she work with other trans people, she's a doctor who provides them with medical care. (She's an obstetrician and a decent chunk of her patients are trans men because she is fairly progressive for where she lives). Of course they're going to perform happiness for her. We do so much to prove we're valid to the medical profession. I've had doctors tell me I seem way happier. I'd bet money a lot of those trans men she's talking about have had this exact conversation with their families.
It's weird because I'm only partially out, like I just finished telling my close family, and I've told two people at work so basically I have to kind of still dance around like I don't know who it's okay to tell. It's still going to be a very long time before I actually would've needed to tell anyone but it's all very stressful sorry. I am significantly happier as Gloria even though I look 100% male

I'm scared to be in my country	"I live in Britain and my government seem to be proud of their transphobia. Rishi Sunak (current pm) has recently said he's going to review the Equality Act to make it clear that sex means biological sex and not gender. He's going to remove trans people from the Equality Act meaning all trans people in this country, transitioned or not, are going to have our rights of safety removed. 

I could be kicked out of education, denied medical need, denied a job all because I'm trans. I do hope my transphobic government know this is endangering many lives, not like they care and we can't even protest against it because they made protesting illegal. I can't stand this country and knowing that my life and many other's lives are going to be at risk..I'm terrified of living here.

ETA - Protesting isn't illegal but being loud during it is and police can search you if they think you're protesting 

ETA part 2 - I currently can't move out of Britain as I'm in education and don't have a job but I do plan to leave as soon as I can

I spoke to some of my friends in the UK about this, and they said something that I think might help you feel a bit safer, at least in the short term.

According to my (also trans) friends, it's very unlikely that the changes to the equalities act would be approved by parliament. They would be unpopular, even among tory MPs, and if Sunak tried to remove trans people from the equalities act without consulting parliament, it would cause a revolt because the government being able to take people's rights away in that way would look unacceptable, even to a lot of tories.

So like obviously the situation in the UK is completely unacceptable, and something needs to be done about it. I feel so much for all my trans siblings there. But hopefully this goes some way to helping you feel safer, at least in terms of the equalities act.
Yeah the nickname for the uk is terf island, its famous for its transphobia
So much of the work is heading in a dark direction. Personally, I‚Äôd be making plans to leave. Australia is nice, hopefully it stays that way.
Same, i live in the uk, really worried at the moment.
come to the netherlands
As a disabled person, I can unfortunately attest to the validity and seriousness of your fears. During the Global Financial Crisis, the British Government brought in all kinds of ""austerity measures"". Tens of thousands of people were kicked off welfare they couldn't survive without. Thousands of disabled people died. I lost quite a few dear friends. It was horrific and thry got away with it by turning abled people against us.

There was an intensive media campaign, fear-mongering about ""welfare cheats"" and ""disability fakers"", claiming that they made up a huge percentage of welfare recipients, when in reality, they're actually very rare. It was already extremely difficult to access support, even before the GFC. When the austerity measures were implemented, it became literally impossible for most of us and people everywhere were on the hunt for supposed ""disability fakers"". It was terrifying.

A friend of mine was assaulted by a group of strangers in the supermarket because she stood up from her wheelchair to reach an item on a high shelf. Another was assaulted and had her guide dog forcibly taken from her by strangers at a train station because someone saw her using a mobile phone (because assistive tech on phones for blind people isn't a thing, I guess?). Another had police called on him for using accessible parking and was prevented from leaving until they arrived, even though he clearly had a valid permit displayed. His treatment by the officers who attended was equally appalling.

The same playbook is being used against trans people now. It's harrowing just how well-trodden this path is. They know extremely well what they're doing. They're experts at it, by this point.
If you are English you can move to Scotland and then become Scottish! Help us vote for independence and then you'll be free from that hellhole.
holly fuck i‚Äôm so sorry to hear that:( i pray for you guys üôè
The Tory party are sick, evil malcontents. It‚Äôs not enough to casually consign thousands to a lonely death while they party on, they have to actively target a minuscule percentage of the population out of deliberate cruelty.

 When it comes to Tories, the cruelty is the point.
That‚Äôs a massive human rights violation.
WAIT WHAT ABOUT PROTESTING?????
The world is turning to sh*t as we inch closer to WWIII!!!
Every time I hear something about the UK, I see more and more where the US gets it‚Ä¶. Stay safe my friend.
Yes in live in Manchester and it‚Äôs quite terrible
Germany isn't quite better unforunately.
Yeah the current government is nice to LGBTQ (thanks to ""die Gr√ºne"") but a there is growing discontent.
The ""CDU"" saw a growth of voters since last election unforunately..

But stay safe üè≥Ô∏è‚Äç‚ößÔ∏è Hope you get out of the UK asap üôè   üè≥Ô∏è‚Äç‚ößÔ∏èüíÆüè≥Ô∏è‚Äç‚ößÔ∏è
I am so sorry you‚Äôve had to endure this. There are states in the US that are passing very oppressive and discriminatory laws, but we do have sanctuary states, thankfully. I just hate this trend of trans people being political targets. This should not happen anywhere. I hope you have a solid support system that can help.
I‚Äôm not advising arson, but Britain and burn both start with b.
I live in the state of Florida. The governor here is refusing healthcare to trans children and would like trans adults to have to register like a sex offender. no way in hell will I ever register. I have not committed any crimes.
Sorry to hear that... I wish you much success. Stay safe... Hope that this transhobic policy finally stops
I live in the UK, and I'm currently scouting for asylum destinations .
I hate Britain so much, are you stuck there
You and your family are always welcome in Colorado U.S.A. it may not be much better here in the U.S. but here in Colorado specifically our state government, who stands with the trans community, is pretty much guaranteed to be in power for at least another decade if not more due to gerrymandering etc. 

Im so sorry you have to go through this. And if you decide to stay and fight the good fight just know you have compassion and support from all over the world. <3
*Cries in US lmfao
Brit here too, it‚Äôs scary and I heard about this a few weeks back. There was a petition around the time they where reviewing the acts but I‚Äôm not sure if it got passed or not . Fingers crossed
I guess its not the best timing on my end to figure myself out :D

Gotta love it.
What exactly do they think biological sex even is?
Thats one hell of a human rights violation
I'm so sorry you don't feel safe!  You are seen, you are loved.
I also live here and fear for my rights. Things have always been bad before but it just feels like they keep getting even worse
This is just an idea how about we take the governments fancy paychecks and security away and then see if they are so inclined to start stripping other peoples rights
I have a question and forgive me if it sounds dumb but I thought the King/Queen can have influence on some policies in the UK? I thought they were lgbt friendly. Can someone help me understand this
I literally feel the same way but the cis people in my life don't think anything bad is going to happen. I know they're trying to help me feel better but Idk.. sometimes I feel like they don't understand why these threats worry me so much. Even if they don't actually do anything, the fact that they can make those threats so openly is already scary
Yall should come to a country that is open to all in the LGBTQIA2+ Community and inclusive and open to those seeking asylum.... and I don't just mean US, you got Ireland, Netherlands, Norway, Finland, Germany, Brazil, New Zealand, USA, Thailand, France, Spain, etc..... You are safe on here and we see you and hear you.... we validate your womanhood and any truama you have experienced in your life..... We love you.... So hun please stay safe, and continue to be the woman you are.... üòò ‚ò∫ ü§ó ‚ô• ‚ô• ‚ô• ‚ô• ‚ô•
I was already denied service from my GP for being trans lol time to leave this world.
Tbh, I'm reading through this and can't understand how he's making it unsafe for trans people. Saying sex does not equal gender is a true statement. Can someone explain better? I don't know anything about British politics.
Have you thought of finding somewhere trans friendly and moving there?
There's always Canada. You'll have the benefit of coming from a commonwealth nation, and depending on education get preferential immigration. I find even the most backward places here are pretty tolerant.
I‚Äôm so sorry!  It‚Äôs bad everywhere incl USA
British govt not be corrupt and abuse it's citizens challenge level(impossible)
Yeah, it's rather depressing. Try stay strong, it's what I'm doing.
I think it‚Äôs time to rename my Canadian province of British Columbia to something less offensive. The Brits came here and destroyed aboriginal culture including their trans inclusiveness. I don‚Äôt want to be associated in anyway with Britain or their fucked up Royal family.
I‚Äôm officially glad I plan on moving when I‚Äôm 19
Understandable (I'm in the UK too) however you should know that those threats are meaningless. Biological sex doesn't really have a legal meaning, and the closest thing to it is what the equalities act already uses, so there isn't really much to be done there. That's not to say that their open transphobia isn't still scary, it's just that their threads of action aren't anything to be worried about, at least for the time being.
Rishi is being a bit of a naughty asshole, but right now it feels like a lot of talk. There are serious obstacles to him inacting those plans. So while it is a concern, you probably don't need to be scared.

The uk is for the most part a safe place to live. So don't let a stinky tory stop you living your best life.

With a bit of luck he will lose his job in a year or so and it will be back to business as usual
I'm an American so take what I say with a grain of salt, but I've heard Scotland tends to be a lot more progressive, especially in terms of it's government, if you have the ability and want to move. The state I live in the U.S. doesn't include trans people in it's anti-discrimination laws, so you just gotta try to stay strong and find safe places where you live, if it makes you feel better just remember that these anti-trans laws are backlash to growing acceptance, so these laws won't last forever
Can someone explain exactly how it will affect me? 

Because It sounds like it won‚Äôt much at all, I‚Äôm legally a girl. I was born a boy. 

So yeah what am I missing?
Feeling this, im also from the uk. I didnt know he was this bad, i knew him an liz truss we're transphobic but not to this extent.

This country is my home, i love it but this is why i hate it. We already feel trapped and unsafe in our own bodies so why is it fair that we feel the same way in a country we should be able to call home!
Thank you. That does make me feel safer
This is what gives me some kind of hope. Whilst Sunak might want to do this by himself, it would be horrifically unpopular and be the equivalent of international politics suicide. Cameron first brought this up back in his tenure, every Tory PM has mentioned it, but it hasn't happened so I doubt it will
why do they think any Tory MPs give a shit about trans people? they don't. even most of the opposition doesn't.
I too left the uk 4 years ago for similar reasons, I now permanently reside in France where trans people widely accepted. The best move I ever made, I‚Äôm the happiest I‚Äôve been in years üòò
That sums up the UK, mainly Britain, perfectly
I'd say Terf government island because not every person there is a Terf but yeah Terf island sums it up pretty well.
I already have plans of moving away but right now I want to pass college and then I'll focus on moving away
The coalition is virtually unelectable rn, and given the general attitude last election I don‚Äôt think we have to worry to much
Please stay safe, I have full hope that in 2024 we all avoid voting for the Tories
That is the country i plan to move to. That or Norway, both are amazing countries
Thank you for the reminder that solidarity is crucial to our safety. Its an important lesson for queer people around the world to remember that if another marginalized group is being targeted for genocide, it is only a matter of time until the weapons they develop to do that are turned on another group, possibly us. 

This is personally why i think when it comes to activism, disabled people should be included in the lgbt movement explicitly. We have 1 crucial thing in common, a need to protect our rights to exist as human beings against state power and hatemongering
I'll keep that in mind, thank you
Thank you, hopefully this won't happen but knowing the Tories, it will
It is, it makes me so angry but if history class taught me anything is that when you take away rights from minorities we just fight hard and prevail. I just hate how it has to come to this but I‚Äôll protest and do whatever it takes to defend my trans youth community and older trans community. üè≥Ô∏è‚Äç‚ößÔ∏è
Most things they've done are. They don't care for the country they care for the money
If I've learnt anything, this means nothing if the population in power doesn't think its a base human right. There is no concept of human rights set in stone, even what is laid out by the UN changes.

Look at countries such as Qatar, they do not believe it is a human right to be queer. 

I personally believe this contributes to these discussions internationally fall apart. Western cultures create this idea of what a human right is and other countries don't agree. 

I believe it is a massive human right violation but MANY people don't, and they won't listen to that
Protesting isn't illegal but making loud noise during it is and police can search you if they think you're protesting. So, we aren't allowed to be loud during protests
yeah because that has ever worked for us in the UK
We aren't learning from history so we're just repeating it
We're just the America of Europe
The UK is getting it from the US. Specifically US evangelicals and libertarian thinktanks. Same place the US gets it from

Thank you that means a lot. I'm going to stay for a bit and try to fight back
I'm sure everything will be okay. If he, or any government, manages to pass this and remove our rights i know that no one will be okay with it and there will be many, many strikes and protests
I'm guessing what you're born as and ""What's in your pants"". The articles all spoke about banning trans people, mainly trans women, from single sex areas, like banning trans women from women bathrooms to keep cis women 'safe'. So my guess is they follow to logic that if you were born a man, you're a man even if you have had surgery to turn into a woman and you now have woman's body parts you're still a man.
I completely agree
The king/queen is just a figure head. We have our own government. The leader of our country is called the Prime Minister, they are meant to lead the country until the next general vote but, as we have recently seen, that seems to be impossible seeing as we've had 3 within this one year. We have 4 major political parties: the Conservative (also known as Tories) are the current government in power, the Labour Party, the Green Party and the Lib-dem party. The Tories care more for money, the Labour Party more for the people, the Green Party care for the environment and the Lib-dems are a bit of both Tory and Labour. We also have different governments for different counties, so we have 2 separate votes. The main vote, deciding the next UK government and then the county vote, deciding which government will run the county you live in.

That is so gross, i am so sorry you had to go through that. Where does your GP live? I just want to talk to it
The Equality Act makes it illegal to discriminate against anyone. Him changing the act to make it clear that sex=biological/birth means people can say ""you're not a man because you're birth certificate says female, you can't use these male only spots"" no matter if you're transitioned or not or have a card saying that your sex is different than what's on your birth certificate. Doctors can refuse giving us treatment because we aren't what our birth certificate says we are. Doing this means that he can remove the gender identity part from the Equality Act and start banning us from same sex areas because our genders ‚â† our birth sex. He also openly says that this will prevent us from ""brainwashing"" the public
That is my plan for the future
I'll look into studying abroad in Canada for a bit
Moving is also one of my plans
Scotland is way better than Britain. I am so jealous of them and I feel sorry that they aren't independent from us. Wales has also proven to be better, same with Northern Ireland and Ireland
Also, Disclaimer that I‚Äôm American but Rishi Sunak has been criticized for being ‚ÄúMIA‚Äù. He has way bigger fish to fry than passing bigoted legislation, which would be bad for his optics. Even conservatives are mad at him about not doing anything. I don‚Äôt think he *could* do anything
It's not that they give a shit exactly. A few of them might, but no, for the most part they don't particularly. It's two things - on average, the UK population actually supports trans rights, so it would be an unpopular move to support restricting trans rights. And it sets a dangerous precedent, and at least in my friends' view, enough tory MPs care enough about the consequences of setting a precedent to strip people of their rights in that way. It could happen to other minority groups more easily if it happens to us.
Also jk rowling is a bitch, why would she interfere in every transgender solution
The UK is screwed economically for decades to come, so even without being lgbt is not going to be a good country to build your life in. I‚Äôd have left already if I was there for that alone.
Doesn‚Äôt even matter who we vote for anymore, Labour is currently no better than the tories. Our country is fucked.
don't go to the ""randstad"" but come to arnhem or smth in ""gelderland"" people are more chill there i've noticed
I mean...a ton of disabled people *are* LGBTQ+ people. People seem to forget that. There's an appalling amount of ableism and disableism in a lot of LGBTQ+ communities. We're routinely excluded from our own spaces.
Yeah! Scotland isn't too far and all the trans friendly regulation is awesome, England is burning and everyone that's good needs to jump ship lmao
That‚Äôs honestly just really sad‚Ä¶
I did not know about that, thats fucking awful. Thanks for explaining
Yeah, but still laws against are a really bad thing.
History does repeat. It‚Äôs just a question of when. We can only hope things stay stable in our lifetimes.

Arkansas, Texas, Alabama, Missouri and Tennessee too! It‚Äôs terrible. Florida is the worst! My trans senior is having to look for colleges in a state where she will be safe from this! Her family is considering moving too! So sad having to flee your state.
It's is happening to the children but he cannot do anything to the adults. But that won't stop him from trying. And this @sshole wants to be president. I hope he doesn't get in.
Good, that's okie dokie
So they're basically just deciding this despite biology being completely different all because of what some doctor says you are when you're born? Do they even know that intersex people exist?
Okay, that's terrible. I hope he's unsuccessful. Thank you for explaining.
There used to be this Tumblr called ‚Äútransgender housing network.‚Äù But it seems it is no more. Do you think Reddit would be a decent place to create such a group?
There's a serious shortage of people out west, and despite a few loud anti-trans folks (trust me, a very vocal, but also very small minority) and even some in power, our constitution and charter of rights provides built in institutional protection. 

For example, the Government of Alberta has recently been running ads across the country to try to attract workers, despite knowing that many of them would be left leaning.  Furthermore, it's very possible that after the next provincial election the NDP (think left of the aisle) party will gain control of the legislature again. The conservatives here have gone way off the rails.
Scotland once again being the most based country in the UK
sorry for being pessimistic but realistically Tories don't care. they are entirely morally bankrupt, they would be happy to take away the rights of other minority groups too if they were allowed. and unfortunately even though a small majority of the public may say they support trans rights, most of them are far too indifferent to actually do anything to protect our rights. support for trans people has also fallen dramatically over the last few years due to the relentless onslaught of transphobic bullshit from the British media.

I was born and raised here, i am unfortunately British. My family is here and i still live with them. I do plan to leave soon though, once i find a stable job and get the money too
at the very least, Labour is 'supposed' to care.

When we demand equality from Tories, they attack us.

When we demand equality from Labour (if/when they get in), hopefully they at least act like the US Democrats (i.e. mostly in favour of the status quo, not actively attacking us)
arnhem is based
is jumping ship to france also an option? since that's what i plan to do
The government hid it in another law. I forgot the law but they hid it in a law that improves this country so if anyone were against that particular part of it they could say ""so you don't want this bill to pass, so you don't care about Britain?""

It was, as usual, a disgusting thing they did
Congratulations be safe and make the best of it
This is true im not sure when i can get out of here im pushing to go through a divorce from my cisgender transphobic husband and move to Georgia idk how much better it will be but i have really supportive friends there
They probably don't know intersex people exist, in their minds you can be either male or female and that's it
Sorry i didn't explain it greatly. Thankfully, he needs to go through either the House of Commons or the House of Parliament to get this to pass (I'm not sure which one does it) so he needs the majority vote before he can pass it
I think it would be
What??
Should probably put quotes around this before you get downvoted into oblivion
Yeah, I understand the issue. There‚Äôs many British people here in Australia. The problem with emigrating is not just a job and money, but being eligible get in. Being young and qualified, in whatever the government happens to want, is very important. Definitely look into the requirements and plan ahead.
Bruuuuuuuh I said don't 108 days ago
I wouldn't, especially since the far right has begun to gain traction. Only places I recommend are Scotland, Brazil and Norway.
Anything in the Southern states is questionable. The colleges refuse to provide Gender Inclusive housing like the rest of the nation. It‚Äôs very frustrating and extremely homophobic!
[deleted]
Thank you, I'll look into it
hehe
Wouldn't recommend Brazil. They might have changed government but the far right is still very strong.
That's true i don't plan on going to college but i really don't have any other choice so i opted when i can to go to Georgia and live with my friend I've known him forever

If you live in a state with a ban on GAC, you can still get HRT through QueerMed, even as a minor.	"[QueerMed](https://queermed.com/) has been my provider for HRT for the past few months, and they're absolutely amazing. They take **most insurances** (as opposed to services like Folx or Plume), they do telehealth appointments with **no in-person visits required**, and their providers are on the cutting edge of trans healthcare, where most other providers (including Planned Parenthood) still use outdated target hormone ranges that keep patients at levels that are usually too low for transition.

They nominally only serve patients across the southeast US, but if you're outside of that area, keep reading.

I'll let them speak for themselves. They recently sent out a message to all patients (emphasis added):

>Dear Queermed patients and families:  
>  
>We are outraged and deeply saddened by the number of laws banning care for minors across the country.¬† We are monitoring the situation very closely, but please know:  
>  
>**WE WILL NOT STOP PROVIDING CARE FOR OUR PATIENTS.**¬†¬†  
>  
>As of today, we cannot prescribe any medications for patients under 18 who are located in Mississippi.¬† As of March 16, we will not be able to start medications for new patients under 18 in Florida,¬†but we can continue care for those already under treatment.¬†¬†  
>  
>You can still access gender affirming care, including puberty blockers and hormone therapy, as long as you¬†**verbally confirm that you are not in a state where it is banned**¬†at the¬†time of your televisit.¬† You could drive to a neighboring state and have your visit from there, it only matters where you are at the time of the visit.¬† **We rely on your report during the visit and have no¬†way of tracking your location.**  
>  
>We at Queermed will stand by you and continue to help those who need affirming care.  
>  
>In Solidarity,  
>  
>¬†\- The Queermed Team (Dr. Lowell, Dr. Leo, Chris Turner, Luke Scarborough, Janet Black, Al Samach, and Anna Cotton)

Again, all you need to do is **give your verbal assent** during your appointment that you're in a legal state. If you were to hypothetically lie about which state you're actually in, they have no way of verifying otherwise, and will be happy to give you your healthcare under the assumption you're in a legal state. Like most providers, they help you schedule lab work and such.

Do this at your own risk of course, but my understanding is that most laws targeting GAC focus on providers, not the patients, and if you have no other options to get HRT in your state, this might be a solution.

Even if your pharmacy is in a state with a GAC ban, they should still be able to fill your prescription from QueerMed (my pharmacy is in Texas, for example). If not, a mail pharmacy is also an option.

If you're in a state with a GAC ban but can't get out, check out QueerMed's website and see if they're right for you. If you have any more questions, please feel free to ask.

EDIT: Since this has been asked before, their self-pay pricing, with no insurance, is listed here:  [Self-Pay Pricing ‚Äì Queer Med](https://queermed.com/self-pay-pricing/). They also have an $80/month membership, similar to other services, that appears to include regular appointments, labs, prescriptions, the whole nine yards."	"This post should be pinned üìç
Hi.  I have noticed that insurance companies are delighted when a state bans certain care.  It means THEY don't have to pay... If the state bans GAC, such as HRT, then the companies don't have to pay(more money in their pockets) YET they charge the same rates. If YOU did that, the Government would call that double dipping and prosecute you.  BUT a company (aka insurance company) well that's ok they're just following the laws.

Hugs,

Michele
money? how much with no insurance?
i might switch from plume to this
Hell yes!!!
Great to hear!
_HELLS_ YEAH!!! ‚úä‚úäü©µü©∑ü§çü©∑ü©µ‚úä‚úä
What are the outdated target hormone ranges?
Sweet, another provider to look more into for when it's possible for me to start hrt. ü•∞
When I got that message from them, I interpreted it as as long as you tell us you're in a state without a ban, we can provide care. <wink,wink,nudge,nudge>
I might have to start using this. My current ""care"" leaves much to be desired. Thank you for pointing them out.
!remindme 2 months
I use QMed! Dr.Leo has always been super kind!
Thank you so much. It feels amazing to have a resource to recommend to people going through this.
That‚Äôs amazing to hear! Anyone have experience with them or know how feasible it would be to do this without the knowledge of family? Currently don‚Äôt have the funds to live on my own and was going to wait on HRT for once I moved out but if I can start it sooner I‚Äôd love to.
I love this we c ant be stopped
I was hoping this would happen.

You know what conservatives are doing with their witch hunt? They're cutting starfish in half.

I'd lol seriously if being trans took off as being more popular than regular cuz trying to regulating it made it explode in popularity.
absolutely. living in Florida and I have no doubts that the moment the ban on private insurance covering GAC passes, my insurance will be more than happy to drop coverage. only saving grace is that Amazon Pharmacy's Prime discount and GoodRx still exists, but it's gonna suck paying full price for lab work and such.
Their self-pay pricing is listed here: [https://queermed.com/self-pay-pricing/](https://queermed.com/self-pay-pricing/)

I'll paste the info here, for convenience:

FIRST VISIT: $299FOLLOW-UP VISITS: $149 ‚Äì $199

Expect 3-4 visits in the first year1-2 visits per year after that (after the first year, the total yearly cost for Self-Pay visits AND labs will be approximately $250-$500)

LABS: $99 for QMed pricing- Insurance may cover- Expect labs at every visit

This lines up with how much I've had to pay. They also have an $80/mo membership that includes all of the above, which might work out cheaper: [https://queermed.com/pricing/](https://queermed.com/pricing/)
Essentially, the target a lot of doctors use of <100 or even <200 pg/ml is outdated, since E levels in cis women are routinely higher and too little E is incapable of suppressing T on its own (monotherapy.) Subjective healthcare experience incoming:

My doctors at Planned Parenthood were trying to keep my E levels under 200 pg/ml. I had been on two patches twice weekly and my levels were around 330 pg/ml, which was suppressing my T without needing any blockers. They thought it was too high (despite their own ranges for cis E levels listing the mid-cycle range as anywhere from 64-357) and cut me down to one patch, which, you guessed it, stopped being high enough to suppress my T and I had to get back on blockers. 

I went back and forth with them over it for a while before going to QueerMed, where Dr. Chris Turner told me that PP and most other providers still uses outdated standards that aim to keep levels lower in trans women than they would be in cis women, and that my levels at 330 pg/ml on two patches were not only normal for cis women, but if they worked to suppress my T then clearly they were good levels for me. They even pointed out that mid-cycle is when most women tend to feel best, and it only makes sense to let my levels fall into that same range. 

Not sure if that answers your question, but I hope that helps!
Yes, came here to ask this! And what are QueerMed's preferred values?
That's exactly the way I interpreted it as well. They're clearly committed to helping anyone who needs this sort of care, even if they usually live in a state with a ban, and I think that's extremely commendable.
Not knowing your situation, off the top of my head I‚Äôd suggest doing appointments in your car, a friend‚Äôs car, or a friend‚Äôs house. As far as receiving supplies, I‚Äôd recommend a PO Box (find out if your supplier can deliver to a PO Box) or having them sent to a trusted friend‚Äôs house.
Seems more whack-a-mole than starfish to me, personally.
It's comforting knowing that, despite how aggressively conservatives have been targeting us lately, at the end of the day they're still absolutely shit at governing and, no matter how many ways they try to limit this care, there will always be ways for people to get it and for trans people to exist and flourish as we always have.
Honey, I live in RED State Texas.  East Texas.  Here we have the problem of only certain areas and certain drs. handles GAC.  You have to travel about 100 miles West or South as the closest doctors that provide ANY of the surgeries.  There is only 1 doctor in the East Texas area that handles trans patients. ALL BECAUSE OF THE RIDGID CONCSERVATIVES HERE. I have Humana, and they sent a letter stating if Texas bans gender care for minors, they will not pay for care even for adults.  YET their monthly rate will not go down, in fact it's going to go up.  OH! They Have To Comply With State Regs.  The less they have to cover the more goes in their pockets. WE THE PUBLIC HOWEVER WILL HAVE TO PAY MORE FOR LESS. WELL THAT SEEMS FAIR!!!(YEAH RIGHT!!!!!)

I'm 74, M2F, on HRT 6 months, I live and dress openly as a woman 24/7, and been out about a year.

Michele
thank you so much for helping! im am currently unable to work and even this amount of money is impossible for me. but it make me happy that people can access hrt. i just hope that one day i can work again or get to a state that will not deny me any economic help. i fear that in my current situation i might fall pray to myself before i can find help.
This is really helpful, thank you so much! Do you have any studies or medical evidence that shows this I could use to present to my doctor to advocate for an increased dose?
Had to do some research, but sure thing! Most trans healthcare providers use the targets set out in [this 2017 study by an Endocrine Society-appointed task force](https://academic.oup.com/jcem/article/102/11/3869/4157558) that states providers should ""maintain \[serum hormone levels\] at the level for premenopausal females (100 to 200 pg/mL \[for estradiol\] and <50 ng/dL \[for testosterone\], respectively.)"" Most other studies that cite the 100-200 range source back to this document. The emphasis in many of these studies is avoiding supraphysiological hormone levels.

**However,** [this study](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/0002937871909276) from 2016 shows that the normal range of estradiol in a cis woman's body can be anywhere from 20 to **300** pg/ml, so really, if we're aiming for doses that aren't supraphysiological, any number at or below 300 should be fine (and has better chances of suppressing your T.) The above study is behind a paywall, but the 20-300 pg/ml E2 range it states is cited in [another study](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0015028219301219#bib26) from 2019 that's free to read

Disclaimer: I'm not a doctor, just a random trans woman with access to Google scholar, so take what I'm saying with a grain of salt as always, but my subjective experience has absolutely been that my T was suppressed without needing blockers at 330 pg/ml, and I generally felt great. There were also noticeable negative symptoms when my dose was lowered by Planned Parenthood.

Hope this all helps!"	12dk42h	trans	396	0.98	2023-04-06 13:18:46
Rest in peace Eden Knight	"(TW abuse, hate crime, suicide)

2 days ago, a transgender woman from Saudi Arabia posted her [suicide](https://twitter.com/cyberangelfaery/status/1634929690287779842?s=46&t=OcYhx7xF8-Bl3YK2SpJuCg) letter to twitter. She was a young trans woman that escaped Saudi to be able to live her life and transition but her leaving was not enough for her parents. 

Her parents hired PI in america to find her, ‚Äúbefriend‚Äù her, kidnap her and have her taken back to Saudi to her family where she faced abuse and was forced to detransition. She soon took her own life. I am so heartbroken to hear about such a disgusting thing happen to one of our own but even more heartbroken knowing she won‚Äôt get any media coverage. 

Things like this happen all the time in the middle east but she escaped. She felt freedom and love and acceptance only to have it taken from her. Her blood is on her parents hands, as well as the 3 accomplices who tricked her, stole her and forced her to go back to Saudi. 
Her death certificate has been published, deadnaming her and misgendering her. I am so sick. 

Please share her story. 
Please consider supporting [LGBT charities in the middle east](https://twitter.com/elierlick/status/1635372999200362497?s=46&t=OcYhx7xF8-Bl3YK2SpJuCg) who work hard to try and make this region liveable for us.

This hurts wow. This is really fucked up but I think nothings gonna happen for Justice
Do we have any info on the PI or names of the people in the US who assisted them?
Rest in Power, Eden.




This is what Trans people suffer from in Middle East



This is why I'm suppressing myself and will never come out, yes I'm from Saudi Arabia.

These people that coerced her into her death need to be punished. How many more innocent lives will they take before we get justice?
I keep seeing horrible news like these every damn day, and fucked up comments in social media celebrating things like this, it's just too much, too much hate
It‚Äôs incredibly evil.   The depth of depravity explicated by the actions of the parents and Michael is just massive.   I hope they are continuously tortured by the enormous black hole created by her death for the rest of their miserable lives.   I have no words to accurately describe my disgust, but that‚Äôs a start!
This fucking terrifies and disgusts me on so many levels that I can barely hold myself from puking
Isn‚Äôt that true evil? Aren‚Äôt these people as bad as they get?

Eden was a friend, we weren‚Äôt close, but talking with her always brightened up my day. She was smart, hilarious and sweet, and so optimistic about the future she worked so hard to make for herself here in the US. And then Michael, Ellen, Bader and her parents stole that future away from her through deception and abuse.

Some of Eden‚Äôs closest friends have drafted a letter to send to your local representatives. It concerns a change to the law that could‚Äôve saved Eden‚Äôs life. If implemented, the change could prevent LGBT people from dangerously homophobic and transphobic countries from being trafficked and coerced the way Eden was.

Please read it, and send to your local representatives. There are many, many other people in this world in a similarly dangerous position to Eden: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1pMyr-5Ua2t567Qr0qdcESNfy3_bMpHrG-ZQq66gPdIs/mobilebasic
Wow. You know, I was gonna do the same thing, but every time I tried anything on myself, it hurt too much. Sometimes the thought still comes up.
Actually just remove the saudi governemnt at this point
This is why I think some people aren‚Äôt fit to be parents
I would down vote this but didn‚Äôt. I am just so angry from this that I needed to vent without throwing my phone against the wall. üò†üò¢
And yet the same people who claim to be defenders of trans rights are also the first to defend Islam from any form of criticism.

Rest in peace and power, Eden. Shit like this should never happen.
Where is the parents response?
Just to let y‚Äôall know, atengesdal is a hate account here to troll us, he‚Äôs posting comments on other posts like ‚Äúborn a man will always be a man‚Äù, and I‚Äôve reported him.

i know that nothing will happen legally but i feel that queer issues especially in the middle east are always silenced. We need to let people know what happens, spreading the word of our injustices and ways to support the queer and trans community in the middle east are so important. so many suicides and deaths can be avoided with external support.
Its a big thing but the agency that was hired to take her back home in the middle east were she had parents who are abusive. The agency is run by Michael Pocalyko and Ellen Cole. The company is called SI or Speck SI (cannot remember all the details) and is in Virginia. 

Also I apologize for the bad grammar, my english is not that good.
It was Mike Pocalyko, he made all of his contact info and his home address available online too. So even if there isn't any legal justice, at least he won't be feeling safe for a while
Here is a story:

stay safe and please don‚Äôt let anyone be able to tie your online identity to your real person. take care.
be safe hbb, i wish for a future for us where we don‚Äôt have to hide ourselves in our homes. i hope you can leave and live your life happily in the future.
How can we best help you? Should we donate to organizations? Arrange for educational scholarships abroad? Try to send medications/hormones? What would help you the most? 

I didn‚Äôt know Eden or even of Eden. I first heard of her due to her Twitter message. It made me feel both angry, incredibly sad and also guilty. I think I could have set her up with immigration attorneys who would have been able to do something. I might be completely wrong though, why would anyone trust a stranger on the net? But I firmly believe that legal immigration to the US or some EU countries is possible even for those who overstay visas etc.
please stay safe
thank you for sharing the article. i hope that the americans involved face justice or any consequence for their disgusting actions but unfortunately, i know that her parents won‚Äôt be affected at all. if anything they will be praised by their community while her friends and lgbt folks in Saudi have no choice but to stay silent. breaks my heart.
I‚Äôll never understand those kinds of people, like mate somebody just died. Whether you hate trans people or not it‚Äôs not something to celebrate
They talk about how we are the bad people here, but celebrating our deaths is totally not bad, bunch of hypocrites
what response? to my knowledge they haven‚Äôt been questioned or interviewed and and probably won‚Äôt ever be.
I already copied their entire comment history, lul. xD
Nah, those ain't parents.
Poeple like that don‚Äôt deserve to be called parents. Being a parent is a title you earn, and they lost it. Parents don‚Äôt hire a PI to kidnap their child in another country across the globe, parents love and respect their children for who they are.
They weren't parents.

Edit: poster, u/atengesdal, has transphobic comments in other lgbt subreddits. Report the account friens üíúüîÆ
Honestly my future is pretty unclear even though I came in terms with myself being trans, I'm still hesitant about transitioning (One of my own concerns is I'll have to give up on my dream being a father and having my own kids if I ever decided to transition) 

I don't really have knowledge about organizations, others might help.
Sending HRT to trans people in Saudi or Middle East is very dangerous for them (If they didn't confiscate the hormones in the way.), Trans people can't publicly come out there let alone transition.

I can't come out (and will never come out) to my family because I won't be accepted and will be considered an Immoral pervert if not disowned.
I love my family but being trans is something I have no control over and I'm not ready to part ways (yet).
As a thankful person I don't want to ruin the good memories and turn my life into hell when I'm (and my family) going though not so good times.

Same can be said to all Trans people in those countries even those who happened to have progressive/supportive families (which is less than 1% chance), are still not safe because of the society and country overall.

I don't know about educational scholarships (even though it's not a bad option) for me I found out I'm trans when I'm close finishing my Bachelors degree (which makes it harder for me)

I would say the best option possible is making Immigration to Canda/(Trans friendly) Europe easier with overstay visas and protecting them from any danger (from previous country/relations) 

US/UK are currently massive red flags...

I heared that Canda covers HRT costs for trans people, which might be an option for me if transitioning was my last resort.

Japan is also one of the options for me personally (I'm fortunate enough to know Japanese and will improve it later) because I heared people there are very accepting and welcoming while the government is supportive but extremely strict.

I would plan/prefer to immigrate there once I'm financially stable so I won't worry about myself there but Immigration/Asylum could always be an option if shit hits the fan or those who are unfortunate.



I would be happy if others provided more options.



TL;DR:

Immigration/Asylum with protection and overstay visas (and possible citizenship?) is the safest option probably.

Countries to Immigrate to (Feel free to add more or correcting me):

Canada - Germany- Japan (only if you can speak Japanese)
Speaking as an immigrant to the US familiar with he immigration system, just being from KSA would be a huge positive in an asylum application, because it is public knowledge that KSA executes or heavily persecutes people it considers to be ""deviants."" Certain states, like California and Minnesota, are very trans friendly. 

Of course, if DeSantis becomes president, he will use the power of the office to target those states. Only the SCOTUS could keep him in check. And I am not at all inspired by seeing so many trans people who unfortunately are convinced that ""Biden is just a blue Trump"" or that the two parties are the same. You'd think they'd understand that not voting against DeSantis is a vote for DeSantis and thus a systemic, organized program of persecution.
Sorry to take so long to reply but thank you so much for your thoughtful and detailed response. It sounds like you are well aware of your situation and the difficulties that are connected to your life situation. I agree with you that - presently - the only option for transition seems to be to abandon your current country and family. That‚Äôs really tough. Sadly, it‚Äôs a situation that so many around the world, even in developed progressive countries, are faced with. 

I don‚Äôt know anything about Japan but it‚Äôs an interesting option. I would guess that Thailand could be another one. In Europe, Germany and Spain seem to be the best. As for the US, don‚Äôt count out the whole country as there are major differences between states. Minnesota just became a trans refuge state and several of the coastal states are very progressive. I doubt that even if DeSantis did become president, he would be able to turn the whole country into Florida. While it may seem difficult to immigrate legally to either of these, there are always ways‚Ä¶

Either way, whatever you decide, please stay safe. That‚Äôs the most important thing and that goes for your mental safety/sanity as well. If things get bad, please remember that you can turn to this community and we will do our utmost to figure out resources and ways to help.
That's why moving/Immigrating to the US was never an option imo, America are facing a lot of problems and the rampant increase of Transphobia is the straw.

Also Trump vs Destantis is literally Trash vs Garbage.

Like I said I'm only Immigrating if transitioning became my last resort, thus I'll seek Asylum.
>the only option for transition seems to be to abandon your current country and family.

It's not easy and not ready for it yet but I'll do it if I have to, need to secure myself financially first.

>I don‚Äôt know anything about Japan but it‚Äôs an interesting option. I would guess that Thailand could be another one.

I always wanted to visit or even live in Japan even before finding out I'm trans and I'm already learning Japanese so it could be an option for me.
Japan is one of the safest countries in the world and probably the safest trans-friendly country in Asia.
South Korea is also safe from what I heard, along with Japan they are more in the acceptance side.

I'm not that interested in Korea tbh but will definitely give it a visit, Thailand is one of the options if I'm going for FFS nor SRS (I would recommend to know someone who's Thai so they can help you from getting scammed or other stuff.)



>As for the US, don‚Äôt count out the whole country as there are major differences between states. Minnesota just became a trans refuge state and several of the coastal states are very progressive. 

To be frank, I pretty much lost hope or any will to move or visit US weather I was trans or not... A lot of terrible things happened last decade and the recent Transphobia was the cherry on top.

I get it not all states are the same but I can't guarantee or risk in that situation and living in the US is expensive, If trans citizens are struggling then how about trans immigrants/refugees?

>Either way, whatever you decide, please stay safe. That‚Äôs the most important thing and that goes for your mental safety/sanity as well. If things get bad, please remember that you can turn to this community and we will do our utmost to figure out resources and ways to help.

My future was always unclear but with coming out It got even more vague... Whatever my decision will be I will always plan for it.

Thank you so much for your supportive message, it did lift me up today."	11rg444	trans	374	0.98	2023-03-15 00:30:15
Church makes me feel like an awful person	"So I have known I am trans for a while. I wanna tell my friends but for some reason I can't. Anyways, every time I go to church they talk about Jesus and how he will save you and bring you to heaven and you will live there forever when you die. I always think, I am never going to heaven I am trans and I will never be accepted and its ""wrong"". I always then say in my head ""it is just a phase I can change my ways and  I will be able to go to heaven"". I don't want to do that, I wanna be a girl like I am supposed to be why was I born as a male. They say, ""God chooses your gender for a reason you shouldn't change it"" and somehow I agree with them. But then, when I go back home I realize no that's bs I am a woman and I should be able to be a woman because I am one. I just wanna transition like I should be able too, I just can't.

Edit: Thank you for all the really nice comments but I am going to have to stop reading them for a while as I suffer from really bad anxiety and reading the comments help me feel a lot better about my identity but my anxiety is going up because I know my parents wouldn't support me I don't want to find out.  
Also people who are saying religion is dumb, I don't really care, and you aren't helping just don't comment"	"For the record, (1) people who worship Jesus don't get to cite Leviticus and Deuteronomy, because they rejected them for their ""New Covenant"", and (2) the totality of what Jesus Christ said about trans people is this, ' '

You're not wrong, churches who forget these 2 facts are.
I am glad I got rid of my religion this sounds difficult and annoying.
Church and Christianity exist to make people feel guilty just for existing. If you feel like you might be going to hell, then church is succeeding at its job.

‚Ä¢THAT IS HOW THEY MAKE
MONEY‚Ä¢

In 15th century Christianity, people paid the church to get their dead loved ones out of purgatory. Because god needs money.

Honestly, it‚Äôs bullshit. There are a lot of bullshit spiritual teachings and in the US, Christianity is the top of the list.

You are who you are and you cannot change that. That feeling of being another gender does not go away. You make peace with it as best you can. It may mean that you embrace it fully. It may mean that you live privately as your real gender. It may mean that you completely repress it. All have consequences and benefits. 

But I‚Äôd strongly caution you against embracing the advice from a corporation that claims to represent a being that cannot communicate directly without being paid.

What does god need with money?
The ‚ÄúGod made you this way don‚Äôt change it‚Äù argument is stupid, well, God made us living in the woods without houses or modern amenities, and yet we made houses.

Honestly, God made you who you are, and that includes the fact that you‚Äôre trans.
Hey. Regardless of what any industry, religion,, group or induvidual syas. You. Are. Beautiful.
Do people in churches have those views? Yes. But that‚Äôs not in the Bible. At the end of the day the church has been totally fine with other bodily alterations(eunuchs, castratos). I stopped feeling bad about being me a long time ago, it‚Äôs a journey. Just don‚Äôt try to flip and deny it, that will just end up in pain.
I am a pastor in the midst of transition (MTF). I believe we fit into the same category as those born with a congenital birth defect, the same as someone born with a cleft palette, a club foot, or any myriad of other birth challenges. While we are all wonderfully and fearfully made genetics and nurture together play as big a role as God's interest in who we live as. I hid this aspect of myself off and on for almost 60 years. I feel like I lived a lie my whole life for not living into how God made my heart and mind, which is much different than my current genitalia. I still have a ways to go but God loves me (and you) as who we are at whatever place in our life we are. The world pushes us to deny who we are yet Jesus celebrates diversity. Remember, Jesus is God revealed in human form, so I always go with Jesus over religious turmoil. Feel free to message me for more confirmation that you are beloved of God no matter what others tell you.
Congratulations you've discovered transphobia and church dogma designed to oppress people different than from the churches view.
Why do you care about what the people say today? It says clearly in the bible who jesus was and what he stood for:

He was about loving and accepting everyone equally, his motto was unconditional love. He sat with the outcasts of society regularly telling them that they are loved and accpeted by god. He specifically condemns people who judge others and the bible makes it clear that judging people is up to god. So if somone tells you that Jesus would support homophobia, transphobia or any other form of discrimination that means that person has never openend a bible or atleast the new testament in their life

Btw im not religios at all, it just makes me sad how many ""christians"" dont understand their own religion. Just because there are one or two SENTENCES in the entire bible that COULD MAYBE be understood as Anti-LGBT, that doesnt make the literal thousands of pages about jesus preaching love go away. Its insane to me. Please stay strong and be assured that your identity does not stand in any conflict with your faith, but rather with ignorant people misinterpreting the scripture for their own bigotry

Please stay strong, you can be who you want to be!
Don't worry you are not alone on this.

Ex: me.
Jesus loves you for who you are, not who society wants you to be. Being trans isn‚Äôt a sin, it doesn‚Äôt hurt anyone, and it doesn‚Äôt prevent you from going to heaven.
Church is just an excuse for the racist, transphobic, etc to enforce their will on others. Just don‚Äôt worry about what they say I learned that the hard way.
Hey. I know you said you would stop reading comments, but here's my take. For context, I also have dealt with a huge amount of gender dysphoria in the past and had these *exact* struggles when going to church with my family.

I think a lot of people in this subreddit are justifiably angry at religious people for their outright hatred of LGBT folk, but the bible, itself, actually tells a different story entirely. This might be a long post, but bear with me. I think it's important to explain the biblical arguments for and against trans individuals. This should help anyone who ends up arguing with strongly religious people. I hope it also helps those who are struggling with LGBT issues while going to church.

Firstly, what is the biblical justification *against* transgender people. So far as I know, this comes from 2 places:

1. [Deuteronomy 23:1](https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/23-1.htm): No one who has been emasculated by crushing or cutting may enter the assembly of the LORD.
2. [Deuteronomy 22:5](https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/22-5.htm): A woman must not wear men‚Äôs clothing, nor a man wear women‚Äôs clothing, for the LORD your God detests anyone who does this.

To be clear, the top verse only applies to trans women. The bottom verse can actually be interpreted as *supportive* of trans individuals, after all... if you are a woman, you should be wearing women's clothing. It doesn't matter what sex you were born as. To be doubly clear: this logic won't fly for any strongly anti-trans people, but it might help those who are struggling to make peace with their gender identity and religion. In that case, just know that God has your back.

In my opinion, if a Christian says they are against transgender people, they simply have not read the scripture. [Matthew 19:12](https://biblehub.com/matthew/19-12.htm):

> For there are eunuchs who were born that way, and there are eunuchs who have been made eunuchs by others‚Äîand there are those who choose to live like eunuchs for the sake of the kingdom of heaven. The one who can accept this should accept it.

For those who do not know, a eunuch is a man who has been castrated. This is a clear sign that Jesus was accepting of those who need to change themselves to be at peace with their own sexual struggles. It also directly contradicts the only biblical arguments I know of that are *against* trans individuals. In these contradictory cases, most people accept the New Testament over the Old Testament.

If you are Catholic, I understand that this logic will not fly because you also need to listen to the Pope, who is largely against trans folk.
That said, if you are part of a protestant religion that claims to follow the bible, they have no excuse to exclude trans individuals outside of their own bigotry.

In that case, *they* are the ones in the wrong. They are not following the bible and using God's name in vain to support their own twisted logic.

The truth is that when people argue against trans folk, they will usually say something like: ""It's obviously wrong. God made you in his image. He made you a {man / woman}, so you should live as a {man / woman}."" Well, what if God made you as a woman, but put you in a man's body? What if God's path for you *is literally to transition*? He has done way stranger things than that. The trans process could have been set before you to teach you about empathy, humility, honesty... Just a huge number of positive attributes.

If you make the argument that being trans is your intended path, they will tell you to either:

1. ""Read the bible."" Again, biblical justification for gender reassignment surgery is shown above. Show them these verses and ask them where their justification is beyond ""God making people a certain way for a reason."" Tell them what I said. It sounds like they are putting words in God's mouth to support their own agenda. 
2. ""That just isn't the way God works."" Are they prophets? Can anyone in this era hear God directly? Again, God has done way, way stranger things in the past and Jesus even acknowledged that some people need to modify their sex organs ""for the sake of the kingdom of heaven.""

The way I see it, if your stumbling block is gender dysphoria and transitioning will help you become a better person (""for the sake of the kingdom of heaven""), then transition! That is the path God has set for you. Even if you are not planning to transition, God might have given you these issues (like gender dysphoria) so you can be more accepting and welcoming of different beliefs.

The church does not speak for God. To be honest, the bible doesn't either, but it's a trump card out of religious bigotry. Anyone who uses the God's name without proper biblical justification is using it in vain and therefore sinning. Tell them you won't listen to their arguments without proper citations.

Sorry, I might have gotten a bit heated. I used to be very, very strongly religious (I would read the bible for like 2-3 hours a day for years). I get really pissed when people don't cite their sources and make outlandish claims.
been there. my advice: leave. there is no safe home for you there and you won‚Äôt be able to police your thoughts enough to convince yourself to be happy living as a cis person. you will never feel good or worthy in that environment because that environment is designed to tear you down and keep you dependant.

you are not unworthy of love. you are not broken. you are not a mistake. you do not need to stifle your light in order to find conditional belonging. you are enough, sis. if you need spiritual connection, please seek out queer religious spaces.
From this post alone, I can‚Äôt quite tell if the church hurts because you still sorta believe in it, or if it‚Äôs because you‚Äôre surrounded by inscription people. 

If it‚Äôs cuz you still kinda believe in it, I‚Äôve been there too. What helped me was to throw out the church while keeping the gospel, if that makes sense. I spent a while trying to ask God if I should transition, and then I finally just told him I was going to. His response was basically ‚Äúyou go girl‚Äù. Being able to keep my faith and relationship with god has been very helpful to me. The church around what I believe in sucks, but I don‚Äôt really have any stake in that, I only care about what happens between me and god. 

If you don‚Äôt believe at all anymore, and the hurt comes from being sidings by hateful people and rhetoric, I personally haven‚Äôt been there and‚Äôs don‚Äôt really have advice to give, though I am always willing to give hugs where needed.
Would your parents be open to going to a different church or you questioning some of their religious beliefs? If that‚Äôs the case you can look for an accepting church (I really hope there is one close to you) and suggest trying that church. If you aren‚Äôt ready to come out yet, you can just make it vague and base it on your own religious views. If you have other issues with this church you could mention those or just ‚Äúthe way [accepting church] talks about god/jesus makes more sense to me/speaks to me more than [transphobic church] could we try going there and see if we like their service better?‚Äù You should be free to not attend if you don‚Äôt want to, but maybe they are more open to a queer friendly church then you not going to church 

If they are strong believers not open to different interpretations of the bible, I‚Äôm sorry. It‚Äôs hard being 13 and having to listen to your parents when they are wrong. God made you a beautiful girl and hang in there until you can live that way
It‚Äôs exactly why I left religion. Separating from it mentally definitely makes the forced trips there easier to bear.
Church, by it's very nature, is designed to make you feel like an awful person. If it didn't threaten you with punishment and erode your self-esteem, it would never have power over anyone to feel like they had to follow its tenets.
Hey hey hey god made you the way you are so there for he intended for you to be trans no shame in that your friends have no right to judge you
Also religion is a crutch for those can‚Äôt self govern. Downvote this all you want but maybe stop going to church and start living your truth
Awww I really feel for you xx
Churches suck
Christianity is retarded
If god doesn‚Äôt want you trans you wouldn‚Äôt be trans
Church is a scam
Repent
You can‚Äôt change your gender(this does not mean that it can‚Äôt change on its own from time to time - gender fluid people exist), if god created you in a male body, but with a female gender identity, then you can‚Äôt change it, BUT what you can do is treat your gender dysphoria as any other disease people are born with
If ""God chooses your gender"" so you can't change it, then if you have bad vision or teeth those also should not be corrected. This argument could extend far beyond ridiculousness as well, i.e. if you have an infection you should not kill it with antibiotics because it's one of God's creatures and clearly they wanted you to have it, if you have cancer it's because it's God's will, etc.

The reality of their statements should be very clear in contrast, God only has a problem with you changing things that make these people uncomfortable ***despite*** it not saying anything about this at all **ANYWHERE** in the bible. These people know, they talk to God or something, right?

The truth is that these people know about as much about scripture as the microbiology of prokaryotes, despite it's accessibility to literally everyone. This should indicate not only that these people are being fed a line by someone, someone who is obviously very bigoted with an agenda of their own, but that they are intellectually about as lazy as people come and that nothing they say can be taken at face value. That doesn't mean that things they say might not be true sometimes, it means that you need to research anything they say because they are just parrots.
You need to find a new church. There are LOTS of churches that do believe God made you the right gender just accidentally put you in the wrong body. (Don't ask me which ones, I'm not a Christian but I have heard of them many times)
Real Jesus would accept you for who you are. I consider myself a believer, but I openly stand against the church. If you read the bible you can see how twisted the words have become. You can believe and be yourself and not agree with everything that an old man on a pedestal says. Even if you would think that there is any continuity since Peter becoming first pope, there's not. There was so much man made changes in Church that it's not up to the values it should preserve
Look, you can feel awful because a 2000 year old book written by farmers that didn't know where the sun goes at night and in wich basically every sentence is a mistranslation by now says you are awful, or you fuck that book and embrace who you are with people that accept and love you for that.
By the logic of the church your god doesn‚Äôt make mistakes and made in their image so there‚Äôs that.
Read about the Ethiopian Eunuch to understand the new testaments views on non gender-conforming people. I am a trans-Christian and unfourtantley I see that hatred a lot especially in America. Jesus preached acceptance, kindness, love. Sadly like people do they corrupted his word to fit their narrow views and cite snippets without understanding context and deeper biblical understanding. All you need to know is Jesus loves you for who you are and if your church doesn't accept this fact or your family, find a new church and a new family. God loves you no matter if you believe or not live a good life be good to others and you do better than 90% of these so called good American Christians.
Well consider this. According to a lot of religions, god gave us 2 paths. 1 path is follow is intended way and believing and doing everything he wants/said. The other path is to do what we want. To make our own path. And a lot of priest will tell u that even if your only a good person with a good heart, you will be able to go to heaven.
There has never been a great answer for this but I am a born again believer and yet am always having to listen to Church-goers.

So I have fallen back on 1 Samuel 16:7 and Galatians 3:28 from both testaments as evidence that what we consider, based on very specific parts of the Bible, is not sufficient to claim foul on other‚Äôs.
Heyas kid. You sound a lot like me when ai was a kid.
I walked away from the church because the people didn't behave like Christians. Unfortunately I blamed G_d as well. It took years to give it another look. A couple of YouTubers actually convinced me to come back to Christ. Haven't made it back to church yet though. Still looking for the right one.
Anyway the Bible Project and one of it's co-creators, Tim Mackie and Brandon Robbins on YouTube they dig into the historical context and explain Bible metaphors that everyone misinterprets. They get into how the English words don't always match the Hebrew or Greek or even latin they were translated from.
And they don't judge. And they let on that it's not cool to judge... I hope you find your place!
Where does Jesus say that being trans is wrong? The church likes to propagate hate to fire up the faithful. If you are a believer, ignore everything in the Bible except the words of Jesus. If you‚Äôre not a believer or you‚Äôre on the fence, just ignore the Bible altogether. I always felt that heaven and hell are just there to reinforce the con. I would never send people to hell for all eternity, and that makes me better than god. I would show them the errors of their ways. In no way do we, as trans people, harm others. Don‚Äôt listen to religious bigots making you feel bad for just being who you are.
Hey dont ever let religion judge you for who you are. Be you. Not be what jesus says. Be who you want to and damn the consequences
God did choose your gender‚Ä¶ you are a girl :). That‚Äôs why you can‚Äôt change that! You were made to be trans. And religion is best taken with a grain of salt anyways. Find your own way to worship, every way has been changed by human input anyways so don‚Äôt worry.
The core message of Christianity as I understand it is to love ur neighbour. So everyone doing sth to harm u is not really following that idea... And is obv just an idiot, don't listen. (My personal opinion, so s don't be offended pls. Not trying to make u think like this ..): there is no god. Always being occupied by thinking about ur afterlife/what god would think of xy is a pretty toxic thing cause it restricts actions/thinking. Then again I know some very smart ppl that believe in god. But interestingly they never bother about the consequences, but focus on the positive values of the beliefe. I think that's a great mindset
It's much easier to whip religious people into an obedient frenzy over hate than it is love. I'm sorry your family is part of such a hateful congregation. I hope you can escape and be your true self sooner rather than later. You don't deserve to be tortured by these lies they're filling your head with. Family means nothing if they abuse you, which forcing you to attend a church full of people who hate you is doing. My angry ass can't help much, but I believe in you to love yourself and not let their twisted view on religion make you someone you know you aren't. Good luck, friend.
I spent most of my life doing everything the church told me to... I was a walking freakin' Aerosmith song, for Pete's sake! I gave tens of thousands of dollars to the church, bought hundreds of dollars of groceries for upstanding church members when things got tough for them, and burned hundreds of dollars of secular music because they told me to... but, I was still a pervert in their eyes. It didn't matter what I did... and when I needed them to help me feed my children, they told me to give more tithe.

My advice is that you take care of yourself. If they can't accept you for who you are, find a church that does. Jesus died for the broken, not for those who look for logs where only splinters lie.

I left the church. I still pray with my children, but I have never found peace or redemption from the church who is supposed to love me.


That being said, one of the Lutheran denominations has a support group for trans people.
I'm trans and I'm a Christian.  ""It is by grace we are saved through faith"".

In other words, it's not what you do or don't do.  It's what you believe.

Right after my gender confirmation operation, my surgeon said that scientists had discovered that in MTF a rush of estrogen comes down the tube and into the baby.  This happens after the secondary sex characteristics are developed but before the brain is fully developed.  So, then the brain develops more like a female brain.

So, you were born this way!

God loves ALL of his children.  :)
There are churches out there who are accepting - per his request (he was tired of being misgendered) I outed my son as trans at my church. I got back nothing but love.

Have faith, and I hope you can find a place to feel loved and accepted for who you truly are. They do exist.
I hope you can read this after you've taken a break from the comments.

I won't say anything about religion. I just want to suggest you to find your answers.  Don't go to the church, don't go to your parents, don't go to us.

I'm not trying to say ""pick yourself up by the bootstraps"". I'm trying to tell you to see the world with your own eyes. Question life, and answer those questions with the information you can obtain on your own volition.

It's good to be a free thinker. It's good to challenge the status quo.  You might derive the same answer, you might not.

I'm sure you'll figure things out. 

You are your own person and you're free to make your own decisions. Don't let anyone take your right to choose away.
I was raised catholic, and I understand your conflicting feelings. I went to multiple churches(catholic, non denomination christian, islam, baptist, Jehovah‚Äôs Witness) and the way i see it from all those points of views is that God made us the way we are and made us to be challenged with the way we are. God made us trans and knew it would challenge us! God loves us and wants us to become the best version of ourselves in order to inspire and help others in need, the bible was written more in parables than absolutes and it has been changed so much from the greed of humans that it would be preposterous to take it 100% literally. But if you do believe in God then from the teachings we can delineate that we were created the right way and God loves us for being that way(as long as it doesn‚Äôt infringe on the God given rights of others. being gay or trans or anything not straight and cis does not infringe on their rights). 
Be you, and do what‚Äôs best for your survival, I‚Äôm here if you want to talk more, I‚Äôll try to send a message as well just to reach out‚ù§Ô∏è
It's almost like religion is based on worshipping old ideals written 2000 years ago and resists any change.
Hi, I‚Äôm a former ordained pastor of 16yrs. When I came out and transitioned, the church fired me. Here‚Äôs what I‚Äôd offer. God is bigger than any church or religion. Whatever you call her, the divine cannot be captured as TRUTH by any tradition, even if they claim otherwise. It‚Äôs true that You might find it helpful to hang out with other trans Christians. I have found this little affirming queer spiritual community to be immensely helpful. https://www.transmissionministry.com/ They also have a really active kind gentle helpful discord server if you‚Äôre into that kind of thing. I had to work through some of the feelings you are describing about having fear regarding God‚Äòs acceptance. Ultimately, I believe that God made me trans, loves me because of it, and that some part of my purpose in life is directly connected to me embracing it. Also, I believe that God is love, and that love is ultimate reality, and that there is no possible way that i or people in my life could be more loving than God. I love myself more than ever, now that I have become honest, and many people in my life are just the same thing. I find it impossible that people or myself could love me more than God. Therefore, God loves me even more, and exactly as I am. Feel free to DM me if you want. Sometimes people call this work deconstructing. And it‚Äôs totally OK however it turns out for you. If you‚Äôre trans or not, if you‚Äôre Christian or not, if you attend church or not, you are enough.
What? I don't know what this means.
Ikr? Plus I'm also gay in addition to being trans so I feel extra lucky
How I have been explained to it is that god only ask for 10% no more no less, and it goes to the church to help save more people. The argument for asking for 10% is saying its not a lot like if you had a billion dollars and gave 10% you would still have 900 million dollars you are still really rich
Yep, that second paragraph. And there's nothing in the Bible that says you can't be trans, no matter how you shake it.
I never thought of it like that. Adam and Eve were just dropped into a forest with nothing, even the guy in Primitive Technology has shorts and knowhow, the first people in the bible didn't even have that. But we made clothes, houses, farms, fire even!
God also made us with birth defects and sicknesses. Christians who are being consistent should eschew all medical treatments and health insurance.
Thank you
Thank you, this really has helped me more than the people that have said, ""Religion is Stupid"" and stuff like that. I am so happy that someone took time out of there day to right a entire comment helping me. Thank you.
I am 13 I am forced to go
The thing is, I can't even transition I want to, but my parents wouldn't let me as they are transphobic as they believe what our church says.
They won't listen, I might just try listening to services online that aren't terrible and put me down.
I can't I am 13 I have to go to the one my parents force me to go to.
Also, ""God made trans people for the same reason it made wheat but not bread and grapes but not wine, so that humanity could share in the act of creation""
Jesus said nothing about trans people. He said a lot about love though, and how you should love your neighbor as yourself. Jesus thought you should love yourself, and show that love in your community, and prove it through your good works. That's what all that stuff is about. The kind of love that Jesus talked about is radical and inclusive and revolutionary. The kind of love that deeply worried the authorities of his day. Look, if they're not telling you about that, you're in the wrong church and I suggest you leave and do some self-discovery before trying to find a more radically inclusive church. Personally, I'm not ever going back but I was in it for long enough to know when they're doing it wrong.
Read Romans 14 it outlines how old legalistic restrictions from the old testament are invalid. It says Christians are accountable to God alone. If a fellow Christian breaks an old taboo it doesn't make them less Christian. I.e. being gay ect. 

Here's a quote my grandfather a Presbyterian minister shared with me. ""God created trans people for the same reason he made wheat and grapes but not bread and wine. So that we too might participate in the divine alchemy of creation.""
It means that Jesus never said anything against trans people. So how can you go to hell for something that Jesus didn't forbid?
While they certainly spend money on charities and helping people, they also spend their money on significantly less ‚Äúmorally righteous‚Äù things

Examples include: 

1) lawsuits defending pedophilic priests

2) teaching abstinence only educational curriculums (proven to be ineffective) 

3) activity in the New York stock exchange (certainly questionable if their intentions are charity)

4) various investments into fraudulent activities (see this story for a great illustration of this point https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-57981508.amp 

5) Historically, the church has also been ay-okay with withholding aid from non-Christian‚Äôs and those they deem undesirable. Which is a little bit messed up in my humble opinion

6) plenty more examples just ask if you want them 

What I know from personal experience however, is that leaving religion made me substantially happier. Even if it was a tough transition (pun intended!)

That said, I encourage you to believe whatever you wish, I just hope you end being happy!
It has to do with depending on God basically if I remember. You give your first to God and expect that he will give you what you need. That is the faith that you have in Him. It's like having trust that you give to him the best of your labors first and he'll still provide for you. At least that's how the stories are described in the old testament. Obviously it doesn't really come across as well nowadays. I think there's a way to do it for yourself but I think most people don't really think of it that way. And you're right when you make that much money, ten percent isn't much. But when you don't make much, ten percent can be the difference between eating that month and not.

The idea behind it is that God will provide for you whether you have the means to provide for yourself or not. But evangelicalism has made a big deal out of guilt tripping and shaming for it.
Save people from what? God? Sounds like a shakedown. 

‚ÄúPay me and worship me or I‚Äôll torture you eternally.‚Äù

It‚Äôs racketeering in law, sometimes a felony, punishable by possibly more than 20 years if someone were to say ‚Äúgive me money or I‚Äôll torture you‚Äù. But we‚Äôre cool it when god does it for some reason.

I mean, would you really worship anyone that told you ‚Äúkiss my feet or I‚Äôll torture you‚Äù?
*stupid evangelicals

Not all Christians are this insane, fuck I‚Äôm Catholic
I am glad it was useful! It's a tough spot to be in. I hope everything works out!
oh dang.

i would really advise you to bide your time then, until it is safe to leave. you most likely will not be able to come out to anyone (and if you do, please be careful about who you choose to trust). your safety is the most important.

a name i would recommend for you to check out is kevin garcia. they are a pastor who has lots of resources, especially for lgbt youth.

edit: i thought that this was actually a different subreddit and didn‚Äôt realize i should have elaborated. kevin is a lovely, gay, mystical, non-binary, christian pastor. they are really popular amongst the ‚Äúdeconstructing‚Äù or ‚Äúexvangelical‚Äù crowds and their practice is more so focused on the love, healing, and connection rather than dogma, correct belief, or shame. i really like one of their podcasts, and i‚Äôm not even a christian anymore.
Yeah, we wouldn‚Äôt want children to escape forced indoctrination. Yes, they can make you go, but they can‚Äôt make you accept the hate and bullshit they pedal. Your mind is free. Use that time to learn about how reprehensible the beliefs are that they are pushing. Or just daydream about other things.
Sounds like you‚Äôll have to wait until you are on your own. Maybe keep bringing it up. Let them know how miserable you are.
Do you really enjoy church? Do you really find the message compelling? I am an atheist because I have seen no evidence that convinces me that any religion or gods are true. We have scientific explanations for things and do not need to rely on ancient myths and superstitions. It‚Äôs very freeing.
Oh ok well then just remember that, it is A church not YOUR church and just because you HAVE to go doesn't mean you have to listen
The kind of love that worries authorities of *any* day.

Yes, this is what many churches have forgotten. There are some that look at the teachings differently. If you want that connection to church, God and the community see if there are more accepting churches in your area. Churches that teach hate aren't as valid as they would like to believe.
That quote is amazing. I'll be writing that one down. Also, your grandfather sounds like a good man.

Hello! You have made the mistake of writing ""ect"" instead of ""etc.""

""Ect"" is a common misspelling of ""etc,"" an abbreviated form of the Latin phrase ""et cetera."" Other abbreviated forms are **etc.**, **&c.**, **&c**, and **et cet.** The Latin translates as ""et"" to ""and"" + ""cetera"" to ""the rest;"" a literal translation to ""and the rest"" is the easiest way to remember how to use the phrase.

Why does nobody talk about this dude? The first FTM to go surgery?	"So for context: I'm FTM myself, and I just came across a post about this dude - Karl M. Baer. 

He was German and transitioned in 1904!!!!

I feel like us transmasc people fall through the cracks, everyone knows the Danish girl, but it seems like no one cares about trans men history.... 

When I was just coming out, the only trans guy I heard of was Brandon Teena from Boys Don't Cry, and I went right back to the closet, because I was so scared of having the same fate. 

Meanwhile, this dude transioned and lived happily (all is relative) all the way back in 1904, just a shame that it's not more well-known...

[https://letherfly.org/en/karl-m-baer-the-first-person-in-the-world-to-undergo-sex-change-surgery/](https://letherfly.org/en/karl-m-baer-the-first-person-in-the-world-to-undergo-sex-change-surgery/)"	"Karl also published a semi-autobiographical novel, *Aus eines Mannes M√§dchenjahren (Memoirs of a Man's Maiden Years)* in 1907, and it was [**translated into English in 2009**](https://www.amazon.com/Memoirs-Mans-Maiden-Years-Body/dp/0812220617)!

He wrote the book together with Dr. Magnus Hirschfeld, who was one of the first doctors to offer something resembling modern western transition-related medical care. In 1919 Dr. Hirschfeld opened the *Institut f√ºr Sexualwissenschaft* in Berlin, which among many other things had a dedicated clinic providing early forms of transition-related care.
Not only was he trans, he was intersex, a feminist, at a point a lesbain, and polyamours. He should really be talked about more especially to lgbtq+ kids, or really just new lgbtq people
So much trans history was lost when the Nazis burned books and attempted to erase us
Yay, some Karl Baer love!! Thanks for making this post.

My personal favorite historical trans man is [Dr. Alan Hart](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alan_L._Hart). In 1917, he was one of the first trans men to undergo a hysterectomy in the U.S., and:

> The 1906‚Äì1907 case of Karl M. Baer had set a new precedent for sex reassignment surgery by enlisting simultaneous support from psychiatric, legal, and surgical quarters. There was now medical and legal precedent for transitioning; Hart's approach to his own transition appears to have drawn on the Baer case.
Thank you for posting this. <3
This guy is super cool too, he was the first to undergo phalloplasty and the performed SRS on the first British trans girl to recieve it.

https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Dillon
There was also Dr James Barry who was English doctor who helped pioneer the c-section as well as reaching the rank of Inspector General in the British Army
Ohh I love history like this, thank you for this post!
He was in my presentation for my research paper! Very cool guy!
Maybe the facts not many know is wjy he lived a happy life, just a thought tho
And sadly much of the history Dr. Hirschfeld researched and collected, and the advancements made by him and the Institut, were destroyed when the Nazis burned it to the ground and forced him into exile.
Wow that is so cool! I‚Äôm totally reading up on this guy. Not only is it trans history, but I rarely hear of polyamorous people like me from this time.
Literally one of most heartbreaking things I've read about. What world might we be living in if the Institut survived to the 21st century?
Very much agreed.

We would know so much more of our history, our presence throughout history. Medical treatment and surgical treatment for those of us who need or want it would be so much more advanced."	wlta9o	trans	313	0.99	2022-08-11 14:50:44
So, not the usual content on here, but the primaries/caucuses are right around the corner. Bernie's health care plan specifically covers transition expenses, and he's been consistently pro-LGBT for decades. It's free to give a sh*t. We only lose if we're apathetic. Get out and vote pls. c:		"Bernie Bros to Bernie Babes.

Bernie was the best then, and he's the best now. :)
His policies don't address the fundamental causes of Poverty, only puts patches on them.

Sanders is putting in the steps to destroy the oppression we face as people, and unwavering against fascism. 

Yang has some great points, especially those on Automation. I'd love him with a chair in something like technology.
He's not going to win please vote for Bernie. Yang 2028?
Who said that there is? Bernie's proposals will be paid for by taxes like any other government program. As a full time working Bernie supporter, I want my taxes to go towards things will will benefit me and other working class Americans. Things like health care and college tuition, as opposed to war and corporate handouts.
""Free shit* that every other developed country in the world has. Bernies just bringing America up to the standard of care that every other nation has had for decades. No one should die because they can't afford to pay for their cancer medication, no one should drive themselves to the hospital when they need to be in an ambulance because they can't afford it.
OP here. I've been a worker consistently for my entire adult life. Nobody is talking about ""free shit"". Bernie's proposals will be paid for by taxes like any other government program. Taxes that will be (and already are) being taken out of my paycheck every week, just like yours. Shouldn't us tax payers be getting something worthwhile out of these taxes? As opposed to the non-stop wars and corporate handouts they've been used for for years, how about use them for healthcare and college tuition? Please don't be so eager to blindly accept those baseless Fox News talking points. Think for yourself. Much love to you. <3
Cuba has covered HRT and GRS for years while also creating one of the most sustainable economies on the face of the planet but ur right ""no government has created a successful socialist economy""

Maybe this will help someone else	"Story time~
So, last year I came out to my father. I hadn‚Äôt visited him 6 months prior, as I was starting my transition. When I finally found the courage, I went over and told him immediately. He laughed and said, ‚Äúthat‚Äôs why you haven‚Äôt been coming over?‚Äù He accepted me, or so I thought at the time. 

So, as time went on, two weeks of him joking about it and finally I told him I‚Äôm not his son anymore, and to call me by Gabby or use my female pronouns. In a huff, he almost yelled back, ‚ÄúI made ya and I‚Äôll call ya whatever I damn well please!‚Äù

I had enough. I left and went home. My roommate told me to tell him to f*ck off, and even though I wanted to, I know my dad cared about me and really desired me in his life, as I am his only child. 

So, I went back over the next day, he was joking as he usually was, he‚Äôs quite the comedian, and then started to misgendered me again and get mad when I once again told him to use my correct pronouns and/name. But this time, I said, ‚ÄúDad, look. I‚Äôm gonna be honest. I love you and I want you in my life and I want to be a part of yours. But I don‚Äôt have to. I don‚Äôt have to talk to you or visit. I choose to, and the way you‚Äôre acting about this makes me want to choose otherwise.‚Äù He stopped talking and was quiet for a while. Eventually things returned less awkward, we watched a movie and just hung out as usual. But when I was about to go home, he hugged me and called me Gabby. Without a joke, without sarcasm. And from then on he hasn‚Äôt once misgendered me since. Even after I moved halfway across the country, he texts me and sends me Hello Kitty gifs (I love HK). 

TL:DR
If you have a family member that you know really loves you but they‚Äôre not getting the big deal with your gender identity, let them know your being around them is your choice. And they might lose that privilege.

Edit: wow, this blew up. Thanks everyone for your support, I wish you all the best~ much love."	"Cis people need to hear this too.

Can't tolerate abuse just because it is from family.
That is beautiful. The way you stood up for yourself, and the way he came to respect that. I'm glad you two can move forward together, and be a part of each other's life.
its enough to make a grown trans cry
Well, this only works when your parents love you and didn‚Äôt say ‚ÄúI actually never really wanted you‚Äù to your face =.= (thanks mom, the feeling is mutual)
I'm in a similar situation, i haven't yet reached resolution but I'm working on it, thank you!
It's a complicated situation. Social media tells us to be intolerant with this type of shit - and by all means, we should not tolerate it - but want it or not, they act that way because they feel threatened and scared of losing someone they love, they don't want the situation, the person they care about, to change. My first reaction is to go with empathy first and to acknowledge the way they feel, and then explain how essential this is to you. If they chose to be an asshole and not accept you for who you are even when they know how you feel, then fuck them. But I think it's good to remember that it can be hard for them too, as it is hard for you
This made me cry
I do truthfully feel like this with both my parents itsjust difficult because I live with them and I'm not old enough to move yet so."	mojw4r	trans	276	1.0	2021-04-11 04:01:54
School locker rooms	"My 13yo daughter is trans, in 7th grade. She's transitioned socially but due to cost, not medically. There's a trans girl in 9th grade in the same boat. They both came out last year but since only half the students were actually in class and they closed the locker rooms for social distancing reasons, no one did much more than grumble under their breath. This year, however, there are parent meetings going on about the trans kids in bathrooms and locker rooms. They're at the school board meetings demanding action.
A couple days ago I sat with 4 of the ""concerned mom's"" to try to educate them, or at least find out what their plans are. They said, ""We just want to make sure every child is comfortable in the locker room."" I called bullshit. I straight up said, ""No you don't. Kids have been uncomfortable in locker rooms forever. There are always kids who hate changing. And none of you gave a shit about ANY of them. Schools, parents, everyone, tells these kids all the time that they have no choice, they have to change, it's part of life, and their grade depends on it. The only reason you all care now is because you think they SHOULD be uncomfortable. That's where I take offense. You're perfectly fine forcing minor children to undress for grades, but not with my child existing in the room."" Well, they'd never thought of it that way before! These mom's, and a bunch of others who just didn't show up to lunch that day, told me they want to school to put partitions in the locker rooms so everyone will have privacy. Again, ""That won't work. It will give the kids privacy but the problem isn't the kids, it's you, and you have an issue with the bathroom and that already has separate stalls.""
Long story short, they agreed that an easier solution is to stop making kids undress for grades. It's a very small victory, but I count it as a win. And hopefully they'll be more open to talking about their next complaint. I hope so, because I have a whole big speech about how the first time a butterfly lands on a toddler they freak out but instead of trying to keep butterflies away from them forever, parents just explain that butterflies aren't dangerous, and maybe these parents could treat trans people the same way and explain that they're not a threat instead of indulging their kids' unrealistic fears."	"You speak the truth with eloquence and power. You're my new friend!
You rock! I'm saving this post for future reference.
Thank you!

Changing for gym in high school was absolutely terrifying.  I didn't know why at the time, but it just filled me with dread.  I used to wait until everyone else was done before I'd change.  This worked until they got a new gym teacher.  He screamed at me for ""wasting time"" when I desperately tried explaining how uncomfortable I was.  I started wearing my gym clothes under my regular clothes so I could change extremely quickly, and didn't have to expose my chest.

The gym teacher always put me on ""skins"" during basketball, which I absolutely refused to do.  I eventually quit changing all together after being pantsed.  The school administrators tried to blame me, and threatened me because the kid lied and said I spread a rumor about him.  That it was my fault.  They also asked embarrassing questions like ""Did *IT* fall out?"".  So, I quit changing after that.  I got a C in gym for not participating, and my dad screamed at me.  I was so happy that I never had to take gym again after that year.
This is fantastic. Thank you for speaking out. Your daughter is lucky to have you. 

I am curious though, and I apologize for not knowing more about tween/teen trans folks, but you say‚Äînot medically transitioned due to cost‚Äîdo you just mean hormone blockers? Can 13 year olds take HRT? I wish her and you the best of luck regardless.
I love this view of locker rooms (well,  I hate the truth of it, and as a trans person I hate locker rooms in general, but I love the fact that you put it so accurately)
Your a true legend
You are an amazing parent holy shit
Thats definitely a win.

I genuinely don't understand all this gender separation. Most swimming changing rooms I've been to are 1 big changing room with single stalls. 

Couple of gendered shower rooms and some bigger family stalls but that's it. So I get a choice where I go. Weirdly the gym changing rooms at the same place are gendered.

Why don't we just have single stalls everywhere?
Are they their kids‚Äô fears though? In my experience as a kid of very hateful people, any fears I had about gay or trans people (which I grew up to realize I AM on both counts) was given to me by my parents. I wouldn‚Äôt give these people an inch to shift blame to their kids, and I‚Äôd make sure to place and keep that blame for having fear of trans people squarely on their shoulders. 

I‚Äôm sorry you‚Äôre having to go to bat on something that shouldn‚Äôt be an issue, but seriously congrats on the win! 

Also thank you for being so supportive of your kiddo <3
Butterflies and toddlers bit had me cackling over har.
I failed gym class every year just because I wouldn't change in front of a bunch of people that already bullied me. The fact that we have to get undressed in front of an adult and other students for grades has always been fucking weird and I will never understand why that's even necessary.
You‚Äôre an amazing parent standing up for your child‚Äôs rights. My 15 yr old son is transgender and i‚Äôve been worrying about her safety in the restrooms.  Her school‚Äôs solution is to allow her to use the bathroom in the nurses office. It‚Äôs a start anyway.  Thank God my child gets to use marching band for her pe credit and does not have to undress or i can imagine we‚Äôd be having the same issues you‚Äôve been dealing with.   Eventually i think they will take such things into consideration when building new schools.  At this time, our kids are just the ones who are breaking the mold.  Hang in there üòä
Well said!
What's wrong with having private changing stalls? Like you said tons of kids have issues changing in front of other people. Not having separate gym clothes is an issue unless it's the very last period of the day. No one wants to sit in a room full of sweaty teenagers.
This is a really good point.
Fully agree with everything here which is a fairly rare occasion. The thought of changing in front of people was fucking wild to me at 6th grade and I couldn‚Äôt imagine doing that being trans (I didn‚Äôt know till about a year ago and I‚Äôm a senior this year) they really should have stalls and have like some of the class go in and change in groups. It would also be greatly appreciated by victims of sa that are really against the idea of undressing around other people
Here, you flunk if you don't wear the uniform. I had 2 gym classes in 10th grade because I didn't change in 9th grade and had to make up the year.
I am sorry to hear you had such a horrible experience with all that nonsense.
She's not on puberty blockers or hrt. She's advanced, puberty wise, and would be a candidate for more than other girls her age might get. I don't know all the details because the one office visit we had cost us $300 out of pocket, with no labs at all.
The only reason I mentioned her transition at all is because there's this false belief that you can't be trans, or at least you can't live as your gender, unless there are medical intervention. To a lot of people, even school staff, my daughter and her friend are just boys in girl clothes until they get a prescription or a surgery.
I really think that if some organized people made a movement out of it, we could get PE uniform mandates eradicated all over. If you stress the pedo angle of it, and that's a real angle, and point out how counterproductive it is to all of the ways we try to teach our kids that they are in charge of who gets to see them undressed, I think it could go the way of teachers paddling students. And there's a great parallel to Chicago's naked swimming. Look it up, it's horrifying.
I completely üíØ percent agree!
It's only legal to force a roomo full of healthy, unrelated, minor childhood to undress against their will in 2 places: school and jail. Anywhere else, it would be a felony.
Son?
My daughter uses a gender neutral bathroom and changes in there. It had been the staff bathroom before this year but they changed it this year.  Last year they'd proposed the office bathroom but the secretary isn't very nice so she just went all day without peeing. The high school put in gender neutral bathrooms, too, which is what the other t girl uses and changes in. The trans kids aren't even using the locker rooms and these parents are angry because they don't even do enough research to know this. I had one of them ask me if there were hormone shots that could make my daughter feel like a boy again. Like, if there were a cute for trans don't you think that's what doctors would do?! And if it were a hormone thing there would be no postmenopausal women, just old men with boobs. These people will look up just enough to bring that Loudoun County rape case up but not enough to even find out what trans means.
They're nothing wrong with it if the money and space is there to put stalls in, and there's not. But the thing is, nobody showers after gym, and nobody tries to make the kids shower, and deodorant wasn't even on the school supply list. The parents I spoke to don't even send it to school with their kids. I have been washing gym clothes on the weekends fora collective 8 years and they've never stunk because the kids don't do anything sweaty now. They walk the track or play dodgeball or volleyball, things that don't involve running. And the bathrooms already have stalls exactly like the ones these parents think will make them happy, and they still have a problem with trans kids in the bathrooms so obviously stalls aren't going to solve their issues.
That last part is what put them on my side about it, I think. I had said that the locker room can be traumatic for any number of reasons, from early development to late development to body hair to scars or birthmarks, and one of the mom's said how horrible it had been for her to not only undress but to be told by an adult that she had no choice in the matter because she had been assaulted by an adult who told her she had no choice but to undress.
If you don't mind me asking, what state are you in? When I started transitioning a big part of what kept be back was the financial aspect of medical treatment, but I found out that there are often times clinics that do sliding scale fees for visits (I ended up paying $25 for each visit as a flat fee, labs included.) And I was able to use Good Rx to get coupons for the meds to bring them to a reasonable cost. I am now on medicaid (IL County Care) and they cover everything except the needles and syringes.
Absolutely, a person is transgender whether or not they medically transition. I just had no idea it was that expensive!  

I am very lucky to live in an informed consent state, and my insurance covers everything. 
I‚Äôm sorry to hear she doesn‚Äôt have access to those things (if she wants them) but she is lucky in that she has a supportive family! 

I didn‚Äôt begin HRT until I was 40 so I know it‚Äôs never too late.
My daughter is the same. No hormones or blockers, but presenting herself fairly comfortably at school this yes as a girl, especially with regard to her clothing choices.
It's so messed up.
I try üòÖ
Yes it‚Äôs going to take a lot if educating people. My husband was one who wondered if my daughter‚Äôs feelings could be changed with hormones, as well üòû
I‚Äôm surprised how sterile and uncaring school systems can be on certain policies. The idea that girls can‚Äôt have bra straps showing under their shirt is 100% there because it distracts the teachers I‚Äôve never seen a studenr stare at a girl cause she had bra straps showing but I‚Äôve seen some teachers do some interesting double takes at certain students and it‚Äôs fucking gross. the dress codes of most schools inherently sexualize children
Also I had to share a locker room with the people who sexually assaulted me so that was a fun experience which makes this issue quite personal to me
Illinois. Whiteside County. Blue cross blue shield of Iowa.
There are 2 accessable places that deal with trans kids, one in Chicago 3hr away and one in Iowa City 1.5 hours away. We went to Iowa. They suggested puberty blockers and said the one they do is a once a year subdermal implant. It cost $20,000 and without insurance you have to pay up front. I went to the local health department because they give free depo shots and the DEPO shot is an old-school puberty blocker but they only help transmen. They are a vagina only clinic. A lot of other places deal with transgender issues but not pediatrics.
I understand why they might think that. I just don't understand not doing a simple Google search. Like, if you're going to make trans children your enemy, wouldn't you research the enemy? I guess the idea is that if estrogen will help her ""be a girl"" then maybe testosterone would help her ""be a boy""? The lady looked so shocked when I told her that medicine had been trying to ""fix"" trans people's brains to match their bodies for hundreds of years before they even entertained the notion of making the body fit the mind. Like, Hello! They tried it your way and it didn't work!

I'm tired of people using incorrect scientific terms and statements to justify their transphobia	"In the country where I live, there is a popular 'science' page that often uses outdated and tranphobic, fatphobic, sexist terms. 
Today, they posted about transphobia.
First words in the post are ""this is transphobia"" on the left side, and ""this is not transphobia"" on the right. 
On the left, obvious transphobic things like ""laughing at trans people"" ""denying trans people their right to transition"". 
But then on the right:
1. Saying there are only two genders
2. Saying that a difference between your gender and gender identity is an illness
3. Saying gender is only determined by genes and not culture (that was supposed to mean 'mental gender is not a valid gender')




There were so many likes to that post and so many commenters who agreed and praised the author of the page.
I am so tired of people pretending they are experts in the transgender field, even though they have no education in it. I am tired of people claiming ""this is basic biology"". I am tired that people use outdated terms that are INCORRECT SCIENTIFICALLY to justify their obvious transphobia - to deny the fact that we are who we are. 
When will this end, when will people let us fucking live without us having to have endless disputes about our right to exist? When will discussion about the validity of our identity end? And lastly, why do people care so much about what junk we were born with and not about what we are?
I had to vent cause I'm just so mad."	"""Air resistance doesn't exist. It's basic physics.""
My bestman is a biologist, and we often talk about trans people on sports, and he confirm some of the divergences between bodies, but everytime he says, ""anyway, banning transpeople of their gender gategorie is transphoby and we should find another solution that don't shame trans people"". He is a really good friend and ally
We must fight to end the genetal mutilation of intersex infants. If we protect intersex babies we are protecting all of us from the dangers of misinformation.
Anyone claiming that science supports the idea of binary gender is *decades* out of date. Fields like anthropology and sociology have recognized the fact that gender is socially constructed since the 1970s.   


Not that the anti-trans crowd *actually* cares about science.
You just have to learn to not go into these kinds of spaces online and avoid people like this IRL as much as possible.

The only way to win the game is not to play, even if that means fighting the urge to argue with these people :/
Just because you don't 100 % agree with everything regarding a topic doesn't mean you are phobic. A phobia is an extreme reaction to something. Saying there are only 2 genders is not phobia.
I've seen it woth racists and homophobes, where they pat themselves on the back for not burning people at the stake. 

Its just to make themselves feel better, pretend they're good people and not total cunts, sry u have to go thru this shit, ppl suck üòï
Even with so called allies using outdated terms, I've had many ""disagreements"" with my friends on terminology but they keep digging their heels in
What is the name of this ""science"" journal
In my opinion this people should be easy to convince i myself thought there were only 2 genders but i quickly realised why it was wrong, if this people are logical they should be just as easily swayed
People will use anything to justify their transphobia. Whether its science (which has proven that genders arent binary but are cultural human inventions) , god (who love everyone, exept apparently the lgbtq community for some reason) or the elderly (which this subreddit has shown are completly capable of understanding and respecting us). Stop blaming your transphobia on everything and just admit your discriminating for no reason other than lack of understanting. Or better yet, try to understand and accept trans people.
""Ay listen, idc what you think you've learned. My physics professor in 9th grade says air resistance doesn't exist so obviously you're just making shit up to fulfill your own bias!""
yeah the transphobes are like ""it's basic biology"" and I'm like I'm sorry but have you ever heard of advanced biology?
This is my new retort.
yo this is actually the *best* analogy for that, thank you
Yes, this is true! But I don‚Äôt see the relation to the original post. Maybe I‚Äôm just confused?
I didn't *go* to those spaces. This was shared all over the trans groups in my country, which is quite understandable considering how the page is one of the biggest 'science' pages on facebook, so people were disappointed. Even when you avoid tranphobia it always finds a way to get to you.
I agree
saying there are only two genders invalidates the identity of non binary people and therefore it is transphobia. idk if you're new to lgbt related topics or what but any lgbt related ""phobias"" are not in fact ""phobias"" as in extreme fears of something (like social phobia), but reactions that invalidate, humiliate, or just reject scientific knowledge (such as claiming there are only two genders in a world with non binary people, whose identity is valid; claiming homosexuality or being trans is a sickness, which is just... not true? and leads to stigmatising us)
Can confirm all cows in my vicinity are frictionless spheres in complete vacuums.
""if air has resistance, how can we move through it? Sounds like you're deluding yourself.""
unfortunately, they genuinely have not in many cases. 

A lot of transphobes are sold on the idea that there *isn't* more advanced knowledge and research and understanding to be had on the subject, because as far as they're concerned, *they're already there.* 

They already have the ""correct"" understanding. Obviously, that's not true, but it does give context to why many transphobes are so frustratingly dense about things.
I can see some kind of connection there if I think laterally:

1. Stopping genital surgery on intersex babies may lead to more adults with non-binary genitalia, therefore
2. More adults will have come in contact with and have exposure to non-binary genitalia, therefore
3. More adults will be normalised and open to all kinds of genitalia on people of all genders, therefore
4. Less transphobia

It's a stretch though, a long game, and there are many more effective ways of combating misinformation and transphobia (despite the fact that genital surgeries on intersex babies should definitely be stopped regardless).
It‚Äôs inseparable from misinformation about trans people, it‚Äôs really also inseparable from misinformation about the vaccine. All of the misinformation is bad and hurts people. I think saving babies from mutilation is a really good starting point.
Transphobic content finding its way into trans spaces is probably something I should have considered before smashing a comment together
Thank you. I find this community to be totally resistant any form of discussion regarding non-trans peoples view of things. The world does not only exist from a trans point of view. As the other person who commented on my comment pointed out, words no longer need to mean what they intended to mean -like phobia- this word now encompasses anyone or anything that doesn't wholeheartedly agree with every opinion coming out of this community.
I know, also the fact that those are the kind of people that are basically *commited* to misunderstanding you. 

I don't know why, but for some people admitting to a mistake is a big problem, like they would lose their honor if they changed their mind when they were very deeply convinced they are right. 

That, and the fact that lgbt-related issues are considered leftist-political, like environmental topics, and often trigger far-right people and make them agressive, makes discussion quite often pointless.
Agreed. I can get there, but it‚Äôs a stretch! Worth it on its own merits but not as a method to protect trans folks from transphobia.
Okay, still confused. Look, you‚Äôre just giving me arguments about why what you said is true. And I‚Äôm not denying that it‚Äôs important. I‚Äôm just questioning why you posted it as a reply here.

Also your comment on vaccine misinformation makes me even more confused!
With certain beliefs and certain people, you cannot convince them you are right. They‚Äôll never listen. Their worldview is so deeply entrenched that to challenge it is equivalent to attacking everything they are. Once that happens, the only thing you‚Äôre doing is making them hate you more and more until eventually something snaps. That thing is never their worldview, its their temper, and now you have a belligerent angry person who thinks they are backed into a corner and is now defending their perception of the world with either their fists or, worse, a weapon, against something they see as a direct threat that needs to be eliminated.

My mom forced me to cut my hair	"My mom forced me to cut my hair short and now i'm crying because of the massive dysphoria load...i told her multiple i wanna let my hair grow but she didn't care. I hate everything

Edit: no i wont call CPS or something i'm only going to talk to her that she shoud stop control my life...

Edit 2: my mom is a control freak kinda if i don't do what she wants me to she get's really pissed and yells at me even tho she knows i get really scared when people yell at me and  she forced me to work as a mechanic for a week even tho i hate crowds and unknown people around me  that's the reason for the stupid haircut. I didn't even wanted that job but again she forced me to. The job starts tommorrow but maybe i can convince her to cancel it. But it's impossible cause she's very narcistic sometimes.


Edit 3: i had a very intense talk with her and she apologized for her behavior and even promissed me to try her best to help me with my transition.

 So everything has a happy end thanks for the kind words and supports y'all üíï"	"Ugh omg I remember my dad used to do that. I ended up just cussing him out and making him cry. Never cut my hair again.  Tell her you‚Äôll be shaving her head bald when you dump her in a nursing home.
Remember that women wear pixie cuts all the time. Maybe if you look some up, you can style your hair that way. 

Hugs from a trans dad if you want them.
If someone threatens physical abuse by the laws of nature and the state you have the rights to defend yourself. (Research state laws)
Tell her ‚ÄúI‚Äôll remember this for the rest of my life. That you forced me to do something that I didn‚Äôt want to do, I wonder how this choice you made has deviated the course of our relationship, what have you sentenced us both to?‚Äù Boom.
Next time don't let her? Like she can't make you if you don't go along with it. If she takes shit away. Okay then. If she tries to hit you threaten to tell child services. If they physically force you to then make them struggle so they remember how much you don't want to and cuss and swing and hit and break shit.
Im so sorry love!!!! We are here to support you and help you get through it best we can, if you need anything, feel free to message me hun ‚ù§
Girl I feel you I just got a hair cut and it was supposed to be a trim and now I‚Äôm dysphoric asf
The good thing about hair us that it grows back. it feels like shit now, but you will be able to grow it back out. 

If you think itll be safe, as in she wont hurt you, take away food, etc. next time just absolutely refuse. Grab the door frame if she tries to make you leave, scream that you‚Äôre not going to get it cut. Make it too much of an effort to get it cut. ONLY do this if it wont get you hurt
Remind her that you get to choose her retirement home.
I hope your mom finds out some day that the people on the internet think she's acting like shit. I mean when it's safe obviously but idk. I just wish peole who do stuff like this knew how many peole are against them
Have you tried wigs? That might help if you want to have that long hair look! Also you‚Äôll get to grow your hair out soon!
Gosh this happens to me as well. My dad doesn't give a fuck. If you dont want a lot of dysphoria, tell him to cut just a bit. I just see so many cishet guys at school with long hair but i cant grow my hair. Sucks.

I hope things get better for both of us
I'm so sorry that's horrible. Its your hair your. You should be allowed to grow your hair out. 
Maybe you could get extensions?
I know it's not a full solution but would you be able to negotiate on an undercut or some mushroom cut? I hear 90s trends are popular so maybe worth a try?? 

Yes I'm old.
Tell her you'll remember this when it's time to pick her nursing home
My hair wasn't even that long....it was longer than my ears that's it...i was ok with how it looked. Yea you could make it a tiny bit shorter but not make me look like a boy again...i kinda looked like menhera chan now i'm ugly
The problem is that short cuts usually make us look more masculine.

We also want to get away from the masculine norm of short hair, so... Yeah...
I wanna have one but i'm too shy to ask...
No cause she is controlling my life and my life decissions
That‚Äôs exactly how mine was on that fateful day, just past my ears. I had been wearing a hoodie everyday hoping my dad wouldn‚Äôt notice my hair was getting longer. Didn‚Äôt work, but my words sure did
It‚Äôs anecdotal but when I was in the USAF one of the guys in my brother flight brushed his ‚Äòhair‚Äô (had been shaved like all the others)‚Äîhis flightmates made fun of him for brushing what wasn‚Äôt there.

His hair was three times as long by the time of their first haircuts. üëå
Exactly. These short cuts or pixie styles work on many cis women because of their size overall and features. The same haircut wont always be flattering on a face/shoulders that have been greatly affected by testosterone
You can get a cheap one at Walmart (it‚Äôs only $20 I think)
Ah I'm dumb, I'm sorry

Celebrating getting out of my comfort zone	So this might sound silly but last weekend was my first time presenting feminine in public in a non queer focused place. And I‚Äôm a year and a half into my transition. Unless my friends and I were going to a lgbt heavy place I always boymoded no matter how good I thought I looked. But I eventually got tired of trying to ‚Äústealth‚Äù. So with the help of my friends I finally got the courage to go downtown with them, get coffee, go clothes shopping, and visit my favorite bookstore for the first time as myself and not ‚Äúthe other guy‚Äù. The real kicker, my biggest fear which I thought would be inevitable never happened, no body looked at me. Even before transitioning I had severe spotlight syndrome I thought if I ever presented fem I would be mocked by everyone I passed on the sidewalk. But surprisingly except for a glance from an old woman no one looked at me or cared who I was. It was so bizarre. I felt normal for the first time in my journey. I just blended in.	"You look so cute, girl! I know passing isn‚Äôt the end all be all of transitioning, nor is it everyone‚Äôs aim, but you pass, my dear. I‚Äôm digging your jacket
You are so beautiful, congratulations!
Epic beauty IMO :)
Ashley!!! <3 love seeing you living it.
I love your smile, and I hope that you are going to feel comfortable soon! You are adorable!
I am happy for you, and you looking great üòä
I get told I pass but I often don‚Äôt feel it. I jokingly tell my friends I see an NFL linebacker in the mirror most days
Oh, that‚Äôs so rough to hear. Do you mind if I ask how long your transitioning journey has been?
Socially a year and a half like my caption says on this post. But medically only 8 months.
It‚Äôs an oft repeated thing, but the mind changes slower than the body. You ever notice folks who lose or gain a whole bunch of weight still think of themselves as their previous size for a bit? Or when folks get their hair styled dramatically differently can still surprise themselves in the mirror? You‚Äôre not just transitioning physically; you‚Äôre transitioning your mental image of yourself and unfortunately, that can be painfully slow."	12k9nw9	trans	229	0.96	2023-04-13 03:03:31
So this actually happened to me...	"I figured that everyone knew trans in public etiquette... like, especially trans folks.  But no shit there I was, in the busiest aisle in walmart only to be stopped by another trans individual. 

She says I'm pretty, so I smile, nod, and lie to her saying I think she is as well. This seemed like the courteous thing to do, especially because we were in such a public place. Then.... she asks how long I have been transitioning,  which made me uncomfortable but I answered and she then started to question wht I still have facial hair left and why isn't it gone yet if I'm  really trans. 

I explain 2 times I'm in the process, pointing out I only have small patches left and can't shave due to skin sensitivity. But she doesn't like that answer I guess and said she goes to Philly for it and I said me too and left.

Am I wrong that calling out people for being trans in a super public setting is a shit thing to do much less interrogating me and telling me I'm doing my journey wrong and not listening to the answers I give her? 

Everyone who was around during this I kept seeing around the store. They all smiled at me and made alot of eye contact and all the kids waved. So there wasn't public backlash but still way more attention than I cared for."	"This is awful of her. She questioned your validity, called out things that likely make you dysphoric, and downplayed your journey.   

For anyone reading this, don't be that person.  

For OP, I'm really sorry you had to experience this.
Personally I think that it should have just been a quick ""you look pretty"" exchange and end it there. She *should* know that kind of conversation should be had privately. 

However one thing is (for me personally) I try not to lie, so if I don't actually find them pretty, I'll try to find something else to compliment them on, like thier makeup, nails etc. But that's just me üòÅ
it's a weird thing to do yes and the questions about your facial hair and transition are also very weird
Honestly, sounds like the transmeds I have met.  Women thwt go straight ti asking about whether youbare getting bottom surgery.  Like, that's my business, not yours or anyone elses!
It‚Äôs an incredibly shitty thing for a trans person to clock another trans person, loudly announce it, and then interrogate them as to why they aren‚Äôt as far along as they are
There is a really, really big aspect to all of this that is being missed. The reactions of the other customers. Nobody hated on you, was derogatory or cruel. You said that people heard your exchange and you saw them later. And they smiled. And the kids waved, so the parents didn't tell their kids you are an evil pedo groomer, etc. You were accepted. Despite all the anger and hatred politicians are spewing, the average person in a Walmart is accepting. I know there are real problems, but this shows we have made progress. These people know you were put on the spot,maybe not necessarily why, and they tried to make you feel better. Accepted. Today, Joe Everybody supported you in a bad interaction with a trans person. Celebrate this. There is a long ways to go, but celebrate what has been achieved.
Umm‚Ä¶I‚Äôm part of a trans fem support group and one of our main rules is not to acknowledge anyone else in public because you don‚Äôt know how out they are or who they might be around. So this just completely shocks me. 

It might be different if it were a queer bar or some other queer specific event. But just randomly in a *Walmart*?! No. Absolutely not. I don‚Äôt care if you are well intentioned and just trying to be friendly. 

For anyone who is trans and is just trying to figure out how to meet more trans people in person, the internet is your friend. You can Google local resources or find groups that can direct you to in person events. But do NOT just approach strangers in public.
This *is* Walmart we are talking about.  /s
It‚Äôs already hard enough just existing in a public setting like this.  We don‚Äôt need our sisters adding to the stress.  It‚Äôs wrong of her.  Some trans people very early in transition don‚Äôt know the etiquette but that doesn‚Äôt make it okay to put you in public like that.
I'd lose my shit if that was me (FtM) that's so not ok I don't have words... I'm a very peaceful person but I'd struggle to control myself for sure.
OMG, I just read this waiting in line for a clerk and I look up and am pretty  sure he is trans masc.   Did I ask, or try to make some connexion on the basis of that one shared commonality of being trans?  No.  I just smiled nicely and kept on with my business as I would with any other clerk. 

To have the effrontery to overtly clock and out you then to lecture you about your transition is horribly rude.   My tactic is often to smile sweet as pie, and say, ‚ÄúGosh, bless your heart! Thank you SO MUCH for your kind concern but I‚Äôve gotta finish up here and get going. My sweetie is waiting  to take me out on a romantic date tonight.‚Äù Or something along those lines. 

People like this are often looking to connect negatively and get an angry response to affirm their own sense of superiority.  If you are super polite and syrupy-sweet, it totally disarms them.  Read between the lines though and you‚Äôre actually saying, ‚ÄúPhuck you, you obtuse troll. Unlike you, I‚Äôve got a great life so get the phuck out of my way while I get on with it.‚Äù
To me, they sound a little weird. Ok, a lot weird.

My usual action if I spot someone who may be trans is I just smile and do a sort of mini head bow (weird habit of mine) and leave it at that unless they approach.

For the curious, kind of like this  
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=boQmX6feIn0&t=83s
Never hit em with the courteous compliment back. This always gets people talking to you. I always say thank you and move on cuz I hate strangers wanting to talk to me. If I wanna compliment someone, I will, but that‚Äôs still pretty rare even among people I‚Äôm close with.
Honestly the only acceptable clocking behavior among fellow trans people in my opinion is a knowing nod to one another. A whole conversation in a very public place is awkward at best and invasive/rude at worst.
Shit I'm so sorry that happened
You're in the right here
No excuse for her making you uncomfortable but ‚ÄúI smile, nod, and lie to her saying I think she is as well?‚Äù Yikes that‚Äôs a shitty thing to say
My favourite thing about this is that you called her ugly. Made me chuckle.
I've never dealt with this personally but..That's a big oof right there. It's the same with therapy, or kink rules: If you see someone that you recognize as X, they don't exist in the regular world unless you already know them and their preferences etc. You don't know how out they are, or who could be around and overhear. As someone in the comments pointed out: Prolly different in like a queer bar or something but like. In regular public setting? Nah.

Clearly she didn't know the rules. Maybe nobody told her. If you don't known, then you don't know and have to be told by someone.

also as a sidenote like. ""wht I still have facial hair left and why isn't it gone yet if I'm really trans."" The fuck kinda question is that? Some people do transition all kindsa ways and all kindsa reasons. You could not shave at all if you wanted and you wouldn't be any less trans. So presumptuous. I assume they didn't do it maliciously but ughhh. That'd make me mad and kinda icky tbh.

Sorry you had to go through that.
what a bitch
I see other trans ppl every so often and I'd love to casually chat. But then I think they might feel like they're getting pointed or called out in public. So... I just say nothing and continue with my day.
What shit person is this? No parents to educate ah
Gentlepersons, if I do anything at all, I will just give them a nod.  I read a couple years ago that the person may be in a very volatile state themselves and just want to live quietly without the waves, high-fives or hey girl/hey dude!  I don‚Äôt want to assume for a second that their experience is my experience.  So I give them the respect and privacy that they deserve and go on about my day.
That is particularly weak of the trans person, but I don't expect cishet people to understand the etiquette. Why would you expect that? Most normies don't even realize we existed ten years ago.
Not cool of them for sure. Them questioning your transness is not okay
Thank you
My brain doesn‚Äôt usually work fast enough to respond to a compliment with another compliment in turn. I just say thank you and die a little inside.
*Flashback to all the times someone complimented my shoes, glasses, purse, or nails* ‚Ä¶ aww damn lol
I am usually of the radical honesty camp but I was so taken aback and couldn't find anything that was in anyway worth compliments. Like for someone being critical of my appearance, she looked like crap. Extreme and blocky and unblended makeup with and ugly outfit.... but I wasn't gonna just insult her as she complimented me and I felt too trapped to say nothing.... üòî
If you will forgive me for not answering your questions I will forgive you for asking them.
Transmeds?
ZOMG, my kid's doctor did that to me last week. There we were at an appointment and she congratulated me, very sincerely, and asked a couple of things including whether I had a new name and pronouns.  

Trouble is... my kid obviously sees me, but we haven't had the full talk on where this is going.  

All very kind and sincere and the affirmation felt great, but definitely caused me to have to do something I hadn't intended at this point. üò¨
Lololoolololol
I will definitely be using ""effrontery"" in more sentences from now on
Exactly what I do!
Just telling ya all the true story.
I compliment shoes etc because people can CHOOSE those. I‚Äôm naturally attractive and know that I did absolutely NOTHING to earn it so I‚Äôd rather be complimented on something I actually DO have a choice in. So that‚Äôs what I do for other people-tell them I love their outfit or their nails or something.
I tend to compliment people on stuff like that rather than their general appearance since I don‚Äôt want to accidentally make them uncomfortable
Hmm yes, I can understand the situation, I probably would have just done the same thing in your shoes then lol
Inexcusable how she made you feel, but it‚Äôs still really rude to talk about other women that way. We‚Äôre all trying our best with makeup and outfits
Sounds like a jealousy issue. Some people make themselves feel better by questioning others. It‚Äôs a crap move.
People, particularly transfolk, who believe that you aren't really trans unless you have had all the surgeries, procedures, I've even seen some say thst a trans person who doesn't pass or try to pass isn't really trans.
Yep. This type of thing is exactly the reason why. There are women at our group who aren‚Äôt out to their kids or their parents or their spouse or their job or whatever it is. And it‚Äôs best to never assume how comfortable they are. 

If feels weird seeing one of your good friends out in public and basically ignoring them. But sometimes that‚Äôs what we have to do for chance encounters to keep everyone safe/happy.
Right on!  I learned it the hard way, from a nun who was chewing me out for not respecting another adult‚Äôs place of authority.   She used some other choice words too but In retrospect, I deserved that particular tongue lashing.
But what about, when your pretty af and you know it.
That feel good to, especially when you can answer like I do. Which is"" awwwweeee thank you so much."" And if I have nothing to compliment on a person. I won't. I know it sounds bad but idc I'm not fake.
""your so charismatic!"".... With a dash of /s üòÑ
Personally I wasn't trying to come across as rude, I'm sure she was doing the best she could with her style. Makeup isn't necessarily easy, and I can remember when I was just straight up bad at at it, it just takes practice and I'm sure they will get better
All I said is I didn't think she was pretty but told her I did. Why are people mad I was polite to this rude person. Just telling you the story. I didn't describe her in anyway.
Does any one care about rude nowadays?
E gad thats horrible... like to do this without alot of money can take time and often going slower allows you to figure things out like your style and explore options instead of jumping in and making changes you may not have all the facts about such as best size or permanent make up choices.
Of course! I was describing why I personally give compliments, not trying to say my way is the only RIGHT way!
Or a ""thanks hoe"" *snaps and walks away*
You didn‚Äôt have to add that you lied when describing the exchange, and in the replies you said she ‚Äúlooked like crap‚Äù and shit on her makeup and clothes. What she did was awful but the way you‚Äôre talking about her appearance here is really shitty
And not every trans person wants surgery either!  Never mind yeah, the financial ability.

I told my wife and now I don't know what to do	"I tried posting this in /r/offmychest and /r/trueoffmychest. I think this is the far more appropriate place for it.

I (\~30 AMAB) started to think I should have been a girl when I was in middle school. I was put into therapy because of bullying at school when I was 14 and I came out to my therapist then. As part of this process, I told my older sibling who was ""supportive"". They would keep my secret but wanted me to talk to my mom. It was incredibly hard but I talked to my mom. That did not go over well. ""It's just a phase"", ""You are seeking attention"", etc. Around 17, I decided that I would just bottle up these feelings and deal with it. Maybe my mom was right and I would just grow out of it.

These feelings persisted throughout the years, but I continued to bottle them up. I married my wife over 5 years ago and we had our first child shortly after. I always felt guarded around my wife for fear of ruining my life. We moved to a southern state and I work for a fairly conservative company with very outspoken beliefs surrounding these types of topics. I was afraid to get too drunk or too high and say something that would derail my life to anyone, but especially my wife.

This year has been really tough so far. I have had some minor health problems which I knew was going to put me into a state where I might be vulnerable to saying something. To pre-empt this, I decided to tell my wife. I was afraid if I were to tell her when I was not in control that it would lead to a different outcome. I absolutely 100% adore and love my wife and I felt broken telling her. I told her that it started when I was young. I told her that my sibling and mother knew but they both wrote it off. I told her that these feelings were really strong, but I also care so deeply for her.

I felt like I betrayed her. I felt like I deceived her. She didn't deserve this. How could I drop a bomb like this on someone I love and care for so fully. However, she said she is 100% supportive of me and wants to help me figure out what this means for me. She has always been incredibly supportive and it should not have been a shock. But, she did not marry a woman. With this support does come the implications of the eventual divorce.

I do not know what to do. I feel like I am too old to transition and start my life over. I always worry about my perception to others. I am terrified of losing the absolute love of my life to this decision. I am scared about losing the career I have built and reputation along with it. I don't want to introduce complications into my child's life. But these feelings have been around for so long and eating at me. I feel completely selfish at the same time.

All this said, I think I will continue to suppress these feelings because my love for my wife and family far outweigh everything else.

&#x200B;

Update: I am blown away by the kindness and support of this sub. I hope one day I can show the same compassion and support to others as you have all done for me <3"	"OP It is Never to late to be your Self. Be happy that your wife loves and supports you. I myself started transition at 40. Its not going to be easy, but nothing worth doing ever is. Best of luck to you sweetie.
I'm in a pretty similar position, egg cracked about 5 months ago, told my wife about a month ago, been dealing with it for about 30 years though.  Slightly different outcomes by the sound of it though.  I'm fairly new to this otherwise but would be happy to talk if you want to, just DM me.
I came out older than you are now, and am also married. When we first had ""the conversation"", I was pretty much an emotional basket case, and was terrified that we might not be able to navigate through all the changes together. She was honest in the beginning that she just didn't know if she could stay with me if I transitioned. This was over two years ago and not only are we still together but we are even stronger than we were before. 

You already know inside that this is not going to just go away. It IS possible to have a shared future, but it is obviously not possible for everyone to make it through. I can't sit here and say that I know what is best for you in your situation, but there really is a possibility to have it all - life, love, family, and happiness, and honesty. I would be glad to talk more with you and share more about our transition if you think it would be helpful.
Im 34 and told my wife about a month and a half ago. (I went a bit extra with, ""new year, new you."")

One thing that has helped her, is /r/mypartneristrans. We also talked a lot about what that would and might mean for us. We both still love each other and right now? That's enough. Neither of us wants out or plans on it. Should that change, we agreed to burn that bridge when we get to it. 

For right now? Tell her how much she means to you and how much you care about her. We were both TERRIFIED that the other was going to leave until we talked about it. 

Communicate. Make sure she knows how you feel about her. Do special things for her. If she wants to do special things for you and support you, let her. Also, individual therapy would be pretty awesome for both of you. 

Will it work for sure? No idea. Don't even know if it will work for me. But it's worth the try.
I have a lot of the similar experiences with some little minor differences. I‚Äôm also over thirty and we have a child together. It‚Äôs pretty conservative where I live, but my company is very gender affirming. My wife was and still is supportive. I went through similar feelings and thoughts as you have. 

My wife found a workbook online for partners of people who decide to transition. It‚Äôs a safe space for them to process feelings and asks honest questions while being supportive. My wife wasn‚Äôt sure how she felt for a week but she was still supportive of me and my decision. After about a week and discussing our future in more details, she felt she had a clearer picture being together and realized she didn‚Äôt have to ‚Äúgrieve‚Äù anything because I am not changing my personality. I‚Äôm just adding things on I‚Äôve never explored. It also caused her to question her own orientation and realized she wasn‚Äôt as straight as she thought. She was also worried I would not wouldn‚Äôt want to be with her because I might discover I want other things or sexuality might change (which is not the case)

I‚Äôm not saying this will happen to you, but having more conversations will help clarify your future. It takes time, you‚Äôll both figure out the journey as you progress however you both decide to. I hope you the best and that wherever you land, you‚Äôll be the most happy with that decision.
It‚Äôs not too late. I came out at 30 and started hormones at 31. I liked what I saw when I looked in the mirror for the first time at 31 and I now love my body. 

You sound like a caring person but you‚Äôve got your head on a little backwards. You‚Äôll be a better parent and a better partner if you‚Äôre comfortable in your own body and happy being yourself. You aren‚Äôt a bad person for misleading your wife and dropping a big emotional load on her. You‚Äôre a caring person who tried for their whole adult life to make your family happy and secure then showed your wife the extremely love and vulnerability of telling her who you really are. 

It‚Äôs not easy to transition and depending on where you live, your families views, and what industry you work in you might have to trade a lot to live as yourself. But you don‚Äôt owe anyone your suffering. You deserve the opportunity to be happy and to live the life you want. 

Keep talking with your wife, get into therapy with an experienced and supportive gender therapist. In my opinion you‚Äôve suffered long enough to live up to your perception of other peoples expectations.
You ultimately have to do what's best for you.  Maybe it is best that you don't transition, but it has to be your choice and not just for someone else.  These thoughts have gnawed at you all your life and they will continue.  Your wife knows about this now, and that is amazing news.  Now, even if you don't transition, you won't have to be afraid to let it slip.  

She's supportive of you, so at least there's that.  I understand divorce may be unavoidable, but take your time with things.  This is a lot on both of you.  She said she'd be willing to help you, and in that time, perhaps she'll get used to the idea.  

I wish you the best.  I can't imagine how hard it is on you right now.  If you ever need someone to talk to, I'm here üíô
I think that should be yourself and don‚Äôt worry too much. From what you‚Äôve said your wife seems like a lovely person who supports you and wants you to be happy so if I were you I wouldn‚Äôt worry about her wanting to divorce you.
IMO taking care of yourself, processing your feelings and honoring your truth will make you a way better parent.
I am exactly in the same boat. I have no advice I just wish the very best for you
Read your post and had to check if I didn‚Äôt just write this.
I‚Äôm a 36 year old AMAB enby. I started transitioning 3 years ago. My kids have been fine so far. Transitioning did upset my relationship with my wife a bit but it might have gone better if I‚Äôd been more open at the start. Things have improved too, and I‚Äôm glad I finally opened up, and did something. I started questioning at 12, I tried to convince myself I was a cis guy for a long time. You might be happier if you did some exploration, maybe talked to a counsellor. You don‚Äôt have to rush into this, I know you have been dealing with this for a long time but even some little steps can help. It‚Äôs never to late, and you can stop if it makes things worse but your happiness, and health matter too.
She has assured me that we are always going to be connected especially since we will be co-parenting our child. She has not outright said we would separate but the co-parenting comment was the implication. Really appreciate your perspective on it and hearing everyone else's similar stories.
Thank you so much for this. The feeling of sharing this information with her has been so freeing. Unfortunately, I feel like I unloaded this weight to only place it on her. We are a team though and plan to work through this
Hi, I‚Äôm basically you except I dropped the bomb six months ago.

Try not to read too far into things. I‚Äôm sure you‚Äôre feeling really insecure about all of this, and that means you‚Äôre likely to assume the worst when presented with uncertainty. But you must resist that urge. It will cause you to do damage to yourself and the people you love.

Your wife might have been saying, ‚ÄúEven in the worst case scenario, I know we‚Äôll do a great job co-parenting,‚Äù and your brain turned that into, ‚ÄúI want a divorce.‚Äù

I know your brain does that because mine does it too. I have been my own worst enemy throughout this whole process.

Six months ago I told my wife. She told me she loved me, but she is 100% heterosexual. I was crushed. I thought she‚Äôd want to divorce me for sure. But things got better. She‚Äôs told me there are things she likes more about me since I started transitioning. Last night she said, ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt love a man or a woman, I love you.‚Äù

You‚Äôre not the only one figuring things out. Your wife is also coming to terms with this. Sometimes she may say something the wrong way, and our insecure brains will try to find the worst way to interpret that. You must resist that urge. Be willing to give her time to figure things out, but also ask for clarification when you don‚Äôt understand what she means. Don‚Äôt assume the worst.

One last tidbit of advice. When I came out, I didn‚Äôt want to force my wife to go along with anything. So I told her how I felt and what was going on with me, but I didn‚Äôt ask anything of her. I wanted her to take some time, figure out how she felt, and then tell me how she wanted to proceed. Months later she still hadn‚Äôt told me that she approved. I was in agony. I thought I was going to lose her and our son.

The relationship became strained. We stopped communicating. When we did they‚Äôd sometimes devolve into arguments.

One night we had a bad argument. Like the worst we‚Äôd had in a decade. It was the first time I‚Äôd ever considered divorce.

It boiled down to the fact that she felt like I was too hands off with her. She assumed that meant that I didn‚Äôt care, or that I was being dismissive. That *really* hurt me, because I felt like I had gone to great lengths to give her space to make her own decisions and it was being turned back at me to hurt me.

The next night it was like a light switch had been flipped. I understood the problem.

I was raised by a single mother, and she was very hands-off. She didn‚Äôt care where I was, who I was with, or when I‚Äôd get home. So long as she was happy, I was given freedom to do just about anything except burn the house down. But if my grades slipped or she was unhappy then she‚Äôd punish me harshly. At one point she took the door off of my bedroom for like 6 months.

My wife grew up with helicopter parents. They were all over her, and they still are. Her mother will threaten to call the police if my wife doesn‚Äôt reply to texts within 5 minutes. Did I mention we‚Äôre almost 40 years old?

So I was taught to show love by giving people space. You only get in their business when you‚Äôre mad about something.

My wife was raised to show love by getting very involved. She expects to be hovered over and told what to do.

So we were totally misunderstanding each other. I was giving her space to make up her mind about whether or not she could accept me as a trans woman. She interpreted that as disinterest in her feelings. She wanted me to get involved and tell her what the next steps would be.

My goodness, things changed so much after that conversation. My wife baked a birthday cake for me the next day to celebrate my rebirth. She‚Äôs been buying all sorts of things to help‚Ä¶ she‚Äôs been so good. She‚Äôs being super supportive. It‚Äôs everything I hoped for. And I almost screwed everything up because I wasn‚Äôt communicating clearly.

So talk to your wife. Communicate clearly. But also make sure you understand each other‚Äôs expectations. Don‚Äôt assume the worst about her intentions. And if you‚Äôre waiting for your wife to read your mind to understand what you want her to do, it‚Äôs not going to go well.

Good luck to you.
You didn't do it to put a weight on her.  You did it because it was important to you.  You did it because you trusted her.  All you did was take the weight off of your back and ask her to help you with it.  You love each other, and you shouldn't have to bear it alone.  

It's going to take her time, but I hope and feel that it'll only make the two of you closer.
The one thing everyone's advice has in common: communication. There was clearly a lack of that for years and I am trying to do better. I shared this post with my wife and it started a lot of conversations. There is a lot of reflection that both of us need to go through and we plan to be open about our thoughts and feelings so there is no doubt. Thank you for the support!"	syxp8y	trans	221	0.99	2022-02-22 20:39:02
I Made A Video Defending Dylan Mulvaney, And The Amount of Transphobia in The Comments was Sickening, I'm So Sorry You All Go Through This	I thought people were upset about it being a political statement (which it wasn't), and mostly didn't care that Dylan transitioned. But the amount of paragraph long comments attacking her and the trans community is brutal to read. I've been deleting a ton of them, but the amount of hate is really eye opening, I didn't know it was this bad.	"Yep, they just hate us for existing, the campaign just gave them someone to target
Thanks. It is relentless, and only getting worse.
It‚Äôs bad.  It‚Äôs also nothing horribly new.  I served during the don‚Äôt ask don‚Äôt tell military years and came out after I served.  Was promptly told to kill myself because my country doesn‚Äôt deserve the embarrassment of my honorable service.
They only speak of politics to legitimise fervent bigotry and make humanitarian issues ""debatable"" as a matter of ideology - it makes seeing us as inhuman more palatable: at best we're brainwashed NPCs that are infectious and must be rid of, at worst we're disfigured monsters possessed by evil to attack children. 

There is no rational anti-trans discourse, just hatred and ignorance - they're people without compassion, education and self-reflection following leaders who know they've never studied history and rattle them with lies.

""The first large burning came on 6 May 1933. The German Student Union made an organised attack on Magnus Hirschfeld's Institut f√ºr Sexualwissenschaft (roughly: Institute of Sex Research). Its library and archives of around 20,000 books and journals were publicly hauled out and burned in the street. Its collection included unique works on intersexuality, homosexuality, and transgender topics. It's assumed that Dora Richter, the first transgender woman known to have undergone sex reassignment surgery (by doctors at the institute), may have been killed during the attack.""
Thank you for caring.
yeah.  It‚Äôs pure hatred.  Some of these people have literally been making bomb threats against Budweiser factories just because a trans person‚Äôs face was on a can of beer.

It‚Äôs the for profit hate industry that drives this stuff, Imo.  I think The reason anheuser-busch did this is that Bud-light hasn‚Äôt been selling well, their stock has been slowly sliding down for years, and they are hoping to have their ‚Äúcoke at the Berlin Wall‚Äù moment where history books become guerrilla advertising for their product.

Of course, in reality that company donate ls to republicans, and now the CEO has released a statement ‚Äúapologizing‚Äù for the ‚Äúcontroversy‚Äù undermining what goodwill they had accumulated.

Like‚Ä¶ I‚Äôd love to see more trans faces on products, and I‚Äôm worried this violent backlash might impact our ability to get public facing jobs.  Who is going to face down stochastic terrorist and legislative threats to their businesses just to hire a trans receptionist?  

At the same time, I feel thoroughly exploited by both the conservatives and Budweiser.  The hateful voices, the Carlsons Jones‚Äô and Crowders, make money railing against Dylan, and I think the plan from Bud was to leverage their vitriol to eventually make money off of trans allies buying their beer as an outlet for ‚Äúfighting fascism‚Äù

The whole situation fucks me up.  They are both riling up a lynch mob against us to make money.
We‚Äôre at a 7/10 on the [Genocide Stages]( https://museeholocauste.ca/en/resources-training/ten-stages-genocide/), with stage 8 happening more and more frequently at bigger and bigger right wing events
The more ‚Äúnormies‚Äù discover the sheer level of hatred leveled at us, the more I HOPE it will be shamed out of existence. I think the silent majority who even notice go ‚Äúthat sucks‚Äù and continue throughout their day because humans are inherently self and tribe centered. I‚Äôm not trying to throw shade with that comment.

Do you think you can make a video that shows how much hatred you‚Äôre getting? Something statistical, like ‚Äúhate comments average this many words, positive comments have this many, here‚Äôs the ratio in positive to negative comments in numbers of comments and number of words‚Äù. Then compare those numbers to the same number of positive to negatives on a different video. Use infographics to drive home how much energy and effort goes into these hateful comments. Also highlight the tiny number of people that they‚Äôre hating, the hateful right has the fearful right convinced we‚Äôre EVERYWHERE in huge numbers when we can rarely find trans friends in real life!

I‚Äôd be happy to help with the video if you want! If you‚Äôre willing! I also understand if you would rather not put a bigger target on your back. I‚Äôm leaving the country from a blue state because I‚Äôm too afraid to stay and fight.
Thank you so much for trying to protect and defend us. It gets wild sometimes. I remember one time a security guard at the place I worked started calling me slurs and implying I wanted to sleep with him just because I wore makeup. People suck but people like you remind me not everyone is bad.
Welcome to our lives lol. It‚Äôs getting so much worse lately. We are the villain of the week.
I'm a male whose a proud ally and all this fuss over a trans person being on a beer can is a sign that society is fucked
i detransitioned a few years ago, even if it wasn't right for me seeing ALL of the hate the community gets absolutely breaks my heart, i thought we were advancing. i will never forget how my peer's ostracized me for feeling like i was a different gender. i will never forget the pain i felt when people would purposefully dead name me (i still dont use my government name). i will never forget the boys that went out of their way to physically assault me in front of my classmates with no repercussions. my family wonders why i get so upset if it doesn't effect me anymore. its empathy. i pray for the day we can all accept each other, but sadly i don't think we will get there peacefully anymore.
Maybe in the future you'll believe people telling you it *is* that bad without having to experience it yourself.
Hey,where your video,I'm gonna laught at these stupid comment,this will be a bit fun
As a post transition Youtuber I lose subscribers every upload now (audience is slowly correcting but it's a long and rough ride) and regularly have to remove comments. Most people are nice, but the crappy people will make sure you hear them and a lot of other people are just there to watch a video.
Yep, it‚Äôs every day if you‚Äôre active online as a trans person üòê
Maybe in the future you'll believe people telling you it *is* that bad without having to experience it yourself.
They consider trans people to be easy targets because let's face it, the vitriol comes from both sides of the political and social spectrum. It's gotten pretty bad. The misguided priorities of Americans will likely be our downfall.

I'm an expat in Southeast Asia and my ex and close friends are transitioning. I've been repeatedly warning them that they may want to rethink going to the States. Make no mistake, there are serious existential problems trans individuals face here as well but there's no widespread concerted effort to punish and eliminate their existence.

Most importantly, you **ARE** loved, cherished, and appreciated, not by all, but by the people that matter. Remember to vote. They won't win in the end, the people that hate you are losing influence by the day, which is why they've amplified their attacks and declared war against you.

I wish I could give you all a big giant hug and protect you.
I agree with everyone that it is pure hatred, but you have to ask when and why it even escalated to this openly hostile point. Because to be honest, up until recently, and as a big people watcher/sociologist kind of person, most people didn‚Äôt give a s*** about any of this. But they are being fed loads of false crap, that no one fact checks, and allows their emotions to be manipulated into a narrative that is totally false. 

So now we are dealing with a dumbed down masses buying into the absolute BS being spread by Evangelical Crusaders. The people have become sheep who don‚Äôt want to be pointed out for being different, want to be accepted by the ‚Äúcrowd‚Äù, and will turn on anything with little prompting and no facts all to be a part of the crowd.

It‚Äôs not that this many people hate trans, it that the hatred and toxicity of the groups that DO hate them has become that influential on those who would normally not care.
All I can say is mourn the dead, fight like hell for the living.

I know others suffer from this, so i don‚Äôt mean this to be funny.   But I‚Äôve hated and been saying such terrible things to my self for so long, that I don‚Äôt know if others hate even registers.
I went in like ""nobody cares she's trans"" and then the scum of the earth came crawling out of the woodwork like ""um actually!"" And then was wildly transphobic. Insane.
I was kinda in shock reading the comments, I can't believe this happens to that degree.
This a million times. I love business so I've kept up with it, but the new CEO literally said ""our brand is fratty and out of touch, and we need more inclusivity"" so they ran campaigns to appeal to genders other than men. 0 politics, just a CEO trying so salvage a company on a decline, normal business stuff.

Yep, and the best part is Bud Light apologizing to the bigots for ""dividing them""... Cause fuck the people they're targeting...
Once you‚Äôre aware of it you start seeing it everywhere
It's too this has to be said, but  trans and lgb people really need to arm yourselves and work together, or if possible leave the state. The Republicans are coming for you, and there's no doubt they'll:  1. Put you in camps and 2. They'll have to ""sterilize"" you.   Just look at the history of Hitler because the Republicans are using his playbook. I'm sorry, and I hate that in this country, that loves to boast to the world how ""free"" we are (we're not), it's come to this. But this is the reality of living in America.
 I have a trans in my family as well as an out-gay member, and I support them and I fear for their well-being.
Yup.  In this case, by using the conservative hate machine to advertise bud light.  They sell more bud light, and I have to talk my friends down from suicide.  Hooray for capitalism.
I like to think that I feed off their hate,as when I see these kind of things,it just make me more determined to live,to show these things we cannot even call ""human beings"" that I can be what I want.
Lol wait did they?
Wow, I guess I'll have to continue to not drink their shitty beer.
I hope people see the reaction to this campaign and Chris Tyson coming out and finally come to the conclusion that the only reason our rights are a political topic is bigotry in the first place.

These are two adults living their best lives, doing absolutely nothing wrong and  the right is foaming at the mouth about trans people existing in public.

 It's always been that way, but it's all out in the open now for all to see, no concern trolling over children transitioning, no dog whistles, just pure unadulteraded hatred for trans people.
I was watching a tour of museum ship HNCS Haida - the last remaining Tribal class destroyer - a few days ago, and noticed that she was flying a Progress flag beside the Canadian flag. They did a piece to camera with it in the background, but no mention was made - don't know if the creator even noticed it.


Ohhhh, the comments. Fortunately largely gone now, but some people are colossal dicks.

My parents say if I ‚Äúdamage our relationship‚Äù because they won‚Äôt use my [24F] girlfriend‚Äôs [25MtF] pronouns then that‚Äôs on me.	"It‚Äôs all so overwhelming, all the time. I need to be the most well-educated, literate, and respectful person at all times if the topic of my girlfriend gets brought up, or trans issues in general. (Or LGBTQ issues at all, I‚Äôm bi and they aren‚Äôt pleased with that either)

I make the slightest ‚Äúdemand‚Äù or raise my voice and I‚Äôm getting disappointed looks and tears from my mother. My dad will say ‚Äúlabeling people [transphobic] when they disagree with your views is awful intolerant from the side that claims to be all about tolerance.‚Äù

I‚Äôve never called him or my mother transphobic (at least, not to their faces) and in the past they‚Äôve been fully kind and supportive to trans people we‚Äôve known. But not to my girlfriend.

For some reason it being my girlfriend (who they‚Äôve known since before she was out to anyone) means they have objections and don‚Äôt want to be ‚Äúdishonest‚Äù with their viewpoints.

It hurts and it doesn‚Äôt help that I live with them over 6 hours away from my girlfriend due to having to move thanks to COVID. It also doesn‚Äôt help that I‚Äôm closeted non-binary. That too.

They are kind loving people, and that‚Äôs almost the worst part. They are generally reasonable and care so much for the people around them, but they genuinely believe that transitioning does more harm than good, and out of their care won‚Äôt support it.

I don‚Äôt know what to do anymore. They keep saying they have open minds and I could convince them with the proper data, but I can‚Äôt be perfect. I can‚Äôt. I‚Äôve got my own mental health issues and a job and‚Äî it‚Äôs just too much. I never know when a ‚Äúdiscussion‚Äù will start, and god forbid I avoid one. I have no support.

My extended family is worse. I was hoping- planning on my parents being the supportive ones. Helping me with the extended family and protecting me like they have all my life. But it‚Äôs clear they won‚Äôt be that. I have no friends here. Every day I feel more isolated after moving here from my old job.

I feel guilty for not being a better ally for my amazing girlfriend.

I feel guilty for hurting my relationship with my parents.

And I feel so alone.

If you read this, thank you. I‚Äôll take anything. Any advice, any words. Anything.

I apologize if this is the wrong place for this. (And, I do want therapy, everyone is booked out for months and months where I am and it‚Äôs another overwhelming thing to try to find.)"	"Your parents are pathetic toxic people. What they are doing is literally an abuse technique used by manipulators called ""gaslighting"" where they take all their shitty behaviours and make YOU feel responsible for them.

PLEASE, PLEASE for the love of god get the fuck out of that house and never look back!! Those people do not deserve you as their child and they do not deserve to have you in their lives if this is the way they treat you.
Find a friend to stay with - find other family if you can - just get out of there and stay safe xx
Your parents are gaslighting you. You need to come to terms with the fact that they are not safe people. 

My parents gaslight me, too. It‚Äôs emotional abuse. And just like your parents, they are caring and kind to everyone else. 

But their kindness and support is conditional where I am concerned, because as their child it is my job to be exactly what they want me to be, not exactly who I am. I suspect your parents are the same. 

They can respect everyone‚Äôs reality but your own, because they see you as an extension of themselves, not as an individual who has a valid identity apart from them. 

They are pushing you away by not respecting you. Their claim that you would be doing something wrong by setting a boundary to make yourself feel safe and respected is classic emotional abuse.
So, your parents are transphobic, they were just hiding it. Their behavior is repulsive. They are the ones damaging the relationship by refusing to even come to the table. 

I want to repeat it one more time, they are the ones damaging the relationship, do not feel guilty as you have done nothing wrong.

They may seem kind and reasonable, but their kindness and reason stops where it comes to trans people. That makes them selective, not even willing to see past their bigotry for their child. I have no doubt that if you came up with a good argument on how transitioning is actually extremely good for people, which by golly it is, that they would move the goalposts, because really they are just bigoted in the first place and coming up with a reason to defend their awful behavior. This means they are transphobic.

With that said, what to do about it. That's a much harder question. Reading some of your other comments over here you say that this is only coming up when your girlfriend is not around because you won't tolerate them behaving badly to her. Then why will you tolerate them behaving badly to you?

You say you are tired of arguing with them, very reasonable. I know it may be hard to consider but perhaps leaving them is the right thing to do. If their behavior is keeping you in the closet and exhausting you it means the environment they are creating is toxic for you to be in. If you aren't in a position to do something like that right now, I would say explore your options

If you feel confident enough to do so, stand up for yourself. I don't mean be horrible back, I mean that you should tell them how their actions are making you feel, as it looks like they are causing depression, or at least the thought patterns that lead to it. I mean that you should stay calm and explain to them why their rationale is wrong, and that you should not take their shit when it comes to making you doubt yourself. Because that is what they are doing. You mother looking disappointed and crying is emotional blackmail, and your father's reasoning is flawed. It isn't that they disagree with your views, it is that their views, which cause you to come into contention, are transphobic, thus a transphobe. 

If you want to go down the road of arguing with them, which I don't advise unless you believe that you will actually get somewhere, I would advise reading about debating, and learning about logical fallacies. Since your father it seems likes to commit them. If they won't let you speak, or if you aren't confident enough in speaking to them, write a letter. Arm yourself with information and statistics which are pertinent, don't let yourself get sidetracked or distracted talking about things which are not the point of the issue. Furthermore, figure out what the core of the issue is, what is the real problem here. Once you figure it out, drive towards it, their position is not well founded, yours is.

You feel alone, if you have trusted friends, talk to them about it. Talk to us here. I can't be of any physical support unless you happen to be in the Waikato but know that I believe in you. And that my messsages are open. You are not alone. 

Wow, that was longer than I intended for it to be. Honestly I could write more but it would be overkill without more accurate information.

Lots of love, Alice.

If your parents are in fact open minded, this video by Abigail Thorn from before her transition helps explain Transphobia in an easy to digest and educational way. This way, they can see from an outside perspective why what they are doing is in fact transphobic without it being an outright attack
Hey, I think that many people gave you their opinions etc.
But I just wanted to say : you're a good ally for your girlfriend, you're a good person. The fact that you came here, telling that, show how wonderful you're and how you want to see the good in people. 

You don't have to feel guilty, you've done nothing wrong. I'm so sorry that you feel alone, I Hope your situation will be better soon enough, if we can help for that, we are here.
Agreeing with all the others, this is clean cut gaslighting. Your parents *are* being transphobic, just not entirely explicitly and are being manipulative to you over it too. They are not going to be convinced while they have authority over you. Get away from them if you can. 

I may be a bit younger than you, but I‚Äôm your mom now.
I think you probably have the message by now, but you are still left in the same position with the same options (which may be none).  It seems like things are going to be rough for at least as long as you are living with them; I hope you find the patience to deal with them.
Right now I think you need to focus on keeping yourself going. What you've described is clear emotional abuse. It is compounded by you dealing with your own gender.

As long as you realize that the issue is with them, you should be able to make it through ok. Just get out as soon as possible and don't be afraid to talk to a therapist if you need to. Family can really mess you up sometimes...
There is no kindness or hate in transmisogyny. Your parents are *not ""*kind, loving people"" and if your girlfriend is as amazing as she is you should be sticking up for her more and not give into the wankery or the manipulative tears of your parents , no matter how genuine their belief is, their beliefs are harmful.
You obviously love your parents. It is okay to acknowledge this but also set limits. Such as, ""Mom and Dad, I love you, but I don't want to discuss _______ or my relationship with _______ anymore.""
This was a hard comment for me to read, but I am taking it into deep consideration. Thank you for your time and advice
Psychologists use the term ‚Äúgaslighting‚Äù to refer to¬†a specific type of manipulation where the manipulator is trying to get someone else (or a group of people) to question their own reality, memory or perceptions.""

That's not what is happening here
Alice, thank you so much for your thoughtful response.  I‚Äôve reread it a dozen times now, and each time is helping me break through my parents ‚Äúreasonable‚Äù attitudes and see my situation for what it is. 

My whole life I‚Äôve been taught that family is the most important thing, that family is always there for each other and can overcome any difference of opinion we might have.  But their refusal to ‚Äúbelieve‚Äù that trans people exist isn‚Äôt an opinion, it‚Äôs hateful. They make it all pretty and scientific, but it‚Äôs transphobia, plain and simple. That‚Äôs hard for me. 

It‚Äôs true, they know if they do or say anything remotely hurtful to or around my girlfriend I will not stand for it. They haven‚Äôt crossed that line (though I also haven‚Äôt given them the opportunity).  As for why I tolerate them behaving badly to me‚Ä¶ it just goes back to trying to be an advocate I guess. I desperately wish they would change, I want a relationship with them if I can have it.  I‚Äôve been taught not to burn bridges. 

I‚Äôm exhausted Alice. And on edge all the time, which doesn‚Äôt help my mental health. My depression has been being successfully treated for almost a year, but it‚Äôs slowly coming back in force and I‚Äôm terrified. 

Also, you‚Äôre spot on about the emotional blackmail. That‚Äôs something that‚Äôs been going on for years, though I sometimes let it slide due to my mothers own mental health issues. (Can‚Äôt bring up the emotional blackmail otherwise she‚Äôll be upset lol).  Plus, if I bring up how their emotional responses are hurting me, they always say: ‚Äúwell we are people too, why aren‚Äôt we allowed to have our reactions to things?  You can‚Äôt make us stop feeling how we feel.‚Äù  And I never know how to respond. 

I don‚Äôt know if I will get somewhere arguing with them, and that void of unknowing is terrifying.  Something I didn‚Äôt mention in my original post is that, due to some trauma completely unrelated to this and my parents, getting into an emotionally charged disagreement has about a 50% chance of sending me into a panic attack or meltdown.  It‚Äôs hard to defend your position reasonably when the act of defending it at all is a trigger that makes your brain decide you‚Äôre under threat. 

But you have a wonderful suggestion I haven‚Äôt heard before, writing a letter. That‚Äôs an excellent idea and one I think I will attempt. 

Im also going to start looking at potentially moving out. As nice as the financial support is, my mental health is being harmed. Space might be best for everyone involved.  

Unfortunately my trusted friends are far away and very busy, but I‚Äôm going to try to reach out more to them for support.  My best friend in the world (my girlfriend) is wonderful in every way, but I can‚Äôt bring up all my struggles with my parents to her right now. She struggles with a lot of guilt and would immediately take this all on as her fault, WHICH IT IS NOT!  She is not the problem, and I never, ever want her to feel like she is. My parents are the problem. 

I really appreciate all the support Alice, truly it‚Äôs been so helpful just being able to talk about this somewhere, and to hear some small reassurance that I‚Äôm not wrong to be upset by this. 

Thank you will all my heart
I just watched this video and really really appreciated it for putting my parents actions firmly in the transphobic category despite all their arguments to the contrary that have been causing me confusion and distress. I will be sending it to them this weekend, fingers crossed they won‚Äôt just be offended and not internalize any of it. 

Thank you so much for the resource!
Thank you so much. I‚Ä¶ I needed to hear this more than I care to admit.  Reading this feels like a warm hug and a pat on the back, and it brings me to tears. Thank you.
I just want to make it clear I tolerate no disrespectful treatment of my girlfriend in the slightest.  When she is around they call her by her chosen name and don‚Äôt bring the topics up. They know I will not stand for that. But as I mentioned I live with them at the moment and they direct their concerns towards me alone.
I wish to sincerely apologise for the harshness and bluntness of my words - it must have been painful to read and you didn't deserve that ‚ù§ parents mistreating their own children is a MASSIVE trigger for me and I tend to have very reactionary responses to it x

I am sincerely sorry I let my feelings get the better of me x
Telling her that she would be the cause of the deterioration of their relationship with her if she sets boundaries because of their disrespect is an effort to change her perception. Her perception is, rightfully, that their behavior is unacceptable and they want her to believe her proposed response to that disrespect (distance from the relationship) is irrational. 

It‚Äôs gaslighting.
I'm glad that my thoughts can be of help.

A couple things to say. There is no strength to a scientific argument which would say that trans people don't exist. The reason for this is multifaceted. We can't agree what gender is, or how it occurs. Based on what we do know about gender from a biological perspective being trans can occur in a multitude of ways. Lastly, every single piece of ethical research which has been done about trans people has strengthened their position instead of eroding it. Nurture arguments go out the window when you consider that cisgendered people who are raised the wrong gender exhibit the same dysphoria signs as trans people who are raised the wrong gender. Transitioning helps both. It is people, not medical dangers, which makes transitioning dangerous.

You said that your depression has been flaring up, I would be willing to wager it started to happen around the same time your parents started acting this way. Or perhaps when they moved you away from all of your emotional support. 

If arguing is a trigger for you I would advise against it highly. The letter is a good idea but will often lead to an argument, so be warned there. It doesn't mean to not write the letter, it just means that you need to have a good enough argument in the letter that you can successfully head off the subsequent discussion until such a time as your parents have had time to properly consider it. 

For the, I can feel how I feel argument there is a tactic I devised for getting through the same wall with my mother, to mixed success. The idea is to use their belief that they are a good person to leverage a change of opinion by convincing them that their current opinion is hurtful. It begins by fully understanding their point of view, not believing it but knowing what they think. Then showing them how their ideas are harmful to others. It is important to not mischaracterize their position anywhere or they can weasel out by saying ""I don't think that"". They are technically right that they can think and do as they wish, but they cannot do so whilst still being good people. You can't have your cake and eat it too.  Essentially you aren't saying, you have to change your mind. You are saying, you can keep believing what you want, but I know you're a good person and the way you think hurts people. These sorts of extremely lengthy arguments where you have to build the logic up from the floor to even begin saying something useful are where the letter comes in, as in an actual argument they are extremely difficult to utilize. Most of this is purely theoretical as I don't advise arguing with them, you are already justified, there is no reason to spend further energy on this.

Your parents seem to like the debating tactic of destroying the field of the argument, instead of pitting their actual argument against yours, because they know they will lose in a fair fight, they choose to make it so that there is no way to actually argue with them by constantly asserting that your correct position doesn't matter and that trying to change them would be immoral or hypocritical. It isn't, not even slightly, especially after they seek you out for the discussion. It is they who are being the hypocrites. 

I agree that it isn't your girlfriends fault, it's mostly the fault of poor media and generations of hate, and then the fault of your parents for buying into it. I don't know how your girlfriend would feel about being kept in the dark while you are struggling. I've always been a proponent of honesty and openness. Maybe talking to her is a good idea, you don't have t bring everything up at once, you can be subtle and slow about it. If she tries to make it her fault, explain that it isn't. It isn't your girlfriend's fault for being who she is, and it never will be. 

Separating can be really difficult but from what I can see of your position it seems like a very easy weighing of factors. You have a certain amount of things which you can spend energy on, and a finite amount of energy, which is currently being over drafted:

\-Job

\-Arguing with overbearing parents / Moving out

\-Mental health

Two of these three cause you to gain proportionally to the effort put in. And you can only choose to end one of the energy sinks. Mental health problems don't go away, you need a job to survive in the world. Your parents, they aren't fulfilling their role, let them realize they are pushing you away, that will change their attitude pretty quickly. The only benefit to living with your parents currently is financial. Especially since I feel rather certain in saying that your parents' actions are contributing to your mental health issues. Imagine if you could put the mental energy you spend arguing with them and worrying about it afterwards, into your work or mental health issues. Supporting yourself has it's own challenges but weighing those against a panic inducing home life I know which I would choose.
Absolutely! Really hope it helps!
You're welcome dear, please take care of you ‚ô•Ô∏è
I have no idea how the OP will take your comment, but me, honestly, your answer is the best thing that I could read this whole month. Harshness is INCREDIBLE necessary imo when the person fails to see how they are being manipulated or are living in a fucking emotional prison! Which I am! But I always tend to not think about it and think that I just need a bit more money to get the fuck out. But anyways, THANK YOU! For giving me more bravery to get out of my toxic family and never get back
Gaslighting is not an effort to change someone's perception. It's a deliberate attempt to make someone question their own sanity. For example, hitting someone and then telling them it never happened. Convincing someone that they are hallucinating. Denying that past events ever happened.

Their behavior is shitty, but they are not gaslighting.
Check your first comment again.

Like, I appreciate that you‚Äôre concerned the word is overused or improperly used, but this behavior is literally gaslighting.

Edit: convincing someone they are ‚Äútoo sensitive‚Äù or ‚Äúoverreacting‚Äù is a staple of gaslighting. 

Also, the APA considers ‚Äúgaslighting‚Äù a colloquial, not clinical, term.
> Edit: convincing someone they are ‚Äútoo sensitive‚Äù or ‚Äúoverreacting‚Äù is a staple of gaslighting. 

Sometimes calling someone ""too sensitive"" is done with the intent of making a person doubt their memory of an interaction (""Was his tone really that bad?""), and sometimes it's done with the intent of making the person think their boundaries are unreasonable.

Both are toxic behaviors and valid reasons to leave someone, but the latter can be done by someone who's simply emotionally immature, while the latter is usually done in a more intentional way. The distinction matters.
Convincing someone they are too sensitive is not gaslighting and is definitely contributing to the overuse of the term

Trans & Military	"Hi! Im Celeste, and Im a SPC in the US Army. I joined in 2020 and am coming up on my one year left mark haha. A lot has happened, a lot IS happening, but i really want to get some opinions and feedback on my situation.

So lately, the past couple months id say, i‚Äôve finally felt comfortable and safe enough to open up to two of best friends, one who is also in the Army, and their partner. These are the first people to really know ANYTHING about any of this. (The whole point of joining the army was to leave home and start new life lol) I looked online and have been doing research on transitioning, resources, advice, tips, etc, etc, etc. you know the deal. 

i got so excited!!!! in Washington you dont need a diagnosis or anything you literally can just talk to planned parenthood, schedule an appointment and find out if transitioning will work for you. Not only that, but this entire area is so inclusive and trans friendly, at least from what ive experienced in the last couple years in WA. I was literally SO close to scheduling an appointment, but then i realized

I cannot find and info on transitioning WHILE IN the army?! I know that they have Equal Opportunity things for trans people to openly serve, but what does that mean for someone wanting to transition while already in? Ive had major dysphoria the entire time but ive kept my chin up and looked forward to my life after this period, but the more i wait the sadder ive gotten. i feel like im wasting such valuable fucking time, when ive already scared and denied myself out of so much time (as a girl) already. Im currently on anti depressants, but it still really effects not only my life as a person, but as a soldier too. it ruins my work performance. which is hard because everyone knows how youre treated when you cant keep up, which then causes me to do pushup which means heavy excercise which means muscles which means majorrrrr dyphoria etc etc. 
Its a terrible cycle. :(
its been very damaging forsure, but thats okay! things will always change, including myself haha. 

I guess what i really need help with is how to bring this up without involving direct chain of command, and finding out how to transition without getting 
 A.) Kicked out
B.) in trouble
C.) harassment from current coworkers who dont know, care, or even respect trans people as a whole
D.) outed by said co workers.

any advice or tips help so so much. i feel like ive never been able to find & relate fully with someone in my situation. 
thank you üíö -Cel"	"Sadly, you do have to get your chain of command involved eventually. They need to know any medical stuff you have going on and hiding that will be a really quick way to get kicked out.

If you want to start discussing it with someone without getting your chain of command involved though, a chaplain can be someone to talk to. They're required to keep any discussion you have with them confidential and while they're probably not going to be the most accepting, the one I talked to while I was in was very helpful with getting the process rolling at least.
Alright, current drill sergeant here(and closeted as well, so I feel you). To address your specific concerns:

A) you won‚Äôt get kicked out. Latest policy protects gender identity under EO as well as treating gender dysphoria as equal to any other medical condition while serving. Meaning they are bound to render the same level of care that all other conditions receive. (This kind of covers point B as well; you won‚Äôt get in trouble and if administrative actions are pursued by your chain of command, you can fight it through EO channels)

C) I wish I could tell you that this won‚Äôt happen, but we both know it will. The best thing to do is have a good understanding of the EO complaint process and to come out to your commander/1SG before everyone else. I would say Behavioral Health is step one and step two is letting your command team know. This gives them the courtesy of being prepared for any interpersonal issues that might come up instead of blind siding them with having to go into ‚Äúdamage control ‚Äú mode. 

D) There really isn‚Äôt anything you can do to prevent this other than asking those who know to not do it. As shitty as it is, some fellow soldiers are garbage people and will do this just to gain what I call ‚Äúinfantry points‚Äù. Unfortunately we are in the same position right now that our gay, lesbian, and bi brothers and sisters were in 2011. 

All this may sound negative and hopeless, but keep your chin up and remember there are probably other trans soldiers in your area. There are a surprising number of us. Also, check out r/transalute, military one source, the aclu, and spartapride.org. They all have good info and resources. üè≥Ô∏è‚Äç‚ößÔ∏è‚ù§Ô∏è
Have you been to r/transalute?
I thought orange man did a phobia and done did a ban or something.
I'm in a similar situation talk to your pcm they should be able to help also your 1st sgt should have some guidance they can send you to help I haven't been to med yet but what I've read is they want you to do it all through the military which includes getting a diagnosis
You will have to go through your chain of command eventually if you want to transition. Your first step is talking to mental health. They should be able to guide you through the process. I am a disabled veteran who is transitioning through the VA. If you get to thst point and want help navigating the VA I would be glad to help.
I feel ya here! Same boat but I‚Äôm in the Air Force! Your PCM should be able to help you. Eventually you will have to involve your chain of command but I don‚Äôt believe it has to be like your first step. Good luck girl! üòä
I'm surprised no one has brought this up

AR 2021-22 has all the information to go about the correct steps in order to begin gender transition (they go by Harry Benjamin standards so you will need to get a diagnosis from mental health, unfortunately planned Parenthood will not be an option for this)

As others have said, who knows if future policy will change but having lived through the trump ban, you'll be safe from unwarranted discharge. Discrimination however, might still be a problem (EO is your friend)
Unrelated but I love your name. You‚Äôre lucky I‚Äôm a guy otherwise I‚Äôd be stealing it
Document everything that you do with the Military and get copies of any med or other reports.  You will need them down the road.
Sent you a DM. I am a psychologist for the DHA and serve as head on a local Transgender Care Team (TGCT) I have overseen at 35-40 soldiers through the process at my local MTF and serve as a consultant for other bases with respect to providing services to TGNC soldiers. If you need any help/guidance/advice then DM me. I can walk you through the process and what to expect.
Omg maybe the next drone strike on a school will be carried out by a trans woman ü´¢
Request an appointment with mental health.
Inform them you have gender dysphoria concerns

By going through medical your command won't be informed.

Next step is to decide how much social transitioning you feel safe doing on that base and in that state.

I wish I had been brave enough to do it when I was active duty but Trump was still in office when I got out
Secure protect contain
Ive looked into joining the raf my self and wat ive not found much my self
I wish I could join the military I'd either join the royal navy or the army but sadly mental health issues bar me from service
I‚Äôd encourage you to reach out to Sparta, the transgender support organization for the US military.  https://spartapride.org/
You might want to go over one of the EEO courses on ALMS (enrolled through ATRRS).  They might have some info that could help you as a transgender person in the Army.  I‚Äôm a contractor for the Army and did just that before I came out at work.
I might be biased cause I don't like the military but that aside, could you take a break, take time to transition, and come back??
Hi! Im in the Canadian Armed Forces (CAF) - Armoured Soldier. 

Its really nice to see that there is a little military trans community on here! 

For the CAF it has policies, but not well known. Should there be anyone here in the CAF who is trying to transition while serving, please let me know and I can share some helpful policies and resources that I presented to my COC.

For the CAF, the first step is advising the COC. For me, I had to advise my Troop commander, who also advised the Adj of my unit. 

Obviously, I am growing my hair out. So, people are going to find out. Another issue is I am on course soon. The military does not allow for a lot of privacy. But I will just suck it up for a bit longer I guess? Not ideal at all. Additionally, the military seems to attract a very socially conservative clientele. This makes social settings difficult. 

Obviously your experience will be so different from mine. I hope you are able to transition safely and can protect yourself from any of the possibly toxic culture. üíï
Trans Army Girl here, for policy stuff, check out DODI 1300.28 and AD for 2021-22. 

The process looks like this:

1. Get diagnosis from BH
2. Get treatment plan from case manager and PCM
3. Get referral to endocrinologist 
4. Get memo signed by BDE command 
5. Start HRT
6. Change gender marker in DEERS

To avoid getting kicked out or in trouble, you'll have yo go through BH and your PCM. As for harassment/being outed, that's tough. People are assholes. I would expect BS but you have EO to fight back. Will your company commander have your back ? That makes a big difference where EO is concerned. 

SPARTA is a great resource and if you're on discord, there's a trans military server I can send you an invite for. Anyway, if you need anything, feel free to reach out.
Here is a link to the resources you are looking for. My chain of command is using this for as a guide for my transition. Hope it helps!!

British Forces count uncontrolled gender dysphoria as a barring medical condition.

We must accept detransitioners	"There's been a lot of hatred thrown at detransitioners, and unfortunately, it's not just from places you'd expect.

Sadly, a not-so-insignificant portion of the hatred comes from within the LGBT community.

There's a widespread misconception that detransitioners are using their unfortunate life experience to spread hate and malice against transgender people. While it is very true that a few notable people likely have this despicable motive, the majority of detransitioners are not so deceivingly inclined.

They're regular, normal people, just like you and I.

It's difficult to face the concept that some people may experience significant enough regret years after transitioning to begin detransitioning. While they obviously do not make up the majority of transgender individuals, we're discovering that they may be more than outliers in a statistical sense, although more research is needed to absolutely solidify that claim. Reguardless of the ultimate outcome, detransitioners are a reality we must embrace and support.

The reasoning for the LGBT community to have difficulty discussing detransitioners is understandable. They've been politicized by conservatives worldwide as ""proof that transgenderism is a choice"" or that allowing people to transition is ultimately dangerous. A select few detransitioners have gone so far as to use their circumstances to promote that false narrative. Detransitioners existing in the first place provide a means of questioning and anxiety to many transgender people's solidified identities. But, reguardless of their weaponization by anti trans advocates, detransitioners that detransition due purely to regret (not due to transphobia, physical problems, etc) do certainly exist and we cannot ignore them. Medical science definitively proves the existence of transgender people. It likewise proves that transitioning is ultimately very effective at alleviating the mental stress of gender dysphoria, so much so that it is the current recommended treatment. Research further proves that successful, content transitions are most effective if started within a few years after the onset of puberty. In short, there is *undeniable evidence proving the existence of transgender people and the effectiveness of transitioning*. Of this truth, we shall accept no compromise and give no ground.

HOWEVER, we likewise must accept the fact that some people, despite feeling absolutely certain of their desire to transition for YEARS prior, do begin to experience regret in doing so even years after starting the process independent of the results of transitioning or the social acceptance of their transition. And, unfortunately, some of these people were teenagers when they started. These detransitioners are extremely important, because they provide evidence that research into transgender care is far from complete. As we rightfully push for easier access to transitioning hormones and surgical procedures, we also reduce the ability of the medical system to screen out people who's discomfort could stem from other sources and potentially be worsened in the future by deciding to transition.

The underlying point in this discussion is that *there must be more long term research into transgender adults, youth, and transitional care*. Does this mean we halt pushing for transgender care and awareness? Absolutely not. It DOES mean that we fully accept detransitioners and wish them well, reguardless of how their stories may be weaponized by bigots. It means that we accept the branching of gender affirmative care to not necessarily conclude in hormonal and surgical treatment. It means we allow further research into what causes people to transition to further improve the medical care of trans youth and adults. It means we embrace the idea that ""gender questioning"", or even fully transitioning, does not have to conclude in HRT and surgery.

While ultimately I understand that much in the way of this occuring is due to the despicable political landscape aimed at destroying trans people under the banner of ""protect the kids"", we still have to make the adult decision to accept that transitioning does cause life-altering changes that can never be fully reversed and as such is not something to be taken lightly. We're not those who hate us; our existence is based on medical science and evidence. As such, we must accept unbiased research into the causes of detransitioning  and how those findings may affect the concept of gender affirmative care. And, the most important point, is that we cannot hate detransitioners nor exclude them from our circles simply because they received an incorrect diagnosis when they were in highschool. After all, like transgender people, detransitioners aren't going to disappear.

We spread love, not hate, forever and always."	"100%! The only issue I have with anyone who detransitions is when they go full on anti trans and claim that all trans people are groomers and all doctors are tricking children into getting surgery. Unfortunately those people are making things extra difficult for trans and ex-trans alike.

Most of the bigots only need one example to fully validate their entire world view. There is nothing inherently wrong with being trans, or previously trans, and I have a huge amount of empathy for anyone who has had any kind of medical procedure and later regrets is. 

If someone involved in that process was incompetent or malicious, I definitely want them held accountable, at the same time, I absolutely hate it when it is presented as a generalization as opposed to their specific personal experience. 

I would never generalize my transition to anyone else‚Äôs experience, and I have complete respect and sympathy for anyone who is able to accept that their experience, no matter how bad, is their own.

I do find it especially frustrating that the bigots will exploit detransitioners to attack trans people, but they don‚Äôt seem to have any interest in fixing the societal problems that led that person towards whatever issues they had in the first place. 

They just claim that the existence of trans people is the only possible problem but somehow we are only trans because of some failure in society. It‚Äôs a chicken and egg situation except trans people are somehow the chicken and the egg.

We are the victims and perpetrators at the same time. If a detransitioner supports that theory, it becomes very difficult to support them.
There are studies already such as this one, which overwhelmingly indicate that most folks detransition due to a lack of support:

Detransitioners are important and their experiences are valid and need to be heard. But it is a myth that Trans people silence detrans voices. Detrans experiences are important to be studied to see what factors lead to them detransitioning so that we can work towards correcting those factors.
It is also true that a fair number of detransitioners on the internet are just trolls pushing their anti-trans agenda. Detrans voices are important, but often they are the only voices that some people hear, trans voices are important too.
It is a myth that trans people silence detransitioning voices in my experience. It‚Äôs also absolutely shameful that people try to lump in people who have evolved or discovered their gender identity is beyond a binary transition in with people who have detransitioned, and attempt to use them for their own agendas.
Trans people are generally acceptive and supportive of detransitioners. Unless you are a right wing nut you know that the point of the trans movement is being free to pursue what makes you feel more at ease, even detransitioning.  


But why in the hell are you making detransitioning sound like something that happens half of the times? We know the stats! It's around 1%! And it includes a lot of regret for complicated surgeries that governments impose on us in order to change documents.  


Also you're spouting transphobic points when saying that making transition easier will make people regret it.  


This whole post is in bad faith and you're doing no service to detransitioners.
does anyone else believe that detransitioners are still *of trans experience*? because I do. they transitioned TWICE for cryin out loud. I personally find it fascinating and would not ostracize them just for being detrans.

I learn way more about myself from people on different paths than I do from people living a similar experience. I value the detrans perspective because it oftentimes validates my transness
It's important to remember that there are different types of detransitioners. People who got so much hate they return to the closet, people who realise that their gender identity isn't binary, people who have health complications with hormones, people who realise that they are cis and probably some others that I do not know about.

There is no problem with detransitioning. Do what makes you happiest. Only issue is that detrans people get weaponised against trans people and some are outright transphobic. Of course these are in the minority of detrans people but transphobes know how to push against trans people.

Every detrans person who identifies as cis shouldn't speak over trans people. You do not see me talking over women as an ex-woman, do you? 

Also a lot of detrans people retransition later.
If we want society to be understanding, we should be as well. We're all different, but we're still human. Why treat others with the same hate or lack of acceptance as we receive? Thank you OP, for promoting the spread of love and not hate.
Nobody I know hates detransitioners. They are valid and a part of the community. 

The only ones I have a problem with are the ones that try to deny trans people access to healthcare or rights, who use their own poor choices to try to make our lives worse.
I'll respect them as long as they respect us. Too many of them immediately turn their backs on trans people and act like beings trans is a huge issue and should be resolved like global warming after they detransition and that's not fair.
Transitioning to your agab after having been trans outside of your agab is also transition. They‚Äôre not detrans, or ex-trans, they‚Äôre twicetrans. Embrace them too. 


Naturally if some individual is nasty and being hateful call them out. That goes for cis folks and trans folks just the same. Use your power for good.


But never assume you know someone‚Äôs heart just because they belong to a group that is sometimes used in propaganda against you.
This is bullshit. 
Get your gender exploratory therapy shill the fuck out this sub.

The unbiased research on detransition shows majority of the time it's due to lack of resources or social pressure. 

Anyone coming to this sub attacking ""gender affirmative care"" should probably just be banned. Toxic bullshit.
I couldn't read the entire post. I don't have the attention span. I agree with the sentiment of the headline though. Some detransitioners have been created and or used against the community, but there are so many who just are.  I know several people who chose, or are considering choosing to detransition. They were terrified to tell me, because they thought I would hate them.  Let people be who they are. Whether they detransition because medical transitioning isn't right for them, they develop health problems that make them have to, or because they can't take one more day being separated from their children/grandchildren because of transphobic family.  There are many reasons to detransition.   


We can fight back against the hateful detransitioners by spreading the accurate information. There is no need to attack everyone who says they did, are going to, or are in the process of detransitioning. We should not meet everyone who mentions it with instant hate.
I have no problem with de  . I don‚Äôt like seeing them let themselves be used as props by transphobes for 15 minutes of fame. I come to this thread every day and see children asking if starving themselves is a viable way to delay puberty.. and then see a detransitioner let themselves get used by someone who‚Äôs not even a doctor, anecdotally, to argue why HRT should be unavailable..
Alot or a few,maybe some trans people have no choice but to detranstion and we didn't detranstion because we weren't trans.

Alot of us do it because of fear,being ourselves in a alot of places can fundamentally risk your life and possible outcomes of choice.

Sometimes it's like knowingly going into Bloods territory wearing blue,it can be visible and you know it's dangerous,you might not get hurt that time but you might on another day but wear blue everyday and paranoia and fear eventually builds up.

people like myself just can't handle that and that's just being human.

Detrans lives matter too! üíóü¶à‚úä
They just have to pass the same litmus test as any other human, are they being a cunt?

If someone detransitions for their own reasons, no problem. It could be financial, safety or social reasons.

If someone starts trying to weaponise their experience to spread lies and fear, that's being a cunt.
so well put hope this reaches people who need to hear this <3
I don't see a whole lot of hate for detransitioners. Most of the hate I notice is towards the ones who use their experience to attack trans people. The thing I notice however is that it's just not talked about much. Most likely because it's not a huge issue.

Detransitioners make up around 1% of the trans community acording the the studies I've seen, and 95% of that 1%, detransition due to factors such as; high costs, lack of medical access, lack of support, and other issues. I belive that less than 1% - 5% of 1% of trans people transition because it wasn't for them - basically they just weren't trans. 

Simply put, if one detransitions because it wasn't a life for them, that is completely fine. But I do not think they are trans. They realized that they weren't actually trans and decided to detransition. And while they should be treated with respect, kindness, and compassion, thinking of them as trans is simply incorrect. But again, I belive they make up a very small portion of the trans community and as far as I have seen, the detransitioners who do so because of the other issues listed above, are treated well in my experience.
I would say I've been seeing a lot of hate, but I have noticed a certain discomfort that some people have with those that detransition. I have very very much noticed that some people feel ashamed for wanting to detransition for different reasons because of the way the enemy (!) has used any and all of those that detransition to attack everyone. Of course, like I've told several of those that were thinking of detransitioning, forget what the bigots are doing because they'll just lie and make stuff up anyway. Their claims make no more sense if they mix some actual facts into their basis for it.

Now, you might think that loosening up the ridiculous and arbitrary requirements around accessing hormone therapy and gender-related surgeries would make it easier for people to rush to it looking for an answer that those procedures can't give. The reality I've come across more than once is that the gatekeeping and unreasonable expectations actually **increases** the incidence of people second guessing and possibly regretting their choices! I was surprised, too! The thing is that the bad faith obstacles that people put in the way distract from reflecting on the choice, because it adds value to actually aquiring the procedure, and it makes it more costly to reject it, so people will stick it out to see if it gets better. After all, they won't get a second chance from the people that don't listen to them and that they had to lie to.

I had a friend that had to go through a transphobic  psychologist to get HRT due to the country they lived in. It was a giant struggle with arbitrary waiting times, they had to bend the truth and tell them what they wanted to hear, in the grand tradition of our people. After a few weeks, my friend started to have some doubts. While I was pretty sure it was depression and anxiety messing with them so I didn't want to simply advise them to go back and burn their perscription, the right thing was to tell them to take a break to think about it. The problem, of course, is that it would show up on blood tests most likely, and there was a chance it could be taken away from them, so they had all this pressure to go one way or the other. It's the most I've been involved in a situation like that, but not the only one.

I'm actually pretty happy about the fact that bigots can't ever seem to do anything right, but it makes it a real bummer that people are suffering for it. The real irony about these weaponized detransitioners is that even when they're real people with real experiences, they're **still** creations of bigot because the bigots both but that false value on those procedures, and convinced them not to take responsibility for their decisions. Meanwhile, this lovely community has done a great job so far at supporting people that have wanted to detransition as far as I've seen. I definitely think that any hate towards the detransers is misplaced. The best thing we can do, in my opinion, is be open and vocal about our goals and values.

We're here to maximize happiness and satisfaction in people's lives, and if that means detransitioning for someone, then we're proud to help them achieve that. There's no shame in detransitioning, it doesn't feed hatred towards us, and it's all just another step in someone's personal journey through life. Hugs for all!
Totally agree. Not trans but as a doctor I can see the lack of care on people who wish to transition and individualised approach. If there is better education and counseling/planning, maybe things will be managed more appropriately. Making major physical alterations should be an informed decision and based on personal wishes.
A good point to raise here is about whether these people were not sure about transition. Or maybe partially had other reasons to question their gender. 
My wonder is if there were signs early that they could have been picked up and discussed prior to transition. 
I get often the feeling that we do not discuss the decision itself or know how to handle the psychological part of it
Since I announced that I no longer wanted to be seen as a woman, my andocrinologist and some of my 'friends' have unfortunately reacted badly to me.
It's transphobia those people should be criticized for, not detransitioning.

We shouldn't make them connected. We should be working hard to de-associate the two so people who detransition aren't guided to that pipeline.
We do not need to support a detransitioner going full anti trans ""groomer"" screamer. Reguardless of their attitude, however, we cannot be sending death threats and hateful messages. We are not the same as those that hate us.
It‚Äôs almost always due to social pressure and lack of acceptance or not being able to afford the costs.
While some studies do exist, none are fully comprehensive. A major issue with these studies has been too small of a sample pool, insufficient duration of study, or limited funding. Let's be honest; whatever the results of current studies, researchers are afraid to touch this topic with a degree of severity. Why wouldn't they be? Reguardless of their findings, the results will be twisted to suit an anti trans agenda simply because it includes the word ""detransition"". We have a significant of scientific and societal work left ahead of us.
Many detransistioners get rejected by their trans and lgbt peers and then get pushed into the arms of the conservative agenda where their pain is used as a weapon. This is a fact. The solution, then, is to make damn sure they feel safe and don't end up losing their support systems for doing so.

When someone leaves the trans experience we need to give them a warm goodbye.
It is absolutely an undisputable fact that detrans people have received hate, harassment, and even death threats from the LGBT community, and specifically the transgender community. There are Tiktoks of people telling detransitioners to ""shut the f*ck up"" because they're promoting hatred towards transgender people. I'm not saying anyone's voice is or isn't important; and I fully agree that detransitioners are heavily focused on to promote anti-trans political retoric. But hatred against them cannot come from us. It must be nipped in the bud *now* before it grows further.
it is not a myth that trans people silence detrans voices. I have seen it both online and IRL. sometimes it is directly to the detrans person. *oftentimes* the silencing happens in conversations between trans and cis people in order to validate the trans experience.
We don't even have the power to do that.
I'm sorry you feel that way. I have put significant effort into conveying that we should not allow transitioning to be more difficult or less acceptable, nor should we cease the fight towards making it even more obtainable. However, we should also likewise expect the statistical number of detransitioners to potentially rise in the next decade and as such we should do our best to continue to welcome them. If they go off the deep end with transphobia, that's a completely different story. But even in that case, while their message should rightfully be condemned, we should not promote hatred towards them to the extent that they receive death threats.
How many detransitioners have you seen do this? I find it hard to believe you‚Äôve heard of enough specific detransitioners to make up enough of a data set to draw conclusions on. Being trans doesn‚Äôt mean someone is more likely to be a bad person, neither does transitioning twice. In short, you‚Äôre being bigoted. Stop it.
Double trans people can triple jump. We mustn‚Äôt incur their wrath. Because we shouldn‚Äôt be assholes, mobility isn‚Äôt a major reason.
Thank you for providing evidence towards my point.
Yea, it's pretty fucked up. That being said, many of them don't want to be weaponized by transphobes and are taken advantage of. I think there would be a significantly smaller portion of them that stray into that error if the transgender community fully embraced them reguardless of what the transphobes want to say about it.
Me too I'm +18 but still is uncomfortable.
I think in part this is a resourcing problem. To access hormones where I live, I have to be on multiple wait lists for a combined period of about a year (yay socialized healthcare /s). If clinics and psychologists are that overburdened, I don‚Äôt know how they can possibly do an adequate job of providing individualized, case-specific care

There is technically a psychological vetting process I have to go through to get permission to receive hormones (which I strongly, strongly object to). But there‚Äôs basically zero actual support.
Absolutely, and it‚Äôs really the anti-trans groups that are linking them together because they want us to turn against each other. It‚Äôs crazy how they are exploiting people by claiming that person has been exploited.
I'm still going to call them genocidal shills all day, because that's what they are.  Anyone who supports groups that want to eliminate trans poeople, allies themselves with fascists who want to eliminate trans people, they get no support.  They get called out for what they are.
A very small portion of the entire population goes trough with medicaly transitioning. And even out of that alredy small percentage, an even smaller one decide to stop their transition. And even then most of them donit because of social pressure and other kind of situatuons in their lives. So yeah, I do think that the people who transition and realize its not for them and then start pushing against trans rights are in fact representative of the entire population. I will accept them when they accept me too. I havent seen a single detransitioner be pro-trans.
Oh definitely, nobody should be sending death threats to anyone. The other day in a different sub someone posted an image depicting Trump almost fully submerged in quicksand or something, hand outstretched with the caption ‚Äúwhat would you do?‚Äù I‚Äôm in the military, and barely survived his trans ban, but I would try my best to pull him out. Why? Because whatever kind of person I am dealing with, I am not going to let them determine what kind of person I am.
Not really true, it‚Äôs just a fact their are not a lot of detrans ppl. We should support the ones who exist but it‚Äôs true their is not a lot of them.
No one is afraid to touch this, there's loads of studies out there.

This is a good breakdown

https://www.gendergp.com/detransition-facts/
Bigots will never warm up to other people and accept them no matter what you do to them. You can give yourself up on a silver plater they will still think you are lesser and that you deserve to suffer.
This. We should validate their experience.  

However, we have to make clear they are a *very* small minority of people who transition.  Their life is valid, but they do *not* represent transfolk.
wait we should not tell people to shut the fuck up when promoting hatred towards trans people?
The thread you're basing your world view on wasn't statistically significant.
If we let ppl transition their will be the same amount of detrans ppl theirs always been, their has never before been bans on hrt like they are doing now. I don‚Äôt understand how you could think it‚Äôs ok to ban transitioning when that will literally kill people.
there's an ex marine who identified as a trans woman who had detransitioned and is now spewing transphobia and ""protect the children"" bullshit. can't remember the name though
No, I am not. I'm asking for respect in return which is more than fair. 

In fact, here's 3:

Helena Kerschner- used to identify as a trans man and now speaks out publicly against gender affirming surgery and states that  it ruined their life and will ruin yours too. 

Walt Heyer- a former trans woman who speaks out against gender affirming care and how ""harmful"" it is to youth and also uses their religion as a source. 

Cat Cattinson: former transman(?) Publicly speaks out on their platform about how puberty  blockers are harmful an extremely dangerous. 


I'm not saying everyone who detransitions is like this, I am  speaking about these kinds of people.
how?
There are definitely detransitioners who are pro trans, problem is you don‚Äôt hear about them much because the mainstream conservative media is only exploiting the ones who are willing or susceptible to be manipulated to be anti-trans.

Also I think there is a lot of stigma from all around about detransitioning, so a lot of them probably just want to be left alone and don‚Äôt talk about it unless they are pissed or exploited.

I think the most important point is that no matter what someone says, we have to be the calm and mature ones despite how angry we might be. For MtF people, this is what cis-women have been forced to do since forever. It‚Äôs the only way we have a chance of being heard.
I would save Trump not because of his humanity, because he has none, but because he's lolcow.
Ok. Idk what this has to do with accepting detransitioners, but ok.
We don't actually know how much of a minority they make up currently. While they are CERTAINLY a minority, they may not be as small as we think, whether you like to hear that or not. They absolutely do not represent transfolk, and transfolk are undoubtedly much more numerous than detransitioners, but their existence is proof that the codex for gender affirmative care is in no way complete yet, and that we must allow further research to proceed. We shall give no ground, mind you, but it's still important to find tune diagnosis of gender dysphoria.
The lense I focus my worldview through is analytical caution. I do not understand the meaning of your suggested ""thread"".
I don't understand how you perceived that at any point I suggested we can transitioning
You can add Oil London to that list now too
[removed]
I repeatedly made the point that gender affirmative care and transitional availability are not to be meddled with, only that the research into effective transgender care is far from complete and is having difficulty proceeding not only due to transphobic legislation and arguments, but also from within the transgender community itself due to fear and animosity that the already imperfect access to medical transition could be meddled with in the process. This understandable fear is something that we must work on ourselves to prevent it from stalemating the progress of research into transgender care. The above comment made multiple remarks clearly driven by anxiety that allowing further long term research into detransitioners may produce findings that do not support the current limited research that most detransitioners do so due to transphobia and not regret of transitioning at all. If encouraging research into detransitioners to potentially lower the amount of them in the future while expanding access to gender affirmative care is a bannable offense, then perhaps we truly are an echo chamber.
I could agree with this if it‚Äôs in a bubble that doesn‚Äôt include him having or potentially having the influence to completely ruin my life and put me in danger.
Nor do you know how many people are doing this.  Your evidence is fucking TikTok, a shitty spyware platform.
fine tune diagnosis of gender dysphoria?  


Diagnosis of GD is just however the psych feels that day, it's just gatekeeping at its purest.
Yes, we absolutely agree with your nuanced approach to this.
I literally didn't say a THING about that ? I said I will give them respect if they give it to me. Not that I'm going to demonize them immediately for detransitioning wth they're already going through enough shit already?

They are allowed to do so if they feel they need to. I am speaking of the ones that do that then act like WE'RE  the issue, that turn their backs on us.  Also I'm not going to sit here and name every single detransitioner that has turned their backs on trans people, you asked me if I'd seen enough to make an assumption (which I didn't do, I asked for basic mutual respect) and I gave you three easy examples. I'm not forming an entire anti-detransitioner opinion based on three fucking people. 

I don't  even HAVE an anti-detransition approach I don't understand where you're coming from on  this.
ah you say ‚ÄúI love detransitioners‚Äù but what if I replaced ‚Äúdetransitioner‚Äù with ‚Äútransphobes‚Äù? it now says ‚ÄúI love transphobes‚Äù checkmate
It‚Äôs not, people are just pointing out the fact that a lot of detrans ppl do so bc they have no support. We should 100% do more research but their is alot of research already done. Education on trans ppl and letting people transition might increase detrans ppl but it will also increase trans ppl who come out. I don‚Äôt think their will be a huge increase in the percent of detrans ppl bc of that. If theirs more out trans ppl theirs more detrans ppl ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
there's decades of research behind gender affirmative care, and you literally came here implying things that have been studied haven't, implying that we need care that doesn't lead to hormones ect.  

it's bad faith bullshit, and it's pretty clear you're here to try to push some gender exploratory bullshit, which is just conversion therapy.

letting the patient/subject guide the care and attending to their needs has always been and will always be the only correct way to care for trans people. Any suggestions that we depart from that, particularly because of a cohort that gets elevated above the other 98% of trans people, is only advocating on behalf of the trans eliminationists.

just stop.
Trump didn't work alone, what he did was what the republicans have tried to do forever. Him dying will make no difference.
citing Tiktok as a source for hate speech is NOT the same as using wikipedia as a source for your thesis paper.
It was a false (pride) flag attack!
A shitty spyware platform that has remarkable popularity
Any occurrence of maliciousness towards innocent people from within our own community must be condemned.
 ...so you agree that it's diagnostic protocol needs work?
Proceed cautiously, but allow research to proceed. It's important that we do not become the mindless crowds of anti trans zombies puttering about the current socialscape
You immediately jumped to them being disrespectful. That was the ground state you were working from. That is not okay.
Lmao made me giggle
Lojik.
Exactly, he is just a figurehead or mascot for a whole entire horrible group of people. Honestly I don‚Äôt think he actually has any personal convictions or beliefs other than that he should be worshipped. It just happens that the type of people who are willing to worship him are the type of people who want us dead, and he has to appease them.
Don‚Äôt get me wrong, I‚Äôm sure the people posting negative stuff are really trans, but I don‚Äôt believe they represent the majority.
And?  So you ran into a couple stupid kids on TikTok, hardly cause for alarm.
That‚Äôs a very optimistic yet naive view of the community. Being LGBTQIA+ does not prevent you from being bigoted towards the LGBTQIA+ community. 

It‚Äôs impossible to get rid of all bigotry and hate. But it‚Äôs not impossible to atleast call it out in a lot of situations.
It doesn't need work it needs to allow us to self diagnose.
I think there is a counterintuitive issue with gatekeeping and restrictin access to transition.

For a long time there was one trans narrative that you had to fit to be able to transition. You had to say you wanted srs in order to get access to hrt.

That meant people lied and the strict narrative of what a true trans person was becomes a self fullfilling profecy.

So whats the story with detransitioners, and I mean the ones who realized they weren't trans at all. Did they genuinely feel like they were a different gender than the one they were assigned and then those frrlings changed? Did they somehow just convinced themselves they were trans? How did THAT happen? Or do you think maybe when a large portion of the community has a fairly high level of distrust of healthcare professionals that they get to a point where they will do everything, including lying about their experience to get access to healthcare?
Research is already proceeding, what are you on about?

https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8213007/
We are going back to college specifically to do research about being transgender, with a focus on transwomen with DID.  From there. Go into advocacy.   So yeah. We agree.
Didn't even once say they were disrespectful.  I asked for mutual respect.
They aren‚Äôt ‚Äúbeing disrespectful‚Äù they are inciting violence. In Florida detransitioners literally flew out to try and ban hrt for anyone under 18. That will literally kill people. We should support detrans ppl but not transphobes. I don‚Äôt support trans ppl who act transphobic why should I have to respect someone who‚Äôs transphobic just bc they detransitioned?
I think the issue is that when it comes to being trans, there is no such thing as ‚Äúrepresenting the majority‚Äù. My gender doesn‚Äôt have anything to do with who I am or what I believe. We are all unique individuals who happen to have had the same birth defect. Even experiencing anti-trans discrimination is widely distinct based on your intersectional perspective and experience.
The concept of detransitioners has been danced around by a scientific community afraid of being accused of political motivations for simply performing more in depth and larger long term studies on the phenomenon. I am certainly not here to fight you; only to ensure that it is understood that we cannot make the same mistakes of those who oppose our existence. The underlying point I wish convey is that malice towards detransitioners from within the LGBT community is an actual, presently occuring issue and it needs to be recognized. Validating detransitioners is not invalidating transfolk, even if it should be twisted and presented as such by bigots. Even if that occurs, we will have our morality intact.
You asked for it, implying it wasn‚Äôt already there. You don‚Äôt get handed a glass of water and immediately ask for water, you ask for water when you‚Äôre thirsty.
Transphobes who have detransitioned are transphobes and should be treated as such, the issue is acting like detransitioning makes someone a transphobe.
Sure, what I mean is that OP seeing a couple kids posting on TikTok is not indicative of a wider problem with hate for detrans folks.
Nobody is arguing that detransitioning is not valid.  


Except for governments that don't allow changing back documents for example!
That analogy made NO sense to this conversation. It is not an implication to ask for mutual respect it is just a statement.
If OP said he ONLY saw a few kids posting on TikTok that would be valid. I think the point was that was an example that most of us can relate to experiencing in various places. It‚Äôs pretty clear that it‚Äôs not just ‚Äúa couple kids‚Äù, but I would also certainly not credit it to ‚Äúthe trans community‚Äù.

For the same reason we can‚Äôt hold detransitioners responsible for detransitioned bigots, we can‚Äôt hold trans people responsible for transgender bigots. Being anti isn‚Äôt an inherent aspect of either ‚Äúculture‚Äù. 

Problem is that anti-trans people will still generalize and hold us to that standard, so it‚Äôs reasonable for us to discuss ways to possibly mitigate it.
How often do you ask for things you already have?
I genuinely feel this is entirely blown out of proportion.  You‚Äôre going to have some people that get extremely emotional about the detrans issue, that doesn‚Äôt mean ‚Äúthe trans community‚Äù has a problem with detrans folks.

What people have a problem with is the rhetoric spewed by some detrans folks.  If someone detransitions, cool, they made the wrong decision, shit happens.  It‚Äôs still exceeedingly rare that people choose to detransition because they weren‚Äôt actually trans, and they need to accept personal accountability without making it seem like there‚Äôs some sort of conspiracy pushing people to be trans.
How often do you start arguments on zero grounds?


My dude, asking for respect from your fellow human is not implying that you believe the respect is not there, it is  grounding for comarardary, a sign that no bad blood be between the two parties.
That‚Äôs my point, it‚Äôs the anti-trans people who absolutely are going to blame the ‚Äútrans community‚Äù. We can at least be conscious of it and maybe try to mitigate, or we can just ignore it and see what happens. The anti-trans people don‚Äôt use nuance. It is being blown out of proportion by the people who want us dead.
Again, you don‚Äôt ask someone who respects you to respect you, they already do. It‚Äôs not complicated, take a moment, listen to what you‚Äôre saying, and go take a nap you seem tired.
Okay, dude. Once again I'll state I wasn't implying they DIDNT. You cannot sit here and tell me beyond a shadow of a doubt that from both sides there is mutual respect because there absolutely isn't and it's sad asf. We bite eachother's tails all the time and we SHOULDN'T.

transition makes me happy. so I often answer 

""*even if I happen *not* to be trans, how could I possibly regret the best moments of my life? I cried tears of joy when I got my first T injection, even if I realize I am in fact a woman, it won‚Äôt erase the joy I felt that day.*""
Even if I do regret it nothing is permanent. And either way I‚Äôll just be in the same position I am now. I already hate myself and my body, if I still hate it when I‚Äôm done transitioning then I‚Äôll have to figure out what else is wrong with me
What if you regret getting a degree in this field instead of that field? What if you regret getting married? What if you regret knee replacement surgery? Or buying a house?

You have to measure the risk/reward for all decisions. If you never did anything with a risk of regret you wouldn‚Äôt do anything. Idk why transitioning would be any different.
The best feeling for me right now is getting gendered correctly on the phoneüò©
my sister says this to me whenever we talk about the future, she says i should quit my job and keep studying until i become wealthy enough to have a family. Not even remotely close to what i want to have in my life. I'm a hairdresser and she says its not a real job and then talks that if i start transitioning no job will ever want me
Its like looking for a place to eat and u see ONE bad review on a 4.7 stars restaurant and u decide not to go there because of it lol.
My mom tried to stop me form starting hrt with "" you might regret it"" and "" you're not mentally sound with yourself. You're still gonna be you at the end of the day"" as if I hadn't thought about and desired to be a woman all my life.
My answer always will be, *and if I do it's non of anyone's business* .... ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
The also don't see that people that detransition later retransition.
They act as if I didn't spend my entire time in the closet second guessing myself. Once I came out, it was because I knew that what I was.
I hope I have regrets because it will mean I'm still alive.
I wish I could feel like I won't have any regrets.
I haven‚Äôt started HRT yet, but if I stop feeling like nothing in my life is real and that I am not a real person, i will already never regret it.
So here‚Äôs the thing: i‚Äôm already depressed. I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs gonna get worse. Even so, it‚Äôs worth the chance because it‚Äôs at most 3/100 that regret the decision. *AT MOST!* So, if I were to tell a gambler they had a 97% chance of winning, how likely are they to take that bet? Pretty fucking likely. It‚Äôs a great bet! So yeah, I‚Äôm gonna take it. Give me my estrogen, and if I regret so what at least I tried.
My sister keeps telling me this because one of her friends detransitioned
It's honestly crazy for me to think that cis people try to make our decisions for us when they know not what we've experienced
I was actually having a discusion with a friend of mine about this last week, and he was wondering if there were any studies with percentages of detransitions, are there?

Btw, he wasn't arguing against being trans, he's got a very matter of facts kinda brain and was really just wanting to understand. After our chat he's pretty much gotten to understand our happiness from transitioning haha
Your something like 10 times more likely to leave a religion then stop being transgender so statistically being religious is more of a waste of time and statistically less real then we are
Literally my parents argument~
It‚Äôs like they don‚Äôt think people have spent years or decades thinking about it but just randomly decided to go through it all for a laugh.
But what if that was my problem and not yours??
Yea I recently realized how much I hate this cause my grandpa mentioned it to my mom recently. I get he cares but like come on I wanted to do this when I was 18, forced into denial/closeting when family had a traumatic response to me coming out, and now I‚Äôm trying to play catch up and having such a hard time cause my dysphoria is crippling to this point (look in the mirror and can‚Äôt get pass my masculine features even when trying on cute outdoors üò¢). Like the only thing I regret is not doing this when I was 18
[deleted]
Apparently‚Ä¶ the cis regret rate for gender euphoria related surgeries like a boob job is something like 15% and the trans regret rate is like 1%
So I spent dinner explaining that Sex offenders are generally straight , and that the case in Scotland is a fake effort
Yeah exactly, it's like, ah yes, all of my worldly problems disappeared when I started hrt, but yes my cis compadre, I shall regret transitioning,because why would I want to be happy?? üòÄüòÇüòÇ
Ikr, always acting like they know more about being trans than us üòÇ
I cried so hard when I realized I was able to feel emotions after 5 weeks in on estrogen
Welllll maybe not the booba, those kinda don't go away afterwards but it's okay, if you believe transition made you happier, that's all that matters sis
Fr, it's so true, but for most of us, it's a gut feeling, it's almost like a pull towards, and the more you push away the worse you feel but if you just follow the pull and transition you feel so much more whole, so when we decide to transition, most of the time it's like we know, this is going to help me for sure, and it usually does so yeah, I personally shall never regret
This has always been my counterpoint. Society doesn't even blink an eye at an entire generation of young adults signing up for a life time of debt because of a lie told us by the older generation.
Pfft no offense to your sister but, what? Like that's so silly, ""not a job"" okay then why am I making money? ü§® Hmm? Honey respectfully your sister can paint her face with glue, because that ain't her decision, live for yourself üíô
My mom is a hairdresser, she opened the first woman owned salon in Anaheim, has been financially independent her whole life and her clients (many of whom are trans) adore her. It's not merely a job, it's an art and your canvas is people, it's a calling.
Ikr, all cis people are now Karens apparently üíÄüòÇ
Absolutely!
Trueee because some people are forced to do so, it wasn't their choice, be it, abusive families, abusive partners, insurance that refuses to cover their prescription anymore due to transphobic laws, like, what about those ones? üòó
Yeah it's almost like my entire childhood I liked playing female characters instead males because ""better clothing options"" and ""well I'm not gay so"" and then I watched transition timeline videos and was like ""man they're so pretty I wanna be like them *clears throat* but in a cis way because I'm a dude bro manly man person hoora! üí™"" And when I look back I'm like, God I was such an egg üòÇ (edit) I also watched monster high and my little pony and littlest pet shop, which to me was not odd and I was like I watch it because my sister watches it, didn't have a younger sister, I just watched it for ""totally normal cis reasons"" and not because I was trans üòÇ
It's okay, we all have regrets, but if it's something that makes you happy, you should never regret that.
Well, I hope you can start hrt if it's what you wanna do, and I hope you can be happy in yourself, so much that you never have regrets üíú stay strong sis
Inject it in my veins doctor I'll deal with the consequences later, which is never! üòÄüòÇ No but seriously yeah I really thought it wasn't gonna work for me, but after week one I went from this üíÄüòíüòÆ‚Äçüí®üòûüòî to this ü•π‚ú®üòäü§™üò≠üíê, so yeah, regrets are literally zero for me üëå0Ô∏è‚É£
Well she sucks, that's all
Honestly, preach, yeah they fr have no idea what we go through but then act like they know it all, ah yes I didn't read the bible but I'm definitely the source you should trust when it comes to the bible, like ü´§ just, shut up üòÇ
Oh yeah there are studies out there, like the fact that only 1% or slightly more trans people detransition, (in general no specific parameters) but yeah it's a super low percentage of people who are trans, that's good for him though, love seeing cis people be educated and understanding, but also curious, but not rudely questioning. (Edit) hunter avallone on tik tok has a video or two where he covers stuff like this whole depbating with transphobic conservatives if you wanna seeore stuff about that, he talks about everything from toxic masculinity to transphobia, and he's also a pro feminist, great guy, super smart.
Yep, I love when conservatives and radical religious people try to explain how they aren't a cult and watching them froth at the mouth like a rabid dog telling me to unalive and burn for all eternity, whilst still not justifying why they aren't a cult and how their practices are humane and help people, like okay Joseph seed from far cry 5 I'd like to see you explain this one for me. (I really hope people get that joke or I'm going to feel dumbüòó) üòÇüòÄ
Ew, L parents honestly, hope they get better ‚ù§Ô∏è
Nah didn't you hear stupid trump the other day? ""It's a phenomenon created by the radical left and has never existed two years before now"" what a silly orange man he is, but yeah they act like I physically tossed my male privilege out the window because it's a phase or oh y'know I just wanted to do irreversible changes to my body because it makes conservatives Angy, like, just no üòÇ
Whoa üò≥ that's crazy, it's almost like they should mind their own business üòÇ
Won't happen. Already lived a lifetime with regret; once you experience the freedom of living Life with Authenticity, *there's no going back.*
Okay, color me confused, but yeah, most sex offenders in the world are straight.
proud of u sis, we‚Äôre all gonna make it <3
To be fair I think being a guy with boobs is better than being just a normal guy but yeah I could bind/get top surgery if I really needed to but I don‚Äôt think I will, only like 1.5% of trans people detransition because they realized they weren‚Äôt trans
Trans men can get rid of Booba, so can I.
People use detransition as hope that thing will go back to what they used to be. That's how my mom see it and it makes me sad. She could have had a happy daughter but instead she has a miserable son and wounds why I'm so depressed
100%, and not everybody believes in the bible anyway. People want to enforce it like it's law, which isn't any less delusional than they think we are for being trans
Nah I'm moving soon they can eat my gay dust
Yeah, we can pull through, if we just keep living unapologetically they'll have to accept us one day

Anyone else sorta bummed they missed their chance to transition during the pandemic.	"Just wondering if anyone else out there is in a similar position. Full disclosure COVID SUCKS and can just die off already and I'm super happy that vaccines are becoming widely available and society as a whole can start returning to normal. However, a small part of me wishes that it wasn't all ending so that I could transition at a time where its acceptable to stay home and wear a mask when in public. 

I didn't come to full terms with my trans-ness until recently and now I'm kinda kicking myself in the butt for not committing sooner. I know I shouldn't care about other people's opinions and their judgments but I'm afraid how much harder it will be to transition  once things go back to ""normal"""	"It has its definite advantages. As Laura Jane Grace told me, ""You have this ultimate badass ability ... of being able to say ... 'oh yeah, when I came out I also survived a plague'."" So I'm gonna rock that shit. 

Masks will be around for a while though, and quite honestly they're a godsend for hiding things that might tip people off that you're trans.
yeah i totally get that, but in my situation i wouldn‚Äôt have come out to myself if it wasn‚Äôt for the pandemic.
I feel the same way... eugh...I realized I was ‚Äúmore‚Äù trans than I thought I was. During the entirety of the pandemic, I was gender non conforming. I switched through labels a lot  and only recently have I started to accept that I‚Äôm trans. Not totally binary, but still. I want to transition. 

And I totally get why you‚Äôre upset w/ yourself. Not the whole point but definitely a pro to transitioning is to be seen as the gender you are by those around you. And no, it absolutely does not matter what they think, but...it kinda matters to you...

It may be hard or it may not be. Just hang in there and keep goin‚Äô forward. Can also think about all the upsides to this pandemic ending. Maybe people will stop hogging all to the soups, paper towels and tp lol
The best time to start is always right now!
Unfortunately I have been an essential worker for the entire pandemic. I am still working up the courage to come out to my wife, and family, let alone start transitioning.
Well, if it‚Äôs any consolation I started transition during Covid, well Dec 2019. And while, yes, it was easier with masks and staying home, I missed out on a lot. Namely my first pride, socializing with people in my new gender role, attempting to actually date. Having people see me as me at work. (Out there, but living that teams no cam life)

It also slowed down my legal name change to the point I couldn‚Äôt continue. (Working on it again now though)

So it had its advantages, but looking back it had its disadvantages too.
I just regret not getting on a wait list for a gender clinic yet, because the waits are probs longer now :/
I mean, it‚Äôs definitely not over. Please transition ASAP.
I kick myself every day for cutting my hair through out this past year. I stopped recently because I know without a doubt, after crying myself to sleep the night after the last hair cut, that growing it is something I need to do. BUT my hair could not be more in the awkward poofy phase if it tried ü§¶üèª I'm just crossing my fingers now that it will calm down before I have to go back to work properly
I am in a similar position except my mom won‚Äôt let me transition till I am in year10-13 which is 6 form in my school
Yes
I do wish I took advantage of all the hair cutting places being closed...  starting the process now and I can't wait for my hair to grow out...
Only that it took most of the past year to finally get hrt. I really wish I had been able to start that sooner.
I just want it to end, because Covid has caused a LOOOOONG waiting list before you can start with hormones. Primarily because it has meant they are understaffed, and thus they focus on finishing people in the process rather than start with new patients.
The pandemic has given me the space to find who I am. Jan 2020 I finally, publicly came out as gay at age 41. Still dressed as expected of an AFAB at work and socially. Bought a house with my amazing partner and moved in as it all started. Have been on pandemic leave from work since last April. It started slowly with which clothes I chose to wear, always the same type of outfit, who's going to see me anyways, always home. Then came cutting off my elbow length hair in August, which has always been the least stressful feminine thing for me. Winter brought the acceptance that I've always had the thought in the back of my brain that I'm really part dude. Now.....well now I'm working on figuring out what it means for future me. Am I ok being called ""mom"", ""sister""  and ""daughter""  because I've been conditioned to respond to those honorifics or because they match who I am. Or am I on the way to dropping all that my Catholic upbringing and 80s childhood taught me I should want based on my genitals at birth. I know my egg cracked, just enjoying the space to figure out who I am.
Oh. I have been waiting to start hrt since before the pandemic. ""I will send the letter out next week"" I have been told on 6 occasions now. I don't like the hassle but a realistic answer would have been kinda nice, even if it was telling me to wait this long, likely much longer.
I started HRT in August 2020.
I just thought if the world turned upside down, might as well try to be the real me while I have the chance and when/if things return to normalcy, I will be more deeper into my transition and may have an easier time passing.
Was able to make myself go out sometimes and have the practice needed to gain more confidence.
Agreed! I was stoked to have a mask to cover hair I was in the process of removing
Same here tbh. But looking back all the signs were there long before covid. Just wish I had picked up on them...
Oh man I almost forgot about the toilet paper crisis of 2020. What a wild ride this year has been üòÇ
That's a good point. I remember how much of a hassle just renewing my car registration was during the pandemic. I can only imagine how hard a name change would be üíî

Don't fucking out people, for fucks sake	"Seriously. I shouldn't even have to say this, but here we are. I've had this experience a few times recently where other trans people that I barely know will clock me and make some stupid comments outing me to other people who may be around. This is totally and utterly unacceptable. 

The only times it's acceptable to out someone outside of specific legal/medical contexts are when either: 1. You've gotten \*explicit\* permission to do so, or 2. You know for a fact that I've explicitly told the person you're gonna out me to.

I don't care if you think that the city we live in is a liberal city. I don't care if you think everyone would be cool with it. I don't care if you yourself are trans and haven't had a bad experience with the group. I especially don't care if you are transmasculine or a newly transitioning transfeminine person and haven't had a bad experience (which, tbh, is like 99% of the trans people that pull this shit-for some mysterious reason, other trans women who've been transitioning for a few years don't pull this shit.) I don't care if everyone in the group is a bunch of accepting bisexuals. I don't even care if literally the whole group is a bunch of trans people. 

My personal information is not your business to spread around to others. Not to mention the fact that you're potentially opening me up to violence or the thousands of little microaggressions that a lot of cis people will do when they figure out that you're trans. My risk tolerance isn't up to you to decide. If you want to connect over the fact that we're both trans, you're welcome to mention to me that you are trans, but you have to accept that it is my absolute right not to reciprocate. /rant over"	"My thoughts exactly!! You said it so well,  it‚Äôs so frustrating when it happens. I don‚Äôt know why it‚Äôs so hard to grasp for some people. The other day I was at a friend‚Äôs party, and I knew no one else except her and she introduced me to like 5-6 people as ‚ÄúMy friend who‚Äôs transitioning to a girl.‚Äù I was like ‚ÄúWhat? You don‚Äôt just freely reveal that!!?‚Äù

She‚Äôs not transphobic or has any ill intent, she‚Äôs just completely clueless on trans issues, but still, I was so pissed about that, fortunately all of them were chill with that.
Exactly. I always try telling this to people but they never listen. I do my best to live stealth but it‚Äôs hard when I keep getting outed in every space I‚Äôm in.

I‚Äôve had teachers out me, friends have outed me, family members, acquaintances‚Ä¶hell, even people I don‚Äôt know have outed me to even more people I don‚Äôt know. Ofc, that then leads to EVERYONE knowing. 

Because of this I have severe trust issues. I now only tell people I‚Äôm trans if I‚Äôm romantically involved with them or if it‚Äôs for medical reasons. I don‚Äôt even tell my friends anymore because they always tell people that I‚Äôm trans behind my back. It‚Äôs so frustrating.
every trans person is entitled to keep their gender and sexuality to themself.
definitely agree with this, but uhh transmasculine people also have bad experiences?? like people are transphobic at us too. so please don‚Äôt put all FTM/N people in your ‚Äúnaive and clueless people who don‚Äôt know how transphobia feels‚Äù group.
outing someone without their explicit permission is just wrong, it really sucks that youve had to go through that
Yeah my friend just told another friend that I was trans and they proceeded to tell like 10 other people :(
to anyone that has a transgender friend:
act like they were born with the gender they feel comfortable with,and dont share it around like a gift.
Oh God no!!üòØ
I've met vastly more trans women than trans men or nb folk, yet the majority of people who've outed me have been trans men or nb. On average, trans men do also have to deal with far less transphobia than trans women. While this doesn't always apply to individuals, I'm 100% in the right to use my personal experience to navigate the world, and thus 100% in the right to presume some degree of naivete or cluelessness of particular trans men if I don't already know them. If you don't want that to be the case, you can educate your own community instead of bitching about me accurately relaying my own lived experience.
I don't think they're questioning your lived experience or your right to base your decisions about your safety on those experiences, they're questioning the way you frame this as a problem specific to trans men in a public forum.

I don't have your lived experience, I've only been ""outed"" by another trans person once, and it was a trans woman. I also only began transition a few months ago, so of course you have more experience being out than I do, but I also felt the way you phrased your post was less explicitly ""this is my experience"" and came across pretty strongly as being your interpretation of some sort of constant / prevailing trend amongst trans men. That rubbed me wrong. We're all one community, we need to look out for each other. Your experiences are your own, but they're also a very small sampling of the world as a whole. Extrapolating personal experience to make sweeping judgements about whole groups isn't awesome.

I'm guessing this was a phrasing issue, not really a disagreement. So just a heads up, your original post definitely came across as talking about trans men ""in general"" as opposed to only your own experience."	r33md9	trans	141	0.99	2021-11-27 02:58:37
tired of being perceived as non-binary/ ‚Äútransmasc‚Äù	Despite dressing male, having a fit male body, an andro/deep voice, I STILL only get perceived as non-binary or any other variation that isn‚Äôt exclusively male. The things holding me back you might ask? My height (5‚Äô4‚Äù) and a soft face. It‚Äôs so frustrating that even though I am breaking my ribs every fucking day, lifting 5-6 times a week, and have trained my voice for 4 years to still rarely get affirmation that I am male. It almost makes all my efforts seem worthless and that I should just stop trying so hard because I‚Äôm obviously not getting the results I want. Hopefully that changes once I can medically transition, but who fucking knows, and even better who fucking cares but me.	"I'm in the same boat. Before starting T a little boy asked me if I was a boy or girl.  I was glad he didn't only see ""girl"", but it still stung that he didn't only see ""boy"". Other people would use they/ them for me without me asking. But...... still. I'm a man. I'm only 3 weeks on T, so nothing's changed yet. 

They're are many short cis men out there, don't worry about that.
I know what you mean. I pass decently but bc of my smaller frame people see me as a masc female and often assume I‚Äôm nonbinary. Having cis people call you they all the time gets tiring, especially when you make it clear you‚Äôre male and they still do so like it doesn‚Äôt matter or it‚Äôs the same thing to them. I‚Äôm not a they, I‚Äôm not nonbinary, I‚Äôm male. Also, ‚Äútransitioning for others‚Äù is not a thing. It‚Äôs okay to want to pass as your gender in society even if it‚Äôs difficult.
I totally get it, just in reverse. Voice training is rough, face is scarred from fights a long while back so I‚Äôll never look cute. I don‚Äôt/probably never will be perceived as anything other than a guy with tits outside of friends and family, so anyone that says otherwise can bite rocks
I feel your exact pain. For height, I've personally been looking into height surgery, ""height-lengthening"" workouts (spine stretches, really), and shoe inserts. For having soft features, chew gum and look into ""mewing"". A lot of it might not be scientifically backed but it seems to work for a lot of people- it defines your jawline more.  
I've also noticed that people you introduce yourself to as masculine tend to continue to perceive you as masculine. With that said, making new friends might help you create a circle that you can fall back on days when you need extra validation. If you're out to your current friend group, maybe try normalizing days where you ask to be hyped up in more masculine praises as well. My ex used to do it when he just started T and it seemed to work for him, and everyone else in the group was chill with it.  
I know some days are really hard as a trans guy, but just know that you at least have a community here that cares man. I hope things start to look better for you.  
Good luck dude.
>I should just stop trying so hard because I‚Äôm obviously not getting the results I want. 

I think take it easy, trans women also can't get female body by just exercise unless having an intersex condition. Tryng that hard at something practically impossible is not good to your mental health.

>Hopefully that changes once I can medically transition, but who fucking knows, and even better who fucking cares but me.

Don worry it will definitely happen T it's very efective and more irreversible than e, unfortunately for trans women but fortunately for trans men T is very strong.
You could buy some minoxidil and put it in your upper lip/chin. It helps grow facial hair and even works pre-T
Sir, close your legs on the train and stop mansplaning. (/Joking) noe there's a nice young gentleman
If you're transitioning for others you're doing it for the wrong reasons and you're gonna be let down.   If you feel good doing what you're doing keep doing it.  If you don't
.....don't.  

That being said....not being perceived the way we want definitely hurts.....specially when we try so hard. 

I don't really know what the answer is either.  Sorry :(  but I know how you feel.
I'm willing to bet a good bit of this is in your posture and movement. It's really subtle, but people pick up on it.

Now I don't know for sure, of course, but try and watch the guys around you and see how they walk, how they act, how they position themselves on a chair, etc

It's usually that kind of stuff that makes a person be registered as a guy or as a girl if they would otherwise seem more androgynous.
even though I'm in a different situation, even when I was CIS gender, I was misgendered by everyone I met. I don't understand. Why do other people feel like they get to choose what to call me?
I'd suggest spending less time on r/truscum. Nothing but hateful backwards thinking over there.
I feel you:  I‚Äôm non-binary, and I have had surgery and been on T for a long time, and I still get gendered female.  People will always minimize our efforts.  Hang in there, and focus on the things that make you feel like the great guy you are.  The more you focus on that, the more you will fill out a circle of other people who see you as you are too.
Yes, short men are common. I think it's easier to men to apeat more muscular when they are short.
Not sure if this will help literally at all, but I will say a lot of people I know including myself default to they/them pronouns for everyone just to avoid assuming genders, so people who have done that for you may have done it because they didn‚Äôt know your pronouns rather than perceiving you as non-binary and referring to you as such. 

Of course knowing that may not help the sting of not getting gendered properly, but I figured I‚Äôd put it out there. Super cool you are on T now tho man, congrats! :)
Might I suggest the transition goal of orc females? It's helped me a lot with my own sanity as I look like a mook from a mobster movie standing behind the boss. Crazy how I look more feminine in hand wraps, a sports bra, and harem cargo pants than in a dress. Just a different kind of feminine. Seriously I don't get misgendered like that but I get compliments on being a hot guy in a dress when I wear a dress. It's like trying to fill a mental expectation.
I have cats
huh
I am transitioning for myself, but it would be nice to have my efforts recognized yk
In their defense, they‚Äôve been more helpful in terms of what I can actually do/need in order for me to pass as well as I can. By no means do I agree with even a majority of what is said over there, but it‚Äôs nice to be welcomed into a space without an immediate autoban for even discussing certain topics.
Hmm.. well I AM a punchy lesbian type, wouldn‚Äôt be hard to do. Lol
I do too, I just make sure to wash my hands extremely well before and after, keep the minoxidil container closed at all times and don‚Äôt let them touch my face/hands for about two hours after application
Sorry was acting a Karen (or at least stereotypical old lady) accusing you of stereotypical male activities. I know it's hard but you are loved and valued.

I can't do much but try to bring a smile sometimes if I can, always sounds better in my head though
 Judging from your posts you agree with a lot of what they say.

 It's okay to want to medically transition, but trying to invalidate other people's experience because it's not the same as your own is not cool.
ohhhh okay that makes more sense, i was just lost lmao
I have never attacked someone else personally for how they identify?? Just sick of having my perfectly valid voice stripped from me because I don‚Äôt fully align with that community.

In online spaces, I am willing to use xe/ze/etc for those who want to use them. I believe in the existence of non-binary people as well as nb lesbians/gay people. Clothes and presentation do not equal gender. yada yada yada. 

However there is a line with me (much further than most truscum) where it simply doesn‚Äôt make sense to me. I‚Äôve really tried to accept all aspects of the community, and while I won‚Äôt ever attack someone personally for their identity my beliefs stand firm. I will continue to fight for the rights of all trans people (whoever identifies themselves as trans, not my decision ofc). not everyone in that subreddit is some evil monster, there just isn‚Äôt any other space to voice some concerns I hold without immediate ban, unfortunately this subreddit included. 

Now before mods see this and ban me, I am both trans (ftm) and autistic, so my voice is valid. This subreddit is also home to many great resources that I use and do not want to lose for the sake of differing opinion. Have a good day :)"	u5bpsd	trans	144	0.95	2022-04-17 00:58:56

I also dont have a big problem when talking to transphobes on the internet. Because i know their opinion is stupid anyways so Im always open to have a conversation with them and try to educate them. I am scared to come out to my friends and family tho because i dont want them to make fun of me. But Im also scared that i wont feel satisfied after my transition if i ever have one. At the same time I dont eant to be an old woman tho. I would rather be a dilf. Like Joseph joestar. But im scared that my brain is tricking itself and all of those things are just the thoughts my brain forces on itself. So am I really trans or am I wrong and just feel something like body dismorphia."	"theres no requirements for being trans, you‚Äôre valid in feeling however you feel, i personally dont feel bottom dysphoria either, that doesnt make me or you any less trans than someone who does.
My advice is: Don't think about it too much. Instead of wondering if your trans, try just doing what makes you feel happy and euphoric! I know doubt hurts but you just have to give yourself time, it will all make sense someday if you just live your life the best way you can. 

I was also having similar doubts about changing my name, if I was trans or if I wanted to take T. But I took a breath and just kinda accepted the uncertainty. Then, about 3 weeks ago I got a haircut that put everything into perspective and I finally understood that I do want to go through with my transition.
There's nothing that defines being trans based on one aspect. A lot of people aren't specifically dysphoric but might have strong euphoria over some things (getting called sir, handsome, or having short hair etc). A lot of people also feel impostor syndrome, which you describe and that can affect your confidence. If you think your health would be improved by coming out (including the reaction by your family) then by all means at least bring it up, but if you're unsure and it may damage your living situation it is always better to wait. You can transition successfully later in life and still be respected and loved.
Like others here already said, you‚Äôre valid as you are! When I was first questioning my gender‚Ä¶ I even said I LIKED my body. Turns out‚Ä¶ I just aesthetically liked my body if that makes sense. I thought it was a good body that people can and should be attracted to and it has survived a lot. That didn‚Äôt actually equate to me feeling its a body that lines up with my gender identity.

It took me going out to a thrift store and buying clothes of the opposite gender and kind of ‚Äútrying on‚Äù gender as though I were trying on clothes to really confirm things for me. I even tried on a binder this way! But god the sense of euphoria I felt?!? Unmatched. Now I can see the dysphoria places where I hadn‚Äôt before and I better understand my relationship to my body and gender identity and gender expression.

Highly recommend checking out https://genderdysphoria.fyi/ to help you think things through though! I didn‚Äôt learn about it until later but it was super affirming regardless.
just stick to what makes you happy brother, rid yourself of things that dont
I think you're asking yourself the wrong questions. 

Would you feel happier if you could live your life as a man? If yes, yea, you're probably trans.
Let me put it this way: there are cis people who have physical attributes about them that aren‚Äôt seen as ‚Äútypical‚Äù or ‚Äúcorrect‚Äù for their AGAB, and many of them accept and even like those traits. Does that mean they‚Äôre less cis? Of course not. So you‚Äôre just as trans as anyone else here
As others have said, you don't need to do anything to be a valid trans person. The act of transitioning isn't what makes anyone trans.

I'd just like to point something out to you. You say that you don't mind your voice because it's already masculine. Of course if it is masculine you wouldn't have that much dysphoria around it. There is way too much focus on just suffering when people look at the trans experience. If you have certain traits that are already the way you want them to be, then that's a good thing.
Being trans isn't defined by the dysphoria a lot of conditions can cause that. It lies in the euphoria.
Some trans girls experience no bottom dysphoria (myself included) so I don‚Äôt see why that can‚Äôt happen with trans guys either
no such thing as a fake trans guy, so yes you are
You sound like a trans guy to me. Ultumately its up to you, but that sounds like something a trans guy would experience
You have pretty much explained exactly how I feel to a T. But we're real, how we feel right now is real, even if we change our minds later. If you ever want to talk to somebody in a similar situation my dms are open :)
This sounds like me talking into a mirror, especially with the Jojo reference, lol. But in all seriousness. You're valid. I'm a dude, I'm a year into HRT. I don't have major bottom dysphoria, it's mainly around my chest and outward appearance. You're valid and wouldn't be less of a man because of it. I rationalized it as, my private parts are actually private, so I don't have to see, look, or really touch them. That's why I don't get dysphoric. It's also much better since my cycle stopped. Now I can literally just ignore my crotch and it's existence (other than hygiene obv).
‚ÄúBut I don‚Äôt have bottom dysphoria and also like my face.‚Äù This does not invalidate you. Just bc I don‚Äôt mind being flat chested doesn‚Äôt mean I‚Äôm not a real trans girl. 

A lack of any specific discomfort or specific dysphoria will never invalidate you.
It something like 50% of people don't stuffer bottom dysphoria I believe?  I think male at birth people suffer more is it just sticks out more and just more apparent.  It like a pin that wont go away, it never stops reminding something really weird and wrong is their.  Got to hold that money for the future badly.  Anyway that my prospective so your view on the other side will be different.

Anyway... are you a guy?  If you believe so you probably are.  Cis-women don't wish they want to be a guy, that a tran thing to want to switch genders more or less.  Yes they might hate this or that, they might think periods suck or their chest too big but in general they love being a woman and just wished the world was better as a woman.
I hear MOST trans guy's actually don't have that bad a bottom dysphoria situation? It's usually almost entirely the top! I think the only person I know with bottom dysphoria that's actually really prevalent is me. I'd REALLY like to get a surgery for this one day.

You don't have to figure it out right away, either. You could just use the nonbianry label if you want, if you think it'd suit you.
I‚Äôm a trans woman and I don‚Äôt have bottom dysphoria either, it‚Äôs not a simple binary for what makes people trans or not. Some people have top dysphoria, some have bottom, some may have both or even neither. I know it‚Äôs much, much easier said than done (I know that first hand) but you don‚Äôt need to worry about it, you‚Äôre a man and not having bottom dysphoria will never change that üòä

What can(t) be explained	"Coming out is hard everybody tells you how hard it can be but you never really know until you do it. Until someone looks you in the eyes and says that you‚Äôll always be their little deadname. Until someone tells you that you aren‚Äôt correct. Until someone cuts you off as a friend because why wouldn‚Äôt you tell them sooner. Until your parent asks ‚Äúwhy are you doing this to me‚Äù 

You can‚Äôt say anything, heaven forbid you say how much these words hurt. They are trying they swear it‚Äôs just so hard after twenty years. They care I swear they just grew up in a time were it wasn‚Äôt normal. You can‚Äôt get upset they are trying. Be more understanding they are old, but nobody stops to think about us.

Why do we have to be understanding? What about us? We aren‚Äôt your deadname. What about us? Do you know how much it hurts when you brush us off? What about me? Why can‚Äôt you be understanding of me? Why can‚Äôt I look you in the eye and tell you that this isn‚Äôt easy for me. Why do I have to understand how hard this is for you when I‚Äôm the one transitioning. When I‚Äôm the one facing the crowd while you get to sit back and say ‚ÄúI understand but.‚Äù 

Sorry for the rant."	"I can see this being read aloud at an open mic slam poetry event. Well worded and well done, you would definitely get the audience to consider so much with this. I‚Äôm right there with you, I hope society becomes more accepting.
You need a hug, I give you digital hug.
Yeah I agree with this. This is why it someone doesn't put in the effort to gender me correctly, and uses my deadname, they are disowned as quick as can be.
You are a champion üíö you're putting into words what alot of us can't ü§ó sending big internet hugs
Although the more you do it the easier it kinda gets. First classmate I came out to, I nearly had a panic attack. Now I came out to fourth one without breaking a sweat, casually...
Please don't be sorry for the rant, where else are you going to be able to unburden yourself unless it's with your peers. I know I for one have felt that way for most of my life and have had to hold it in.
Thank you so much for your kind words. I felt overwhelmed from a long day and just started writing. I‚Äôm glad you enjoyed and I hope it bright you comfort knowing you aren‚Äôt alone
I did need a hug, thank you. I send you a digital hug back

I'm sad and disappointed	"I don't even know why I'm writing this, because I don't feel like anyone would actually care... 
It's... I guess, envy? Seeing people who Live successfully transitioned and without fear makes me depressed. After almost 7 months of HRT I barely changed on appearance, my voice sounds like crap even when I try my best, and I might run out of HRT because our dumb government decided to make war to Ukraine and pills aren't getting imported anymore. 
Moreover, russia sucks, badly. I'm scared to exist, when people cheer at gays getting beaten for kissing in privacy. And I can't get out of this place, because of income and world being hostile because of war... existing is pain and disappointment.
I wonder how living feels like, but I don't think I ever will experience that. Just like my childhood..."	"Sorry with what your going through. I think everyone who transitions has to deal with fear, weather it is internalized fear on themselves or people are being Transphobic to them or both, I think we all have to deal fear. So you are not alone. Hope you feel better soon
That sounds rough, sorry hun.
Month 7 was really rough for me. I'm at 2.5 years and am doing much much better now. The time it takes isn't really linear if that makes sense.
I‚Äôm so sorry honey! Not everyone has the same results with transitioning. I don‚Äôt think anyone sees me as anything other than a guy in women‚Äôs clothing. I wasn‚Äôt able to properly modulate my voice, so I opted for Vocal Feminization Surgery, which was not successful. My voice is hoarse and barely louder than a whisper. Still it prevents me from doing my Strong Bad impersonation. 

All I can say is to hang in there. Look for the victories, no matter how small. Hope things will improve and work on improving those things under your control. Know that you are awesome just the way you are!
Can I give you a virtual hug? I'm going to make two thoughts:

&#x200B;

1. If your current method of HRT isn't working, if it weren't for the circumstances, I'd consider checking your hormone levels and upping your dose/switching your method. Its not unlikely your T levels are too high. This is the biggest reason I see people this late in transition struggling to see changes. Do not give up hope. Also, so much is yet to come after 7 months, you will get there my girl.
2. F\*\*\* Puting to Hell. I hope he dies and Satan is so disgusted that he kicks him out because Hell is too good for him. I'm really sorry that your leader is a genocidal dictator and has not only killed thousands and displaced millions of innocent Ukranians but also made life harder for the citizens of his own country. You and the rest of the people of Russia don't deserve the sanctions but sadly they are the only way to force the the Russian government to cave and hopefully give up this pointless war. And hopefully they one day cave hard so Russia can be the free country it deserves to be and one day you can either leave or you can safely transition in your home. Stay strong like you've been up to this point, things will get worse before they get better, but get better they will.
I‚Äôm so sorry to hear you‚Äôre hurting. You are cared about, the trans community loves you and you are real, even if you‚Äôre struggling to transition the way you deserve right now. I‚Äôm sorry the world is so messed up. I hope you are safe and warm.
If you beed someone to talk to, I'm here
I hope someday you are able to leave Russia and live in a country where you are free. You deserve to be happy and free and YOUR TRUE SELF.
on a physical level, i had been told by people not to expect bigger changes to even *start* until around nine months in. it took for me around a full year to see any results i wanted, and from there i‚Äôve been steadily getting to where i want to be. same sort of timeline with voice training. while a handful of folks excel enough in presentation to nail passing like a few months in, the body needs time. be patient with it, it‚Äôll get there ‚ù§Ô∏è

on a practical level i would strongly consider leaving as soon as possible. things are only looking to get worse for russia as this goes on, and the narrowing methods of flight available now are not guaranteed to remain viable. it‚Äôs obviously not my call to make, but it‚Äôs an option i hope you weigh heavily. please stay safe, buddy ‚ù§Ô∏è
In my case it's not only about time, but also about my environment... Long story short, my existence may become a crime, LGBTQ+ is hated around me, this country is making war so a lot of places closed their doors on russians, and also due to war my economical state is declining. If it wasn't for environmental problems, I would be in so much better condition... 

Soon it will be a question, if I want to eat enough, or take HRT. If these pills even be still available...
Then I'm praying you never have to make that painful decision. And I'm hoping you can be delivered from this to at least a little more stability.
I hope so too...

Came here because there was nowhere else to go	"I'll admit I'm someone who can be easily shaken, which makes me a target, and I know that Reddit has a rather nasty reputation almost like a bleached version of 4chan, but I have nowhere else to go. Someone accused me of being a ""tucute"" (something I don't believe in, but for the sake of this I'll go along with it) because I'm not radical on my ""rules for trans people"". Because in all honesty, I don't care how others express themselves, it's none of my business and I was raised to be understanding.

I'm FTM and yes I have gotten backlash/threats of violence before but for some reason when other trans people are the ones doing it, it hurts way worse than anything. I'm not a public figure. I'm not an activist. I'm like the least offensive person on earth. I even present as masculine as possible, but it's still not good enough for them. It's never good enough until you want to vomit at the sight of yourself. And honestly, I do, but that shouldn't matter to other trans people online.

I'm sick of having to perform for other more strict trans people, I just want to breathe. I force myself to do everything I can, I work out, I'm searching for a job to fund my own surgery, I stay out of the way, and it's still not enough for them. I've spent so many years hating myself, feeling like I was some kind of sick monster up until I found out about the transgender community at age 11. And I finally felt at home. But even that breath of fresh air is being taken from me.

I know nowadays ""Trans cringe comps"" aren't as popular but I'm still even weary to go outside without the biggest possible coat on even though it's 80 degrees on the coldest day. Because I live in constant shame and hatred. I don't feel guilt, because I know I'm not ""faking"" my feelings. Despite it being expensive I do have a therapist, I do take accountability for the things in my life that don't include me being trans, and I do everything I've been told by professionals. But no, it's never enough.

I'm not taking deals for Disney movies, I'm not getting paid for this, and I don't get ""clout"" for being trans. Someone offered to donate to me and I can't even fucking take it because suddenly I'm no longer ""valid"" enough for any of you?. I don't give a damn about truscum, I don't give a fuck about any of this online bullshit, and I don't have any agenda to push. I'm just some guy. That's all I am. Some random nobody. But no, it's not the active anti-trans laws being put into place, it's not the fault of the people snatching trans kids away from their families, not the ""gay panic"" excuse that makes it fine and dandy to harm people you though ""tricked you"" or the police never doing shit about the lost lives of black trans people. Apparently, it's the fault of other trans people now. Because now you're ""one of the good ones"" you don't need to support your community. Now you pass enough for them so you don't give a fuck about our rights. You sold out, not me.

I get sick and tired of the narrative of transgender men are just ""uwu soft boy"" loving women that are trying to trick gay men somehow. I've had partners, and none of them have ever been disgusted with me or have had a problem with me being trans. I haven't even ever been rejected for being trans, and even if I were in the future I wouldn't give a damn. Because I don't want someone who doesn't love me to date me. That's like the common opinion so I'm not sure where this ""trans people forcing others to date them"" narrative is coming from.

Like I think it's funny how people treat less masculine trans guys like objects of desire to be gocked at and fetishized yet it's my fault for what?, just looking the way I do?. I'm not sure what the fuck it is you want from me but unless you're going to pay for me to be sent out to a camp in the woods where I bang rocks together and eat raw meat naked you're not getting much out of me anytime soon.

I like to work out sometimes, most times I wear attire that might be considered traditionally masculine, and I like to keep my hair cut short (even though lots of cis men have long hair, but let's be honest, you think they care how cis men present?). But sometimes, I like to have fun.

Part of me finds joy in Decora Kei, for for the uninformed:

***Decora („Éá„Ç≥„É©) is a Japanese aesthetic and fashion that revolves around an excessive amount of accessories, the primary focus being plastic hair accessories and bracelets.***

&#x200B;

[\(Examples of how this kind of fashion looks\)](https://preview.redd.it/shuwke3kt3e91.png?width=1326&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=1f7500de765e50f3072a9f5a83b043c45633f1cb)

For some people, the idea that a trans guy could be interested in things like this sounds preposterous. But it doesn't to me, and that's what fucking matters. I'm both transgender and black and so the standards of how I'm allowed to present are narrow as hell. And I just want to express myself. Just one damn moment of peace.

The people in my life accept me, and my boyfriend enjoys my company, I was even starting to feel better since I felt I was getting way closer to my goals for my transition. But my own fucking community can't stand to see my happiness. It's like the second I stopped completely hating myself I'm not good enough for these people anymore.

So basically what I'm saying is, genuinely: What the hell am I supposed to do about like?, like how am I supposed to solve this.

Because it's eating me up inside."	"First off, \*hugs\*.  It has been my experience that there is a subsection of the population who derive their validation through unquestioned conformity of others.  Basically, anything that differs from what they perceive as the ""correct"" way to be is perceived as a direct assault/challenge to them and their belief.  ""live and let live"" does not make sense to them as they cannot get beyond their own insecurity. 

This subsection can be found across all demographics, gatekeeping who is and isn't part of their demographic, as they see it.  Worse is when they get actual power (management, owner, parent, politician, etc.)  

Next, it is a form of selection bias to perceive a whole community as sharing these individual's views.  These individuals vocalize their discomfort, whereas the rest have no real issue so see no need to say anything.  Worse, the ""live and let live"" philosophy discourages even calling out such behavior.  

I do not have a solution to your problem other than to suggest that the scope is smaller than it seems.  I still haven't found a way to ""reach"" such people so that they can understand what they are doing to others.  Empathy seems to be lacking from such people, but that could also be an oversimplification.

I hope things get better for you.
I feel you. The pressure to conform to the gender binary is strong even when you reject the basic rationale behind it. 

You're not obligated to please anyone but yourself. It might take years to fully accept and believe that, especially when everyone around you says otherwise. But with time, it will get easier. In the meantime, take whatever validation you can from trans-accepting spaces. 

I'm new to reddit myself and I know the reputation but there's some good spots here that seem to be reasonably well-moderated.
Unfortunately, there are always toxic people in every community. And I‚Äôm so sorry you have to deal with that, but just know that everyone else here supports you and I‚Äôm sure you‚Äôre so handsome.
Anybody who calls you a ""tucute"" probably isn't worth your time.
It's so annoying that we still have to deal with this BS.  Why can't people just understand that:

1. Other people's transitions are none of your damn business.
2. Rules about what hobbies/clothes/etc. counts as masc & what counts as femme are arbitrary social conventions.  Some men like one or more of the things society has decided are femme.  Some of those men are cis, some of them are trans.

If you're easily bothered by truscum stuff, I'd advise you to just steer clear of the parts of the internet where you're likely to encounter it.  I know that, in principle, silo-ing & information bubbles aren't great, but at some point you have to just prioritize your own mental health & avoid stimuli that are harmful.
I don‚Äôt know of anything that I could say to help, except that if you ever need a sympathetic ear, my dms are open.
I‚Äôm sorry that you are going through this kinda crap bro. I kinda get it. My interests aren‚Äôt super manly, and I‚Äôm ok with that. If you like decora kei, do it as much as you want! Be a bright pastel rainbow! F the weirdos who are trying to control your ‚Äúman experience‚Äù. Everyone is different. You are valid.

May I suggest: r/ftmfemininity
I see and know what you're talking about, tho' I have a tendency to keep online communities at a.. idk, mental arm's length?   
I don't want to sound like I'm giving stereotypical platitudes, either; but quite honestly not giving too much a fuck what others think of you is my way of handling these things. It's not easy to do, of course, esp if you need that connection and community bc you don't have it around you IRL. But I know there's people in this world I won't ever get through to, they don't *want* to listen, so I have to just accept that and be done with them, and that part is my descision. There are other communities around, it can just be trial and error to find where it's most comfy for you.  
But like, *you know who you are* better than damn well anyone else. They can't tell you who you are, nor if you're 'enough', nor if you're 'valid'. Please don't allow them to, even if it's just in your own mind. A lot of people project their own shit onto others, and that's not your responsibility to deal with.  
I hope things can get better for you. You don't owe anyone else how you choose to express yourself. Isn't the point of transition to be true to yourself and work for that happiness? I think that's what some hyper critical people miss.
Reddit you can mostly filter out the shit, unlike 4chan. I'm mostly here for cute cat and dog pictures.

God that sucks, if it makes you feel any better I‚Äôm ftm and I like decora too.
i do not have the time to read all of this, but from what i‚Äôve gathered: you do not have to conform to whatever ‚Äúnorms‚Äù trans people set up. although i am mtf, i‚Äôve suffered from the same problem (although not to this extent) and i think i understand what you‚Äôre going through. you need to find people who will support you for who you are. you may never be good enough for the entire trans community and thats ok. keep being you, and find people who will support you for that. if they don‚Äôt, they don‚Äôt deserve you. stay strong man!!
The biggest issues we as progressives (in general, not just lgbtqi+) is that we can't help from attacking ourselves. It's why we struggle against the conservatives so much because they don't really infight and generally stand unified despite there being many many more of us than them.
Not sure what I could offer other than what I did; drop everyone and focus on you. (And by everyone I dont mean your supportive friends and family). Just... disregard them all. Idk if it's because I'm 33 but something like 10 years ago I decided that no one can be pleased and you're always going to be pissing someone off. I'm trans female, but I don't identify as trans female, I consider myself just a queer girl. My partner is trans male and he openly identifies as trans male. He calls me his wife and I call him my husband. THIS ALONE is enough to piss off like 3 different groups in 3 different letters in the rainbow. I've been hated on for ""perpetuating heteronormativity"" just for not being openly trans and having what looks like a ""straight relationship.""  Or that I'm dismantling queerness by calling my queer partner my husband rather than just the gender neutral ""partner"".

Tbh if I were you, I wouldn't want to be friends with people who are that focused on queer perfectionism. It might feel like you're missing out on some big party or belonging to a community but honestly they are stressing themselves out being so tightly wound about things that can ultimately be deemed redundant. Its crazy because it's been weird to watch the community shift like this, we went from being about love and acceptance to criticizing our own kind for not being (x) enough. 

When you think about it, we are becoming the same thing we fought against in the first place xD. 

""You cant do that! That's for girls!""
""You can't do that! If you do that you're not really a trans guy!'

Both sound literally the same to me. Wtf happened?

This is easier said than done but try to ignore it, focus on the people who support you for who you are entirely.
That sucks. There's a lot of useful advice in here. Whole reading your post I just thought of a study that I read.

It concluded that people who had insufficient care and attention from parental figures in childhood (including me, yay!) will have a higher degree of seeking validation from external sources in adulthood, rather than the healthier alternative, which is internal validation.

Now how to get there, I'm not really sure. Personally I try to accept that my opinion is also that of a person and my opinion of me is valid.
Thank you for understanding and acknowledging where I'm coming from. It's been a long night and I've had to take multiple painkillers to soothe my headache and get to bed. It's nice to have someone really listen. I don't think I'm all that special but I know that there's a chance I'll be put in a trans cringe forum for being soo upset about this. But all I really want is to feel comfortable with myself.
Well said. I'm glad you wrote this out so well.
It just gets soo stressful constantly trying to please people who are purely for binary people only. Some part of me wants to understand why these people feel the way they do, but at this point, it's at the expense of my own self-love and happiness. Like I'm being open-minded but at what cost
Aw, thank you for the support. It's greatly appreciated
What is a ‚Äútucute‚Äù? I‚Äôm not really familiar with the term. From context, it sounds like the opposite of a transmedicalist?
I didn't even think people were still on this, I thought we all left it in 2017
I try to, and I don't actively go looking for it. I have someone who helps me with my transition and such but people online don't know that. They're basically asking me to air out all my personal business regarding all that I'm doing to transition because THEY believe what they've assumed I am in their own minds. None of these people know me and it shouldn't matter to me but it still hurts for some reason.
Thank you
Thank you! I really needed that after yesterday. Really rough on my physche.
Thank you, I'm really trying to stay in the right spaces but it's really hard to stay away from ""those"" places.
I'm mostly here on accident, I was just on Google looking at pride flags for research, and one picture linked to a...let's say, less than pretty, subreddit, I ended up in a very dark rabbithole.
Whenever I meet someone with similar interests, it's a pleasure
It just doesn't make sense to me, there are real threats out there yet people like this only want to find the most nonproblem ""problems"" to blame. It feels like there's nothing I can do to combat this, I grew out of this self-hating phase myself but I'm not equipped to teach others. I'm not a debate guy, I'm an artist. I don't know what they expect from me or people like me.
> From context, it sounds like the opposite of a transmedicalist

You nailed it.
I see ""tucute"" as meant to demonize rational and empathetic trans people for being rational and empathetic towards other trans people.
The only thing you are is ""TooCute"" don't worry about it we love you
Yeah I'm similar, not so much with truscum stuff, more with vanilla transphobia from cis people. I basically don't go near the Opinions section in the Guardian anymore, because even seeing a headline about how my existence is the cause of abortion bans & I'm a rape threat to cis lesbians spoils my mood for the whole day (even without actually reading the article).
One day a few years ago my cousin showed me r/IdiotsInCars and here I am now lol.
Lol, I assumed there _had_ to be more than that. Of course it doesn‚Äôt mean anything beyond ‚Äúyou aren‚Äôt working hard enough to exclude people from the trans community, and that‚Äôs a problem for me!‚Äù üôÑ

Are all non binary people trans?	"This isn't meant to disrespect or invalidate non binary people or their identities in ANY way, just something I had been wondering about. as a binary trans person it's not something I'm really knowledgeable about.

I'm aware there are nb people who transition in some way (physically or socially ex. name or pronouns) but there are also people who identify as nb that keep their name or don't care if they are referred to with gendered pronouns. again, not saying there's anything wrong with that or that either is less valid, but I just wonder if the second group would be considered trans, or if they would even consider themselves trans.

for them is the non binary label referring to actually being something other than male or female or does it refer to them not conforming to the gender binary?

for clarification I'm *not* referring to people who want transition but are unable to because of their environment.

edit: yes I see the irony in having binary yes and no options but I'm asking for peoples opinions/ personal experience. I already know that there are trans nb people, I'm asking if you believe that *all* nb people are trans

[View Poll](https://www.reddit.com/poll/sfs1ia)"	"The word that's throwing me off is ""all""

By definition, non-binary is under the trans umbrella however not all non-binary people identify as trans.

I'm noticing a common misconception. Transgender does not mean transitioning. Its an adjective to describe people who's gender differs from their assigned gender at birth (AGAB).
Yeah it depends. Some of the people you‚Äôre describing consider themselves trans, some don‚Äôt. The way I think of it is that non-binary overlaps with being trans but isn‚Äôt necessarily coextensive with it, if that makes sense.
In the purest sense that they are not cis? Yes absolutely.

In the sense that they have to use or feel comfortable having or using the label to describe themselves? Absolutely up to the individual.
It depends on what context.

As a categorization i.e. scientific or academic: Yes, complicated by the possibility of a society existing that does not assign gender at birth; trans as we understand it now means living as a gender identity that's different to what you were assigned at birth.

As an identity, it's up to the individual to decide whether they want to self-identify as trans and consider themselves a part of the trans community.
Non binary comes under the trans umbrella but not all nonbinary people consider themselves or feel trans. Which is valid and how they feel about themselves/their gender.

I'm nonbinary and trans.
i am genderqueer (and non-binary i am okay with both terms) and i love my transness as it is. i don't know why other enbies would refrain from calling themselves trans /gen
i mean okay so. *technically* yes because if you are not the gender you're assigned at birth you're technically transgender , but it's in the end up to the individual on if they identify with trans or not -
It can be argued that intersex non-binary people are cisgender, but since trans tends to be with regards to assigned gender at birth, and hospitals are generally not great and assign everybody either male or female at birth, all non-binary people are trans, to my knowledge.
The irony of giving a binary option to answer a question about the identity of non-binary people üòÇ
As I‚Äôm not non-binary, I think this is an answer for individual non-binary people to give for themselves.
By definition yes because trans is just identifying as something other than your agab but not all enby people are comfortable being called trans for whatever reason.

So in conclusion kinda yes but also kinda no.
i personally identify as not cis, i'm just not comfortable enough with like saying i'm trans. but if we're being technical being trans means not identifying with ur agab so apart from intersex people, yeah we're all trans.
Idk about nb people as a whole but personally i call myself trans even though I'm nb, it's just that i feel more fem than anything else and I'm amab.
Yes, if they choose to label themselves as that.
I had nothing to add as everyone else already clarified that, sticking to the definition of transgender being anyone who doesn't identify/live by their assigned gender at birth, then yeah, Enby people may be considered part of the trans umbrella, but I consider it each individual's choice what to identify, and which label to use.

This is something that (almost) every commenter before me has said but I still wanted to participate because I find funny af that we can't decide on a binary answer but we do sorta agree in a ""non-binary"" answer hahaha
Ive seen nonbinary people who dont think of themselves as trans, not for any self hating reason, just personal preference on their part
The way it has been explained to me by my NB friends is that they are trans because no one is assigned non-binary at birth.
Ehhh. I‚Äôd say it depends, and I‚Äôd just play it by ear (like, asking them). Things vary a lot, and that can include how they feel.
My thoughts are that all enbys are to be given the trans umbrella. If they want to open it to fit underneath it, good. If they don't, also good.

Basically, I am to treat them as belonging as a trans person and if they tell me they don't, I do the work to see them how they want.
if their non-binary gender is different than their AGAB, then yes, technically, they are under the trans umbrella- however not every enby uses trans as a label, for various reasons, and that's fine. personally I consider myself trans and enby, but I usually just say enby, because trans kinda feels redundant to mention as well. so it really only comes up for stuff like this XD
well yes, technically. By definition they are all trans because they don‚Äôt identify with their agab, but not all nonbinary people label themselves as trans.
I personally believe that as long as someone doesn't identify with their birth gender, regardless of how much, they fall under the trans umbrella
I don't think this is truly a yes or no question. For me, yes. I believe every nonbinary person belongs under the trans umbrella. Regardless of if they transition or not. However, I acknowledge that there are some nonbinary people out there who feel the trans label isn't for them, and choose not to use it. That's a real and valid experience that I don't want to erase. But on the whole, nonbinary people are trans unless they feel/decide otherwise as an individual.
I vote no because i dont wanna force non binary people into a label. It is under the trans umbrella but some people dont wish to identify that way
My logic is like a train track. If you're not cisgender, you're switching away the track of cis gender and transitioning to another track (gender). That's just me though and how I think. Everyone is valid. At the end, only non cis people can decide if they identify as trans or not.
Technically no, because you could theorically raise a child in as nb and let them choose afterward (wich could make every man/woman raised like that trans funnily enough*), so if they chose to stay nb they could be cis nb.

Effectively yes, because raising a child in a nb way is very rare today. And since almost every non binary person where raised binary, I guess it would make them trans.


*I gotta say: the distinction cis/trans would become obsolete in that scenario, I'd like to see a society that let children chose themselves their gender.
This is giving me the same vibes as ‚ÄúIf you‚Äôre bi/pan then are you gay?‚Äù
All non-binary people are under the trans umbrella, however not all choose to identify as trans (I didn't until I had my epiphany)
All nonbinary people can claim the trans label, not all nonbinary people do.
Yes, because it‚Äôs not assigned at birth, HOWEVER not all nonbinary people identify with the label, and that should be respected
Are all non-binary people transgender by definition: yes
Do all non-binary people have to use the label of transgender to still be valid: no
‚ÄòTrans‚Äô does NOT mean ‚Äòtransition‚Äô. It means ‚Äòtransgender‚Äô. And that means identifying as something other than your AGAB. There are binary trans people who don‚Äôt transition for any number of reasons. That doesn‚Äôt make them not trans. Trans is a condition of being, not something you do. 

Unless you were born into one of the few extant societies that use a non-binary gendering system, if you are non-binary then your are *by definition* trans, especially for purposes of discussion and solidarity for political and social activism. 

That said, many non-binary choose not to use the term to describe themselves, for various reasons. Others do. It‚Äôs neither right nor wrong. It‚Äôs their choice. No one else gets to gatekeep.
Personally, I'd say most; unless anyone was assigned a gender other than male/female at birth, then by being nb they are not their AGAB, which is the definition of trans.
I see it as ""Yes, but actually no"" since they don't need to take the label if they choose not to.
If a non binary person says they don't identify as trans, then they aren't trans. That's kinda exactly how this is supposed to work. So asking for others ""opinions"" kinda misses the point.
Another person's opinion on whether a non binary person is trans or not isn't relevant. Otherwise we'd have to start accepting the opinions of transphobes.

It might seem like an extreme example. But if someone says they aren't something and you try to explain to them why they're wrong about their own identity...

Well I think I've made the point I was trying to make.
I'd say so. By detention trans people identify as a gender that is not their agab. Assuming most people were assigned either male or female, then non-binary, meaning outside of the male/female binary, would by default put them as a gender differing from their agab.
Trans means not identifying as your agab. Non-binary people weren‚Äôt assigned non-binary at birth, therefore yes they are all trans.
It‚Äôs both yes and no‚Ä¶. Yes in the fact that non-binary is under the trans umbrella, no in the fact that not all non-binary people use the trans label.
You‚Äôre going to get subjective answers because there‚Äôs not a one-size-fits-all answer. For me, I identify as non-binary and transmasc. I‚Äôm on an average dose of T. I get gender euphoria with every masculinizing change on T. I present androgynous to masc depending on the day. I crave as much bottom growth as my body will allow. I feel more comfortable with ‚Äúhe‚Äù pronouns than ‚Äúthey.‚Äù But I also don‚Äôt live 100% feeling like I‚Äôm male. There‚Äôs an ‚Äúother‚Äù in me - an in-between. It takes a lot of courage and commitment to being authentic for me to not just call myself a trans male and try and pass exclusively as one. But my truth is, that doesn‚Äôt feel right for me. 

You‚Äôre asking important questions but you‚Äôre still asking for a binary answer. :)
it depends on what they would want to be labeled as :)
as someone who is non-binary and on hrt i do consider myself trans. anyone no matter how they look can be non binary  it‚Äôs all love at the end of the day!üñ§
I have a friend whos nb but he doesn‚Äôt identify as trans
Fuck I miss clicked I‚Äôm sorry y‚Äôall. Meant to click yes
Idk how to feel on as a trans non-binary peroan I get the worst of both worlds
Nonbinary people are only trans if they identify as trans, we shouldn‚Äôt force our labels on them.
If you identify as any gender different than what you where assigned at birth you are transgender
The way I see it is if your not cis your trans but some people just don‚Äôt want to use that label. So yea
Nonbinary is under the trans umbrella, so yea technically all nb are trans, but you don't have to identify with it. Whatever makes people comfy üíñ
they do fall under the trans umbrella so under technical terms yes

Does that mean all non binary folk are going to and have to identity with a trans label, no
As an agender the term transgender (""to another gender"") doesn't feel quiet right, but if it is just used to state I don't like my assigned gender at birth than it is alright üëå
The Non-Binary term falls under the Trans umbrella. What each non binary person identifies as, I cannot possibly say
technically yes. trans means that your gender does not match the gender you were assigned at birth, so yes, every non-binary person is trans(except maybe intersex people? I am not informed enough on that tho). however, there are a lot of non-binary people who do not use that term. so it depends on the context you wanna use it in.
I think to be non binary, you *have* to be trans, but it's just a label anyway. Anyone who isn't cis is trans.
It is possibly for an intersex person to identify as non-binary, thus you can be a cisgender non-binary person :)
[deleted]
No not all. People who are outside the binary sex‚Äôs and also have non binary gender are actually cis because they identify as their birth gender (sorry if I‚Äôm not using the right wording here)
not all enby people identify as trans, so no
Honestly I would say yes. People who say they are nb but not trans are just confusing nb and gnc most of the time
Asides from certain intersex nonbinary people (and fictional enby characters), yes.
Trans means to transition. We are choosing a gender to move toward, and rejecting the one assigned to us. Nonbinary doesn't really reject or accept anything. It's just a bit of light crossdressing. Trans people have to take hormones and get surgeries. Not at all the same thing.
If u dont transition if u dont change literally any aspect of ur life then u cant be trans cuz u literally transitioned nothing u would be a literal trans trender saying ur trans when ur not
Non binary is gender nonconforming. Not TRANSgender.

Edit: But we should still accept them into the trans community with open arms because they experience dysphoria too.
[removed]
I 100% disagree with enbys being in the trans umbrella.
Gender nonconforming yes both are defined by this definition.

I see enbys more as a refusal to adhere to the genders that exist in society. There is no transition, it is literally a removal from gender. Existing in a nothing state. The ones that fall under gender fluid are like, I feel male today and female another. This isn‚Äôt anywhere close to the same experience. I see it more as cherry picking the pros and refusing to deal with the cons of any given gender. 

Now those that actually transition ie trans. The umbrella is mtf and ftm. 

But feeling male some days or female another isn‚Äôt trans.

Edit.

If y‚Äôall gunna downvote my opinion which is based off what I have seen from the vast majority of enbys and those that use they/them pronouns. At least counter it. Tell me why I am wrong because the way I see it my experience is way fucking different.

Not to mention y‚Äôall literally make it more difficult for those that actually do transition. You literally help the argument of the right. Because they literally use you to justify why I am a ‚Äúman‚Äù.

With that being said enbys aren‚Äôt trans.

Now the ones that are mtfnb or ftmtnb maybe y‚Äôall trans? But my point of going into a nothing state still stands, because society is masc or fem there is almost no whatever. Until that changes enby literally is an outsider. Existing outside of society while still being there.


Now those of us that stay in the mtf and ftm. And medically and socially transition. We are still within society because we are simply changing teams so to speak. This is 100% fundamentally different.
I think or mabye not.
as an nb person I do think all nb people are trans, but people are allowed to not want that label and I fully respect that. 

To me, it would seem that the definition of trans is being a gender different than what you were assigned, and since no one (at least in the traditional western ideas of gender/sex) is assigned nb at birth, that would make all nb people trans. 

Fully up for debate tho!
how can i vote for both
Personally i think yes. They dont identify with their birth sex, a lot tend to get somesort of surgery, or at least hormone therapy.


And if their not up for that, some will do things to alter their appearance to look more androgynous.
Either way they go through some sort of medical transition (surgery or hormones) or social transition (pro-nouns or personal style).


But of course its more up to the actual person to decide these things, and not really anyone else. If their non-binary, great! If their a non-binary trans-person Also great!
The definition of trans is identifying with a gender that differs from your assigned sex at birth so by definition yes non binary people are trans. 

The nuance that's missing in that statement however is that not all non binary people identity with the trans label. Which is fine. Some identify with the term cis based on their experiences which is also fine. 

Technically non binary does equate to being trans. Individuals don't have to use a word because it ""technically"" applies to them is all.
I usually imagine the distinction being that transgender ppl are binary trans and just ‚Äútrans‚Äù refers to ppl who are seeking some form of transition whether that be medical, social or what not. 

I think when you get to this level of queerness though labels stop mattering so much, a lot of trans ppl I know just say gender queer and a lot say enby trans and some say enby but they don‚Äôt feel comfortable saying trans. It‚Äôs all valid just go with what you feel.
no! not all nonbinary people consider themselves trans, i do personally hc i'm nonbinary transmasc. but there's many who don't.
Not all of them. I might be non-binary or genderfluid, but I am not trans. I am just here supporting everyone here. I might yeet my boobs some day because it gives me body dysmorphia.
I consider myself non binary. I do not consider myself trans. That‚Äôs all.
My GF is non-binary and does not consider themselves trans. So, no.
That's what the white stripe is for, as long as they don't fully identify with their birth gender then they are trans.
No. Being trans and NB are different. I know both trans and cis NB people.
I had some trouble with this and upon pondering I voted no, my reasoning is someone can identify as how ever they please. That is what being a part of the LGBTQ+ community is all about right? Being yourself and authentically you. If someone identifies as non-binary but says they are not trans why should we deny them what they label themselves as?
They're definitely not cis, so I vote yes.
I voted 'no' because it's up to the non-binary person themselves whether they identify as trans or not.
Trans means that your gender identity doesn't match the gender you were assigned at birth. Since people aren't typically assigned NB at birth, it stands to reason that all NBs are trans. 

I consider myself trans, even though I'm a masc presenting AMAB, who isn't bothered by he/him pronouns. Even if most people see me as a man, it doesn't make me one. Just like if a binary trans person doesn't pass, it doesn't mean that they aren't their gender. 

Some NB people don't feel comfortable calling themselves trans, and that's perfectly valid. But any NB can call themself trans if it's something that they feel applies to them.
to me, trans is identifying as something other than what you were born as. however i do get that some might not identify as trans.
there can be cis intersex enbies.
Didn't vote because I think some are and some aren't.

I identity as non-binary. Actually when I reconnected with a friend and former colleague of mine after years of no contact and after they'd (1) realized they are trans and (2) are now a gender therapist at queer-specific clinic and I'd mentioned I was struggling with gender and we talked about it and he was like ""welllll ... identify however you want and that's valid and it's not for me to say but fwiw, just so you know, you meet diagnostic criteria and I'd write you a WPATH letter right now"" lmfao

But I, personally, don't identity as trans. I don't have body dysphoria and it really is meaningfully different for people who do. On that one point I do admit to being very sympathetic to transmeds, tbqh. Those of you who need to actually _transition_ go through so much more. I'm low key tearing up right now honestly at the thought of how hard it is in this garbage world to just be true to yourself. ‚ù§Ô∏è you all so much. 

so yeah that's where I'm at

Edit: my friend works at Mazzoni Center in Philly. I'd recommend it if you're in the area. No gatekeeping. You can DM me for his name if you want (though I'll double check with him). Pretty sure he'd support informed consent but the world we live in means navigating this bullshit world and meeting diagnostic criteria.
I think It depends on what the person is comfortable with and what they want to label themself so no, not all
I mean, I put no simply for the fact that there are nb people who don't identify as trans. Who am I, someone who is not and will never know what it is to be nb, to tell them what they are?
Simple. I support self-identification as it is the best heuristic from a therapeutic standpoint. Some enbies don‚Äôt identify as trans so I answered no.
I think they can decide, like the definition of trans includes non-binary people, but like if they don‚Äôt want to be under the label then they don‚Äôt have to
I think this is a perfect explanation. I'd add on, it should be noted some people just have an alternative gender expression without a different gender identity. If you're a girl who likes masculine clothes,names and even pronouns, but you still identify as female, that doesn't make you trans at all. It's your gender identity (the part of you that says are you at your core a guy, gal, or something else) that determines if you are trans or NB. Not just how you present.
I mean, no one (at least in modern western society) is assigned non-binary at birth, sadly :/
I think the misconception comes from, at least within the English language, the ‚Äútrans‚Äù prefix in ‚Äútransgender‚Äù and the ‚Äútrans‚Äù prefix in ‚Äútransition‚Äù don‚Äôt have the same definition, but lots of folks seem to believe they do.

The ‚Äútrans‚Äù in ‚Äútransition‚Äù means ‚Äúso as to change‚Äù.

The ‚Äútrans‚Äù in ‚Äútransgender‚Äù means ‚Äúon the other side of‚Äù. Why? Because the word ‚Äútransgender‚Äù is meant to linguistically be the opposite of the word ‚Äúcisgender‚Äù; and the prefix ‚Äúcis‚Äù in ‚Äúcisgender‚Äù means ‚Äúon this side‚Äù.

All that to say that ‚Äútransgender‚Äù does not equal ‚Äútransition‚Äù. They just happen to use the same prefix (at least in English).
[deleted]
I remember talking (on Reddit) to an intersex NB person that identifies as cis, so there is at least one
Lol
lmao how so
I'm not trying to debate the validity or existence of nb people  I'm just hoping for responses from people who are nb themselves or know nb people  and what their experience has been
Tbh he hardly identifies as nb either (he uses masc pronouns ppl and actively says he just doesn‚Äôt like that ppl think men can‚Äôt have pink hair and that‚Äôs his entire reason for being nb, other than that he‚Äôs pretty  transphobic by default) this isn‚Äôt a jab at the idea of being nb this is a jab at a shitty friend for being transphobic
For the last time, intersex is not a gender, and not all non-binary/intersex people are perfectly androgynous.
No that's incorrect. Many nonbinary people who are not intersex do not identify/feel transgender. And I'm sure many nonbinary intersex people do feel trans.
Nonbinary people who are intersex can still be trans. Many intersex people are forcibly assigned a gender at birth, and also intersex and nonbinary are two different identities, so it's not like they 'match' to make a person cis. Intersex is not just a nonbinary body and nonbinary isn't just wanting to be intersex. And there is absolutely NO cis privilege derived from being both intersex and nonbinary like there is being both afab and female or amab and male. People really need to stop treating nonbinary and intersex as a catch all third gender and trying to fit those intentities into the same framework as binary trans. You can't go 'oh people assigned male at birth who still identify as male and people assigned female at birth who still identify as female are privileged and cis, so nonbinary intersex must be the same' you can't just apply the same logic with no consideration for the actual experiences and identities, the oppression both groups face, and the fact that intersex and nonbinary have never meant the same thing and have their own distinct histories and identities and connotations.
Also some don‚Äôt want to identify as trans if their gender presents similar to what they where identified as at birth but that‚Äôs a bit more complex
*says transphobic, nbphobic crap*

*totally retcons said crap even though the crap is still there*

*is a contradictory truscum*
Begone truscum
> At least counter it

ok

> I see enbys more as a refusal to adhere to the genders that exist in society. There is no transition, it is literally a removal from gender

This is gendervoid specifically, plenty of NBs are not gendervoid and still consider themselves to be on a spectrum between male and female, not removed from the concept altogether. Also some do get varying degrees of surgeries and hormones.

> The ones that fall under gender fluid are like, I feel male today and female another.

There are binary gender fluid individuals so it doesn‚Äôt really make sense to target the NBs for this specifically. As for it‚Äôs own merits, the brain is complicated and largely unmapped, I see no reason that this couldn‚Äôt be possible, similar to how dysphoria levels can fluctuate over time.

> You literally help the argument of the right. Because they literally use you to justify why I am a ‚Äúman‚Äù.

Frankly the reactionaries were never going to ignore us just because we were all binary, they have chosen gender as the battle line and that will not change until they find a new group they consider even easier to dehumanize. Besides, this isn‚Äôt like an ill advised easily reframe-able slogan the left has rallied behind, these are humans that exist. They are what they are so we just have to plan our defenses with that fact taken into account.
Only if they were in a culture that assigned at non-binary gender at birth. In most Western and Western-colonized/occupied cultures, intersex people are coercively assigned a binary gender (and often surgically operated on without consent). 

Remember that non-binary is not a third gender or androgyny (though a non-binary could present androgynously), but an alternative, non-categorical conceptual framework of gendering that replaces the Gender Binary. Despite what the name might naturally lead one to think, it‚Äôs not the gender equivalent of intersex. Intersex could go on to identify as non-binary, but if they were assigned a binary gender at birth, that would make them trans.
So by that logic every single non binary person is trans by definition of the word? 

I‚Äôm confused
Intersex isn't a gender.
""gay"" is often used as an umbrella term for any sexuality that is not heterosexual so it's similar to how ""trans"" is an umbrella for anyone who is not cis
True! As a binary/not intersex trans person it‚Äôs not really for me to decide or have a say on, if you feel trans you‚Äôre trans, if you don‚Äôt you‚Äôre not! I‚Äôm overthinking this, and that first comment was wrong, that‚Äôs my bad!
Yknow what I‚Äôm overthinking this, if you identify as trans you‚Äôre trans, if you don‚Äôt you‚Äôre not, sorry for the word dump, and the incorrect assumption!
truscum because being trans means something.
I may be wrong but they could be referring to how some non-binary people do not identify as transgender.

If I am wrong, then yeah begone truscum!

Edit: I just looked at their profile. You're right. This person doesn't belong here.
Ok my point is that the experience is completely different.

I‚Äôm saying nb should be it‚Äôs own category and gender fluid people the category above nb.

The fact that I have always felt like a girl, even though I presented very cishet (for my fucking safety). This is not the same, When I feel male it cause massive disphoria, not oh I‚Äôm a boy today and a girl tomorrow. This is insulting to me. 

My physically changing my body via hormones and probably a few surgeries so I feel complete. 

We are not the same.

The only thing that is the same is we are gender nonconforming.

I am not ok being male at all.

Which is why I said metaphorically that nbs exist in a nothing space because it litterally is a nothing space. The binary is male and female, nb exists outside of that. And in society today it is a nothing space.

Also when you have people with a beard and wearing a dress JVN. People will say see, he‚Äôs just faking it. This is exactly why I want it separated. I have nothing against these individuals. But saying we are under the trans umbrella is absurd.
> Only if they were in a culture that assigned at non-binary gender at birth. In most Western and Western-colonized/occupied cultures, intersex people are coercively assigned a binary gender (and often surgically operated on without consent).

While this has been true for most of modern Western history, it has changed in recent years in many Western countries, and there have been more and more people assigned intersex. It's also possible to retroactively change your birth certificate, so existing intersex people increasingly have the option to actually change their AGAB.

> Despite what the name might naturally lead one to think, it‚Äôs not the gender equivalent of intersex. Intersex could go on to identify as non-binary, but if they were assigned a binary gender at birth, that would make them trans.

It's not the equivalent, yes, but a person assigned intersex could identify as cis non-binary, that's my entire point.
By definition, yes. But it‚Äôs up to them if they want to individually use the label of ‚Äòtrans‚Äô to describe themselves. Many do, some don‚Äôt. Individual comfort and choice.
That makes me feel like some people are just dodging the stigma and discrimination and further stigmatizing it :(
So I get downvotes for voicing something that doesn‚Äôt make me feel good. Got it. Can‚Äôt open up or ask questions.
It‚Äôs rather that 1) those do still present mostly as their AGAB don‚Äôt want to occupy space or talk over binary trans people who are dealing with the issues involved in transitioning their presentation, and/or 2) they are either shamed by or otherwise tired of dealing with harassment from transmedicalists and truscum. 

The general vibe that I get is that it is a reaction to gatekeeping from within the trans community. To dump on them as trying to avoid the stigma of being trans serves only to put them in a double bind. 

I live with a binary trans person. I am non-binary and still present mostly as my AGAB in daily life (I may make a more binary-ish transition later on, but that‚Äôs not what being trans is about). I‚Äôm not going to stand beside them and publicly call myself trans in most contexts, as I would feel (rightly or wrongly) guilty about seeming to trivialize their experience, not afraid of stigma for myself (I would be afraid of being seen by binary trans people as not trans enough, actually). But on a conceptual level, I absolutely do consider that I‚Äôm trans by definition because no one in my culture is assigned any gender outside the gender binary at birth. Does that make sense?

Coming out as trans to my 94 years old grandmother	"Spoiler alert, this is a good story of mine.

When I came out to my family about a year ago, talking with my grandmother was high priority to me. She was never much of a grandchildren grandma if that makes sense, but we grew closer when I became adult.

So I called her (we live very far apart), and told her about my plan to transition to a woman. Her reaction was clear and strong, along the line of why do I want to be a woman? Don't I know how difficult it is to be a woman in our society? How disadvantaged I'd be and how much bigotry I would have to face as a woman? And saying that, if I choose to transition and live as a woman, she is a hundred percent behind me and wishes me absolutely all the best.

Oh, she also immediately tried to put me in touch with another trans woman she knows to get advice and support. Also, a couple of conversations later she raised on her own accord the her wish to use my new pronouns.

I found it absolutely wonderful, the heartfelt care for my well being, her own life experience and advice mixed in, and most importantly unconditional acceptance of my decision.  And it goes to show, age is not a reason to be transphobic or to reject change."	"My grandma will be 90 in a couple months and she's been by far the most accepting and welcoming member of my family since I came out. Everyone is nice and supportive, but she is _happy_ for me. She talks so often about how much happier I seem and tells me how beautiful I am. She sends pictures of me to all her granny friends. She asks personal questions about transition and what it's like sometimes but always out of love and she always asks if I'm ok talking about it first. Her boyfriend (87) was lazy with my name and pronouns at first so she started whacking him with a wooden spoon every time he got it wrong and now he always gets it right.
Wow that's really heartwarming ü•∫ happy for you
That's so cute and heartwarming \^\_\^  
And no, age definitely isn't an excuse to be transphobic/homophobic.
Literally same. 87 year-old grandma is the most supportive.
This is the best thing I've ever read
Supportive grandparents rock üëçüòÉ
That sounds amazing, having someone close to you so positively curious and supportive, and that is is your grandma is a lovely bonus. Thanks for sharing!"	xbhbub	trans	113	0.97	2022-09-11 12:30:08
You can delete this if you like.	"I actually give up. I'm done transitioning. Not doing it anymore. I'm too old and I can't live this fairytale you all get to live. 

You all are so beautiful and gorgeous women. And such handsome and fine ass men. 

I am 30, I have 2 kids 5 and 3. I been losing everything. And I already have nothing and been had nothing but yet somehow losing more. 

I rather just die. But I can't have that or the easy way out. Can't take a father from my kids either way... I hate God and peoples excuse to use it. I hate terfs. I hate men and misogynistic people and mindsets. I really hate this earth. People are sick.

I wish I was some cute lil white person so I could get love and support and transitioned young or just been born a fucking girl. Instead I have a stereotypical old black father. Stupid un educated religious mother. Kinky hair. Masculine body. 

No one wants me. Or I'm a fetish. Or hated by most of the world cause I'm black. God forbid I be trans. 

I can't do it. 

I really hope you all achieve your goals and stay beautiful people. Take care of one another. Be kind to yourself. And be smart and safe. 

I'm done here and not coming back to this account or subreddits like this or timelines."	"I feel awful for you, I couldn't imagine not being supported but know that there is people out there that love you for who you are like I'm sure your kids love you.

You deserve to love yourself as well and it may be difficult sometimes but it's worth it

I am so sorry about the racism and transphobia you face, I'm sure you are a wonderful, beautiful person 

*Virtual hug*
I'm really sorry to hear your family isn't supportive. Regardless of circumstances I like to think the best bet is to follow your heart despite what others tell you. It's a compass that leads to your own happiness. If you're the one that has to endure the walk don't let people tell you how to do it. I can't imagine the pain you must be experiencing and I hope you find respite. Be safe and hold on.
30 isn‚Äôt very late. I‚Äôve seen a lot of people have great outcomes. I thought about getting hrt when I was 30, and I didn‚Äôt think I needed it. Those feelings never went away, so now I‚Äôm 38 started hrt at 37, and I wish I had when I considered it then. I encourage you to reconsider but I understand the pressure from family.
You can do it, you just need support. I can't transition for medical reasons, but I know you absolutely can.
I was afraid of starting late too at 26. But I've been seeing trans people all over the 55+ community. I don't think it's ever too late to just live as yourself
I am 32 and I started transitioning this year. I have a daughter (6 years) and was married at the time. Within a week after coming out to my wife she told me I needed to move out by the end of the summer and that we would be separating. I came out mid June, and moved out at the end of August. Those two and a half months were emotionally exhausting.

When I finally moved out I felt emotionally free. Being out on my own allowed me to push my transition forward without fear of making my wife uncomfortable. I have made a community for myself since moving out. 

I just want you to know it gets better. Transitioning isn‚Äôt easy and for me it was the changes to the relationships I cherished that were the hardest.
Incase you really are leaving ill keep it short. You have a purpose in this world, and things will only get better with time. Stay safe, give yourself some breaks, and keep being you
WTF? I'm almost double your age, and just got my first appointment early next year. My kids are 27M/22F . I give zero fucks what others think about me, and go wherever I want dressed in whatever I like.
Well, if you see this I think you can be a great mom, just for starters
I understand if you can't anymore, inherent racism in the system. And the many many obstacles you face. But there's plenty to hope for. I know parents who's children understood and loved them before and after the transition. 
And i know people of colour who thrive after starting to transition. Even when they start at a later age. It's never to late to start being yourself. 

I hope you start feeling more comfortable regardless of whether you continue. You deserve to feel happy.
Even though I'm only half white with brown skin, I still have to deal with racist systems and institutions - I know how fucking hard it is to keep moving forward. I can't speak for your experience as I live in Australia, but fuck me, I know exactly what it feels like to be automatically excluded, maligned and treated like a criminal for simply existing. Chuck on the trans label and now we're double XP marginalised with an even bigger target on our backs.

You're not old, in fact I'm 31, so as an elder trans woman you have to listen to me üòã It also means, you have to extend the same kindness and generosity you have for us (complete strangers) towards yourself. If not you, at least for your babies.

You are a lot fucking stronger than you realise; you have to climb a mountain everyday whereas most have to face a small hill.

The world needs more beautiful and compassionate Moms like you! Fuck the terfs and transphobes, they're just scared of being left behind.

Please don't do anything rash and be kind to yourself. You deserve to be happy and loved ü•∞
You‚Äôre 30, you likely have two thirds of your life left to live, you will be so thankful at 60 that you transitioned at 30, instead of giving up and trying again at 40 or 50
I‚Äôve seen people in their 50s and 60s transition.
don‚Äôt give up now you‚Äôve come this far don‚Äôt let yourself be guilt tripped by the dude upstairs
I'm really sorry :( I don't know if I can say anything to make any of that better. I just want you to know the same thing that this community told me when I was starting out - we're here for you. All of us. Always. Whether you transition or not. We are your people, and I think I speak for everyone when I say that our hearts break reading this. You have to do what's best for you, and I wish you the best in that. Good luck, girl <3
ü´Çüò¢üè≥Ô∏è‚Äç‚ößÔ∏è

I cried for you tonight...
Noooo your never too late or old to transition. We may not know the true circumstances your going through but fuck everything anyone holds against you. I used to feel like that but eventually I didn‚Äôt give a damn and said we‚Äôre all gonna die anyways. Never give up, you don‚Äôt even have to transition to feel like you are ‚Äúwho you want to be‚Äù. This whole community definitely supports you and I‚Äôm wishing you love. Being transgender definitely comes with struggles but you got it :)
I recommend reading the book Love lives Her by Amanda Jette Knox, this book is about a family who has a trans daughter, and later in the story, the mother also comes out as trans, and she doesn't transition until she's 40. I can't force you to change your mind, but I think it would be a good book for you regardless on if you decide to continue your journey or not. 

I wish you the very best in life
Trans people are so beautiful. Non passing trans people are beautiful. Passing trans people are beautiful. It's a hard road when you don't pass, but it doesn't make you any less worthwhile.
I‚Äôm 36 and I‚Äôm not handsome but it doesn‚Äôt matter. Being trans isn‚Äôt just one thing, you can try different things and keep what you like. 

But I read a different post of yours and I‚Äôm guessing this is about your partner preferring who they thought you were to who you really are? Honestly, moving on sooner than later will be best. Being true to yourself will make you increasingly appealing to people who are good for you. You don‚Äôt have to spend the next 30 years trying to seem to be someone your ex finds palatable, and you shouldn‚Äôt.
People drop in and out, don‚Äôt worry she‚Äôll be back.  Or not, her life"	yn9auc	trans	105	0.88	2022-11-05 23:01:21
My dad finally began to accept me as a daughter ‚ô•	"MtF, six months into HRT. These past six months have held more joy and meaning for me than the past entire twelve years of my life combined, and my previous depressed, neurotic, constantly-anxious demeanor is almost nowhere to be seen. Whenever I get dressed, I care about what I'm wearing now. When I see my face in the mirror, even with its fair share of dysphoric facial stubble that I can't ever get fully rid of, my heart sings and I think I look cute instead of repulsive. I even got my legal name changed to Akari and I literally have never felt happier.

Thoughout all this, Dad has been considerably less enthused. He's always claimed ""all he wants is for me to be happy"", but it had always seemed tired and half-hearted. His response to seeing me in my black mesh and frills was ""hope it's everything you wanted"". His response to my name change was ""I'm glad you finished your task you set out to do"". My elation at my progress seemed entirely irrelevant to him up to now.

But last night is when I felt like that's starting to change. He came into my room last night and said something that made me kinda start to cry-- he said that he's ""noticed how much happier and more lively I've been these past few months, and that he's genuinely relieved and grateful to see that"".

He added that he ""still doesn't understand why I would transition, or what I hope to gain out of it, but that he's glad I went through with it since it's been such a positive thing"".

And he referred to me as Akari!! It is the first encounter we have thus far had where he hasn't forgotten not to deadname or misgender me.

I was so shocked and touched by that that I got up and went ""here you get another one"" (I had hugged him previously when he came home from work that night) and just squeezed him as hard as I could while tearing up

I told him I love him and am grateful to have him \>\/\/\<

Another thing he said was that ""all his life that he's been a kid, and a teenager, and an adult, there have only been two genders in his world view and the world view of everyone around him"" (he actually did reference native-American two-spirits as well as Thailand's kathoeys as examples that this has been around longer than he has, and acknowledges it-- my dad is extremely scholarly \^\^), and that for him this isn't a five-foot step away from before, it is more like a leap across an entire city, but that he's getting there and starting to see that it's something to value.

I really love my dad. Even my mom, who has been even less kind about it (the line ""god gave me a son, not a daughter"" will always stick in my head-- my dad is very anti-religious so his was really just more pragmatism). Even if the whole rest of the world would accept and validate me, it wouldn't mean nearly as much if my parents never would. So I \*needed\* this. I'm so happy. It finally feels like my dad has my back through this, even if he doesn't completely ""get it"". And I'm more than happy to talk with him and help him understand further.

For everyone still struggling to be accepted by their families here: stick with it. Talk to them, be open, as much as you feel comfortable. Do what you can to meet them halfway, with patience in your heart. Obviously everyone's situations differ, but I truly believe Love Conquers All in the end if we allow love into our lives and interactions, despite generational world view differences."	"Thanks, Akari!! This is such an uplifting story. I‚Äôm having some similarities difficulties with my extended family and your story gives me a bit of hope.
This is wonderful, Akari. I hope your mom sees how happy you are as yourself as well
You're never alone.
Well unfortunately she thinks most forms of happiness are just sinful temptation and thus anti-god, which I'm sure applies to gender euphoria as well >_>

Her hatred no longer holds power over me, though
Thanks."	ovd50y	trans	104	0.99	2021-07-31 19:15:19
Friend of 10 years misgenders me on purpose and gaslights me when confronted.	"Hi. So, recently, I started socially transitioning which has gone great! All of my family and friends have been supportive, with the exception of my one friend who I have known for around 10 years :(. We will call him Yarnld. So ever since I came out to Yarnld, he has treated me weird. Mind you, when I came out to him as bisexual a few years back, he was mostly supportive, just a little surprised, but nonetheless, didn't care. So, when I came out to him as MTF a few months ago, I thought nothing would change. Instantly, he started calling me ""ma'am,"" even in front of my family who I wasn't out to yet. However, Yarnld didn't out me. But as time progressed, he continued to treat me slightly weird. He continued to call me ma'am in a snide tone but yet he would still refer to me with he/him pronouns, even after I was out to my whole family and even his family. Over the summer, we did a few summer camps, driver's ed, etc. and he would randomly say to people at those places, ""he's a woman,"" when referring to me, but yet would use he/him pronouns (he even did this later to my very young little sister after I was out, further adding to her confusion). I tried correcting him once and he said, ""she, he, he, she whatever. You are a male anyways."" That was when I was really starting to be affected by his negative attitude. He still misgendered me, and when corrected, he would say ok and continue to misgender. One time, he was telling me about how he told his sister that I was trans. He said she didn't think I would ""be like that."" I know his sister didn't say that because his sister is awesome and progressive/woke. He most likely twisted her words and lied. After that he proceeded to tell me that there are only two genders. The thing that made me really mad and confused was that one time his mom misgendered me (on accident) but then pulled me aside after and apologized but then she told me how one time, Yarnld corrected her when she misgendered me at home in a conversation (again, on accident). Was he just torturing me for fun? I wasn't sure. 

This kept up until finally, the other day I confronted him through text and asked him to please use my preferred pronouns. He said he always does, which was not at all true, and when I said that he doesn't, he sent an empty message bubble and question mark every time I replied. I told him to stop trolling and he continued to gaslight me. I brought up specific examples and he defensively said, ""why didn't you say this the last time we hung out."" While this seems endearing, I can tell he did that simply to deflect. He said that this transition has been hard on him because has had to change the way he has referred to someone for 10 years (me ofc). However, he has never even once tried to properly gender me, unless he is trying to make a quip or snide remark, such as saying ""ladies first"" slyly and in a rude tone. He left saying he was going to the beach. While this breaks my heart, I don't think I want to continue my friendship with Yarnld. He is mean to everybody. He talks shit about people behind their back, even my own dad and my brother. And he is also a very big liar. Yarnld has become a very different person from when I first met him, and I think we have grown apart way too much for me to consider him a friend anymore. '

TL;DR: My 'friend' keeps purposely misgendering me and when I confronted him, he denied everything and gaslit me."	"I mean, yeah that's not a friend. Cut them out of your life and move on to better people. Fuck em.
It's the best choice to leave and don't look back. People like this will talk about others behind their backs and do the same to you. This definitely isn't a good person and karma will come bite him quick. Just drop him, ghost him if you want. He doesn't deserve an explanation and you sure don't owe it to him. Do what's best for you.
sorry but Yarnld in general seems not like a person *anyone* would like to be around (""he is mean to everybody"", ""he is also a very big liar"", WTF)? second the other comments, drop'em and don't look back. you need supporting people, not aholes
You have more patience than me. I‚Äôd have slapped him by now.
My advice is not be in that position anymore if they Aren‚Äôt  going to at least respect your decision about you‚Äôre sexuality, gender,etc.
Dump him, be friends with his sister.
ur friend is a bad friend
Friends don‚Äôt have to stay friends just because you‚Äôve known them for a long time
It sounds like he had something going on he's not taking about. That said your not a therapist is not your job to fix him. Let him know that you need some space, that your relationship doesn't feel healthy anymore. Make sure that he knows you'll be there if he needs to talk but unless he's willing to make some significant changes this is the end of your relationships.
I'm so sorry!

Gentle comforting hugs if wanted.

Hopefully your life will improve without that dude being so rude to you anymore.
True colors! Never Never trust someone like that again. We have all seen that! Be careful and Be happy.üåπ
That‚Äôs gross. Not a friend. You deserve better.
I'm just going to say the same thing but the season of Yarid needs to end some people are only in your life for a season and that's for the best in this case.
thanks everyone for the support! i think that i will try to drop him, as you all agree and that's what a lot of my friends are saying as well. i will try to keep yall posted but as of now he hasn't replied or reached out to me :/
I‚Äôm so sorry that‚Äôs happening to you. I think it‚Äôs best to fit him off tbh he sounds like a horrible friend‚Ä¶
Confront him in person and if he gaslights you even once dump his as
That‚Äôs not a friend. Dump them
i love this
üëÜ This is important
yes please!
i remember one of my favorite tv shows (atypical) talked about this and i very much love and agree with this.
I've never seen it but I'm hoping you find all the advice given here useful.  I've lost friends in life for various reasons sometimes it was a bad reason other times people just go in different directions and drift apart with no bad blood between the two. I wish you the best."	xaerda	trans	103	0.97	2022-09-10 03:25:33
A heartwarming story from last night.	"A little clarification needed. I along with my good friend work at a small family run grocery store. I'm much newer to the area than most but I've been taken in and treated as family by these people as well.

Just last month I came out to said friend that I am trans (MtF if it matters) and he's been nothing but supportive. He's always asking me questions, and making sure that he uses my new name, pronouns and any feminine terminology he can when we are alone or amongst others who know. He even had a dream recently in which ""my transition went very well."" 

However last night was the night that made me write this post. He asked me to cover his break early so he can take care of something important, and when he came back he told me he needed to talk to me about something serious. When we got to the backroom he gave me the vinyl of Red (Taylor's Version) I've been eyeing for months but couldn't buy due to being short of cash. He said it was a present for coming out to people and how he knows how stressed I've been. 

Being this early on in my transition in my experience feels like being one person with a very large boulder that you need to push yourself, and said boukder is a barrier that isolates you and makes you feel alone. I'm just glad that I have such wonderful friends to help remind me that I don't need to do everything alone :')"	"Congratulations, Mikaela!
when you said however i thought it was going to take a turn for the transphobic but no it ended super wholesome, im so happy for you! :3
i'm not crying, you're crying
Thank you!~ :)
Thank you!~ I didn't even pay attention to the phrasing I just rambled lol

MTF, partner transition. Started to transition socially‚Ä¶ my mom, is making it really awkward and hard. Does she even care about us? Or is she only concerned about what people will think of her? How do you deal with something like this?	"
Long story‚Ä¶ maybe not so much. But needed a place to share and vent a little. My partner started her transition, and it‚Äôs been by far the biggest emotional rollercoaster I‚Äôve ever experienced. But throughout this ride I‚Äôve experienced so much love, growth and appreciation, that I can‚Äôt deny it‚Äôs all been more than worth it. Our friends and siblings have been so supportive and seeing my wife thriving in this journey‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs just‚Ä¶beautiful. 

I‚Äôve done a lot of grieving, but I‚Äôm at a different point right now‚Ä¶ So it felt right to move forward as a couple and allow ourselves to just be US out there. Stop modulating pronouns and how we behave. Just be.

But my mom. Oh my mom. When we talked to her‚Ä¶ (and don‚Äôt get me wrong, I can understand the initial shock), she almost seemed too worried about the ‚ÄúHOW CAN YOU BECOME ‚ÄúTHAT‚Äù AFTER SO MANY YEARS, AS A MAN‚Äù‚Ä¶ 

She claims to be worried about me but not once has she asked me if I‚Äôm doing okay. She started questioning us about my wife‚Äôs therapist, ‚ÄúWho is she? What does she do? Is she even good?‚Äù

She doesn‚Äôt want to ask us anything, instead wants to do her own research and then have a private conversation to ask us questions. That she prefers to address this as a LAWYER not a mom (she is in fact lawyer)‚Ä¶ so she‚Äôs been acting like she‚Äôs building a case against us‚Ä¶ so tiring, and disappointing. 

Talking to my psychiatrist, we came to the conclusion that I was raised by a narcissist mother. Which not shit, is quite evident. 

I‚Äôm going through a bit of grief again‚Ä¶ that lovely beard that my partner once had, is going for good, since she‚Äôs starting permanent hair removal‚Ä¶ (she‚Äôs so excited!), But just makes me a bit nostalgic‚Ä¶ and feeling like I also have my mom acting up is just too exhausting. 

Anyways‚Ä¶ 

Any comments? Ideas? What can I do? How can I keep supporting my wife? How to help parents that seem so convinced on changing the course of things understand?"	"Hope you‚Äôll find answers here. If you want answers from people like you, i mean partners, you can also post this in r/Mypartneristrans
Oh! We have been married for 9 years! I don‚Äôt know what she‚Äôs expecting. Or what case she wants to build against the situation. I love this woman‚Ä¶ my woman. It‚Äôs just exhausting. I honestly believes she was going to be so supportive, and it was the biggest disappointment.
Well‚Ä¶. When I came out to my Mom, her first words were ‚Äúwhat will people think of me? What will my friends say?‚Äù   I was disgusted, she then started trying to talk me out of it.  I told her I‚Äôd been planning on doing this for a long time, that I‚Äôd been on hormones for six months.  Then I went on to point out all the things in my life that pointed to this very issue.  Things she ignored and hid for me.  That when her and my entire family has been saying for the last six months I‚Äôve been happier than ever, which was true.  She tried interventions two more times, at which point I told her that when I decided to transition, one of the things I said is that I would erase those from my life that don‚Äôt accept me.  The only two things in my life I needed to keep were the love and acceptance of my kids, and my career which supported them.  That her in my life as the real me was totally up to her, accept me or don‚Äôt be in my life.  

She eventually came around.  

Be strong, don‚Äôt let negative people in your life bring you down.
Being the transitioning half of my marriage, I don‚Äôt have any direct experience that can help you. But, my mother-in-law was initially extremely hostile to my change as well. Her ignorance and internalized transphobia led her to tell me that I, personally, was the cause of the ‚Äúcollapse‚Äù of American society. It put my wife under a lot of strain, but after a few failed attempts to educate her mom she eventually felt like she (wife) had to cut her (MIL) out of our lives until such time as she (MIL) got with the program. No calls. No visits. No grandkid time. 

At the same time my wife leveraged her brother and father and uncle to mediate and try to bring her mom up to modern social standards. It took time, but eventually her mom found a progressive Christian pastor writing online devotionals that resonated with her and she accepted me and has reintegrated into our lives. 

The process was so hard on my wife, but she took that on for me and our children. The security I feel from her gives me so much strength to face my own challenges, I desperately hope she feels the same from me and I work hard to support her. 

Ultimately, parents are obligated to love and care for their children until they are able to assume legal culpability for their own actions. Children are NEVER obligated to love and care for their parents, so if you need to get some space from yours, it‚Äôs totally valid. I hope your mom can learn the truth about trans people and realize how amazing you are, but more importantly I hope you and your wife can continue to support each other forever!
Get married. Your mother can't compel you to testify against your own wife.
Hey there! So, I am very sorry your mom is acting like a lawyer and not a mother. There are a few ways to deal with narcisistic people. One of them is to give only the most essencial information and try to redirect the subject to something else. Keep supporting your wife and focusing on what you CAN do, and let your mother choose for herself. The more bigoted she acts, the less she will have your presente in her life. sad, but true.

Source: am a nonbinary person married to my transfem wife, and my transphobic relatives just don't have my presence in their life anymore.
Don't really know what to suggest other than explaining and time, but I just wanted say that my partner and I are currently going through this with their parents about me. Thankfully there mum has slowly got better, but she wanted to get my partner away from my 'influence' at first and they still haven't spoken to their dad since they told him about me and he went on a ballistic rant that included threatening to physically stop me using the appropriate bathroom if we were out together.

I'm tired of the debates about teens/youth transitioning	"I started T at 15 and had top surgery at 17. I consider myself very lucky, but I had to fight for it. I saw someone make a comment recently that they ""wouldn't let their 15-year-old self make decisions for their adult self,"" but if my 15-year-old self hadn't fought as hard as he did, I wouldn't be here today. Transitioning as a teen literally saved my life. 

I'm sick of this being a political debate. Withholding gender-affirming care from trans teens is withholding life-saving medical treatment. I don't want to hear shit about it from cis adults who have no idea what they're talking about."	"Fucking preach ‚ù§üñ§‚ù§
Yeah we're with you
Hey how do I get stuff like that? I'm exponentially becoming more and more suicidal and dysphoric but my parents won't even let me get a packer before 18, let alone anything else.
100% this
YES
They probably listen to Blair White.
Your 15-year-old self may have been a dumbass that would stick a fork into an electrical socket or get a penis tattooed on their throat, but my 15-year-old self had already contemplated suicide and experienced enough self-loathing and mental trauma to mature by at least a decade. We are not the same. Our life experiences shape our development.

Which is precisely why there are preteen children that are capable of caring for drug-addicted parents and baby siblings and managing bills and taxes, while there are also adults incapable of running a load of laundry or washing dishes still living in their parents‚Äô basements at 30. Age is not an equivalent measurement of maturity or intelligent decision making.
Do you have any other supportive adults in your life you can talk to? Unfortunately, I had to convince my parents in order to start transitioning. They supported my identity but didn't want me to medically transition at first. Maybe connecting with an adult like a therapist or a school counselor, or even another trans adult, could help mediate conversations with your parents around this stuff.
Please try to not feel suicidal. There must be many things still to cherish.
Oh they barely even support my identity, and my bio mom and stepdad have partial custody, and their hella Transphobic. Like terfy Transphobic. Even if my other 2 parents were fully supportive, it's still gonna be real hard legally and medically to get much help.
I mean, I don‚Äôt really think people who feel suicidal are choosing too. Yes, obviously we don‚Äôt want them to die, so saying you support them and they‚Äôre valid is good, but like, I think that‚Äôs like asking a person with depression to try be less depressed. It just doesn‚Äôt work like that.

edit: forgot a word

I'm sorry you're in this situation. Without support from family members, it's much harder to get access to gender-affirming care. Would it be an option for you to set up a virtual visit with Planned Parenthood or a gender clinic and talk through what their requirements are and if they might be able to support you? 

I've also heard of some young people getting emancipated in order to access HRT, which is no easy process, but maybe something to look into.
You are right, and no, I don't want to die, at least the part of me that is in control most of the time. I feel like I'm split into ""good"" and ""bad"", the "" good"" is the me I know best and understand, it has rational thoughts. The ""bad"" is transphobic, sexist, racist, homophobic, and every other kind of discriminatory and disgusting in the book. It's like having to share a body with a homicidal, suicidal psychopath, who is also my worst enemy and has all the qualities I don't like.
I'm 14. Need to be 16 or 17 to be emancipated. 

How do I do a virtual visit without a microphone? I can't make much noise or my parents will find out. I am willing to give that a shot though.
I‚Äôm not sure that you have this, but on the off chance this suggestion helps I might as well ask, but have you heard about disassociative personality conditions? I don‚Äôt remember the exact name, it was like oocd or ooc or something like that. But one person I saw talk about it on r/bigender was  saying  how  they  have  a  host  body  and  then  there  is  their  personality  or  other  personalities  that  share  the  same  living  space.  Again,  i  dont  really  know  much  about  it ,  but  maybe  it  would  be  something  interesting  for  you  to  research  because  maybe  you  relate  to  it!

I‚Äôm definitely not an expert, and still new on my own gender discovery journey, but if you feel like you want to reach out or keep talking or want another redditor friend don‚Äôt hesitate to reach out!
Do you have a cell phone you can call on? Could you go out for a walk and sit at a park while talking to them? I'm not totally sure what options there are for the clinics near you, but you could also look on their website to see if there's a contact form or email address for questions.
But whenever I talk about that irl I get punished by my parents for being ""crazy"",. So I'm fine and all of what I said is definitely false, because if it were true I'm crazy. 

Yes I probably do have something like that, but I already have Asperger's Syndrome (autism) Major Depression, and Anxiety diagnosed, I don't want anymore things known to be "" wrong"" with me. My parents aren't very nice."	y03qh5	trans	98	0.98	2022-10-10 02:59:43
Update: I told my wife and now I don't know what to do	"I originally posted about a month ago here: [https://www.reddit.com/r/trans/comments/syxp8y/i\_told\_my\_wife\_and\_now\_i\_dont\_know\_what\_to\_do](https://www.reddit.com/r/trans/comments/syxp8y/i_told_my_wife_and_now_i_dont_know_what_to_do)

What an incredible month. I am not posting from my throwaway account because I have accepted myself and am ""out"" to everyone that I care about. My wife and I are communicating daily about our feelings and processing the changes. She has encouraged me and given me the strength to accept myself and begin transitioning. I know she has a long way to go with her own processing and what it will mean for us long term, but we are taking it a step at a time.

In terms of coming out to people, it was overall an incredibly positive experience. There are some exceptions. My good friends accepted me immediately and constantly check-in to see how I am feeling and how I am doing. My sister has been an incredible advocate and has been nothing but encouraging. My father is very analytical and is coming from a loving place. He has lots of questions but supports me absolutely. He has also set the bar for the most inappropriate questions, but I do not fault him for that. My mom has a lot of guilt for how she treated me in my youth over this and a lot of current concerns. I am hoping she comes around.

My wife's family has been challenging. My brother-in-law and his husband have been incredible. My father-in-law is just concerned about his daughter and grandchild. However, he is supportive of our family and what this is going to mean. My mother-in-law and sister-in-law are processing and just need time. I am hoping that everyone does come together because I love both my family and my wife's family.

Work has been....interesting. I am a founder in a small tech company and all of my direct reports are incredible. My business partner is fairly conservative but supportive in his own way. It is the best I can ask for. I am not fully ""out"" to the whole company but that will be something that happens with time.

I have been working with my therapist on self-acceptance and some of my own internalized transphobia. I have hidden myself for so long, it really feels hard to truly accept myself and express it. She has given me homework to express my more feminine side publicly to ease myself into it and I feel like its going really well. 

I have my first appointment with Plume this afternoon and I am incredibly excited. For so long, I never thought a day like this would come and here it is. Early on, I was afraid that this was just a dream and that I would be thrown right back into hiding. I don't have to do that anymore. I plan to be more active in this community and give the same support everyone provided me when I originally made my post. I love this community and the positivity it provides!"	"Aw, congrats OP. That sounds like such a hopefull start. Good luck going forward. :-)
Congratulations on your appointment today!  

I‚Äôm on my 4th month of HRT and am ~40.  It‚Äôs an adventure to say the least.
Congrats. I am super excited for you. I also have been with Plume for over a year now. They are great and I recoment them to every trans person I meet. Your family will have to come around. It will be weird at first (more for them than for you) but eventually they settle in. I wish you the best and good luck sis. In regards to you not knowing what to do, just keep doing what your doing. You seam to have a good head on your shoulders and your therapist knows what they are doing. Trust yourself and be yourself. It's a long and slow process, but you will love every second of it. Trust me. A few months from now when you look in the mirror you will love who you have become. I know I did.
Hey that‚Äôs great!  Congratulations on coming out and receiving such support.  

Stay strong sister
What an easy process Plume was! I already have my prescription and my provider was absolutely wonderful."	tkrkj1	trans	102	0.96	2022-03-23 11:15:08
I refused to give my Instagram to a nice guy	"I felt like a jerk. He is a really nice person, funny, caring and all that, but when he asked for my Instagram to keep in contact I flat out said no, because I have transition pictures and he doesn't know I'm trans (and I still haven't ""investigated"" if he's accepting or not), but I also don't want to delete those pictures because they are milestones and I'm proud of them. He looked crestfallen and I tried to build a lame excuse that I don't use it anymore, I don't think he bought it tho.

The life of being trans, am I right?"	"Say you don't have one next time; then you don't have to make up excuses for the No.
Too true. I am a little surprised you didn't hand over your phone number instead though.
In my opinion, let him know! Somewhere safe obvs... if you invest even more of your time into him and *then* find out he isn't cool, that'll suck way more than finding it out now.

But yeah, its shitty youre even in this situation in the first place. Good luck with it x
HAhAHA your not kidding i have transphobic parents i had to make a secret acount for everything
You should definitely let him know. Its part of who you are and if you‚Äôre wanting any form of actual relationship with him then it‚Äôs only right you share who you are. It‚Äôs not good to keep things, for when they come out later, it could be much worse whilst being honest could surprise you. If he‚Äôs as sweet as you say then definitely share and see if he‚Äôs worth your time
At the end I did, but he still looked like he didn't get what he really wanted
You too? :/

Gentle reminder	"Reposted from Tumblr 

Gentle reminder here that there are elder queers out there. Real elders, people in their 80s and 90s who survived, who are here. You can get there, old age does exist for us. 

I know an old lesbian couple who have been married since the moment they legalized it. One woman can hardly walk anymore but she loves Hallmark ornaments, so her wife supports her against her walker during Christmas so she can look at them more easily. 

I know a transgender man who started transitioning only 10 years ago at 60, and he's brilliant and funny and brings his grandchildren by to get sweets.

I know an asexual woman who, beamed and told me she absolutely loved not having a husband, and that she ""never once regretted not getting married. I never felt that way about anybody! Why force it?"" She lives with her parrot and loves salsa dancing. 

Our elders exist. So many of us have been wiped out and erased on purpose, but we're here. And that means you can get there. When you're old and grey, when you're retired and done, there will be people who will love you and will care for you."	"Jeez, if they can transition at 60 then all us young punks can work through it too. I‚Äôm only 33 and I constantly worry when I start that I won‚Äôt pass and such. 

Life is tough as is for most but it‚Äôs the only one we got. You gotta make the best of it and do your best to find what makes you happy.
We just need to get there. And how different the world wil be by then.

"Dad said he ""would probably disown me if I transition."""	"I Had a long conversation with my mom about transitioning and getting on hormones and it basically ended with her saying, I don't really get it, but I will always love you. We talked for a while more about How my dad would react and if I should tell him I'm getting on HRT. the consensus was no, for context, about a year and a half ago I started painting my nails and he shut that down. he asked if I wanted to go see the new resident evil movie with him. he told my mom to take my sisters on a girl's night out. it was all just a ruse so that he could bully me without anyone to stop him. when my mom got back, He got so angry that he yelled at me, said I hoped I felt stupid, called me slurs, and then went outside with an axe, and chopped up a spare dresser we had on the porch. Hes very imbalanced, and honestly, he can be very scary.

I thought fuck this I'm tired of hiding, and I said:

""Dad we need to talk, I know you don't support me, but despite what you've said in the past, I love you. this has really been bugging me and I don't want to lose you. I'm eventually going to get on hormones and transition. And I'm scared I'm going to lose my dad. I just need to ask, are you going to disown me?"" 

he said:

""You know how I feel. and that's another thing, you're 19, you don't know shit about the real world, you don't know anything, I think this is stupid.""

I said:

""that's not a no, I asked if You'd disown me.""

he said:

""I don't know what I'd do.""

I just said okay and walked away. later on, he was yelling at my mom about it, and he said:

""This is so fucking stupid; he can do whatever the fuck he wants to do. Why do I have to talk about it? it's wrong, it is not right, and I have a right to that belief. honestly if he does transition, I probably would disown him. what would my dad think?""

I don't know what emotion I'm feeling right now. the best way to describe it would be a lack of emotions. I just don't care anymore; I feel completely and utterly broken.

As far as I'm concerned, I'm disowning him. I'm sorry for the rant, but I really have nowhere else to put it, or anyone else to talk to. I have no friends, and I don't want to talk to my mom anymore, so my dad won't be abusive to her. 

I just feel so alone."	"Tbh I‚Äôm getting abuse red flags from your dad and that‚Äôs putting it lightly. 

Screw him. You‚Äôre better off without. I cut my parents out years ago for reasons unrelated to my transition, but they were similar to your father. Very conservative and abusive. It hurt at first but the freedom is well worth the pain. 

You don‚Äôt deserve to live in anyone‚Äôs shadow, or in fear of what anyone will do when they get angry.
Years ago, when I was trying to figure out how to come out to my parents, a cousin of mine came out as transgender.

My dad was talking to me about it, and said he didn't know what to do, or how to treat her. So I asked him ""Well, what would you do if one of your own kids came out as trans?""

And he answered that he would disown them (because they would be ""living in sin"") unless they agreed to commit themselves to conversion therapy. And it got worse from there.

So I decided not to come out to him at that time. At least I learned what to expect though.
Your dad seems like a fuckin monster. But at least your moms a good one.
Hey, we are here, there is also a wonderful community of supportive individuals under Willow. A trans educational twitch streamer. 

I doubt your dad would read this but your mom might so here is this,  it helped me explain a lot of things to myself and others.

https://genderdysphoria.fyi/en
Do what you have to do for you. You have your whole life ahead of you. Your mom will be ok. She loves you & wants you happy. Your father needs help. He refuses it just like mine. Carry your own weight, & move on to your best abilities. I support you & am here if you need a shoulder to lean on. You got this! You're not alone. Reaching out is a big step towards help or anything for that matter. I love you & am glad you're ok.
I understand you; my father is a monster too, he hate homosexual and trans, outlander and other religions too.

Two years ago he banned üö´ my bother, only cus he wear ear's ring (he isn't trans or gay) and when my bothysaid he want a tattoo, my father blow up.

I fear that he could kill me if I come out (not exaggerating)
Disown dad
I‚Äôve said it before and I‚Äôll probably have to say it again, I‚Äôm about one very bad day from becoming an overly flamboyant super‚Äùvillain‚Äù who runs around finding and beating the shit out of ‚Äúpeople‚Äù like your dad. On a more serious note, if his past actions towards you are similar to what this post makes me suspect, then you might be able to sue him once you‚Äôre independent depending on what country you live in and if you‚Äôve reported this stuff to social services. It can‚Äôt undo this shit, but it can help pay for therapy, HRT, and other stuff to help mitigate the lasting impacts of a situation like this.

Throughout my childhood my father emotionally abused us, even after my mom divorced him. He‚Äôs really mellowed out in his old age and we even agree politically now (while he used to be a hardcore conservative) 

I found out a few years ago that he had actually physically abused my mother as well and that she‚Äôd never told me because she didn‚Äôt want to poison my relationship with him. I completely cut him off and have vowed to never see him again. He doesn‚Äôt even know I‚Äôm trans, and he‚Äôs not going to. He doesn‚Äôt get to meet the real me. 

Ig my point is, people like this don‚Äôt deserve to know the real you. Those that do are LUCKY to be able to meet the real you, and if this pos doesn‚Äôt want to, he‚Äôs not worth a second more of your time thinking about him than you absolutely have to
Best case scenario: he keels over with a heart attack the next time he's busting up household furniture with an axe. 

I had a father like that. I waited until after he was dead to do any kind of real coming-out, for Reasons. 

Your mom should get out too. I wouldn't count on it that your absence makes her safer. He's going to do whateverthefuck he's going to do whether you're there or not. 

Here's how you do it, based in part on my personal experience. You go down to the local casino-hotel and get a gift card good for a weekend hotel stay. They have gift packages like that where it's like, 3 nights plus buffets and maybe a show for a couple hundred bucks. Maybe you ""won"" it in a drawing or you ""got it as a bonus from your boss"" and re-gifted it to him so it doesn't seem suspicious. Oops your mom has a schedule conflict and can't go along that weekend, maybe he makes a solo trip or brings a buddy along. While he's gone, you and your mom and a team of movers clear out the house of all your stuff, (you can leave his junk and his smashed furniture. Take the axe though.) Load it into a truck, and move at least two towns over to a new place. Don't forget to open new bank accounts without his name attached. Protect yourself, your family and your assets from that dangerous man. Your mom needs to contact a family lawyer. When your dad gets home from the casino, a process server can meet him at the door of an empty house to serve him with divorce papers and a restraining order. He doesn't need to know where any of you have gone, and at that point, all further communication re: dissolution will be between the lawyers.
I'm 4 days into recovering from having to cut out my transphobic gamete donors from my life. It hasn't gotten easier but I know it will. There's nobody else for me to come out to and everyone else is supportive. Losing parents is hard regardless of the circumstances.
I know you don't want to lose him, but don't lose yourself in the way!

I had a similar situation though my dad seems a bit lighter. He once tried to bully me in a similar way and I honestly got in shock and was living in auto-mode for around one month, then came back to my senses.

What worked for me was thinking that even if he doesn't want to support me then I can support myself and try my best to find that spot while I can. He doesn't want to support me nor allow me to wear feminine clothes nor do my nails, but he was giving me a roof and food. Well then, malicious compliance kicks in and while he was sheltering me then I'd plan how to get away ASAP. I got a nice opportunity in another state (I'm in Mexico), and took it; now, I'm finally starting HRT and living on my own.

I miss him, really, and in some way I miss my aunts, grandparents, uncles, cousins and so. But the current situation is that my grandmother is sick and she somehow gets sicker when she sees something weird for her or that she dislikes. So I cannot go, and my dad is an alcoholic who recently fell back for a week into it then recovered. I want to get him therapy but he probably wouldn't take it, and my grandmother medical insurance as well but idk if it's possible once I finish this internship. But I cannot simply go back, because it's awful living there!

So right now, my whole focus is my career and making it go from internship to full time, then focus on my health and subscribe my dad, mom, and grandmother if able as co-dependents in medical insurance. Then, I'll visit them and I'll have a way out if things go awry. 

I feel for you, it's awful having to detach yourself from your close ones, but you can't really change their minds if they don't want to! You can give them opportunities, but beware cuz you also need strength in case they try to use it against you or they reject them. Best of luck and tons of hugs, I'm sure you're going to find a way!
Honestly, I wouldn't start medically transitioning until you are safely not living there. As pretty much everyone here has said, your dad has no clue what he is talking about and is dangerous. If you have the means to move out, please do so. If not, please be careful. Do you have relatives or close friends you can go to if things get scary?
Time to find a real dad.  Not him.
Hugs. I‚Äôm sorry this is happening to you. You need support right now, not dysfunctional parents projecting their feelings on you. However, parents also have feelings and he might be struggling with this and he obviously doesn‚Äôt have the skills to handle it. He seems unstable. Try to keep getting your education so you can become independent and do not depend on your parents forever. It will take time, but everything is easier with an education and money. Go to therapy if you can, and move forward with your transition, if you feel like it. Xo
Dad doesn‚Äôt really love you then. And i doubt he ever loved you. If he did he‚Äôd be ok with it. Love for your child is what you should keep unless the child actively abuses you and shit in the future. You just wanna transition. Your dad is planning on throwing you away just for being uncomfortable with ur body

He doesn‚Äôt deserve a child
I know he‚Äôs abusive. I didn‚Äôt for so long and then one day it was just like ‚Äúoh, I‚Äôm being abused‚Äù.

I can‚Äôt wait to leave but I‚Äôm also scared to leave my mother and sisters with him. I may be trans  but I still have the body of a man right now and idk I feel some kind of comfort in being between him and them.
It's not a red flag there's just abuse happening, like we're entirely past the red flag stage and into the ""taking violence out on inanimate objects instead of people"" stage.
yeah, I don't know what Id do without her. she may not understand it, but I don't expect her to. she was raised a Jehovah's witness, so I can understand why its hard for her. but that's never once stopped her from supporting me, because she knows it will make me happy. dad was also raised a Jehovah's witness, I think he turned out different because in that religion women are seen as subservient, and I don't think Hes really had anyone, of any gender or sex, buck up to him. Hes also fucking stupid, and to a degree I legitimately don't think he understands how hurtful some of the things he says are. for instance I asked him if he even knew what the F slur meant when he called me that one time, he said ""yeah its a cigarette"" and I told him what it actually meant, and he hasn't called me that since. so I think part of it is his blatant transphobia and homophobia, and the rest is just how incredibly ignorant he is. that's not to humanize him it all. he is a POS, and a cop, which also explains a lot.
I actually forgot that existed, I'll give her the linkü§ç
Yeah, my parents kinda went batshit crazy when I got my ears pierced at the age of 50, yeah fifty! They blamed my wife for 'allowing this nonsense'. My daughter was around 15-16yo at the time, and she went postal on their asses üòÜüòÇ. Started HRT on the first of this month, my wife and kids support me, but once changes are apparent, I will have to ask my parents not to visit us, but keep the relationship long distance ü•∫
He‚Äôs scary sometimes.
I find it ironic that he mellowed out politically, because I guarantee he pulled the ""it's just because you're a kid, once you have work experience you'll agree with me"" bs at least once.
That would be the dream.
Honey, it really seems like you‚Äôre the one in danger here. Abuse situations are hard, but that‚Äôs a save money and get out kind of signal. You won‚Äôt be able to save them.
And probably getting up to half a step away from dropping the ""inanimate objects"" part at that. OP, stay safe. You may, as you said elsewhere, still have a masculine body, but you will be the primary target if this continues to escalate. His insistence on having your mom and sisters leave on the night he decided to really start bullying you reads to me as he's not likely to lash out at them unless they get in his way or try to defend you... I am not an expert though, and you know better than us what your situation is. Just remember, in a plane crash you have to put your own breathing mask on before you can help anyone else, so get out and get safe, and then worry about helping your family üíú
I intentionally undersold it yes
Hes another example of acab it seems
I am just glad to be helpful. Good luck, hope we mhr see an update that things have improved at least between you and your mother.
Aaand... What will happen when they want visit their granddaughter?

It's more achievable than you realize right now. He has spent years pounding it into your head that you don't have free agency. You may require some de-programming, that shit is toxic in ways that you can't even see from inside the pit but once you get out and get some therapy and perspective you're going to reminisce on this time and go ""Holy shit, THAT was fucked up! I thought it was normal at the time though!"" Whatever y'all do, please survive him. I promise it gets better. <3
I agree. It‚Äôs your mom and sisters choice to get out and get safe from him. You can‚Äôt make it for them. And you being there doesn‚Äôt guarantee their safety either.
Oh. I thought you were being sarcastic. Why even comment :/

I'm absolutely lost	"Had to make an alt to talk about this because I didn't feel comfortable doing so on my main.

I'm 17, MtF, and just came back from a psychiatrist appointment. I've been using my psychiatrist to try and get an endocrinologist appointment (which I am trying to use to get myself an endocrinologist appointment for HTR) I had one for December 9th of last year but it was cancelled, and since our country has very poor trans healthcare services (Portugal) he was only able to get me an appointment about sexual identification so that I could try and have them move me to an endocrinologist...

No problem, I guess, stuff takes time and I'll take what I can get. But on my way home I had ANOTHER fight with my mother over my gender (they are frequent) she says she doesn't believe I'm trans, that my personality and who I am as a person aren't normal for a girl so I can't be trans?? That I haven't been taking the best care with my body, which isn't a female trait so I can't be trains?? She even said that she didn't care if my doctor told her if I'm trans because I'm smart enough to fake the test results so they'll say that I am trans!! I'm so fucking lost, she said she might not take me to my next appointment (I can't go there myself, it's hours away), she also said she won't help me with any sort of medication or treatments I might need.

What do I do? I'm 17, 11th grade, I want to go to university but if I do I won't be able to get money to pay for my treatments, even if I don't go to university how long will it take until I'm able to start doing what I need.

There's also my boyfriend.. in Australia, who I'm supposed to move with, but how can I get the money for that and all of these things? If I want to go to university I have to do it here in Portugal so it'll delay my transition even more, meeting him in person, and I'm not sure that either my mental state or our relationship will be able to hold that long.

Also to clarify I'm only out to a few friends and some family members, not to everyone around me, and I still dress and go out in boy mode every time. My father doesn't know because he's an old man and extremely transphobic so I don't want to deal with his reaction..

TLDR; I'm just lost, no idea what to do, where to go or how to make my life work out.. things are looking really dark"	"Not looking after your body is very common. I  have never had the best hygiene, because. . . . i felt disconnected. This was just some flesh lump i was chained to, sure i need to keep it running but why bother trying to look good or nice?  Now i‚Äôve realized it, im taking steps to look nice because i realize i can finally look how i want. 

I would consider- are you able to be yourself in university? Many universities are more open and accepting, so thats a possibility. I would also say that its easier to move countries by going to college in that country- perhaps you can start in portugal, and then transfer to an australian university?
If it weren't so important, her saying that you're not looking after your male body says you aren't female would be funny. 

The sad truth is that some parents can never be persuaded even with incontrovertible proof. They don't want to hear it. 

I don't know the Portuguese healthcare system, so I can only make guesses about what you might do. One possibility would be to try and get your next appointment on-line, as I would imagine that it's not till you get to the medication stage that they would need to take blood and the like. Otherwise you might need to wait for financial independence first. Sorry.
I'll say


1: Get things right with your mom. People don't know what being trans is invite her to talk to the therapist if he/she is down or just sit down and talk her into it. Make a good presentation about your feelings she for what you say may agree.



2: Therapy, University or boyfriend? I don't know. My feeling says that therapy should come first, then university but this on you to decide what's your priority in life



I wish you best of luck i feel you aren't in the worst position your mom sounds uninformed not transmophobic wich is great im sure you can work this out



*Virtual hug*
You might look into taking loans for university if you can. Way easier to get loans for education than any sort of financial help for trans stuff.

In fact, education loans are some of like the easiest loans to get - you aren't expected to have some good credit score or financial history, you are expected to be young and inexperienced and have like no income, and they are a pretty worthwhile investment on the other side because either the country is investing in its citizens and GDP, or a financial institution is making a long term investment with lots of money that is almost guaranteed to end up with a debtor who makes more money after. It's like a business loan where the business almost always succeeds. I'm not sure if it fucks things up with you going to another country, it very well might, but I'd see if there are ANY options for educational loans. Then you get both.

But maybe there is also services for trans people to help you out. I wish I could give you some examples but I haven't looked into this.

I'd do your research and see how you can get both things independently rather than pick between this good thing in your future versus this other good thing in your future.
Thank you very much! I don't know how and if I can transfer to a different university but I will try and get informed by asking at my school.
Thank you very much for the kind words, sadly no matter how many times I try to explain it to her she just won't accept it, she does act like she known about this sort of stuff, but I can tell her information is coming from incorrect sources.. won't believe me when I show her the proper information either though

First Halloween as me!! Did anyone else just not care about Halloween before transitioning??		"Yeah, didn't care about Halloween at all really these last 12 years, but I have a costume this year. I can't wait to show it off to my boyfriend
Haaaa, I know exactly where you got that cause I've worn it too. Made me feel pretty, and I hope you feel the same because it looks great on you. I hope you have a happy halloween
Gorgeous!! I‚Äôm ftm and going as a witch for Halloween! I‚Äôve always cared about it but now I‚Äôm much more comfortable dressing up now
Same here (ftm)
Halloween was the only time I could ever go out as ""myself"".  I stopped after a friend, thinking he was funny (and that I wouldn't care because it was a ""costume"") that I made a ""seriously ugly woman"".

You look amazing... I love everything about that look, especially how happy you look!
yes!!  even when I did dress up before I would be so indecisive and cagey about actually dressing up. but this year it's just like. I'm a witch!
The last time I dressed up as anything was high school, I dressed up using the discount Santa outfit I got from Christmas. Minimum effort and care. This year I got a whole outfit planned. Cute, purple haired cat girl :)"	qip5qn	trans	84	0.98	2021-10-29 23:34:14
My father can't look me in the eyes. It hurts	"My father, even though he has a very conservative view he's one of those people who would love their children unconditionally (supposedly). He has been making a huge effort to broathen his perspective over the last few years but transphobia still remains (in our society that's all he's been exposed, so it's normal he developes this point of view).

After months of huge conversations where I described what I was going through without saying the name, he always gave me lots of support and motivation and he always understood best what I was struggling with (""do what you think it's best, even if it's a radical change, even if no one else agrees, do it for you, we'll always be here for you and will always love you no matter what it is"").

Last month I came out to him and told him what it was really about (just tyat what I was going through is gender dysphoria and that I'm trans and need to transition, I didn't even ask for different name (as I don't have one yet, annoyingly) nor for different pronouns yet). As expected he was shocked, confused and worried that I may be influenced by others/internet, that I may regret it, yada yada... All within expectations.

But today I came back to visit my parents and now he doesn't look me in the eyes, barely speeks to me and there is so much coldness and distance when he does speak to me. It hurts so much, I never in my whole life expected to feel this from him. I expected much confusion from him but never this. All the love and support gone just like that. My mother says he cares and loves me but I don't feel any of that, mostly I feel a bit of shame comming from him. I don't know what to do... Feeling all this from someone I, since birth, always ' knew' would have my back no matter what hurts so goddam much...

TLDR: My father always loved me and supported me matter if he didn't see eye to eye, but ever since comming out he can't look me in the eye, barely talks to me and I feel distance, cold and shame comming from him and it hurts and idk how to deal with this"	"Maybe he needs time. I feel my father may react the same way, but eventually, he will adjust. I think they need to see that this is the new normal and that it doesn't change how you feel for each other. You are a family, now you have to race on the streats to gain your honor (? *Plays fast and furious theme*
Sadly, I feel like I got a similar reaction from my father. I remember coming out to him and he said that he ‚Äúcouldn‚Äôt be happy about it but I still love and support you,‚Äù and now the only time he texts me is to judge me on my spending habits (I am a college dependent and my father is my benefactor for it so he pays for everything). 

Honestly my father often makes me feel as if I‚Äôm just a disappointment to him. It‚Äôs depressing.
Im so sorry :( my parents are the same way, and it can be very painful. Took my father almost a year to start acting normal again. I still get deadnamed even though I try to correct them, but I am still very much myself in front of them. Its helps having siblings who are supportive. I've even caught my mother using my correct pronouns and name subconsciously during some conversations so maybe theyre coming around..? who knows. Point is be you, be proud of yourself, and be happy. Surround yourself with loving and supportive people. Everything will get easier with time ‚ô°
Transphobic men stare at the floor a lot in our presence and I think it‚Äôs a lot to do with them being afraid of staring, fear of finding us attractive and ‚Äúturning them gay‚Äù. Your dad‚Äôs behavior may be more about him than about you.
As long as it takes us to come out it‚Äôs take other just as long to adjust and come to terms with it. There‚Äôs a loss for them .. it‚Äôs hard but true
Thanks, I know he needs time and was always aware of it I just didn't expect this reaction

>You are a family, now you have to race on the streats to gain your honor (? Plays fast and furious theme

""Nothing is stronger than family"" *smiles in Vin Diesel* (sorry couldn't help it üòÖ)
Tbh I'm already the disappointment of my family, thanks to several depressions and probably dysphoria before I was conscious I ended up not able to finish college and now that my younger brother finished it it was the last nail in their perspective. As if I'm not worth it anymore and they shifted focous to my brother. So I'm used to it already, but I didn't think it could get worse.... It did...
It hurts to see myself almost as a stranger in my father's eyes. I do hope it gets better... Thank you ‚ù§Ô∏è
I've still to come out to my family, and when i do, i think i will get the same reaction, i hope not. But i have been changing my clothing, painting my nails and he has given me the looks of ""haha, what is this? Okay, but you are ridiculous... boys these days..."".

3 years HRT, from a 36 yo 300lbs sad man to a 40yo slim goth goddess. AMA.	"Hi everyone!

Like a LOT of trans girls, I've become a LOT less active in this sub after my first few years. For me, it was true what they said - Being transgender becomes less of a 'thing' the longer you are in transition. Of course, your mileage may vary (ymmv). 

When I was first transitioning, it was super helpful to be able to ask other trans girls about their process. I'll tell you a little about my story and then list the surgeries and meds I've been on. 

My egg didn't crack until I was 36. It took me about a year of therapy to really come to terms with being transgender. I've always been queer (pansexual), but never really figured out that my sexuality was not actually the root of my 'queerness' but my gender was. I never identified with the whole 'I feel like a woman on the inside' thing. I just felt wrong, constantly. Like a lot of trans girls, my egg cracked because I dressed 'in drag' for a party once and it threw my life into a tailspin. My relationship almost didn't survive, I went through extreme bouts of gender euphoria and dysphoria, depression, anxiety, closing myself off to the world, and so on. If you look in the pictures below, the picture in the top right was me the night before I decided to start HRT. I tried sending a selfie to my partner and couldn't even smile anymore. I felt and looked old and tired. The very next day I contacted a local doctor and made an appointment. I've been on HRT now for 3 years and 1 month. 

While I lost some weight before then, I always struggled to keep it off. I had weird invasive thoughts my whole life like, 'If I were a woman, I would DEFINITELy want to be hot and care about shit like exercise'. At my biggest, I was 300 lbs, pre-diabetic and had high blood pressure. I lost a lot of it by going vegan but I still bottomed out around 220. It wasn't until I transitioned that I hit my goal weight of under 170 (fluctuates by about 3lbs a week from 167 - 170). 

Transitioning socially was a VERY hard process. I came out to my hyper-religious southern family (Jehova's Witness), my partner (now fiancee), her family, my coworkers, etc. I live in a red state that is VERY religious and worked in a predominantly Mormon company and city. I stood out like a sore thumb throughout the entire process. Literally, anywhere I went, people knew who I was. Still, I felt better in my brain than I ever had, which motivated me to get my body right. 

I'm now thin, attractive (by my standards of myself), happy AF, a raging lesbian homo, and not a day goes by that I don't love myself and my life. Sure, I still struggle sometimes, but instead of fighting a tidal wave of misery, I'm just fighting run-of-the-mill 2020 crap (now 2021). Being trans is no longer 'a thing' in my life. I give talks to large tech communities about my experience to educate others. I quit my job and am going to school full-time for something I love vs something I had to do. My struggles are now more 'woman' related than 'trans' related. My family has accepted me with time and while my partner and I broke up twice during my transition, we are now engaged. If there's hope for a 300 lbs Jehova's Witness son of an immigrant raised in poverty, there's hope for you!

Now for some quick facts. 

**Stuff they don't teach you at Trans School**

* Being pretty is awesome, but comes with it's own dangers. Like guys following me in their cars aggressively hitting on me. 
* Gender discrimination is a real thing. My peers started interrupting me more, not taking my word at face value, etc. 
* Dysphoria lessens tremendously, but I still have bad days sometimes. They just aren't 'as bad'. 
* For me, when I fell in love with my body, I became obsessed with self-expression. I have 6 new tattoos and 3 new piercings since beginning my transition. No more geeky t-shirts and jeans for me!
* The confidence, holy cow! I was never a 'confident' person until now. Going through something SO HARD tempers you. 
* Sex is way better....but also more difficult. 
* It's worth it. It's so so so worth it. 
* I didn't really start 'passing' completely until my voice surgery and my hair was out to my shoulders.

**My timeline**

1. 1 year of talk therapy before starting HRT (age 36). 
2. 3 years of HRT (started at age 37). 
3.  5 Surgeries so far that insurance didn't cover (Will be 8 by the time I'm done):
   1. Tummy tuck at age 36 to try and get right with my body in order to NOT transition. Didn't work. About $14,000
   2. Breast augmentation - $7,000
   3. Brazillian Butt Lift #1 - $6,000
   4. Facial Feminization Surgery (FFS) - $38,000
      1. Brow Contour
      2. Chin Implant
      3. Rhinoplasty
      4. Lip lift
      5. Chin Lipo
   5. Vocal Feminization Surgery (VFS) - $7,000-ish

ASK ME LITERALLY ANYTHING. I'll leave this up for a week or so :)

Can i say this gives me hope! im 278ish pounds pre hrt. im out socially. but i was worried id look like a linebacker. im built similar to what you used to look like. thank you so much for posting this!
#Goals

Thank you for posting this. It gives me hope! I had the same look & style as the ‚Äòold you‚Äô üò¨ My egg cracked last year (3yrs later than yours!) & I don‚Äôt have a spare ¬£50k, but I hope I can still see a fraction of your results.
Thanks for sharing this! I‚Äôm in my 30s, too, but ftm (and still figuring out exactly what my gender is but on my way), and it is great to see someone in a similar age range transition so beautifully.  You look great, and I really appreciate reading your story, so thank you for sharing!

I guess I also don‚Äôt really relate to the ‚Äúive known since I was two‚Äù narrative, and I also started getting euphoria after doing drag, and getting more masc haircuts, etc.  And it‚Äôs sometimes still hard for me to consider that ‚Äúvalid‚Äù - I have a close friend who is a trans man that I haven‚Äôt talked to in a while (not for any bad reasons - just life), and honestly it scares me the most to consider talking to him about this because it feels like somehow I‚Äôm being rude to him?  I guess that‚Äôs imposter syndrome, I don‚Äôt know.

Anyway!  Thanks so much for sharing.  I relate to a lot of what you have said, and it eases my mind a little bit to see your journey.  I am still figuring myself out, but I‚Äôm leaning heavily in the presenting as a man direction, and seeing your transition is very inspiring!
Those surgery prices are very reasonable by USA standards... what part of the world did you get your surgeries done? Any complications?
Oh you are so beautiful. I‚Äôve just turned 30 and am finally coming to terms with my gender. I was worried it was too late but man you give me hope! How long did it take your hair to grow? Do you have any hacks for making it grow faster? 

Also I love your user name, strong DS9 vibes üññ
Congratulations on the success of your journey! I‚Äôm glad that you‚Äôre in a better place emotionally, and mentally üíúüíô
Congrats!

If you could pick just one surgery that did the greatest impact alone (as if a person only had the ability to get through one surgery, with cost being irrelevant), which one  would that be?

edit: at what point did you fell in love with your body?
girl just came here to say you look fucking great
Thank you!
No worries! It takes some work, but you'll get to your goals!! I honestly NEVER thought I would pass. Having a good set of friends and support system helped me get through the hard part. You've got this!
Thanks! Yea, my insurance didn't cover anything but from what I understand, a lot of the insurance companies are now covering gender-affirming surgeries which include FFS and breast augmentations. I just happened to work for a Mormon company which meant that no way in hell were they going to pay for an insurance that had anything to do with transgender rights.
No worries!!! All of my trans guy friends had really good results on T. I've noticed that they don't really spend as much time online as my trans girlfriends.
The VFS and FFS I had done in Boston with Dr Spiegel. I can't recommend him enough. Amazing work. The BBL and Breast augmentation as well as the tummy tuck I had done in Salt Lake City. Dr Warnock sees transgender patients and does a pretty good job.
Thank you!!! My hair is only about 6"" past my shoulders naturally. I put in extensions to get me through the next year of growth. Honestly, you just have to take your hormones and tough out the awkward stage. I hated wigs so I never learned how to wear them.
Thanks, doll <3
Oh gosh. That one is a hard one. It was either my face or my voice. While my face had the biggest impact on my self image, my voice had the biggest impact socially. It's not 100% to where I'd like it (especially over video), but IRL no one every clocks me anymore because of my voice. Yea, I just talked myself into it being my voice :) 

Falling in love with my body was a slow process. It took about 2 years on HRT to finally feel like I wasn't in the wrong body, but it wasn't a light switch. First, my brain stopped screaming at me that it was wrong after about 2 months on HRT. Then when my boobs started to come in, I began caring about my body. This drove me to work out more, eat right, etc. I could see in my head the body that I wanted. Then, I started to like my body over time. By the year 2 mark, I had my breast augmentation and then I LOVED my body."	lpy5nr	trans	79	0.96	2021-02-22 19:57:43
I cane out to my parents and now i feel weird (she/her)	"They were super accepting it was great and i am so lucky to have them. When they use my name and pronouns i feel happy. But i feel like im faking it. Like im tricking them into reffering to me like that and lke i dont deserve to be a woman yet because i havent done much to transition. I came out to my parents randomly at night through text so i could just get it over with and not get scared out of it but now i have so many doubts and i dont know what to do. It makes me happy and i want to just focus on that but its so scary and i cant tell if im faking it or not and i know that im not faking it cause thats not how faking it works but idk i just feel so weird about it. Any advice? Does that fear ever go away?

When i say i havent done much to transition i mean like nothing. I have a single skirt. I barely shave or take care of myself in general. Mainly cause of my mental health but idk. I dont have much dysphoria but it happens more and more. I just dont really know what to do

I want to go back in the closet. I want to just forget i was ever trans and just feel sorta hollow for ever and just drift through life and then thats it. I dont want to do this but i want to be happy and it gets harder and harder to be happy without people reffering to me like that and im scared i came out to early but i would feel like that forever because i dont do anything. I want to be a girl but its so much easier just to play a man 

Idk sorry im just venting but i just dont know what to do"	"Hey. You're valid.


We all feel like we are faking it at some point. But don't let that stop you from just being who you are.


You only have 1 skirt? So what? I had 2 when I came out, and only because I bought them together. Now I have more. Know why? Because now I allow myself to have more, to want more.


Just take it one step at a time, you got this
Yeah, the fear does eventually go away to my understanding, but it's very volatile depending on your current circumstance(s) when you're a baby trans (new to being trans). Keep in mind that cis people don't get these feelings. What you're experiencing is [imposter syndrome](https://genderdysphoria.fyi/en/impostor-syndrome), and I experience it too from time to time. It's also made harder to deal with the imposter syndrome because my parents are very unsupportive, too.

I'm in a similar boat when it comes to feeling hollow (it's called [disassociation or depersonalization](https://genderanalysis.net/depersonalization/)), and to my understanding it's basically a coping mechanism so we don't have to experience crushing dysphoria, so in a sense it is dysphoria (could be wrong on this as I haven't had much motivation to read into it ***because of it*** lmao).

I also totally get that it's easier to just play as a ""man"". But I also can't do that anymore. I've experienced the euphoria and happiness from being referred to by my new name and pronouns from friends, and there's no way that I can continue living as a ""man"".

I'm going to start HRT within the next half a year or so, and in all likelihood it'll get rid of or alleviate these problems for me. You might also want to look into HRT since your parents are supportive, and just see how it makes you feel from there. There's no permanent changes that are made immediately, so you get time to decide for yourself.
You can go back in the closet, but those thoughts will never go away, ever!  I put myself in the closet over and over for various reasons, none of which were good in hindsight.  And now I'm transitioning at age 48.  I'm certainly very happy now, but wish I had been in a better position to accept myself and transition much earlier.
I did the same today they were quite supportive. But I feel ""nervous"" for lack of better word. This is the post I needed. Just to confirm that I am not alone. Thank you so much. Not just to you but the commenters as well. I just really needed this post today. Upvote saved
Brene Brown calls this feeling a vulnerability hangover. 

The basic idea is that you found the courage to do this thing that you‚Äôre internalizing shame about. Now that those courage chemicals are gone, you still have the internalized stuff, but now more people know about it!!!

Brown‚Äôs ideas are interesting. You may want to look up her stuff. She exploded onto the scene with a ted talk a while back. [YouTube link](https://youtu.be/iCvmsMzlF7o). 

This ties into the Jungian concept of the shadow as well. I would recommend that you find a **secular** gender-affirming therapist who can help you sort out your internalized stuff. 

Source: me. I have internalized stuff. The way you‚Äôre hurting breaks my heart. üè≥Ô∏è‚Äç‚ößÔ∏è‚ù§Ô∏è
It's perfectly fine to take every step of the way at your own pace. You can even tell your parents or anyone else you wish to open up to that you are trans and have these feelings but don't quite feel ready to transition or publicly come out yet, which is COMPLETELY VALID!

Presenting your identified gender outside your own home or even own room takes immense courage and it's understandable to know that you're trans while not wanting to take that step yet. An acquaintance of mine didn't come out until half a year into HRT when it became difficult to hide her chest.

Also know that while your depression is likely partly caused by dysphoria, that trans-identity and depression are 2 separate things and that coming out or transitioning will not necessarily ""cure"" the depression away. It's ok to work through it first, try to get better, learn to love yourself and then take the difficult steps towards transitioning afterwards because they become a whole lot easier when there's not a constant self-hatred gnawing at you.

And hey, I've never met anybody or heard from someone who was worried that they're faking anything and then it turns out they actually were. To fake something and stay unaware of it requires a huge amount of ignorance which you've already proven you don't have because you doubt and question your motivations. Your feelings are real and deserve to be heard and felt by you. Just because you feel like you could ignore them, doesn't mean they're not really there.
I really felt this, best of luck to you, hope you figure yourself out
You are valid. This seems like imposter syndrome. Also, from someone who tried to hide it and forget about it for an entire year and a half, it doesn‚Äôt work. It‚Äôs always a part of you. And you can‚Äôt forget that no matter how hard you try because it‚Äôs always there. But the imposter syndrome does get better.
Ugh I'm about to fully come out to my parents and I'm really scared of this.  It's good they are supportive. And just take your time. Everything will feel right in time.

My dad's side of the family say they love me, but I doubt it.	"Basically, I'm trans ftm and bisexual, an artist, leftist and alternative. They're really far right. 

I'm 16 going on 17 now. I came out when I was 13, at the time my parents had recently divorced and my mom took my side completely and has been doing everything in her power to support me and my transition. My dad, however, didn't accept me at all, even when 13 year old me told him I wanted to kill myself and that I couldn't keep living like that anymore. 

Eventually, he """"accepted"""" me. For those who had gone trought similar situations, you'll understand it perfectly. He and his family just swalloed my queerness like a sour pill. They don't support me, they almost don't even acknoledge that I'm queer, as if their precious little child couldn't possibly be ""one of them"". It's like I exist and they just accept that I'm there, but don't acknoledge it. Like a ghost. 

I live in Brazil, and our president is quite literally a copy of Trump, just a little dumber. My dad's side is very much his electors. 

They often say very mysognystic, racist, homophobic comments. Some things that they've said are really borderline neo nazi. However, they always insist that they love me a lot, as I'm kinda their favorite kid of the family. Yeah, they treat me with love and care, but... 

It just doesn't feel right. They don't actually love me. I put on a show for them and I restrain myself from talking back when they say their horrible shit. I love them, because I grew my whole life loving them and I wasn't aware of how bad people they are. It feels like my heart loves them but my mind doesn't. 

I have been in a tight spot of wanting to speak up and defend me and my rights but I fear that if I do, they won't love me anymore. I know this is a big stretch and I don't mean to compare my situation to this very serious illness, but It almost feels like stockholm syndrome. 

I know they're bad, they say hurtful things against me and people like me, but still I can't bring myself to stand up because I'm scared of losing their love. 

And the worst thing is that they do nothing to deserve my efforts. They often say passive agressive stuff towards me to try and get a reaction. I've spoken to them about how I don't like to talk about politics and stuff but they always HAVE to bring it but when I'm around. 

They don't love me. I'm all of the things that they are against. They love the little submissive kid that they have molded in their hands ever since I was born. 

It hurts me so much because our president often says very horrible things and they act like he's right. It makes me sick to my stomach because we live in a country who kills LGBT+ in a rampage. I'm scared, I have depression and anxiety and my life expectation is 35 years old. Yet they ignore this. How can they love me and yet agree with a person who is very much against my existence and my rights? I hate this so much, I wish they really loved me for who I am, I wish I could be free but still loved."	"Might want to add this, but they often crucify my mom, act like she's crazy and stuff, meanwhile my mom is the person who helps me the most and defends me with teeth and nails. When my dad didn't accept me I swear to god she was a breakdown away from beating his ass to the ground. 


So yeah... I think just this already says a lot about the people they are.
They will probably never hear to reason because their prejudice comes from beliefs and emotions.

They do love you, but they also hate you. They love you but despise the queer part of you and harm you because of it.

Humans are fucked up, they hurt a lot those who they love. The justifications vary from believing they do nothing wrong to thinking that the suffering they cause is necessary.

The sad truth is that they may never love who you truly are and will continue believing they are 100% right their whole life.
It certainly sounds like they don't accept you and your identity
Tenho certeza que voc√™ j√° chegou a essa conclus√£o, mas a melhor op√ß√£o, mesmo que v√° doer, √© cortar contato, a verdade √© que n√£o te amam, isso aconteceu comigo nos meus 17 anos, cortei contato com 20, meu pai amea√ßou se suicidar caso eu continuasse sendo uma mulher e minha v√≥ disse que me culparia pela morte dele, mesmo que sempre dizendo que me amam e me respeitam, usam meu nome morto ""sem querer"" e coisas do tipo, cortar contato foi a melhor decis√£o que fiz quanto a eles.
Anyone else sing ‚Äú16 going on 17‚Äù lol
There‚Äôs a famous quote about people being able to contain multitudes. I‚Äôm butchering it. In any case, my point is that it‚Äôs possible your family holds these contradictions simultaneously. For them it‚Äôs not so much ideology I‚Äôm guessing, it‚Äôs how authoritarian leaders appeal to people who want someone in charge to act powerful. They also see you as a real person, not an abstract ‚Äútransgender person‚Äù they don‚Äôt know. So they‚Äôre not putting you in that category. It‚Äôs entirely possible they love you, don‚Äôt understand you, vote for anti lgbtq leaders and don‚Äôt see how that‚Äôs messed up because they think of you as an individual separate from culture wars. I‚Äôd be hesitant to necessarily push that one depending on your situation, and probably wouldn‚Äôt want to openly discuss those things around them, but they love you, a version anyway.
Even though our country is bigoted as fuck there are still going to be people who support you<3 

Voc√™ consegue irm√£o <3
Yep, they really don't, they just tolerate it :/
Sinto muito pelo o que voc√™ passou, deve ter sido dif√≠cil tomar essa decis√£o, mas fico feliz que voc√™ se livrou desse peso. 
Pois √©, eu acho que quando eu sair pra faculdade ano que vem, devo cortar o contato com eles. 
Desde quando minha m√£e e meu se separaram, ela cortou o contato com eles completamente tamb√©m, fora das intera√ß√µes necess√°rias j√° que eles s√£o minha fam√≠lia tamb√©m, claro, e ela sempre me diz o quanto essa foi uma das melhores decis√µes que ela j√° fez. E √© verdade, desde ent√£o, minha m√£e j√° nem precisa mais tomar rem√©dios pra ansiedade, ela n√£o √© mais julgada o tempo todo e ela √© livre pra sair com os amigos dela, rir e se divertir, ela √© muito mais feliz agora. 

Minha irm√£ mais nova j√° cortou o contato com eles, e constantemente eles xingam ela, com aquele papo manipulador de que ela abandonou eles, que ela n√£o gosta mais deles e essas coisas de gente doida a√≠ KKKK
Mas esse deve ser meu destino tamb√©m, minha m√£e e minha irm√£ t√™m completa raz√£o de ter picado a mula dessa situa√ß√£o.
I wrote it singing too lmao
Yes, this is something I've got to think about when I have reflected about the situation sometimes. 
Of course, they don't agree with absolutely everything our president says, but they agree with the problematic things and when they don't, they still don't acknoledge that it's problematic. 

They do love me, just not how I wish they did, y'know. And while they don't see me as an abstract concept as you said, as I'm a person before anything else, but they refuse to acknoledge the things that make me myself. I am a person, a queer person. My community and my experience in society come from my queerness, and taking that away from me that's away a big part of my being, so that's why I get so upset. As you don't personally know them, you've never seen it, but they are very aware of the things they support, and have said some things that are so disgusting towards us that I prefer not to comment...

The Trans Rollercoaster	"Don't you get that feeling? Like one day everything is so perfect and euphoric, but then, the next day you stare into the void and just want to give up?

I have, a lot of times, and damn, is not good.

I've tried a lot of things to feel better, but the closet is too small to do anything, and still, the idea of ""I feel good, so, everything will be OK if I just come out"" makes me feel secure, but then you peak a little and the things you hear and see are so wrong that you fear for your life?

Why is it so wrong? Why is everyone so mad? Isn't supposed to be my life? 

You know, I know, we know.

This is hard, this is truly the hardest step in our life.

I just want to tell you that you are not alone. That I'm proud of you because I know how this feels. I don't care if you don't want to transition, or if you have doubts about to start your process, even if you are fully happy with your transition. 

I really don't care, because you're a human, just like me.

And as a little human in this huge world we call home, even if we are miles or continents away, I love you, and I want to hug you until we both cry, because you need it, because I need it, because we need each other. 

I understand that this ride is terrifying, but there is no reason to close our eyes and not enjoy the emotions it brings. Even if they make us feel happy, sad or even angry. 

Remember, 

I am here for you, 

We have each other.

And together, we stand and survive. üè≥Ô∏è‚Äç‚ößÔ∏è"	"I needed this ‚ù§Ô∏è
This has to be one of the best things I‚Äôve ever read and I desperately needed it. Well, I wasn‚Äôt planning on crying but here I am. Thank you for the beautiful thing this is üíï
Oh gosh yes I feel that. I started today crying, then later I felt so good about everything, and then at night I was back to crying again. I'm relatively early in transition I guess, hormones are definitely acting up, and it's been the hardest thing I've ever done. I want to hug you and cry too. Because without even saying anything, we're going through the same things.
Yes
Thanks. Yeah, this happens a lot
Well, that was inspiring. Thank you.
EXACTLY!! Some days are ‚ÄúWooo yes best boy life! ‚Äú and others ‚Äúwell another day of getting from morning to night‚Ä¶somehow‚Ä¶‚Äù

Thank you ‚ù§Ô∏è‚Äçü©πüôè
Thanks, I needed this too. Last few weeks have been tough all around, and it finally caught up to me this week. Two day long anxiety attack and my first real crying fit after 6 months of E. Some small part of my brain wanted to blame me being trans as adding one more layer of difficulty to life. Rollercoaster is exactly how I'd describe it. Better now thanks to support from my loved ones. Stick together guys gals and nb pals, we're in this together.

A Transgender's Texas Teacher	" 

By now I am pretty sure most of you have heard about what the hypocritical and cowardly governor of Texas has enacted for our state. And yes like most of you I am angry beyond measure as this is not an attack on me, but an attack on children whose only crime is attempting to be happy. Believe me I grew up in a world where it could have been dangerous to be any kind of non conforming and I did not come out till my 30's, even now as I am in the process of transition, I comfortably hide in the closet as long as I can.

But the more I think about what is going on I have to think why is this going on now why has this become his cause, because he is scared. Remember in the last election Texas came closer to being blue since I was a small kid. The blue strongholds, traditionally Dallas and Austin, are spreading. More and more democrats are moving into the state and they are gaining power. And if you actually look at the breakdown of party affiliation, dems outnumber republicans, as of the last census 39% rep 40% dem.   Granted the problems come in as all these dems are located in the same place.  g 

Every day for the last year I have had to drive by Trump protesters flying the confederate flag, flags with Trump's name plastered on them, and some other inane racist or sexist rant plastered on them. and every time this filled me with disgust and rage, then i realized what it actually means. they're scared.

Our hypocritical governor is scared, Cancun Cruz is scared, Rick Perry who, besides starting this new transgender issue, has been spending his free time from being our attorney genial fighting criminal charges, including stealing a very expensive pen, and those protesters are scared.

We have Bato running for Governor, who is our Bernie Sanders, except he's young. We have Matthew McConaughey running for governor, and I'm choosing to believe that's a good thing. Even among Republicans, Abbot is facing a serious threat from Huffines, who would make Abbot look like Kermit the Frog.

For the first time since the 90's Texas has a real chance of sending a Dem to the senate and Seating a Dem in Austin. All this abortion stuff and transgender B.S. and all of it, is them running scared.

Though it means that those children will suffer and that people will have real harm from these individuals' fear and that is not right. That shows that these people do not care about those they were elected to protect.

I can not speak for every single teacher in Texas but I know my classroom will always be a safe haven for those who wish to find themselves and I have never worked with a teacher who does not feel the same way. We learned about this during a math meeting today and the rage that us math nerds were able to raise was quite shocking.

It is going to be a long hard road for many people, but if people start fleeing the state the Reds win. If people keep hiding in the closet then the conservatives win. If people keep saying it will be ok in the end it won't be. Abbot can still win this one and that was his goal in this, but I think us Texas need to do what we do best.  Say screw you to someone pissing us off,  we don't complain we punch someone we don't are the descendants of the people American and Mexico kicked out.  

I have for some time now put off coming out at work while I transition. All this has shown me that I can not put this off any more. Over the next few weeks I will be publicly coming and in my personal life I will become the real me.   because it needs to be done.  If I can be a help for even one person I have been successful and that is what we all need to do.    We need to stand together with Democrats, people who think that one should not punish children because of their religious beliefs, we need to stand together and tell them we won't let this happen. 

Don't run from the state, make this state one people will run to.  

TL/DR 

Texas is in more trouble now than in a long time. It is not the time to run, it is the time to stand strong against Abbot and his ilk and we can do it together."	"I agree. We will never go away and they can try but they dont have the power to stop us, there will always be more trans people because being trans is not a choice. Being a shithole worthless human parasite is a choice tho. I will fight tooth and nail for myself and any trans person. All i want is love and peace but i will not back down from my identity ever, over my cold dead body
Never realised this but it makes so much sense now. They'll drive out democrats with their insane cruelty and stay in power. Thought they were evil for evils sake, but of course there's a reason. Thanks for this enlightening post
Fantastic, friend. I‚Äôve been livid all day. 

And Huffines has gone so far as to buy whole billboards just saying he‚Äôll ban transitioning for kids. I was shaking in my car when I drive past one."	t02dbf	trans	75	0.98	2022-02-24 05:00:05
Just got home from an operation	"I (30, nb) just got sent home after a total hysterectomy yesterday. It took two years to schedule the surgery and obtain all the paperwork (and land with good insurance). I was extremely terrified going in (worries about being misgendered or having les than optimal care) and was blown away by the bedside manners my team had. It was wonderful.

I live in a large metro area and my surgery had some teaching students with them which I agreed to.

Taking a lot of meds and resting. Whe  I started transitioning 8 years ago I never thought I could get/afford this procedure. Im totally over the moon. Id love to answer q's if anyone has them üòÅ

I don‚Äôt think my friend accepts I‚Äôm trans	"I‚Äôm FTM and have been out to my best friend for at least 3 years, and he has always acted like the fact I was trans just wasn‚Äôt really there. He‚Äôs truly the only one I‚Äôm out to irl because I‚Äôm scared of what others will think or do if this is how my BEST FRIEND is acting. 

When he first came out, he didn‚Äôt act much about it, didn‚Äôt talk about it, which was fine, I was still working things out. But now I‚Äôm in a space I can slowly transition, I‚Äôm able to cut my hair, I‚Äôve been getting piercings that‚Äôs help me with dysphoria (don‚Äôt ask me how but it helps), I‚Äôve been talking about getting a binder and mentioning one day I‚Äôm going to get top surgery and testosterone. He has not liked this. He hasn‚Äôt outwardly said it but he never uses the right pronouns (he always says he doesn‚Äôt know my pronouns so he uses they/them even though I‚Äôve told him I use he/him and it‚Äôs on every social media I have, he always said that they/them just ‚Äúsuit me better‚Äù). He never uses my preferred name, always my dead name or a nickname from my gamertag. I know I‚Äôm not out to everyone irl but I‚Äôm out to everyone online and they support me and they call me richard, what‚Äôs his problem that he can‚Äôt? 

I‚Äôve never been able to do anything to get ‚Äúahead of him‚Äù. He always has to be ahead of me. I can‚Äôt have friends to myself without him wanting to be friends with them as well. He didn‚Äôt care about getting his license until I got mine and all the sudden all he wanted to do was to get it. I can‚Äôt even be semi good at a video game without it suddenly being not fun anymore to him. I‚Äôm worried that this is what‚Äôs making us be driven apart and him not accept me as trans. I‚Äôm finally able to do something that make me happy and that makes me more comfortable, and I‚Äôve found that way to make me happy, and it‚Äôs going by he/him, and going by Richard. I think he‚Äôs just scared he‚Äôs not going to be the confident one anymore. He doesn‚Äôt like the idea of me also being happy and comfortable with myself because that puts us on par with each other."	"Yeah thats really not your Best friend i'm sorry mate but for your own good look for better Friends. Not everyone in the world thinks that way and I'm sure you'll find a new Best friend that supports You and is really a good friend. Best of lucks You got this!
sound very toxic your friendship. Sorry, but I think you should end this friendship, and move on.
Sounds like hes tryna smash and though your transition was a phase.
It sounds like he finds you to be emasculating and he‚Äôs trying to get ahead of it by emasculating you. It‚Äôs possible he was attracted to you prior to your coming out and doesn‚Äôt want you to transition because it would affect his attraction toward you (not your problem, obviously). Maybe he knows you‚Äôll be more confident present as male and won‚Äôt ‚Äúneed‚Äù him anymore. Your transition isn‚Äôt a challenge to his manhood, but from what you‚Äôve described it sound like he may see it that way. 

Friends, actual friends, empower and encourage us to do what makes us happy. Letting him go may help you in the long run
Time for this one to end
They dont
Protip: You are not obligated to share yourself - your time, your energy - with people who try to talk you out of being happy, who openly disrespect you, who make your accomplishments and relationships with other people a competition or measuring stick, who aren't comfortable with you having an identity or life outside of your relationship with them.   


Friends want you to be happy. Friends want you to live your best life. Friends lift you up.   


This guy doesn't sound like a friend. He sounds like someone you've spent a lot of time with and invested in emotionally because you've had fun with him over the years and been able to reach a point where you feel safe being vulnerable with him - but you need to recognize right now that there is an asymmetrical 'balance' at this point.   


Tell him, in no uncertain terms: ""I need to know that you understand that when I ask you to use he/him pronouns, and call me Richard, that it's a matter of me not suffering - it's about me being able to have a happier life, be myself, feel comfortable and confident. When you refuse to use the right pronouns or call me by the right name, what it tells me is that you care more about how you see me than my actual experience of life, or communicating to me that you care about me as a friend."" How he reacts to that kind of thing, however you phrase it, will reveal how he actually feels. A *friend* will apologize, and try hard to better. Someone you just happen to know who, likes having you as a convenient social support with all the benefits that friendship brings, will get defensive, critical, and blame *you* for having feelings and needs.   


If this ends up driving him away, it will be on him for being a transphobe - not on you for being a HUMAN.
[removed]
Before i answer let me say
Richard is a fu**ing amazing name you are a person of great taste
About your friendship .... End it...  He seems like a jealous person who cares more about himself then with you....
Goodness, I wouldn't wish that as a best friend to my worst enemies. Please, try to get some distance from him and cut the friendship.
Do you think maybe he likes you, and this makes him upset because it‚Äôs real and not going away
Have you tried talking to him as an adult? Not as a child.
I really felt a vibe he had some kind of attraction to OP too, and thats why he was acting the way he was. Could still be there and he's hoping he can somehow stop OPs transition so he can continue to pursue him.
\-ness gracious?
I don‚Äôt know. I mean he has a girlfriend, always says I‚Äôm annoying and all of that, gets pissed off at me a lot so I don‚Äôt know if he likes me, I doubt it
It‚Äôs happened to me a few times so I wouldn‚Äôt be at all surprised
Well someone else said it. It could be a few things. He could‚Äôve been into you, he could‚Äôve felt comfortable with feeling superior, or felt like he got to be strong and masculine, he also could be uncomfortable with lgbt, now you‚Äôre being yourself you‚Äôre happy, you‚Äôre getting out there. It can make people uncomfortable because they have to question their environment and biases. It happened to me
Thank you guys but I highly doubt he likes/liked me, he finds me so annoying and also has a girlfriend so I don‚Äôt think he likes me lmao
Sometimes when people are in denial of how they feel or just uncomfortable with their feelings, they will become very defensive toward the person and treat them poorly to push them away. It‚Äôs not healthy at all and doesn‚Äôt excuse his behavior either way"	tz1193	trans	66	0.94	2022-04-08 11:05:39
So Dad,	"You might have wondered why I‚Äôve been talking to you about trans issues a lot over the last year. I have a lot of reasons: because it‚Äôs a social change that will likely become normalized over the next decade, because it‚Äôs something I know a lot about and so can see how you‚Äôve been misguided about it, because there‚Äôs people I care about who‚Äôs effected by it. But more than all that, it‚Äôs because I love you. Maybe you‚Äôve had suspicions as to why I cared so much. Why I knew so much. So it‚Äôs time to tell you that I‚Äôm transgender myself. 


I spent a lot of time and energy really figuring this out, and while I did that I reached out to you. I thought, if I *am* trans, and I probably am, I would like to give you as good of a shot as I could to be prepared. To say things you won‚Äôt regret later. To process this more easily. But I couldn‚Äôt keep at it the way I wanted, and you said something that worried me last we spoke, that you were now intolerant of transgender people. Of me. Now I think I know what you meant, that you were tired of representation of people like me in the media, but still. Your sentiment changed from where we started. So I ended up telling mom first.


I wanted to tell the two of you together, actually. I didn‚Äôt think it was fair for one of you to know and not the other, but I didn‚Äôt want to do this alone anymore either. I hope you understand. There‚Äôs a lot of things I am uncertain of, but I am confident you love me no less for this. I don‚Äôt expect the worst from you. But there are some things I do worry about. And I need you to understand that going forward I will not be having a debate with you anymore about my existence and how I and people like me fit into it. I am happy to answer any questions you have and be as open as possible, but I‚Äôll be educating you, not debating you. I need you to trust me, and I would prefer if you didn‚Äôt assume too much either. 


I don‚Äôt expect you to be perfect. There isn‚Äôt any part of me that expects you or anyone to not make mistakes. And I will be as patient and as kind to you as I am able for the time being. I don‚Äôt want us to have issues, and I *want* you to learn about me. I understand it may be hard for you, but as long as you‚Äôre trying it‚Äôll mean the world to me. You‚Äôre allowed to have feelings about this, and I want to do my best for you. I‚Äôm not transitioning to be a different person. I have never felt quite like a complete person. Like things were missing from me. I‚Äôm transitioning to become more whole. More *alive.* 


I‚Äôve been in therapy for this for over a year, and it didn‚Äôt come lightly. I didn‚Äôt realize I had been repressing parts of who I was because I didn‚Äôt consider them possible, like there was an invisible line in the sand that I just didn‚Äôt think to cross. But I have started to become more whole, more happy. And I feel like I‚Äôm finding me in all the little things I hadn‚Äôt seen before. It‚Äôs incredible. 


You said to me a while back that you just want me to be happy, regardless of my decisions. I want you to know that it meant a lot to me. Because of that I had a good idea how you‚Äôd handle this. And it‚Äôs something I‚Äôve heard echoed in everyone I‚Äôve told. Except this isn‚Äôt a decision, it‚Äôs who I am. But I have to believe you already love who I am. So, I‚Äôm hoping this is easier, even if the execution is a bit trickier.


And whatever this conversation actually goes like in real life, when I actually talk to you and say all this: I want you to know me, and I want you to be my father. I believe in you dad."	"This is an awesome letter, perfectly balanced between parental respect, and appropriate and necessary self care.  Thank you for sharing!
A superb piece of writing ‚úçÔ∏è
That's such an amazing letter... That all i can possibly do, is say it's amazing.  Well thought out, well done. It would be impossible to not respect it, and to not be proud of You.
This is an incredible read, heartfelt and honest. It's great that you have so much faith in your dad. Mine has been a conservative Christian music minister for most of his life, but he accepted me with open arms. He doesn't ""get it"", per say, but he still loves me no matter what, and I hope it will be the same for you. Judging by how you feel about your dad, I'm thinking it will be. Godspeed, hun!

Just listened to myself pre-transition for over two hours	"Since I was 15, I existed almost entirely in music. Years of phases of guitar playing, songwriting, singing, recording, learning to play all the instruments to produce my own albums. I hid in it. 

Since my gender transition, I've transitioned away from music (as a living) and into web development. It was to make a better life but ultimately to pay for surgeries before I got too old. 

I've been so focused on coding so I haven't been listening to music lately but I reinstated my Spotify account and just went down a rabbit hole tonight. I forgot how much fun it was to discover new music and to dance along in my bedroom. God it felt good. 

I kept digging and digging and then found myself curiously going back to my own albums. I knew it would be hard to listen to but I had to open the box. And there was so much. The timelines, the eras. 


There's a person that is still there. And I want to hug and hold him. He's me but I'm not him. I'm her and will always be her. I've heard other people talk about their past selves as always being the gender they are now, just wearing a disguise or whatever. 

I saw suffering. I saw denial. And I saw lots of confusion. But I also saw the guy I used to be. And how his family was his rock. How he had girlfriend troubles. The memories of friendships, good and bad. How he was really really trying. 

Then I started to think about how strong he was. How no matter how bad things got, he always managed to get through it and was always there for his friends when they needed him. I didn't just want to hug him because I felt bad for him anymore. I wanted to hug him because I wanted him to take care of me. I miss him so much. "	"[deleted]
When I see photographs of my past, I don't disassociate with it I know that it's me. It's just a different part of my life. People's personalities change over time & the way people look in general change over time o matter what. it's just the changes I've made in the looks Department are far more drastic than most people, plus I got to hit puberty twice so yay (scarcasm). but those events in my life are still part of my life story. My life story altogether it's one big book and there are chapters.
Aw this is sweet :)

I'm someone who escaped into music pre-transition as well and am considering looking into transitioning professionally into something coding-related. Do you have any tips based on your experience regarding switching over into the programming world? 
You're so right. And it's easy to take people like that for granted because you would never guess they're going through something. 
Absolutely! There are a ton of great resources for learning to code. Check out r/learnprogramming if you wanna see tons of stuff. My recommendations would be codeacademy.com and udemy.com. Both are code alongs but udemy is video-based. 

The road map for where you should begin sort of depends on what you're interested in. If you are looking to get into general web development, I would start learning HTML. If you're over eager, you could be somewhat fluent with it in a day. Otherwise it shouldn't take you more than 3-7 days to feel comfortable to move on. From there I would start learning CSS. 

If HTML are the sketches and drawings (content), CSS is the color, coating and manipulation of that content. If you work at that every day, you can be pretty fluent in a week or so but keep in mind that CSS can get pretty deep. But don't be deterred by that, it's more exciting because of the endless possibilities. 

So that would be a great start into Front End web design. If you wanted to get into the programming aspect of that and turn your Front End content into a dynamic application (web or mobile) that's when you can turn to learning a language (javascript, Java, Python, etc). Personally, I went down the JavaScript route and I love it. The thing is, once you learn a language, learning others isn't that hard considering they all set out to do basically the same tasks. You just have to adjust to their syntaxes. 

You can learn any of those languages from the above mentioned sites. Oh, almost forgot, freecodecamp.org is totally free. The others are free to a good extent but you'll have to pay if you wanna work on projects or whatever. 

Hope that helps!
Wow this is a huge help, thank you! "	8wr2xp	trans	66	0.98	2018-07-07 05:58:36

How did I not realize?	"I feel so dumb; like how have I been transitioning for nearly a year and I only realized today that I had dysphoria before coming out.

I had other stuff that made me realize I was trans, it never felt right, but I never thought that I actively didn't like how I looked, and somehow it just clicked last night when my wife and I were discussing having to replace some sweatshirts we have. I just thought I didn't care how I looked, but I never wanted tight clothes, I hated how they felt on me so I always had big baggy clothes. Seriously all those memes suddenly became so relatable now that I have clothes that feel so right on me and make me happy to show off how I look. Turns out being miserable is not a normal state that everyone feels, who knew?

It's a small thing, but to me it feels like some cartoonish light bulb moment. Like I wish I could shake anyone thinking over these things and tell them that not everyone feels that way, that they don't need big neon signs telling them how they are, that things can be so ingrained that they seem normal.

I love you all, you're all so damn valid"	"The more you think about it, the more dysphoria you realize you had. It's nuts.
OMG, thank you so much for sharing...I really needed to hear this today! ü•≤ü•∞üíó
Same experience!
Im realizing the dysphoria now in retrospect.
‚ÄúI dont repress anything. I dont even know how to!‚Äù Lol
I found out the other day that I‚Äôd said or thought things like ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt feel comfortable going out without a hoodie,‚Äù ‚Äúi like how tight sports bras are,‚Äù and even ‚Äúif I was trans my name would be ‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî, but I‚Äôm still cis‚Äù
Being miserable isn't a normal state? I thought everyone felt like this at leasy most of the time...ü•∫
About a year ago, I bought compression shorts to wear under my everyday pants to hide my bulge because I was self-conscious of it. At the time I thought this was normal, but now I realize it was VERY obvious dysphoria.
Lol I did the same! ""I hate being a girl, I wish I was a boy"" ""I just like wearing baggier shirts and jackets just cuz"" ""\*gets distressed the more into puberty I got\*"" It's funny looking back on it

(Lyric)
I regularly wore two hoodied everywhere I went and only took them off for theater practise where the entire point was being someone other than me so it felt more okay.
True. It's like pulling a loose string on a sweater.
You're welcome! I'm glad something I posted made you feel good!
Exactly. How can I have dysphoria, that makes people incredibly sad and upset so I must be fine...
Ha, yeah, I had my trans name picked out for a long time. It's amazing to me that I put so much thought into it, yet still considered myself cis. 'This is just for video game characters' who are always women, always have the same name, and always look like an idealized version of my own self image.

Serious big brain time.
Comfortable, yeah I always said that. I thought it was always just a tactile thing, and I am very tactile, but I never questioned why it was only shapeless clothes that were comfy. I never thought I'd go back in time and see how stupid I was, now I know I was an idiot

To the trans girl in my maths class (from a teacher)	"I know you're a redditor but I don't know if you browse this sub - I hope you see this.

I am so glad that you felt that you felt comfortable with telling me that you identify as female. I hope I was supportive enough, although I feel like I wasn't. I apologize if I ever seemed awkward or unsure around you - I have been repressing my own gender identity for 20 years and didn't have the necessary skills to cope with everything properly. I also apologize that I once misgendered you and was too terrified to say or do anything about it.

Thanks to you I have finally started to deal with my gender identity, and my egg has cracked üòä I am currently getting gender counselling and considering transitioning.
It was scary at first, but seeing the support that other students gave you was very encouraging. Seeing your generation treating being trans like it's no big deal gives me hope for the future!

I wish you all the best for the future - you will go on to do amazing things (and I hope I get an invite to that restaurant/bakery when you become a chef!).
Also I love your name - inspired by a video game character perhaps? üòâ

Take care

Jade (my new name!)"	"I hope your student finds this because it is truly beautiful.
I'm not crying, you're crying.
This is amazing, congrats to both of you :)
Not trying to take anything away from this beautiful post - but I'm in the same situation. I'm also a teacher and I have a trans student in one of my classes. I'll start HRT fully next year, just waiting for the endo appointment. I so wish I could come out to them and I'm doing my darndest to fully support them. But due to me working in a macho-filled school with a former Air Force Major Christian fundamentalist head teacher, I'll likely never be able to do so."	rg82tr	trans	60	0.99	2021-12-14 13:59:17
Nonbinary kid comes out to closeted nonbinary dad...	"I'm a 40yo mostly closeted (out to some close friends,   family, and so) nb trans fem (6 months on hrt) and my 12yo just told me out of the blue while waiting in a parking lot for her mother (still my so) that they don't feel like a girl... or a boy. I was like ohh... So you don't say, apparently she's been questioning her gender for a while. I'm also nonbinary and would have loved to say how much I relate to all these things she was saying to me, BUT... I've already agreed with their mother not to come out to my children until they've had enough time with their therapist... who knows when that'll be.

I still can't believe it happened. It was like 12yo me was talking to 40yo old me and the best I could do was give them a bunch of generic shit about how I love them no matter who they are or how they dress instead of telling them that I personally know where they are right now and how I know how hard it can be. 

Their mother joined us in the car not far into this conversation and was just as shocked as me to hear this and considering how many years she watched me struggle to find who I was I could tell she was doing everything in her power not to brake down crying. Later in private she reiterated she was crying not because she was sad about them coming out, but because of how it brought up all the feelings related to my transition what we've had to deal with and it's just hard to think they'll possibly have to struggle because of it. 

I know this is pretty specific but have any other trans folx here had their kids come out to them as trans and how'd you handle it? I don't typically care about what other people think about how I run my family but I can't help but to worry about how some people will think I convinced them to be this way, but the reality is they have no idea whatsoever that I'm trans yet and I've never even used the word nonbinary in my own home before so having my child say it to me was completely unexpected."	">I've already agreed with their mother not to come out to my children until they've had enough time with their therapist... who knows when that'll be.

I think you have a pretty strong argument now that *not* coming out to your children, at least this one, is actively causing harm.
I think that's amazing! Talk about having understanding parents. I hope you'll be able to come out to your kids soon too ü•∞ü•∞ü•∞
OMG this!!  This is beautiful
Same, except closeted trans femme. My oldest came out as non-binary about a month ago, and for similar reasons, I couldn't just say ""Hey, awesome! I'm trans!""

I did basically what you did, which is to say I reacted to them in the way I'd want to be reacted to in their shoes: with nothing but support and love and immediate acceptance.

It all went fine, but yeah. It's hard to watch someone so close to you come out of almost the exact same closet while still needing to stay in your own.
Reverse, I came out to my dad and found out he was closted mtf.
This is an amazing opportunity for you to support and connect with your child! I think the child‚Äôs needs supersede any comfort agreements between you and your spouse. It‚Äôs definitely time for a celebration!
Out of all the things the universe would throw at me this  was not even on my radar until the moment I was hearing it. Thanks for making me feel not so alone, it's nice to know I'm not the only one in the world navigating something like this."	tgkve8	trans	62	0.96	2022-03-17 21:31:03
I just got married while still in the closet. It was one of the most beautiful, magical, and painful weeks of my life.	"I've talked about this with my wife already, and she has been nothing but supportive; but I feel the need to have this seen by others like me. I feel like I'm going to explode if I don't write out the experience of the past few days and weeks.

*TW for misgendering, fatphobia, misogyny*  

\_\_

I came out as a trans woman to my cis-female wife a few weeks ago. She knew that I struggled with weird gender feelings for the entirety of our relationship, and she's patiently waited for me to be comfortable and confident enough to actually want to transition. She is amazing, truly. She's even given me her old Spiro prescription that she was using for hair loss to help me get started while I try to find gender-affirming care in our area (which is a whole ordeal itself). We're around the same size, so we've been sharing clothes, and she's been helping me learn how to style my hair; she's just been genuinely so good to me. Even typing this out, I want to cry, I just love her so much.

But she's the only one who knows. So, as we've been preparing for our wedding, I have been subjected to the most concentrated month of Wrong-Gender‚Ñ¢ of my life. I have never felt like less of a woman as I have felt the past few weeks.

All of The Guys at work seemingly have accepted me into a new level of Male Knowing. The older men give me little jokes and asides about ""The old ball and chain"" and make assumptions about my enthusiasm to get married. After all, what man *actually* wants to be kept down by an icky woman? They make presumptions that my wife has done all of the work planning the wedding. They tell me ""Always say yes to your woman, you'll be a happy man."" And I smile and nod just to get it over with, but I feel disgusting about it. To be an absolute dork; I feel like Sam and Frodo in *Return of the King* when they have to dress up like orcs to get into Mordor. Except every day I wake up and I'm still dressed up like an orc.

The younger men are more sympathetic. They're hip liberals who know that it's based, actually, to be a man who unironically loves his wife. They're very sweet about the whole thing. But there's always an undercurrent of maleness about it. Like, they're good men who expect that I will be a good man too. 

And then there's my mother in law. My wife, bless her, did her best to vaguely explain to her mom that we wanted to keep things as non-gendered as possible for our wedding. To prevent outing me, she framed it as a very feminist kind of thing. We were coming together as equal partners with equal responsibilities. We don't plan on having kids, and we both work and keep up with domestic duties, and the feminist thing to do would be to leave gendered traditions out of our wedding. Which is all true by the way, so very good on her for finding a good excuse.

But my mother in law wouldn't have it. We've been sporadically getting the most gendered (and frankly tacky) gifts and baubles coming in the mail for the past few weeks. Mr. and Mrs. coffee mugs, Bride and Groom badges for the bachelor and bachelorette parties (which we already told her we weren't planning on doing), His and Her greeting cards. Things that normally would be, you know, normal. But god, they suck to get. My wife can feel me wincing every time I get one. She kindly explains to her mom that she specifically asked not to get these kinds of things, but my MIL is a very ""Mother knows best"" kind of person. She got very offended that we asked her to send them back, and refused to use her gifts. It ended up being one of the most contentious and dramatic parts of the whole wedding planning ordeal.

But the worst part, for me, was getting suited for the big day. God, it literally drove me to tears. It would be bad enough if it was a one and done situation, but anyone who's been fitted for a suit knows the process takes a while; but if you're big and tall like me, it can be excruciating finding something that fits at all.  I'm 6'1 and 300 pounds, which doesn't seem to be an acceptable size to be, according to these stores. It was a one-two punch. My body felt wrong in every way possible. It felt too big and unwieldy to even be a man's body, let alone a woman's. With every store and every garment put on, observed in the mirror, taken off, only to do it again... It was torture. I had to dry my eyes in the car between stores, and I knew some of the people working at Men's Warehouse could tell I had just been bawling in the parking lot. From their perspective, it must look very strange to have a weepy-eyed man with a ponytail and man-tits asking if they have XXXL jackets and then storming out soon after. I'm trying my best to remember the experience as funny in hindsight, but god, it was misery.

So the day before the wedding comes. I meet with all the friends and family. I actually meet my wife's father for the first time, which was a very strange experience. He had been absent since she was a teenager, only ever seeing her every few years. I could tell as I met him, there was a weird mismatch in expectations. He's a very macho guy, full of bravado, shamelessly telling stories of his sexual exploits in front of his ex wife and present fianc√©e. But I'm emasculate in ways he wasn't expecting; soft, and quiet, and unwilling to crack jokes. But in a strange way, he seemed surprisingly free of judgment. Surprisingly, he seemed accepting that I was a different kind of man. Maybe it's because he could tell how deeply his daughter loves me, and how little she cares to see him. 

Then, finally, the actual wedding day comes. I'm dressing in my suit that took like 7 tries to shop for, and honestly, it ends up looking alright. I feel like I look ridiculous in it though. I couldn't help but feel like I was a kid who got into their dad's closet and played dress up. I got my beard trimmed for the day. It was short and shaped up nicely. I'm too afraid to shave it entirely. I haven't seen my bare face since I was 17, and I don't want to have any conversations with friends and family about why I shaved it off. Besides, it makes it look like I have a chin somewhere. 

My wife, bless her (fuck, I'm tearing up again) can tell I don't feel okay. Even though she's in the throes of getting ready on her part, she stops what she's doing. She braids my hair, she helps me put on some concealer and lip gloss, helps me feel pretty even though she knows we have to hold back. It was the most comforting feeling of my life, sitting there in my ridiculous little suit with my stupid little beard, getting my hair braided into a pretty ponytail, giving us both a moment of quiet as the rest of the party got prepared in different rooms. It was like a little moment of understanding. We both know what's going on, even if nobody else does. She alone knows that, secretly, she's about to have a wife.

We drove to the venue with a few family and friends who were willing to help set up the few final things together. I greeted friends and family I hadn't seen in a while, got into task-mode to distract my brain, and got everything ready for the ceremony. 

One of our mutual best friends got ordained online so he could officiate the wedding. For obvious reasons, we didn't want to have a pastor involved in this. He spoke beautifully about the both of us, his time knowing us. The things he said felt honest. I'm not out to him, but he's one of the few men I know who seems to see me as a person rather than a man. My wife stands next to me the entire time, looking absolutely beautiful. She looks at me the entire time, and I start to forget the turmoil, and the Wrong-Gender‚Ñ¢, and anything other than her. The way she takes care of me, and the way that I take care of her. The way she knew I was trans long before I came out, but waited for me to say it first. The way that she loves me, in ways that nobody else in my life ever has, and how I know that there's absolutely no changes I could go through that would muddy the way she feels. 

We get married. It all just sort of goes away. I'm prancing around in my stupid suit, chatting up everyone who came in turns. I don't feel like a man. I just feel in love. I meet with my mom, my only remaining parent. I know that she won't talk to me for a long time after I come out. That feels okay in the moment. She introduces me, my three brothers, and my sister in law to someone she just met at the wedding. She refers to us all as ""Her boys"" on accident. My (cis) sister in law laughs it off, makes a joke that she had a really good transition. Everyone laughs. I try to feel for vibes. I can't tell how they would feel if that were true.

I finally sit down to eat our wedding dinner. It's genuinely some of the best food I've ever had. My wife sits with me, makes sure I take a break. I've still been in task-mode this entire time, either doing things for the venue or making an effort to talk with people to keep my mind occupied. Instead, for a moment, we sit, and we eat, and we're quiet. 

The next day, once everyone has gone home and said their well wishes, we look at some of the pictures that people got at the wedding. I hate how I look in every single one. I don't see myself in any of them. They're beautiful shots, but they all look wrong. But that's fine. We say that we'll take more in a few years. For one of our anniversaries, we'll go back to the venue. We'll hire the same photographer. I won't be in a stupid suit. I won't have a stupid beard. My friends and family will meet me for the first time. My mother in law won't take offense that I won't wear a badge that says Groom on it. My mother may or may not show up. It will be just as magical and lovely as our first wedding, and it will be so much easier."	"*I* teared up reading this.

My grandma called. I‚Äôm very proud of myself. (TW: mentions of Transphobia, Homophobia, and manipulative behavior)	I had already come out to my homophobic parents on her side (whom I no longer live with; I am safe). Based on the past, I knew what had brought this call on, even though she was beating around the bush and just trying to elicit some sort of promise from me that I would never leave her. I brought up the elephant in the room with supreme confidence and shot down attempt after attempt at manipulation. I have *never* been this confident in myself in my *life*, and I am *incredibly* early on in my transition. Told her where the line was, where (metaphorically) she could find me, and that loving people requires accepting them fully, and not using deceptive means to influence them the way you want them to go. There seems to be some hope there, but it might only be surface level. Don‚Äôt much care. I‚Äôve found out I can see through her bullshit well enough, so I‚Äôll be ready for that! Incredibly proud of myself for tonight.	"I‚Äôm so proud of you!!! That has potential to take a lot out of you and you kept your boat afloat like a pro!! <3 you‚Äôre doing great!
Good for you!  I'm glad you were able to stand up for yourself.
First of all, well done.  Sadly you are not unique in this, I think it's just a hangover from the past, but a lot of older parents/grandparents are manipulative, and play dumb about coming out with phobic comments and slurs.
Sweet lord, good on you!! I‚Äôm trying to wait mine out. She is racist, homophobic, transphobic and just an all around cartoonish caricature of a villain from a movie about the racist south‚Ä¶ I am tempted to come out to her just so she will never try to talk to me again.
üíúüíúüíú thank!! And very true.
Me too lol.
Oh yeah. Any means of holding on is what they do.
Geez lmao. If you‚Äôve become adept at seeing manipulative tactics and are in a place where she can‚Äôt hurt you financially or physically, I highly recommend it. It was honestly one of the most cathartic moments of the week for me; it showed me where her heart actually lay: love as a thing demanded of others rather than freely given. So I demanded it of her. If that‚Äôs the only way she‚Äôs going to show it, I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôll be able to have a relationship with her. At least not properly."	pi7fmy	trans	59	0.94	2021-09-05 05:47:53
Anyone else?	"I'm thinking about just giving up. Giving up on ever being happy, being able to transition. It just seems more and more unattainable, I'm not sure what else to do.

I know I'm depressed, but at this point, I don't even hardly have dysphoria, I just don't care I guess? I can't get out easily to see friends because of an injury, and also now don't have money to do much anyway. 

Idk, I just... I feel like giving up"	"Transition doesn't always happen in one go. I've been on and off T for years for similar feelings of not having enough energy to fight a seemingly pointless battle. It's okay to take a break and assess things. If you don't end up transitioning, that's fine, if you decide later you will pick it up, that's also fine. It sounds like you could use a little time to focus on your needs, and nobody can fault you for that, no matter what decision you make for yourself at the end of it all.
it took 7 years, it felt like forever and still does, I've lost so much time.
but I didn't give up.
I've been on hrt for 4 days and couldn't be happier about it.

I know what you're feeling, I've thought on ending things countless times, or looking into diy.
I can feel this, here in Alabama we‚Äôve got a running of 3 transphobic governors and our lead pick for senator is also transphobic. I can feel wanting to give up, but deep down I know that while the fight may never get easier eventually I‚Äôll get a chance to truly be me, without shame or fear. I know we‚Äôll all get our chance to live freely. I believe in you. You got this.
I quit taking estrogen for almost a year and a half and didn't start again until I really understood myself and was more stable.
I had to figure out that being a woman was not what was important to me but more that I needed to do things that make me feel more comfortable. I didn't transition, I just do self care.
yep
Been in the same boat lately due to my work being a ""manly"" environment and having no time to work on my looks. Gonna be rough I suppose
Dont forget that not caring is a defense mechanism. All i can say without sounding patronizing is transition is not unattainable at all once you are a legal adult
How did you get through things?"	upobz0	trans	63	0.98	2022-05-14 19:20:55
Hard not to feel like an imposter currently (29 MTF)	"I came out to my wife 2 months ago and just about everything has been amazing since then. There have been super positive changes in my life (stopped biting nails, diet and exercising, general self care) and the steps I've been taking to start transitioning have led to so much euphoria. But even though I've known I was different since I was 5 I've never felt depressed about being AMAB.

Reading this sub there are so many brave people that are going through it emotionally, I can't help but feel like a bit of an imposter for not going through this in the same way. For me I've just always wanted to live my life but be pretty. My dysphoric thoughts are usually fleeting and centered around manly looking pictures I see, but my euphoric feelings are magical and make me excited to wake up every day now.

Bit of a vent I just didn't know if anyone else felt this way, it feels selfish :("	"You sound a lot like me. I haven‚Äôt taken any steps beyond admitting to myself that I‚Äôm not cis  (took like 30 years for that, I‚Äôm slow) but I had this undercurrent of off feelings, and desires to be more feminine, but not that impacted my life greatly. I always just attributed any depression or anxiety to the many other things life has to offer. Hearing and reading the stories some people go through with their dysphoria and emotions, you can‚Äôt help but think ‚Äúthey‚Äôre having such a hard time and I‚Äôm not, so I must not actually have an issue.‚Äù  I didn‚Äôt even want to talk about it because I didn‚Äôt want to make those who ARE having a hard time even more upset that they have to deal with so many problems while others have it ‚Äúeasy.‚Äù It‚Äôs a vicious circle. I‚Äôve read enough stories at this point to know everyone‚Äôs life and path are different. No one‚Äôs a better or worse person because of it. Finding your own path to happiness is what‚Äôs necessary, without comparing yourself to others. Find those in your life that support you and, with peace and happiness, you can support your fellow humans through their similar problems as well.
I only just came out to my wife last week and I feel so much better. I also never felt depressed about being a guy, instead I was ashamed of my feelings about wanting to be a girl. We are all different, just because we didn‚Äôt feel the same doesn‚Äôt mean any one of us is more valid than the other.
Hopefully, one day there will be a time where someone can realize they are transgender and transition without all the pain.   The fact that you didn't hit rock bottom isn't a sign that you aren't really trans, whatever that means.   If you are enjoying the process and it has so positively impacted your life, then great!   That is the point, after all.
I know it's corny to say, but your experience and relationship to your body is completely valid. I've felt like an imposter for not experiencing dysphoria in the exact same ways as other trans girls, and I'm just now realizing that I'm allowed to be trans in my own way. 

I think that experiencing that euphoria when connecting with your gender identity is more than proof enough. Also, the fact that you've seen your habits improve goes to show how much this all may have been affecting you without you even knowing. 

All the love and good luck!!
Girl, this is so relatable. I'm 30 MtF, it's been a week since I told someone I want to be female. I've always felt like I wanted this, but I've never had gender dysphoria or any other depression about being amab. The only negative feelings I've had was about wanting to be a girl, like you said OP, it feels like I'm an imposter. And on top I feel guilty about it all because it should feel more obvious that I dislike my body right? It's more a low level indifference/discomfort to being male, contrasted with the euphoria of the idea of being born as a girl instead (like, I wish I was).
Chasing euphoria is what matters. Dysphoria is valid, but it shows up for different people in different ways. I feel much the same about mine. You‚Äôre still ‚Äútrans enough.‚Äù We‚Äôre all on this earth to walk each other home.
Everyone's transition is different. You can't possibly compare yours to someone else's because you lived experiences are going to be completely different. Things like dysphoria or just your general experience or euphoria are all experienced differently by you compared to everyone else. Don't sell yourself short and do yourself a disservice. You're not an imposter this is your journey and only you know the steps you need to take to make it to the end. Some people have it harder than others and unfortunately that's just how it is. I wish you the best of luck and I hope you have a safe journey.
I refuse to accept that you're ""slow."" You may have realized later than many trans people, but that's not you're fault.
Thanks for saying this, the ‚Äúbeing ashamed of my feelings‚Äù sums it up perfectly. Congrats on coming out! üòÅ
I needed this thread, it's so reassuring when almost every coming out story I see is very heartfelt with heavy dysphoria. Congrats about telling your wife! I told my fianc√© last week as well and it felt SO GOOD.
there‚Äôs certainly not a rule book for this experience, you‚Äôre right üòÅ good luck to you too!
thanks for saying this, beautifully put üòä
I‚Äôll accept that. And smile at the compliment.

Edit: To be fair, there we‚Äôre definitely signs early, but the gay panic gripped my parents and I crushed the feelings back down pretty hard.
Congrats on you too, it‚Äôs only been 2 months for you and you already listed so many positive things you are doing now. I can relate to the exercising. Before I accepted this is who I am I never cared for it. Lot of work+ I‚Äôm tired+ my body hurts after? Nah, I wouldn‚Äôt even like how I looked if I lost weight or buff even so what‚Äôs the point. But now I‚Äôm seriously thinking I should because I want to be proud of myself, I‚Äôm starting to like myself more and I feel exercising is one way to help me get there.
Congrats yourself, hope everything went smoothly and I hope things go well for you :)
Yeah I'm just overzealous and it's partially projection since I'm finally accepting that I might not conform to my AGAB and I'm much older than average on these subs.  

I get it.  But just be kind to yourself.  Don't blame yourself for pushing feelings down.  Usually when we do that it's because we need to, or we didn't even know it was a thing.
it‚Äôs wild i was a chronic nail biter for 25 years and just stopped the second i said something out loud for the first time. definitely a new feeling to wake up excited to start each day (don‚Äôt even need an alarm! üòÇ)
And to you too! It was a bit of a tough week, not going to lie. She needed some time to process but she told me ""I'm on board"" the other day and has been looking up androgenous clothes to buy for me <3
Gender nonconformity wasn‚Äôt even in my vocabulary and certainly not my older parents. No internet resources or ‚Äúsafe spaces‚Äù existed or they were in nascent stagers. The feelings and thoughts I had were obviously trans upon reflection, but my parents knew only of gay, so that‚Äôs what they grabbed onto when I started expressing myself, but I knew I wasn‚Äôt gay, so my prepubescent mind went ‚ÄúI must be doing something wrong‚Äù.  Stayed that way for a long time afterwards. 
What you‚Äôre saying needs to be said, even if people don‚Äôt want to hear it, but I appreciate it. We need to love ourselves and look to the future, not analyze the past.
That‚Äôs awesome! My wife said she‚Äôs supportive but she been that talkative when I try to bring up things I‚Äôm thinking about regarding my gender identity. I‚Äôve got a couple of therapists set up for next month so things are kind of on hold till then. I‚Äôm excited and I‚Äôm trying to go slow and not let this encompass my every waking moment so I don‚Äôt overload her. I know she still loves me though, no doubt about that and I love her so I‚Äôm going to work hard to make sure she knows she‚Äôs herd as this effects her as much as me so her feelings are just as valid.
Sounds like we're from a similar vintage, and I 100% get it.  But I'm really taking the idea of being kind to myself seriously for the first time.  And I'm not good at it. But I think it's important, and if I can I want to help other people to love themselves.

Its a lot to be going through, but I believe in you.  ‚ù§Ô∏è
Well done, I need to get some therapists myself. That's so lovely to hear how considerate you're being, I'm very prone to going too fast with these things myself and I need to chill tf out at the moment. If love and communication are still there, things will be ok, whatever happens <3
Same back at you üíï"	re3tbm	trans	57	0.98	2021-12-11 16:57:26
I never really took care of my body until transitioning, and now I wish I had.	"For a bit of context, I was also raised by lower middle class, conservative Christian parents.  So being queer or trans just wasn't an option.  I tried to come out a couple times growing up (the first as early as 4 years old), but was met with such vocal and forceful opposition from my father that I just... completely repressed. I literally didn't even remember me trying to come out those times (or that my favorite color was pink) until a few months ago. I also feel like that may only be because the last person in my family who lived nearby (my mom) moved away and left the state. 

 Growing up, practically any form of self-care was seen as ""sissy"", vain, or an extravagance we couldn't really afford. Any time I expressed an interest in something like this, I was steered away,  or guilted and dissuaded with rhetoric like this. I think the learned helplessness eventually reached a point where I didn't even question this. Because the body I had also disgusted me and didn't feel like one worth having, I just didn't care about it at all and did the bare minimum.

Can anybody else relate to this? It's just really frustrating to me,  and now it's like I'm suddenly trying to catch up on three decades of neglect."	"See that's interesting. I also did a lot of damage to myself, but mostly under the guide of ""I hate my body and don't care what happens to it""
If it helps, I've started thinking of my body as the clay from which I am sculpting. Start most mornings thinking ""I have to take care of the clay."" It reminds me that while I'm not were I want to be, I have to take care of my body if I want to get there.
I grew up conservative. Mental health was considered a myth. I have PCOS and it caused me to rapidly gain weight. By age 12 I was nearly 200 lbs. I developed bulimia along with severe depression and anxiety. I wish I could go back and tell my younger self that my weight gain wasn't my fault but also that rather than giving up, I needed to continue exercising and eating like I was before it started. I hate that I didn't because now I'm trying to get my body back to a place where I feel energized and it's hard.
Totally relate to this, girl! I grew up in a conservative, Republican, catholic household and we moved every 2-3 years, in which I developed intense abandonment issues. I was so oppressed by my parents that I became what I call a ‚Äúsocial chameleon‚Äù. That meant that I had no ability to express myself, no opinions, no desires, no aspirations, and hardly a single friend. I wasn‚Äôt even able to go to college for what I wanted. I was emotionally dead. It literally took my wife 10 years to fix what my parents f@cked up.
I didn't care for my body in terms of diet, I was morbidly obese for 3/4 of my life. I actually started caring for my body and lost 120lbs. I decided to lose weight to help with dysphoria, I always felt female all my life but thought losing weight may change that (naive I know). Now transition is in progress and I started feeling better. 

Family pressure and an unhealthy relationship with my family meant I suppressed many things. I never looked after my mental health, I decided to deal with that too and that's a work in progress. 

It's easy to not look after yourself when you can't be who you are. That feeling of hopelessness takes a toll.
Other than the conservative 'christian' family, this is pretty much my life growing as well.

I'll spare you the details of what I subjected my body too (and the health scares that got me back on track) 

You are not alone, dear
I‚Äôm not on T yet.. but honestly I have a view of I hate my body, so why should I take care of it.. I hope when I start T I might want to actually take care of it
can relate, no point taking care of a body i hate
Damn I wish I didn't relate so deeply to this...
I can relate! I grew up in a pretty right home with a single mom who wanted me to be a hyper masculine male so anytime I asked about what a lotion does I was called a slur or two. Then came college where I started a little bit of self harm and now have lots of very large scars on my body. Now here I am (an egg) being like 'okay how do I make these ugly things go away and get baby smooth skin?'. Really hoping HRY can lend a massive hand but in short you are not alone at all.
Before transitioning I was fully committed to killing off this body of mine. Binge eating mostly, but drugs and alcohol too. When I finally accepted who I really was that also came with changes to how I treated myself. I‚Äôm still a work in progress but over 30 pounds lost so far on a long road to a healthy weight. You aren‚Äôt alone lol
Yep, I had a very similar experience. I was raised in a strict Mormon family, and had to repress a lot of stuff in order to avoid tough opposition and penalties. Even after my mission my father was still telling me off for acting too effeminate. He would warn me that such behaviour attracts gay men, and would constantly reinforce that I was a straight masculine male and must always be mindful to act masculine. Even warning me not to ruin their reputation at church. So after I left the church and was subsequently disowned by my family I never felt there was much point in looking after myself because I didn't want to be myself. Now many years later I am finally in a much better headspace. I am transitioning and embracing the true inner me. I am really feeling the burden of those years. Looking at my skin and hair and how I could have been in much better shape if only I started caring about myself sooner, or better yet had chosen to transition much sooner, but I still had religious trauma to deal with before I felt I was ready to go to my next phase of life, which I am enjoying immensely so far üôÇ
I‚Äôm trying to catch up on 2 decades of it
Same lol. I have severe eczema but didn‚Äôt care about taking care about it. Now that I‚Äôm shaving my legs and taking care of my appearance I wish I could slap my younger self across the face. I she. So many eczema scars.
There was definitely an element of that. Especially when it felt like there was nothing I could do about it.
Tangentially related, but this is where the term ‚Äúplastic surgery‚Äù comes from; you are sculpting your body like a plastic.

But yeah, I have a lot of work to do. I hated my body before, so I didn‚Äôt do it any favors.
Thanks, that's a productive way to look at it.
I'm sorry you had to endure that, it sounds pretty bad.

I'm still deprogramming myself, even after a decade of being a heathen. But I think that's partly because my mom was a pretty constant presence still, until a couple months before my egg cracked.
I can relate with pretty much all of this. Still working on my weight, but just the very thought of being able to be cute, have curves, etc., is helping me stay focused on my goals.

On the family pressure topic, I really wonder now if I'd gotten out of that situation sooner (e.g., moving out at 18, living on campus for college) whether I would've transitioned then and there.
Thanks.  It helps to know that other people have gone through the same thing.
Thanks. I can definitely relate to the binge eating. And I think I've lost a similar amount now,  too! I feel like the reasons for me eating my feelings are basically gone,  now that I'm on HRT and transitioning.
Oof. I can definitely relate to this. 

I just really wish I'd found a way to get away from them sooner, since now I'm almost certain that if I had, I would've transitioned.

But for now, my goal is just baby steps; even if the progress I'm making now is tiny, it's incremental, and adds up.
Weight is hard, I still want to lose some more weight, especially before HRT. I found using herbs and spices really makes healthy choices easier. Agree the thought of cures and having my clothes fit me the way I like. 

Possibly so, situationships does a lot to a person. The important thing is moving forward.
You're never alone boss. Someone someplace has been in your shoes before, so keep that head up and that skirt twirlin!"	10mm4zr	trans	52	0.96	2023-01-27 14:27:27

Inequality in the trans community	"This is written from a South African perspective. 

It is common knowledge that the legacy of apartheid lives on. One of the worst ways this manifests itself if in medicine. The colour of one's skin can often determine whether or not they will get medical treatment of a good  quality,and in some cases,medical treatment at all. 

The vast majority of transgender youth who have bee able to medically transition in South Africa are white. The reason for this is mostly socio-economic. Historically,those who are white have always possessed  a lot more material wealth,and this has made private medical care more accessible.  We have not had to go through the struggle of shitty state healthcare in provinces like KwaZulu-Natal,and wait for ages only to be given Premarin instead of something bioidentical. Generally,we have been able to afford travel,and we have been able to come to terms with who we are because of access to the internet(which many South Africans  do not have) as well as less progressive schools usually being those in poorer areas. 

This is by no means fair or just. I am not proposing a solution,because I do not have one. I am simply highlighting  what I have seen"	"I haven't the first clue about anything to do with South Africa, but sadly you see stuff like this (perhaps not on the same scale) most countries in the world.

Even here in the UK where gender affirming healthcare *is* available on the NHS, the wait lists for it are absolutely absurd - to get it in even a semi reasonable time frame costs absurd amounts of money.
Yeah,the UK is an absolute  hellhole for trans people. The NHS is well-resourced (would be even better resourced if the Tories weren't  in power),but despite that,yeah,the waiting lists are absurd. This is not for pragmatic reasons. It's about deprivation and bigotry,bit at the same time having the excuse that at least they allow it....sorry for the incoherence."	ubm2oh	trans	58	0.9	2022-04-25 14:11:20
If you‚Äôre still young and you think you might be trans	"Do *something*. Something that isn‚Äôt related to your gender or sexuality in any way. Volunteer at an animal shelter, throw yourself into school or work.

Being chronically online is a thing and it can seriously fuck with your ability to explore who you are healthily. Having something external you care about takes a lot of pressure off of you to figure out your identity or achieve a perfect transition."	"I'd also like to add that this works for stuff that isn't gender or sexuality based.
i already know i‚Äôm trans but still have confusion so this is so true and i‚Äôm currently trying to do exactly that. i‚Äôve noticed when i eliminate being online as much as possible i never have any doubts about who i am."	11hy2dh	trans	56	0.85	2023-03-04 12:28:26
I don't relate to anything else said about depersonalization, I relate to these two sentences right here.		"I do have a history of not caring about my body, I just never got really fat or anything because I can‚Äôt gain weight very well. But I definitely generally don‚Äôt eat well and have a hard time caring about shaving and stuff because there‚Äôs no point if it‚Äôs just gonna grow back in an hour
This was found on [the gender dysphoria bible.](https://genderdysphoria.fyi/en) And no, I am not claiming to have depersonalization disorder. All I'm saying is that I relate to this one part of it. I've always thought my face looked weird in the mirror. I'm always surprised that that's what my face looked like. I feel like it should be different than it is.
Ah don't worry, usually I (when not looking in a mirror but down at myself) feel as if I'm just a conscious or an alien controlling my body.
Had that partly as a result of a major anxiety disorder. That said, I hope one day I can be genuinely confident and happy with myself.
Yeah this happens to me sometimes, even when I look down at ny arms for example I know I'm controlling and moving them but it still feels like they're someone else's and not my own, almost like I'm watching thru someone else's eyes
I ended up with this because of some nasty trauma.

I wake up sometimes like I've been asleep for months and panic like ""oh shit, how did I get here?""

Knowing that I am transitioning is a real comfort at times like this."	10n6yfd	trans	57	0.94	2023-01-28 05:14:37
(Possible TW) Did anybody else struggle with poor eating habits or even eating disorders before realizing they were trans?	"Before I knew I was trans, I hated my body so I didn‚Äôt really care about taking care of it, so I just kinda ate whatever when I felt like it with no regard for my health. I gained weight, not an unhealthy amount, but it was noticeable. It made me hate my body even more, and now I‚Äôd even occasionally get comments about my body. Never any mean comments, but the fact that people noticed, that they were paying some amount of attention to my body sucked.

So I stopped eating as much. I skipped breakfast and had significantly smaller servings, tried to pick healthier options. It wasn‚Äôt enough though, because while I stopped gaining weight, now I was just maintaining what I was at and enjoyed eating less. My diet started to fluctuate a lot because I wanted so bad to change my body but was so noncommittal to put effort into a body I hated.

After I realized that I‚Äôm trans, despite still having the same body, not physically transitioning at all, and still being in the closet, I actually want to put effort in, but I‚Äôm also more comfortable having a bit of a tummy!

It‚Äôs just something that‚Äôs been on my mind a lot recently as I‚Äôm trying to get back into a workout routine, and I‚Äôm really curious if anyone else has had a similar experience"	"I ate a lot of feelings. I still do, but I‚Äôm getting a lot better now that I know what my feelings mean.
I think quite possibly 0.0 I've always been very slim (probably underweight) and I never tried very hard to change that. Probably had something to do with it being something I got compliments on that I *liked* about my body, being skinny is often tied to femininity, something along those lines. 

I never actively tried NOT to eat food, but I definitely did not like the idea of gaining weight so I never tried to eat more substantial/healthy foods or anything. After 2 years of HRT, I was thinking about this lately and realized I would actually not mind at all if I gained some weight, so eating has been something I'm trying to work out how to be better at (especially since a recent med change makes my appetite pretty ignorable) :3 my genetics still mean I'll likely be pretty light anyway, my mom and grandmother have both been very petite their whole lives and I suspect I've inherited some of that.
In the words of my therapist, ""trans people basically invented eating disorders."" It's really easy to develop one when you either 1) feel so detached from your body you can't even muster the energy or mental bandwidth to take care of it and just try to survive using whatever means you can to feel in control or fulfilled, or 2) know something is very very wrong but you don't know what it is, but society tells you the one thing that will always make you feel better about it is to be thinner.

I lost over 30 pounds in no more than 2 months at one point before my egg cracked because I was so goddamn miserable I starved myself to just feel in control and because I thought if I was skinnier I'd be okay with my body. First thing I did on estrogen was gain all of that back, and I learned that I actually love when my body has some extra fat on it, when it's distributed to the girly places and doesn't just make me dysphoric...

Point is that yeah you're definitely not alone in having very disordered or unhealthy eating habits, it's extremely common.
I LITERALLY HAVE AND DIDN'T NOTICE IT UNTIL NOW.
Skirted around underweight for years. Probably very underweight at one point. The only way I could tolerate my body during those years was if there was less of it. I only ate lunch and dinner, and too little of them. If I went to a party or something, I would skip a meal the next day.

I‚Äôm better about it now that the weight seems to go places I want it to go, but I still have problems accepting the fact that I have to gain weight if I want HRT to do it‚Äôs job properly. It causes me some stress.
Yes. I still do but I've mostly stopped starving myself. I'm starting to eat a little healthier now too.
I had an eating disorder for 2 years and struggled with food and exercise addiction. It‚Äôs‚Ä¶pretty much gone since I got top surgery.
I feel the same way as you. I was in a depression over not wanting to be in this body. I showered once a week, brushed my teeth just as often. Stopped eating right and put on 70 lbs. among other self destructive behaviors. The week I came out I started showing every day, brushing my teeth, eating better and sticking to it. It's like a switch flipped that said, now this girl here is worth taking care of! I think about all the years of being unhappy that I put myself through out of fear and uncertainty. I try not to live in the past with regret and just be happy I was able to come out at all and start taking care of myself.
Yeah same, I weighed about 178 lbs when I first came out and went on hrt. Now I weigh 152 lbs after roughly 5 months now. Though I will say, I prob did not always lose weight in the most healthy way.
I did, I am amab and hated even the idea of not being the skinny girl if I eventually transition so I pretty much never ate and lost about 10 or 20 pounds in 6 months.
I still do struggle with eating disorders even after coming out as trans. I have such a hatred for my body that I‚Äôve committed every eating disorder with the exception of actual vomiting, and even then I‚Äôm getting close. I‚Äôve been obese and underweight multiple times in my life, and I think it primarily stems from having a hatred of my body ever since I was a child even though I didn‚Äôt completely understand what it meant to be trans at the time. Things are definitely getting better now, but the same coping mechanisms and defenses are present and now bad habits.
I weighed 230 lbs before realizing I was trans 7 months ago. Now I weigh 170 just from taking care of myself.
When I came out for the first time I at probably 2 meals in like 4 days
I still do struggle with eating properly, it‚Äôs hard to break old habits but I want to get better
Spent most of my life so far as an apathetic overweight sad boy. Accepted my genderfluid/trans self officially a few months back. And now I'm eating better, joined a gym, all round working on myself and striving to be the best me I can be. Whoever he/she/they turn out to be.

The interesting part of the psychology to me is that as a large boy I definitely felt an amount of self-loathing about my appearance. Not diagnosed as an eating disorder but I'd look in a mirror and just hate what I saw, and feel terrible comfort eat and shame spiral. but since accepting a more honest version of myself. Now my attitude is way more caring and patient. I'm just like...  You know you can do better! Take care of yourself! 

I try not to talk about my boy self and my new fluid/non-binary/girl self as two separate people. But honestly it feels like a whole different person took the wheel sometimes.
I was incredibly insane about cardio and carbs I. High school. Probably contributed to my joint problems. What was essentially starving myself and 1 hour of solid no break cardio a day. 200 full body stomach crunch‚Äôs, 50 push-ups etc. Hindsight is 20/20 because I now accept it‚Äôs because I didn‚Äôt like my male fat distribution.
Also I‚Äôm endomorphic so I was constantly fixated on getting rid of that like tummy pudge. Then it turned into a ‚Äúeat whatever‚Äù depression sort of deal, which I kept going on because boobs. Now I‚Äôm just trying to get moderately healthy again before I start HRT in earnest XD
Yes I definitely struggled with that ( and still do) and i think it is rather common for trans people
I relate to this on so may levels.
This sounds a lot like me, except I have a medical condition that limits what I can eat too. 

After coming out I feel like I have a reason to care about my body in terms of nutrition and exercise.  I still need to eat more but I'm doing a lot better."	snc1qe	trans	53	0.96	2022-02-08 05:20:42
My mom pissed me off so much I'm finally determined to publicly be a girl	" 

So I have started to transition almost exactly a year ago, but I'm currently out as transfem to only a handful of people, my parents included, they are clumsily supportive, well as long as they don't have to do too much effort, like gendering me correctly, too much for my dad üòí But I suppose this is still much better than what a lot of people unfortunately get.

&#x200B;

So anyway, we got a brunch with my grandpa this sunday, and my original plan was to test the water by only coming out as bisexual, especially if that old f\*ck kept doing stupid comments about my newly found femininity, like he did last time. So I I was talking to my mom about the brunch, and tried to say my plan, but she kinda just cut me off when I said I wanted to come out, assuming I meant coming out as trans. And then she did a rant about how I needed to come out in advance to let him ""prepare"" or ""cope"" or some shit. And she kinda implied she was the one that should do it too. Now that's already shit, if i want to come out in person that's my choice wtf? But there's two thing that actually really pissed me off :

&#x200B;

1. The way she talks about it it's like a shameful secret, and I should be the one bending over backwards to make sure I don't shock anyone too much with it.
2. She never takes me seriously and she really thinks I'm super naive and that I think everyone will accept me immediately, and I cannot translate just how goddamn annoying she was about that. It'as also just symptomatic of her not trusting me in general, but that‚Äôs another story/trauma.

&#x200B;

Truth is I do NOT care what that old ass thinks about my gender identity, nor what she thinks about it, or really anyone else. Yeah, some people are never gonna accept me, some are even gonna hate me for it. I am much more aware of who she is, but I won't do everything to change that and to make those people ""comfortable"", screw em. F\*\*\* my original plan, if I'm going I'm coming out as a woman and doing it on my own terms.

&#x200B;

And yeah, as i say in the title, it pissed me off so much i realized how tired I am of pretending I'm someone else, next semester at my university I'm using my real name, I'm done with that deadname shit, and if anyone asks me I'm Marie, the other guy is not there anymore.

&#x200B;

Thanks for reading my unhinged rant :) , tbh I really just needed to let it out lol"	"Gotta love that classic transfem ""look upon my field of fucks given and see that it is barren"" vibe. Good luck girl
Not giving a fuck is one of the best traits of many transfems i hope everything goes allright :D
Go get 'em girl! I love your energy!
We all need to vent. Good luck.
I feel and relate to the energy here so much lol. My family's severely religious and transphobic. I was outed prematurely and once they knew, their bigotry and hate fueled my bravery in being myself.
Good for you. Stay strong.
It‚Äôs the No more fucks to give song! Really though, good for you Marie! Continue to be awesome.
You've got guts and courage. Stay fierce!
Thank you! And yes, my fields of fuck is indeed empty right now
Tahnk you! It probably will go fine :)

And yes, not giving a fuck do be important, especially being trans \^\^
Thanks! I'll stop caring what assholes have to say and just hang out with the plenty of cool people around me instead :)
thank you <3
I'm glad ou got over thos guys, screw them all, we don't have to care about what others think about who we are
Thank you so much!
I will, thank you!  <3
Amen to amen. This is a hard lesson to learn for many bby trans but the sooner they learn this the more stable they will be. This is wisdom from a gran tran."	12d1szt	trans	53	0.91	2023-04-05 23:30:18
On Coming Out	I sadly never was able to come out on my own. Due to some mental health issues I was having, the cops, after receiving that info from me, passed it along to my parents without even really asking me if they could. Despite this, I've decided to reclaim my coming out. It's been a little over a year, and I've finally started my social transition! I'm proud of myself, and I just want to encourage any person reading this, may it be trans, non-binary, ot anything really, to be proud of yourself too, just for continuing to exist! Take care üíú		mu2c1m	trans	52	0.97	2021-04-19 14:53:31
I stopped obsessing over how cis I am - it made my life so much better	"I originally wrote this as a response to a comment, thought you guys might enjoy:

&#x200B;

I'm MtF and like for many trans people my end goal of transition was becoming basically cis. It was a very unhealthy obsession. I had to always measure myself against other women. First steps are easy, to look like them, to move like them, to talk like them.

&#x200B;

But then a cis girl talks to me about sex and I freak out, since I have no idea how girls talk to each other about this stuff. What role do  they think they have in a relationship? For my whole life I've seen the  whole world from a patriarchal perspective and never had those forming  years as a teenage girl to find my place in it. Heck, after 3 years of  living as a women I still don't understand why girls want to be with  men, who are stronger than them, have a more privileged placed in  society and are too often potential abusers.

&#x200B;

Then there is talk about a first period, which I never had and never will. Tampons, pads and comfort routine during menstruation are a part  of this secret women world I'll never be a part of. 

&#x200B;

Then there is motherhood. I cried more than I could count because  I'll never be a mother. I don't even want kids anymore but still can't hear people talking about babies without experiencing trauma. 

&#x200B;

And finally, SRS. I had my first appointment with a doctor and I'll have it done soon. Boy, is this one is a huge can of worms. I'll need to  regularly stretch it, because my body will reject it and try to heal  over it. I'll have to carefully and frequently wash it, because it  cannot clean itself like in cis women. I'll need to always use lube during sex, because there won't be any natural lubrication like in cis women. And what hurt me the most, I'll lack muscles controlling it, so  even on the surface it won't function the same.

&#x200B;

No matter how hard I'll try, I'll always be a worse cis women, there will be something that I lack or don't understand on emotional level. It  was devastating and drove me into a terrible depression. As an enby, it also caused suppression of my identity, so gradual that I honest to God forgot I was one. Only after therapy I remembered who I was and started to get better.

&#x200B;

But there is a good ending to this story and I hope it'll be the ending for anyone, who was in the same dark place as I was. I just stopped worrying about being cis, which I'll never be, and embraced being trans, which I always was. Cis women have their own shared experiences and  shared thoughts. We, trans women, have ours.

&#x200B;

I was trying to be accepted as one of them and even when I had that acceptance, I always felt like a stranger. I finally found peace when I realized i was one of us all along.

&#x200B;

MtF are not worse cis women. FtM are not worse cis man. We are different and beautiful and valid. If you feel good with yourself the way you are, great, I'm so glad for you. But to those who fell the way I felt - we all need to accept that if we want to ever be happy."	"Great message!

 I think we can all get caught up in comparisons to others.  Really you just need to be the best you, you can be.  You have to appreciate what you do have and your journey.  

You have experiences and thoughts that a cis person won‚Äôt have.  Each person brings a perspective, and experience to the table.   Don‚Äôt cut yourself short in thinking you‚Äôre lacking something that a cis person has that you don‚Äôt. The same can be said in reverse. 
I, literally, adopted this attitude when I started my transition.
 
I started at 39, my goal in my transition was to be myself and not to be someone else.
  
I gotta live my own life to my own measures, not against an imaginary yard stick put to someone else's life.
I read your post and started to cry. I‚Äôm feeling the same way than you and I didn‚Äôt walk a part of your road!!! I really appreciate your words a lot. Thanks for share it!!!
I really need to accept myself but I feel so guilty when I feel like I need validation or just someone to tell me how I won't pass.

the whole passing concept just sucks and I know I should be better than to be so fixated on it.  
Beauty standards really get to me I guess, I can't accept compliments because it feels so obvious to me that I'm ugly and masculine looking - that people are just being kind to me.  


But I know that I don't judge other people by beauty standards, I think it is horrible but I seems unable to do that same for myself. its an odd place.
I don't know if I am allowed to comment being a cis woman myself and I don't know if this is going to be seen as a good thing to say or not but please believe me when I say it comes from a good place. You may not be cis and yes there are a lot of differences in experience between cis and trans people. But one woman to another - you are one of us and the decent people amongst us cis lot all see it that way. Your experiences are female experiences regardless and we can all empathise with each other regardless. üíú
I think overall I'm glad I'm trans. I'm not glad for all the medical gatekeeping I go through. I'm not glad to be anxious about which set of toilets or fitting rooms is safest to use. I'm not glad for all the misgendering. I'm not glad that I have to get surgery to feel right with my body. I'm not glad for the trauma and depersonalisation. I'm not glad that I had to come out. My life would have been a lot easier as cis person.

But I am glad for the perspective it's given me on the world and on myself. I'm glad for the community giving me the feeling that there's always somewhere I belong and always people I can turn to for support. I'm glad about the insights it has given me about men and women that I would never have had as a cis person. It's been interesting having a body with a range of sexual characteristics. I'm glad that I get to experience the world beyond the gender binary.
I love this. Thanks for sharing!
I'm glad I could help. Hope you find your happiness soon, I believe it's waiting for all us somewhere.
I hate beauty standards as well. The stereotype of tiny, petite women as a standard needs to finally die - we are no longer doll to be looked at and be pretty the '60 man's world wanted us to be. Women work in factories, fight in the army, heck, even work in the mall requires caring heavy cartons around the store and those jobs are mostly occupied by women. Lately abs + lean body are in fashion and I love it just as much as I hate. It looks soooo hot but the body fat to muscle ratio required to obtain this body is borderline deadly, getting pregnant looking like this is basically suicide, because there is significant amount of fat required for healthy pregnancy and dietary restrictions to get there and not loose it are insane - I know, I tried to look like this and resigned as soon as I found what it takes to look like this.

&#x200B;

Meanwhile ancient women were as muscular as modern day professional rowers due to amount of manual labor required in the agriculture and processing of grains. There are still places around the world, where there is not a single thin girl in a village, because all family members need to work on the farm and physical labor builds what lack of testosterone didn't. In those communities boys grow up seeing only those type of girls and those are their standards of beauty. Being fat in a healthy way was attractive just 2 centuries ago.

&#x200B;

It helps to search on the internet, how the standard of women's beauty differs between countries and changed over time - all body types are included in some place and time of history if you look close enough.

&#x200B;

You may not want to be a ""masculine"" women and I completely get that. But if you're willing to give it a try - I'm very butch and wearing manly clothes and ""typical lesbian"" hairstyle helps to magnify even the smallest female attributes, it makes them stick out and become more pronounced, because those are the elements that don't match with the rest. And when I wear typical ""princess's clothes"", all the masculinity suddenly becomes supper visible, because those are the parts that don't match with the rest. Funny how everyone magically stopped misgendering me after cutting my long hair and getting a pixie cut :D And there are plenty of women and, I'm certain, also men, who prefer a more ""manly"" women over a stick figure who barely have enough muscle to stand straight (using quotes here, because how could you have a masculine body if you are a women and this body is your).
Thank you, it means a lot for a lot of us. In a void your comment would be very cisnormative - you accepting us as real women implies that we are in fact fake and need an approval of real woman to be seen as one.

&#x200B;

However consider how many trans people actually do feel like fakes and how many cis people try to challenge our identity at every step or outright harass us for just existing, not even in a gender separated spaces but anywhere public - your acceptance is appropriate and, I'd say, even welcome. Thank you.
This is the most amazing reply I've ever had.
I really appreciate you taking the time to write all that out. It means so much to me. 

Thank you, I really admire your strength. Total goals. 
Anytime. üôÇ

I'm not meaning to be cis normative at all. It's hard to find the right words sometimes. You are right to suggest that this acceptance shouldn't be needed, it should just ""be"" as it were, in the same way that no-one questions my female status. But where it is needed and helpful, you have it from me at least and from many cis people I know."	9c1v8p	trans	52	0.94	2018-09-01 09:40:04
I think I might want to be a girl	"Ok so I am AMAB, and I‚Äôve been going by they/them since December 2021, and currently I identify as agender. Tonight, though, I had a whole breakdown because I thought I would be happier as a girl. I used FaceApp to gender-swap all of my pics (I currently present very masculine) and it made me really happy to see myself that way. The idea of being referred to as ‚Äúshe‚Äù and being thought of as female is really appealing to me. I just wish I‚Äôd realized this sooner, because I‚Äôm already mostly grown into a biologically male body (I‚Äôm 16). I‚Äôm super scared because my mom is really religious and I know she wouldn‚Äôt help me transition. I‚Äôm also really afraid to start transitioning, because, being raised as a boy, I was never taught to do makeup or how to take care of long hair. I just want to be a girl so bad, I‚Äôm bawling my eyes out right now and my younger brother is in the bunk right above me. I want to wear dresses, and put on makeup, and have long nails, and I don‚Äôt want to grow facial hair, or be super tall, or have a deep voice. I can‚Äôt stop crying. I need help.

Update: so that was fairly fleeting. I still feel like I would like to be a girl, but only‚Ä¶ sometimes? Does this mean I‚Äôm gender-fluid? I think it does. Thank you all :)"	"Hello friend, youre amazing! 
Also, I want to add that YouTube videos work WONDERS. I am afab but growing up, I relied HEAVILY on YouTube makeup tutorials, hair tutorials, etc. you can literally find anything on there. If you ever want someone to talk to, my dms are always open! Also, youre still so young you have soooo much time to transition, don‚Äôt fret! You are still blossoming into your awesome true self, this is just the beginning <3 as for the parents thing, I hate that. But I promise it will be okay. Like I said my dms are ALWAYS open
Do you want a hug?
okay so first of all you absolutely should experiment and explore that! gender is super complicated, not everything is sortable into neat boxes. 
second of all, 16 is like super super early to begin transition. it is not too late, it's never too late. at 16 your growth plates havent even locked yet, they dont in AMAB people until you're like 25. 
I'm AFAB and at 16 I didnt know shit about makeup or hair care or anything like that, it's super super common for people your age to have just started learning about stuff like that. it's a very recent thing for middle schoolers and high schoolers to start doing makeup and such, most people dont come into their own with stuff like that until they move out. I know things are very hard, but dont sell yourself short! I'm sure if it's your truth you will grow up to be a lovely young woman :)
I know it‚Äôs hard but if that‚Äôs what will make you happy know that you aren‚Äôt alone. We‚Äôre all here.
I've experienced something like what you describe a couple of months ago, thinking of myself as agender, being amab, discovering feminine part of myself. But I'm 34 now) So I hope you'll be lucky enough to use the time you have for further exploration of your gender.
Hey! Alt. Transgirl here and yes YouTube videos do wonders with helping teach how to care for hair and things.ive watched lots and lots of videos about doing makeup and things. I'm AMAB and present in my opinion very masculine and I'm 23üòÖ and still haven't gotten to transition because of the state I live in, so it's never too late even if you don't start to transition right away. But most importantly stay safe sisüòä may the ancients guide you.
A hug would be good
Thank you so much, that was so sincere and encouraging üò≠

My partner is now my gf	I‚Äôm 18cis-m and have been seeing my partner nb->mtf for 3months when I met her she was non-binary who used they/them pronouns and presented themselves as a gay male however today she told me she wants to transition to female (btw this isn‚Äôt a big deal I‚Äôm actually on the straighter side of bi) I wanna know how I can support her as she has bpd and I just wanna care for her and her transition	"The fact that you are asking here would mean a lot anyway.

Just be there for her. Stand up for her when you are with her if she isn't comfortable doing so herself. Maybe go out of your way to do nice, gender affirming things for her. Flowers, chocolates, etc. Really, this is something you'll find out in time as her insecurities show to you.

The best advice I can give is to treat her like a girl who might feel like she has been missing out her whole life ‚ù§

At the same time, maybe she is already comfortable with herself! You know what would mean a lot to me? If my partner asked what they could do to make sure I'm happy. Give her that for me, could you? 

You sound amazing, she's lucky :)
Use she/her pronouns for her and her chosen name.
I think one of the biggest things you could do to support her would just be to continue to affirm her gender like you're already doing and show her that you see her as a girl and as your girlfriend.

My mom doesn‚Äôt seem to believe I‚Äôm trans and asked if I might just be gay. I could use some support.	"I came out to my mom about two weeks ago and felt really uncomfortable afterwards. She seemed supportive, but she was especially emphasizing being careful before making any big decisions. I realized that I was feeling so uncomfortable because I felt that she didn‚Äôt see me as a woman, but rather as her son who wanted to transition, so I just didn‚Äôt want to talk about it anymore with her. I set up a gender counseling appointment for early February and she said she would follow my lead and that was that. 

Today she asked how was a different therapy appointment that I‚Äôd had and stressed that she didn‚Äôt want me making any decisions or taking any steps without talking to her and coming out to my dad to discuss with him. 

Then she suggested that I might just be gay, albeit prefaced by saying she didn‚Äôt mean to offend me, so I told her that I am in fact bi and I really didn‚Äôt know what to say after that because I couldn‚Äôt think of how to explain that being attracted to men wouldn‚Äôt make me want to be a woman.

I already can‚Äôt stand talking about these things out loud because hearing my voice and being so self conscious makes me really dysphoric, so trying to explain to her that I do just want to be a woman is really difficult when I know that she sees me as a man that‚Äôs thinking about transitioning. 

It hurts that she doesn‚Äôt get this and it‚Äôs really difficult that I have to explain it to her, but I know I‚Äôm going to have to. My plan right now is to wait until my counseling appointment because maybe with a diagnosis from a doctor she will see me differently. I just know it‚Äôs not healthy to bottle this up until then so I‚Äôd appreciate some kind words. 

I‚Äôm scared she won‚Äôt ever see me as a woman, I‚Äôm scared she‚Äôll try to delay me medically transitioning, and all of this has really made my dysphoria worse since being happy and feeling supported while transitioning now seems even more like a fantasy. 

Here‚Äôs hoping the counseling goes well."	"I mean, I am both gay AND Trans. Checkmate, atheists!
Honestly she seems like she means well and is just confused and or scared a bit about the unknown. Maybe just explain your feelings to her, explain a bit of the science of it and explain how hrt works and such so shes filled in.

I personally dont know what its like to be in this situation since i know my family is transphobic. so im just gonna move out next month and transition then. Pure independence from my ""family"" is the goal for me, i dont really care what they think
I think that since she's emphasizing so much the fact that she doesn't want you to take ""big steps"" she might be convinced that this is ""sudden"". 

What I mean is, you probably have been thinking and ruminating about your transness fro months, if not years, and have had all the time you needed to come to this conclusion. When we do come out tho, to other people it always seems ""sudden"" and ""unexpected"", especially if they were not very observant and didn't spot any ""potential signals"" (either they honestly didn't think that there was anything to notice or they didn't want to notice them... Also, quotes because not everyone gives signals.). 

If she is in good faith (and I hope she is) she might be not realising that you've been thinking about this for a long, long time, probably out of ignorance and fear.
Hey OP- mom of a (trans) son here. 

Maybe I can help untangle this or give you some insight. I can tell you that from what you've described she's trying to figure this out in a way that's respectful to you. She's not always hitting the target but she is trying and that's huge. 

Parents that are invested in their kids are always taking figurative barometer readings to see what they needed to do to get you to adulthood functional and on a good trajectory. Things like- how's your grades, do you have friends, do you have hobbies, etc etc. This new set of parameters you just gave her feels like it's going to alter your trajectory- and let's be real, in some ways it does. Thing is the trajectory she thought she had carefully tended for you wasn't accurate anyway because you've always been a girl and she didn't know that. But... We're parents. We've already weathered countless brief intense interests so the desire to put this ""Thing That Changes Everything"" in ""it's just a phase"" is really really hard to resist for the best of reasons.

If you're trans, it means you're mom missed something (even if she didn't). If she missed something, what else is there she missed? How has she miscalculated? What is the cost of that? Have you seen the world? No one wants their kid to be at the end of an angry mob. So... It's scary. But she's okay with therapy, and she's okay with you making the appointment with gender services. She's trying to figure out how to support you and honestly, I think it's fair to double-check. I just had a conversation with my son a few days ago about how it was okay to stop if he wanted to and he's pretty committed, he's getting a mustache at this point (woot!). It's not that I want him to be a girl, I just don't want him to feel like I have *any* expectation of him on this front at this point. Me checking in had been talked about and cleared by him, and I wouldn't do it if he wasn't okay with it. 

Confusing sexuality and gender is a rookie mistake which is corrected by a simple thoughtful conversation. She'll come around. I'm certain she'd be mortified if she knew you'd hurt her. Talk to her, keep the conversation going. In the beginning that's all my son and I talked about. We talked about how far he wanted to go, what the path to get there was, timelines, concerns, fears etc etc. Overall it's been a great experience and brought me closer to my son. He's taught me what grace means. Give her a minute to get her bearings. She's trying to figure out how to be the best mom she can for you, she's just flailing a little at the moment. Good luck and talk talk talk.

(There's probably auto correct errors in this, but I used most of my morning time to type this up so I don't have time to go through and edit, please be gentle!)
Only you know how you feel. The way I explained it to my mother is that I've always been this way, im just choosing to reveal it so I don't have to lie and hide anymore. My mother took a week to finally say she saw this was who I really am and that was all before ever looking or sounding the way I do now. My mom is now my greatest supporter. I revealed I am Trans about 6 years ago and have never been happier with myself. You have to understand in your own mind that once you begin transition, it just takes patience to make the you that you see in your mind appear to others. Be confident in yourself, nobody else can say who you are.
This sounds similar to what my parents did when I came out. My mom didn‚Äôt try to stop me or slow me down, but she did try to negotiate some things so she wouldn‚Äôt have to let go of her dreams for her ‚Äúson‚Äù. My dad tried argued against it and threw out a bunch of excuses for why I was feeling the way I was. Fortunately I was an adult so they didn‚Äôt have any control over my choices. My dad took longer than my mom to be supportive, but the bottom line is that they both came around after a while. Maybe your mom needs some time to get used to it.
That‚Äôs the thing! Same! It‚Äôs hard to explain how they don‚Äôt really relate to each other since I‚Äôm bi.
I think you‚Äôre right. I should be grateful that this is the situation I‚Äôm in at least rather than having parents who wouldn‚Äôt ever support me. I think the trouble is that our whole family really doesn‚Äôt ever talk about our feelings and starting with something as vulnerable and personal as this is really difficult, but I know that I‚Äôm going to have to.
I‚Äôve definitely thought about this and I think you‚Äôre right, and I think the solution here is also just to communicate better. This in and of itself hurts a little though, because it feels like if I had stayed in the closet for longer after accepting myself, potentially showing more signs and also worse mental health, she wouldn‚Äôt be so surprised. 

I know that that‚Äôs not constructive thinking though and I should focus more on the fact that I trusted her enough to tell her relatively soon after being certain of it myself. Thanks for the comment!
Thank you for such a thoughtful response, I really appreciate it. I know that I‚Äôm going to have to communicate about this eventually, as much as I want to put it off, and I think I was trying to use my being hurt as a way to push it off further. I‚Äôm hoping that I can have the kind of relationship with her that you described with your son, I wish you and him the best! Thank you!
Gosh are you me? I came out to my mother one week ago and everything you are saying is exactly the same in my situation. My dad took it way better. After comming out to him he defninitly was surprised and shocked but accepted it, hold me in his arms and said ""guess I'm having two daughters then"". He even tried to use  my name immediately. Guess we just have to give our moms some time. I gave her the genderdysphoria bible to read, cuz she is seeking for signs and advices all the time. The only picture of a trans women she knows is the one that was playing with dolls and dresses since early childhood and thats the only valid transgirl in her point of view. So I hope that the genderdysphoria bible will help to change her picture of transpeople.
you did what you felt was right for your mental health. it's also not on you to educate her, to be honest. you can communicate better, provide all the resources... but at the end of the day, you can take the horse to the water, but not make it drink. 

I hope that your mom will come around and understand you better."	sbcioz	trans	49	0.94	2022-01-24 03:48:56
I thought I hated the way I looked because I thought I was ugly never did it occur to me that I thought I was ugly because my gender did not match my body.	This entire time I hated the way I looked and how I felt. I stoped taking care of myself and  even had stopped taking selfie‚Äôs years ago only looked at the mirror cause I had to make myself presentable. Although people would say I was a handsome man and very attractive I didn‚Äôt see it. Then I found FaceApp and when I picked the gender swap option boom there she was. She was beautiful and for once I felt it. I felt what had been missing for long. Now I‚Äôm super depressed because I won‚Äôt be able to transition until things get somewhat back to normal cause this last three years have made it financially impossible.	"Super duper relatable, I was ugly and didn't care about my appearance, nothing I did looked good anyway. Turns out I'm a girl so of course I didn't like the way I looked trying to look like a guy
I think I'm in the same boat. Add to that a feeling that female clothing felt way more intressting than male etc
That was how I figured out I was trans as well, Ive always felt super uncomfortable and insecure about myself, feeling like I ‚Äúdidnt fit in‚Äù with the other girls, until I learned about dysphoria (I had heard the term in my preteens but never quite looked into it until i was a teenager) and everything seemed to make sense (to my partial horror lol, I live in the south and I was scared to find out that I would have to go through the hell of being transgender in the south lol)
But once I decided that Id give it a go and tell my friends I was trans, came up with a name and all, I hardly ever feel insecure about myself (unless Im around people who misgender/deadname me constantly)
Im so glad to hear that someone else had a similar experience because I was starting to second guess myself and think ‚Äúmaybe Im not actually experiencing dysphoria‚Äù lol, so glad youve figured yourself out, i hope your journey goes well for you!!
Edit: Wrong post.
It makes it super tough to do before and after timeliness when you spent the last 15 years avoiding or deleting every photo of myself
That's very relatable.
I know it‚Äôs hard. However look at the bright side and know that you are a beautiful amazing human bean."	vgq5ky	trans	50	0.98	2022-06-20 16:58:20
Hi, I‚Äôm Ashley Lilith, and I am trans woman (33mtf)	"I have no idea how to start any of this. I think this will be a long one. There is so much to say. 

My egg cracked a few weeks ago. I first came out to my wife (32f) as pansexual. Then a few days later I came out saying I think I want to be a woman. My wife is part of the rainbow team, and she is very supportive. We‚Äôve had conversations about it since. I am a massive lurker online and don‚Äôt really comment on anything (i think I am extremely socially anxious even online, and I also think I am autistic/ahhd but that‚Äôs not what this post is about). 
	I‚Äôve been reading posts across a few lgbt/trans sub reddits. I‚Äôve been learning so much reading everyones journeys and questions and answers. My wife suggested for me to make a post when I first came out but I said I wasn‚Äôt ready yet, even through an anon account. Today I‚Äôve found the courage to start sharing a part of my life‚Äôs journey‚Ä¶. (omg, my eyes are tearing up, wtf‚Ä¶ I‚Äôve always forced myself not to cry because men don‚Äôt cry, right?)

I hope that I will share more as I continue this journey. I also hope the read that follows is not an incomprehensible mess of words.

I‚Äôve spent the last few weeks reflecting upon things. I‚Äôve been making small steps. Picking a new name was the first. My wife helped because I didn‚Äôt want to choose a new name she didn‚Äôt like. We both like my new name. I‚Äôve spent time reflecting upon all the feelings and thoughts I‚Äôve had over my life which I pushed down because I thought I was a weird person, or I made myself believe what I was thinking or feeling is wrong. Now I‚Äôve learned normal people think about what it‚Äôs like to be a girl/woman, or wanting to be a woman, as often as I think about what it‚Äôs like to be a bird. (Spoiler alert, I‚Äôve thought about being a bird maybe 3 times).

Since coming out I‚Äôve been stressing over giving up my perceived manliness, which is, in a way, just a fabrication at the end of the day. In the last few days, I have noticed that I am ok with that, I want to be me and I want to be happy. I have decided that I do want to completely transition but at the same time I am unsure I want bottom surgery (this is probably a separate post). What is also scary and exciting is the part where I get to learn and be a woman.

I shaved my legs a couple of days ago and I freaking love the feel. I was so dysphoric about my legs, but after shaving them and seeing my skin for the first time, I kind of like them. I always told my wife I don‚Äôt mind if she doesn‚Äôt shave, I know it‚Äôs normal to have body hair, and I stand by that. But for me, never again (as annoying as it is, 100% worth!) 
	I‚Äôve also been growing my nails out for the last few weeks, and I did my best first attempt at applying nail polish. They are a bit messed up, some cracked in the first hour of drying ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è and I‚Äôve dinged them a bit. But omg! I love them so much, so happy with it :) can‚Äôt wait for them to get longer, and get better at nail care.

I also bought womens silky pajamas yesterday, light pink with greeny flower patterns. I was so excited for it. The shorts are perfect but of course I don‚Äôt really fit in the top. My upper body is my dysphoria, including my head. Big fat muscles, I am close to 100kg. I love muscles but the way. When it comes to muscly men I think ‚Äúgood job, well done‚Äù. But I am so jealous of muscly women, give me your body! (Or just any women tbh). Maybe I will be a muscly mommy. 
	Over the last fews weeks I think I‚Äôve come to realise that I will be ok with losing my large build and strength. I know it will be worth it. I can continue with my fitness journey regardless, I just won‚Äôt be as strong or big and I am ok with that. I also thing it was part of my dysphoria, trying to fit in as a man. If I am big, strong and muscly then I must be a man right? 
	Oh this point, and back to my perceived masculinity. I have thought about the dangers. I‚Äôve never directly witnessed any of it. It is a bit scary. I will be giving up my white male safety privilege. 
	I would like to add that I don‚Äôt have my male body, nor do I hate being a man. I don‚Äôt love it either. If my choice was taken away from me, I could continue to live as a man. But I don‚Äôt think I can find my true happiness until I am complete woman.

I‚Äôve already made contact with a local trans friendly health centre. At the time I said I was still thinking about whether I want to transition. Over the last few days I made the decision that it is what I want 100%, and I will be seeking to start HRT asap. I am planning on getting laser hair removal asap as well. But unsure if I should wait until after I‚Äôve been on HRT for some x period of time.

I‚Äôve only come out directly to two people. My wife and the person at the clinic. I plan to come out to my wife‚Äôs brother and his fianc√© when it feels right. They are both part of the LGBTQIA+ community, but it‚Äôs still very scary. I haven‚Äôt made plans about coming out to the rest of my or my wife‚Äôs family yet. Or at work. Weirdly enough, coming out at work has me the most anxious.

I can‚Äôt believe I am trans. I would have never thought this as my teenage self. There was so little exposure to this when I was growing up. Everything seems so grey looking back, so dreary. Even my high school uniforms where literally grey, with just a splash of yellow or gold. 

I think I will finish up. I don‚Äôt want to turn this into a book.

P.S. I wanted to share a picture I drew the day after I came out as trans, but apparently you can‚Äôt do picture posts with descriptions on reddit because of reasons. So I‚Äôll post that separately another time. It‚Äôs not fancy or anything, but made me happy. My wife said to me she has noticed I am more open and just in general more happy since I‚Äôve come out.

TL;dr; I am trans. I want to be a woman. I am going to be a woman. I am a woman."	"Aw this made me tear up just reading it! I'm so happy for you! It is a hell of a thing to come out of the closet and out of denial and open yourself up to other people. So congrats girl!
Hi Ashley! Congrats on making the first step! So happy for you! If you have any HRT or transition questions feel free to message me!
This was such a delight to read, I‚Äôm so happy for you Ashley!
Hi Ashley, I‚Äôm Ashley! Great name :). Glad you‚Äôre finding yourself, and glad you have a supportive partner.

I'm very happy for you but I'm just in love with the use of ""rainbow team"" lol
I'm very excited for you Ashley! I'm just a smol trans guy on the internet and I teared up reading this. It reminds me of the summer before my senior year of high school (which was literally August of 2021 lol) when I finally cracked my egg. Realizing that I wasn't going to be truly happy as a woman was a big first step for me. Going at first was hard but now that I've moved out of state for college and have been able to socially transition properly it's been so worth it to get through the harder baby steps and there's still more hard steps for me to take. I'm happy that you have such a supportive wife at your side. Having people like that in your life is gonna make things a lot better. It's all gonna go up from here. I'm sending you all of my well wishes on your journey. :)
Thank you so much :) I was so scared to come out. I can't believe how much of a relief it is to finally be out. Can't express how happy I am to be called a girl!
Hi, thank you :) I will definitely keep that in mind. There is so much, I am trying not to overwhelm myself.
:) Thank you. I was so anxious that I am just dumping too much out there. But there is so much I have to say.
Omg! Hi Ashley! It is such a great name! Thank you so much. I am so ready to fully discovery myself. :) :)
I'm also an Ashley from Australia. Hi Ashley's :)
Thank you so much, I do love it. :) I am going to try to be brave and share more as I progress :) :)
Thank you :) haha it is so great, and it just makes sense. Everyone should use it. And someone should make a someone should make a rainbow team banner with characters representing everyone. :)
Thank you so much for sharing with me :) I am so happy for you. I wish you all the best, and that every steps gets easier. But it will be so worth it ü´Çüè≥Ô∏è‚Äç‚ößÔ∏è I am very new at all of this but feel free to reach out if you ever feel like talking.

Holy shirt I came out in an interview	"Just wanna celebrate a win!!  45 AMAB trans woman JUST started medical transition in October and still present male but holy crap I came out in a job interview. I‚Äôm interviewing for a director role with a prominent community organization that provides gender affirming care so it‚Äôs not like a huge vulnerability,  but I‚Äôm just so happy to be able to talk about myself openly.  I gave my most authentic interview probably ever and was complemented on my openness.  I feels good to be out.

I made it. One year of this new life.	"On this day one year ago I was just looking up random things instead of sleeping. I went down a transgender rabbit hole and I couldn't slow down, I only sped up, all up until the point where my brain crashed at a million miles an hour into a brick wall with the words ""Oh Shit."" graffittied onto it.

On this day one year ago I renamed myself to Lilac. A few months later I picked out my last name, and a few weeks ago I found my middle name: Aurora.

On this day one year ago I was single. Within three months of coming out to myself I found a lovely trans girl on Omegle of all places. Seven months later I flew out across the country to meet my girlfriend in person.

On this day one year ago I was a virgin. Changed that. Loved every single moment that I could hold my girlfriend in my arms, and even more when she held me in hers.

On this day one year ago I was certain I was a 'straight cis man who was only into women.' So far the new theory goes that I'm attracted to femininity, and a very select few boys have caught my eye.

On this day one year ago I was thin and afraid that I would never be curvy. I bought hip pads and breast inserts when I started presenting femme. After half a year on hormones, and reassurance from my best friend and my girlfriend, I have started to present femme naturally. Even my boymode is beginning to crack.

On this day one year ago I was scared to be who I wanted to be. A few months passed and I joined my college's LGBTQIA+ student organisation. The next semester I was presenting femme and using my chosen name and pronouns.

On this day one year ago I was afraid to tell my family out of fear of eviction. The day before New Year's Eve I told my grandfather, who accepted my choice, even if it didn't mean much considering he *still* deadnames me sometimes.

On this day one year ago I thought I'd never look good as a trans woman. One year later and I've gotten enough confidence to say I look pretty cute. My girlfriend takes every opportunity to say she loves me and say how cute she thinks I am.

On this day one year ago I never thought I'd make it. I did.

This is your life. If you see something that you want you go and get it. If you know something needs to change for things to get better, make that drastic change. If you aren't living, you're not doing it right. Take it from someone who doesn't believe in the 'this is your sign' bullshit, if you know you need to push yourself to progress in your transition, then you go and do it.

If you think you won't look good, then go and steal looks other trans girls have, do cosplay, try makeup, restyle your hair, shave the hair you don't want.

If you're doubting yourself then take time to work it out. Debate what's going on and argue about how people actually act. 90% of people are too fixated on themselves to care about who looks like what or who does what. If you're the only one holding yourself back then do it anyway, worst case is that you'll regret it or feel embarrassed, but that's a problem for future you.

If you're lonely and want a partner, then work on yourself to become a better partner than anyone else. You'll eventually stumble into a relationship if you don't obsess over looking for one.

If you need a friend to push you then I'm here to push you. Do that thing. I know you can."	"I'm so happy for you friend! \^.\^  
There's nothing I love seeing more than growth, and from this it's seems like your frickin blossomed! :D  
I'm at the start of something similar and seeing posts like these always lifts my spirits, so thank you for sharing your experience. ‚ù§Ô∏è
Well done and congratulations. It was so uplifting to read this

Supportive parents (us) of trans daughter need advice/resources for talking to very likely non-supportive extended family (religious sisters/mom/nieces etc)	"Hello r/trans. First and foremost, thank you for being such a beacon of light and learning in a murky world for new-ish trans parents. So wonderful to see all the love and support and sometimes heartbreaking to see that support is not universal. 

Our 22 y/o daughter came out to us middle of 2020. We were blindsided but supportive from the start. We have a trans niece who transitioned 4 years prior who we are close to so we at least has a road map and supportive people we love who had gone before us. Huge help. 

We have honored our daughter‚Äôs wishes to allowed her space as she figured it out as far as telling my side of the family (they are fundy religious and Trumpy-maybe even more ‚ÄúPence-y‚Äù). Now she‚Äôs ready and does not care who knows or what they have to say about it. We are in the same place so it‚Äôs time. 

I told one sister/BIL in person a few weeks ago when we were together. While it did not go horrifically bad, it certainly was not great. Looking back, I feel like we ambushed them by not providing any context or soft place to land if they needed a moment to understand what they were hearing. They were shocked and said basically everything you are not supposed to say lol. Things settled down and they said they still loved ‚Äúhe/she/whatever we are supposed to say‚Äù. We will take that as a win with this group lol. 

We have always wanted to have these conversations face-to-face as we know we have nothing to hide or be ashamed of. However, having that last experience under our belt, we now see that it may not be fair to  just lay this on someone who has no idea it is coming. Especially knowing They have strong religious beliefs about this and hear about it/talk about it in church, and likely the media they consume as well. That said, they know we do not share those views and we have a generally loving/supportive family dynamic (with guardrails lol). This will be a huge bombshell though and will likely rip the guardrails right out of the ground- at least for a while. 

So our thought is to send a group email with some links to resources that may at least give them a little space to digest then set up a zoom chat with each family with our daughter over the coming weeks to ‚Äúget it all out there‚Äù in small groups.  Then perhaps set up small in-person introduction to their new niece gathering/dinner for those who are ready 

I know ‚Äúgoogle is my friend‚Äù and all that but I would really appreciate some advice and help from those who have gone before us. 

Thanks and much love"	"You‚Äôre doing your best and seem like really supportive parents, especially coming here to ask for advice. A group email is a great first step, where you can include resources so that your family can educate themselves.

My first thought here re: the zoom chats is that‚Äôs a lot of emotional labour, explaining, being put on the spot for your daughter. Has your daughter said she is comfortable with this? Her comfort should come first during this coming out process and it sounds like she just wants people to know and they deal with their feelings themselves. She‚Äôs lucky to have you and I bet that‚Äôs really important to her!

If it helps - I (nonbinary) did a social media post about eight months ago, talking about my name, pronouns and that I had started testosterone. I knew all my family would see it and didn‚Äôt want to have to have in person conversations with them. Some asked questions, some messaged me privately, some spoke to my mom, others are definitely still processing and in denial aha. I was able to do this because my mom is really supportive and I only ever needed her ‚Äúapproval,‚Äù which I got by casually telling her I was going to start hormones over the phone (it was a hard thing to say at first because I was worried about losing her but she‚Äôs still here and she is trying her best to understand and figure things out like you).

My mom is the one I explain everything I am able to in regards to how I‚Äôm feeling and what changes are coming. My family are religious and old fashioned and I just don‚Äôt have the energy for those conversations anymore. I can‚Äôt imagine going through meetings with all my family members to answer the same questions again and again when they have the resources and can talk amongst themselves. I hope this helps!
First off, great parenting.  A group email would probably work best. Especially with the links to resources.  It doesn't put anyone on the spot. It gives people time to digest the information. Obviously there will be questions, and probably resistance. But that can all be handled individually, making for less stressful conversations.  This is tricky stuff, and you attitude does help.
Thanks for being so supportive of your daughter. It‚Äôs great to read. You probably did this, but just in case: make sure your daughter actually wants all those video calls and meet ups.   
Frankly, I would feel like an exotic zoo animal that‚Äòs being shown around, if my family did that.  

She said she doesn‚Äòt care for their opinions, so why have her confront every family branch in a zoom call, if there are likely to be many bad takes?   
If I had a child  I would prefer to tell family members alone with my partner (like the email idea), with permission what amount of info I can disclose.  
I would keep the prejudices & doubts away from my child as long as possible and only invite people if it arises naturally, not as a ritual that my child has to go through to claim acceptance.  

Edit: grammar
It pisses me off to no end that religious = excuse to be a pos bigot.
Thank you and great advice. To be clear, we are 100% ‚Äúin support of‚Äù and 0% ‚Äúin charge of‚Äù any way she wants to handle it. If she never wants to speak to them about it in person, that‚Äôs ok. I would hope that‚Äôs not the case but that‚Äôs not my decision to make.
Great insight. We would never push anything she is not comfortable with. As I said above, we are in support port of, not in charge of any of this. She wants to get it out there and we are just looking for ways to ease everyone into it. My thought is it would be easier to get everyone together in smaller groups who have shown support before just showing up at a wedding or a holiday when everyone knows her as a male. Frankly, we would not do that out of respect for her and everyone else. We are low drama (although right in the middle of it now lol) so even though we are 100% on our daughters side, we aren‚Äôt looking to throw bombs either.

Edit to add- any meet ups/ zoom calls would be with those who are supportive and want to build a relationship with their niece/granddaughter. If they don‚Äôt, they are out of the circle of trust.
Its not an excuse but it sure is used as one. Jesus would be pissed :)

hey so,,	i‚Äôve seen a lot of posts recently. i just wanted to let everyone in this sub know, y‚Äôall are mothafuckin loved. it‚Äôs okay to be struggling in your transition and it‚Äôs okay to be content in your transition. it‚Äôs okay to feel stuck. no matter where you are in your transition, no matter if you‚Äôre closeted, i just wanted to let you all know that you‚Äôre not alone and if i can help in anyway, dm me or whatever. keep your head up yall, take care of yourselves. i feel like being all about your transition and thinking about being trans can be a toxic mindset and i‚Äôve been stuck in that mindset, it can be tough to get out of but if you are stuck in that mindset, i promise you, you can get out of it. please don‚Äôt give up ‚ù§Ô∏è	"[removed]

Am I in the wrong to do this? [TW: Transphobia, Mentions of Threats]	"Later today I intend to cut off my family, at least temporarily. While they have not done anything significant lately to provoke this, they continue to not or barely respect my identity.

For some context, I am in college. I had been planning to go home for Thanksgiving for some time, but I have learned that some extended family will be coming as well. This had me to start to think about how I felt about going, and I've realized I wouldn't be comfortable going anyway

My home family consists of my parents, and my grandparents. Of them, my mother is the only one who occasionally uses my name, but rarely and only ever when speaking to me. The rest continue to deadname and misgender me at all times.

They know this makes me feel, but insist that it would be too difficult for them to change, as they always knew me as *deadname*. My grandma, who I often video call with, will see me visibly upset after deadnaming me or using some overly masculine compliment or phrase on me, and pretend not to understand why I'd be upset.

They really haven't apologized for the hell they put me through when I came out, which I feel like I'm still recovering from. In fact, they still consider a normal response for my father to threaten to beat me, and threaten to shoot my friend, among many other things. That he was just angry and wouldnt have actually done it, and that absolves everything.

I've given them an ultimatum before. Told them that I would cut them off if they didn't support me. They told me I didn't get to make ultimatums. I tried to keep it up, but I cracked, and went back at the slightest show of acceptance. I regret doing that now.

But they are trying. Or at least my mom is. She's taken me shopping for clothes I want. She sometimes uses my name. And my mind tries to hold these up as big things, but listing them out now, compared to the things she's done in the past and not apologized for...

I also just know there are other things they are going to accost me for in the coming months that I'd rather not deal with. I'm likely going to be taking a break from college, or potentially dropping out since I feel like my major isn't for me. They have always stressed how important school is, above all else, and I would likely hear so much from them.

I'm just tired of them. They do nothing but drain me every time they call (which my mom and grandma do every. day.) They're so overbearing, and expect our relationship to be the exact same as it was before transition with no effort.

I'm just still worried about how they'd feel, which sounds stupid after how much they haven't cared about me. But it's still there in my mind, that they're deserving of more and more chances. But, are they really?"	"Put yourself and your wellbeing first. Everything else is 2ndary.
While I'm sure they won't be happy, that's kinda not your responsibility. It sounds to me like you've been nothing but patient during your transition and have marched to the beat of their drum for some time. Threats of violence aside, living life with a family that far up your ass is no way to exist. I've experienced the same and every life decision I've made never quite felt like my own until I cut them off. You deserve everything they refuse to give and more my dear. Please be safe, you are loved üíï
You don't owe it to anyone to let them be a part of your life. They're not entitled to your company, so they don't even have to do anything significant. If you don't want to talk to them, you don't have to. Besides, disrespecting you is definitely a significant issue.
As long as you don't rely on them for things like healthcare or finances (including school stuff), I don't see why you'd need to keep them in your life
Sounds like your mother is your closest family ally. I would tell her how I felt to see if she is willing to advocate and work on those who are not as supportive. She might be able to establish some ground rules for the others. Threats of violence should never be tolerated and you have every right to be safe from that and the misgendering and deadnaming. Your family needs some coaching and understanding and maybe your Mother can help. I would see how willing she is. It might make a huge difference. If not, I don‚Äôt blame you for your hesitation going home. Just protect yourself. Drawing a line might bring the change you are needing.
By everything i hold dear they do not deserve you. They don‚Äôt deserve more chances, and they don‚Äôt deserve automatic forgiveness. I had a friend who knew me since preschool. Didn‚Äôt hear a single thing about me being queer in all that time. Told him my new name and he never used the old one again. Some people have slips of the tongue, but some people just don‚Äôt want to actually care about it enough to change how they think.


It‚Äôs okay to put yourself first, it‚Äôs okay to be upset when people constantly and relentlessly disrespect you, and it‚Äôs okay to demand change before forgiveness. Ultimately with boundaries you can‚Äôt control other people, but really what a boundary is is the line that once crossed means someone isn‚Äôt fit to be in your life anymore. So if they cannot see *you* then by all means cut them out.
I agree that you have the right to keep your distance from them, but it also saddens me whenever I see someone forced to choose between themselves or their loved ones. I hope one day your family can see the error of their ways and love you because everyone deserves a healthy relationship with their parents.
Absolutely not.
Cut em off and live your life. You know what's right for you, which means you're on the right track. Good luck ‚ù§Ô∏è
There your family and you are connected by blood
The blood of the covenant is thicker then the water of the womb!
if that‚Äôs your only reason to keep in contact with your family‚Ä¶ i fear you may also need to evaluate your relationship with your own, my friend.
Wow I have 10down votes must not like my opinion my bad"	z12h77	trans	44	0.93	2022-11-21 15:58:59
My son is trans and he‚Äôs the best thing in my life.	"Hi everyone. I have a child that was AFAB and has been living as male for nearly 2 years now. I hope I‚Äôm in the right sub for this and I know this is long so if you don‚Äôt want to read so much, there is a TL;DR at the bottom. 

To begin, my son is turning 12 at the end of the month (Sept 27). A few months ago, he started puberty and it was so traumatic for both of us. He cried and I cried and it was so hard. It hurt me so much to see him in pain and I knew then that I‚Äôd do anything to take that pain away. I was just not ready for this to happen so soon. I didn‚Äôt start mine until I was almost 17 so I thought he had plenty of time. I immediately found him a therapist and he‚Äôs now into his third one that he‚Äôs been seeing for a few months (the first two didn‚Äôt work out but this one seems to be going well I think). And recently she told us that he is okay to start puberty blockers (yayy) so I‚Äôve been trying to find a pediatric endocrinologist that can get him started. I hate to watch him go through this horrible experience and it makes me feel so terrible for him. I hope to get him on the puberty blockers asap, especially with his birthday around the corner. Speaking of which, I want to do something special for him because the last few years have been very difficult between his father and I splitting (after years of fighting and me putting up with his abuse). I made the decision to leave and moved my son and I 3 hours drive away from there. My son knows his dad is a bad person and he doesn‚Äôt really even want to see him. He‚Äôs very protective of me and couldn‚Äôt stand seeing me being abused. There‚Äôs been so much pain and suffering in our lives and I really want this to be a special birthday for him. So any ideas are welcome. I can‚Äôt seem to get anything out of him. He won‚Äôt ask for much because he knows I don‚Äôt have much and he doesn‚Äôt want to stress me out but I keep telling him that money isn‚Äôt an issue and this birthday is going to be special whether he likes it or not. So I‚Äôm kind of on my own trying to figure out what I can do with him that will make it special. 

Anyway, moving on from that, I guess I‚Äôm here because I don‚Äôt know where else to go or who to talk to. I love my son more than anything in the world and he‚Äôs the most amazing person I know. He is just so smart, kind, and brave; he‚Äôs just such an amazing kid. He calls his cycle his ‚Äúman period.‚Äù Which I don‚Äôt know where he got that from but I love it. And yet, I have so many things that worry me. I know he‚Äôs strong and he can handle almost anything. I just want to do whatever I can to help. I grew up in a family that was very homophobic and made me feel terrible about who I was. I want to make sure my son doesn‚Äôt ever have to experience the shame, humiliation, and depression that my own family put me through. 

My mom says that it‚Äôs somehow my fault that I made him think he‚Äôs a boy because I‚Äôm so open about being pansexual and about my own struggles with my gender identity. I don‚Äôt really identify as either gender and I‚Äôve been using the label non-binary for now. I‚Äôm still figuring it out. I changed my name a long time ago because I hated my birth name, it was too feminine and it just didn‚Äôt fit me. I use a more gender neutral name now, Lee. But my parents refuse to call me by that name even though I‚Äôve been using it for close to 15 years now and they‚Äôre the only ones who call me my birth name, which I hate and it has a lot of trauma attached to it. I‚Äôm sure you all can understand that. 

I also caused a lot of drama when I named my baby Elliot (I chose that name after having an ultrasound and being told I was having a girl). My entire family hated it and I had people literally coming at me with lists of alternative more feminine names (like Ella or Ellen and similar) and berating me for choosing a ‚Äúboys name‚Äù for my female baby. But I didn‚Äôt care and I refused to budge. I just loved the name so much and now I‚Äôm so glad I didn‚Äôt give in because people have thought Elliot was a boy from the very beginning. For the first few years I was constantly having to correct people when they thought my baby was a boy and I thought I had a girl and of course he was too young to tell us yet. On top of the whole name thing, it bothered my family that I let my kid play with all kinds of toys and wear all kinds of different clothes. I never believed that toys and clothes should be gendered so I always just let my kid play with whatever he wanted and dressed him in a variety of clothing from both sides of the store because if I liked something then I got it and it never mattered to me if it was labeled for boys or girls. My kid played with dolls and kitchen sets and also cars and tool kits and so on. Whatever he liked, I let him have. I know that none of that made him trans. I know he was born that way and I believe him when he says he‚Äôs a boy. I‚Äôve had a feeling for awhile because he used to tell me that he liked when people referred to him as male and as he got old enough to choose his own style, he would always ask me to get him boy clothes and to let him cut his hair shorter and shorter every time. And I always felt my job was not to dictate how he dressed or what he played with but to just let him express himself however he wanted. He came out to me officially when he was 10 and I was scared at first because I felt like he was too young. But I also never doubted him for a second and I know that he is sure about who he is. I‚Äôm so proud of him because he‚Äôs so strong and so smart. 

About a year ago, he said that if he could have just one wish, he would wish that he was a boy. I cried. But I knew for sure that he was a boy and I would do anything to help him be himself. His happiness is all that matters to me. A few months later, he decided he wanted to come out to the family and even to people at school. Most of the kids at school thought he was a boy already because he looks like a boy. Fortunately, his teachers and counselors were very supportive and kind and they even let him use the one gender neutral bathroom in the office because he was afraid to use the boys bathroom or the girls. That helped a lot. 

The scariest part for me was coming out to my parents. I knew they wouldn‚Äôt be so open. My mom still thinks he is ‚Äúway too young to make this kind of decision‚Äù (she doesn‚Äôt understand that it isn‚Äôt a choice) and she‚Äôs told me that I‚Äôm pushing him in the wrong direction because I‚Äôm encouraging him by allowing him to dress how he wants and helping to get him put on puberty blockers. I know that is total nonsense and I‚Äôm not going to listen to anything she says. It just bugs me so much. She misgenders him a lot but I make a point to correct her every time and it‚Äôs actually gotten better lately. She is starting to use male pronouns more now and I‚Äôm going to keep correcting her if she slips up. At this point I‚Äôm giving her the benefit of the doubt and just trying to teach her that being trans or gay or whatever is not a choice anymore than her being straight and cis is a choice for her. I‚Äôm so proud of my son for everything he‚Äôs helped me achieve, for being brave and helping me to open up the minds and hearts of my family. I honestly never thought they‚Äôd accept him and even though it hasn‚Äôt been easy, it‚Äôs not as bad as I expected it would be. 

So I guess I am here for some advice and maybe also some stories from some of you. If it‚Äôs not too hard to share, I would love to hear what your experiences were like. And for those who had negative experiences, what is something you wish your parent or other loved ones had done or said to make your coming out and/or your transition easier? What do you wish they would say or do now that would make you feel more validated? The reason I ask this is because I want to make sure I do the right things and help my son feel proud to be himself and show him that I‚Äôm always on his side no matter what. 

I‚Äôm willing to do anything to make my son‚Äôs life easier. I know he will deal with some bad stuff and that I can‚Äôt protect him forever. So I want to prepare him for that. At the same time, I want him to see that there are plenty of good people in the world too, who will love and respect him for who he is. I want to show him that he‚Äôs not alone and that he‚Äôs loved and respected. 

I‚Äôm sorry for the long rant and I hope that I didn‚Äôt break any rules here. I just have been wanting to reach out to others for so long. I‚Äôve been wanting to hear stories, experiences, and advice. So that I can be the best parent I possibly can be for my son. Because especially now I am all he has (and he is all I have). He struggles to make friends. A lot of that is my fault because we have moved so many times. And having to start middle school online isn‚Äôt helping. It‚Äôs been him and me for a long time now but the last few months we‚Äôve been just the two of us at home all day every day because of the pandemic. 

I struggle with mental illness myself and I left his father because he was abusive. I had to move away from him for my own sanity and to start a better life for my son and myself. I wish I could get him to talk to someone but he has a hard time opening up fully and I never want to press him on anything because I don‚Äôt want to cause him any pain. I just want him to be happy. 

So if you‚Äôve read this far, thank you. And if you have any advice or stories or anything to share with me, I will be eternally grateful. 

If I posted this in the wrong place, I‚Äôm so sorry; please let me know and I‚Äôll remove it. If you can point me in the right direction then I‚Äôll go there. I just didn‚Äôt know where to turn. Life has not been easy for us. I know it‚Äôs been hard for so many people. I hope that everyone is staying healthy and safe. I look forward to reading your responses. Thank you so much in advance. You are amazing people and I love you all.

TL;DR: My young child (AFAB) came out as trans and I want to be as supportive as possible and make life easier, better, and happier for him. I‚Äôd love to hear your stories, experiences, advice, etc. Thank you.

Edit: I just noticed someone gave this post a wholesome award. That is so sweet. Thank you. You are all so amazing and I‚Äôm so glad I decided to post here. Your comments have made me feel so much better. ü•∞"	"I honestly dont have anything to say bc you seem like a grwat parent. It puts ME at ease hearing about binary breaking/gender ruless parenting and how i might want to parent my maybe future child. Ive been looking for examples and im glad i found one.
I have no advice for you but I just wanted to say that you seem to do everything right. You respect and support and love him obviously very very much and I think you're doing everything right. I think you're an amazing parent!
I'm crying right now, reading this. You're such a wonderful parent, and your son is so lucky to have someone like you in his life.

I identify as non-binary, but am seriously struggling with the possibility that I might just straight up be, but more on the masculine side, and I wish my parents were even half as supportive as you. I was accidentally outed by my well meaning brother to my parents, and have dealt with all sorts of"" comments such as ""keep it between you and your friends"" when I tried to explain my pronouns and ""you're perfect just the way you are, you shouldn't worry about your chest"" when I expressed severe discomfort and a wish to bind.

I don't have any advice other than to keep doing what you're doing. It'll be hard, sure, but with someone like you in his life, he'll make it through. Thank you for your story.
You‚Äôre doing everything right. You‚Äôre making the boy happy and even tho he has a crap way of showing it, as teenagers do, he loves you to death and back. If it would make him happy, I‚Äôm sure that the majority of people that have seen your post would want to wish him a happy birthday. There‚Äôs plenty of things that he might like on Etsy, so I would start there when coming up with a present idea. Maybe dog tags or his name on a necklace with his pronouns.
You're doing the best that you can by your son. Most parents wouldn't have done half the things that you've done for him and it just goes to show how much you truly care for him. If he isn't telling you what he wants for his birthday, it might be because he just wants to spend time with you. Birthdays aren't all about the presents. I wish you both the best of luck on your journey together. Be well and stay safe.
Females hit puberty sooner so try to get him male hormones quick I know some girls who grew breasts at 9
You sound like a really loving and supportive mom gj ‚ù§Ô∏è this is kinda random, but I was just curious because I don't really know a whole lot of gender dysphoria and stuff. I've seen some people, especially younger trans people, say that a lot of children are diagnosed with gender dysphoria by doctors/therapists before they start puberty blockers. I know that doesn't always happen though, so what are the requirements to get it? Like, do the doctors diagnose them as well beforehand? (Pure curiousity)
Thank you. I have always believed that everyone deserves to be loved and respected for who they are and not ever let society or anyone push their beliefs on others. It bothers me how my family tried to do it to me and it made me want to go hard in the opposite direction. I honestly struggled with my gender identity for a long time and I didn‚Äôt really know that I could be anything else but what I was told that I was. I just always felt like I didn‚Äôt fit into either category and didn‚Äôt realize that there are more options. But when my son came out, I started doing a lot of research on gender and it opened my eyes to so many things. I feel like I never would have been able to understand myself as much as I do now if not for my son. He expanded my world in ways that I never could have imagined. I have known I was not straight since I was little. But I didn‚Äôt really know much about how my sexuality related to my gender identity or expression. It‚Äôs such a beautiful thing. I now understand that gender is a spectrum just like sexuality. I hope to find a community where I live that I can get involved with and maybe meet some new people. My sons first appointment with his pediatric endocrinologist is later today and I‚Äôm so thrilled. It was originally scheduled for later this month but I kept on top of them and they managed to squeeze us in. I am so excited and also nervous. I think I still have so much to learn and I am always happy to learn new things. I appreciate your kind words. And wish you all the best in the future. ü•∞
Thank you so much! I always have so many doubts and I question myself all the time. Like I never know if I‚Äôm doing the right thing. I am constantly terrified that I‚Äôll mess things up. But I have severe anxiety about everything so it‚Äôs not just this. It‚Äôs only more extreme because my son is the most important thing in my life and I would do anything to make sure he has a happy life. I feel like this is the minimum of what a parent should do and I can never understand any parent who doesn‚Äôt love and respect their child. I know so many kids whose parents don‚Äôt accept them and it hurts me to see that. I wish I could take them all in and show them they are all amazing and beautiful and deserving of love and respect. And shame on those parents who can‚Äôt accept their own children for being themselves. Those people make me so mad.
I‚Äôm so sorry that you‚Äôre having to deal with that from your parents. I can relate. My own parents were extremely homophobic, as was my brother. I was bullied a lot at school and at home just because I never fit in. My own family called me a freak and a weirdo and my mom would compare me to other girls my age and ask why I can‚Äôt be more like them. I also have several mental health issues that went ignored most of my life. That led to self harm and multiple suicide attempts (all of which my mom still denies even when the scars are very much there on my body). It‚Äôs insanity how parents can be sometimes. I never thought I‚Äôd be a parent and never really wanted to be only because I was scared I‚Äôd be like my own mom. And sometimes I‚Äôm scared that I‚Äôm doing the wrong thing. I‚Äôve made a lot of mistakes, mostly because of my mental illness and putting up with my abusive ex out of fear. I know that stuff was very traumatic for my child. He‚Äôs seen me at my worst and it can be very hard on him. But no matter what, he knows that I love him and there‚Äôs nothing in the world that could change that. I even recently started seeing a therapist again because my depression has been so bad and I wanted to show him that I‚Äôm willing to work on myself because he‚Äôs been in therapy for awhile and he doesn‚Äôt think he needs it. So I thought maybe if I did it too then he‚Äôd see that therapy isn‚Äôt something to be ashamed of. My own family refused to put me in therapy because my mom was afraid of what people would think of her. Her reputation as the perfect mom was more important than her child‚Äôs mental health. The way my family treated me left me with zero self esteem and then they wonder why I am this way. I got the same kind of nonsense that you described like just be happy with your body how it is and just be normal and stupid stuff like that. It‚Äôs so ridiculous to me how anyone can say those things, especially to a child who is hurting and confused. My parents didn‚Äôt allow me to even have friends who were gay because they thought that it would like rub off on me or something. I don‚Äôt even know what they were thinking. I could tell so many stories about how my family treated me growing up but it‚Äôs not important now. I think of it as a learning experience. I could never treat my child that way. It‚Äôs not just wrong, it‚Äôs borderline abusive I think. 

I knew for awhile that my child was different and I was determined to let him figure it out on his own without pushing any sort of agenda or trying to put him in a box. It hurts me to hear stories of families rejecting their children. It brings me pain but also makes me so mad. When you bring a child into the world, you‚Äôre meant to love them no matter what. For awhile I identified as bisexual but then I changed to pan because I think it‚Äôs more inclusive and also bi implies there‚Äôs only two genders and I know that‚Äôs not true. Gender and sexuality are both spectrums and there‚Äôs so many wonderful amazing people all along those spectrums. Every single one of us is deserving of love and respect for who we are. 

I hope that things get better for you. If you ever want to talk, you can reach out to me. I‚Äôm always happy to chat. I appreciate how brave you are to share you story with me. And I hope you know that you are amazing and wonderful and that you deserve to be loved and respected for who you are. And nobody can tell you who that is. Only you know in your heart and mind who you really are. If your family can‚Äôt see and love the real you, then honestly that is their loss. They will miss out on an amazing person. I think you‚Äôre perfect just the way you are but not in the way that they see you. If binding is what makes you comfortable and happy, then that is part of who you are and you should do it. Never let anyone define you. It‚Äôs your life and you deserve to be happy and comfortable in your body. Whatever it takes to get you to that place, you should chase after it. I wish you all the best. Stay strong. And never forget that you are beautiful, strong, and you are loved. ü•∞
I just bought a beautiful flag that he found on amazon which is essentially the trans flag and over that is a heart with the pan colors. It‚Äôs beautiful. He pointed it out to me and said, ‚Äúlook it represents both of us.‚Äù So of course I could not resist buying it. He‚Äôs also been complaining about needing a new phone for awhile so I spoke to my parents and they helped chip in to get him a new phone in his favorite color. He got it this weekend and I think he is very happy about it. Also, last week I took him to get his hair cut because we haven‚Äôt gotten a hair cut since the pandemic started and he was very unhappy with his hair. I took him to a highly recommended speciality salon instead of the cheaper ones we usually go to because I wanted to make sure he was happy with it. And we looked through some photos of haircuts for men and talked with the stylist to get it just right. And I think it looks amazing. It‚Äôs actually the first time he has gotten a haircut and not had a single complaint about it so I think that means he likes it too. He‚Äôs also been asking me for some new clothes because a lot of his stuff is old hand me downs from his dad and older brother but for the most part he just shares my clothes because I have a ton of men‚Äôs stuff that I like to wear (I have a good mixture of men‚Äôs, women‚Äôs, and gender neutral clothing and we‚Äôre about the same size). I always let him pick out what he wants but it‚Äôs been awhile since we went shopping. He asked me yesterday if I‚Äôd take him to the mall soon to get some new clothes and shoes for when school reopens. So if we have time, I‚Äôll surprise him with a trip to the mall later today. I think he‚Äôll be thrilled. Whatever it takes to make him happy, I‚Äôm there. Because his happiness brings me happiness. 

Also, even though I wasn‚Äôt able to get him into the endocrinologist before his birthday, because they were booked out for like a month, I stayed on top of them and kept calling and bugging them until they agreed to squeeze us in earlier. They put us on the list to be first if anyone canceled and then they called me Friday and said they had an opening this Monday and so of course I said yes we‚Äôll take it! So in a few hours we will be seeing the endo for the initial appointment! I‚Äôm so excited. And I‚Äôm sure he is too even though he isn‚Äôt showing it. He‚Äôs been very pessimistic because he doesn‚Äôt believe he‚Äôll be able to get on the puberty blockers. For one they are super expensive. And I‚Äôm currently unemployed. I don‚Äôt think insurance covers it. But I‚Äôve promised him that I‚Äôll do whatever I have to do to get him on it as soon as possible. Even if I have to max out all my credit cards and take out some loans. Whatever it takes, I‚Äôm not giving up. I told him that his treatment is my number one priority. He knows all of the things I‚Äôm putting aside for this. Like continuing my education, upgrading my equipment for work (since I do freelance work from home and my stuff is old) and whatever other things I need. But like I‚Äôve told him over and over again, those things can wait. His happiness and comfort cannot wait. I hope that as things progress he will see that I‚Äôm not bluffing and that I‚Äôm 100% here for him. Nothing is more important. And of course I know that he‚Äôs going through a lot with just starting puberty and the wrong kind. It‚Äôs hit him very hard and I can‚Äôt blame him for feeling so miserable. I can‚Äôt even imagine how hard it must be for him going through this. And I just hope we can get things moving fast to stop it. I cry a lot about this because I can see he‚Äôs in pain and he is always trying to hide it from me. Because I suffer from several mental health issues and am recovering from drug addiction as well as ptsd from years of abuse, he has seen me in a lot of bad ways. There‚Äôs been times when I couldn‚Äôt get out of bed for days and he started to notice that I wasn‚Äôt eating so he‚Äôd bring me food and watch me eat. It‚Äôs almost like role reversal but I wasn‚Äôt able to control it. So I‚Äôve started therapy again recently because I realized that this is not healthy. I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôve ever had a healthy relationship in my life. But I don‚Äôt want my son to suffer anymore because of me. I am constantly afraid that it‚Äôs too late and the damage has been done. But now I have to put my own feelings aside and take care of him. Because he needs me. And I know the sooner we can get him treated, the better and easier it will be for both of us. I‚Äôm sure the next few years will be very hard on him. But I‚Äôll always be there to support him. He‚Äôs my baby and I love him so much. And I know he loves me too. He‚Äôs just scared. Which I can understand because so am I. But I know we will get through this together. The main thing that he‚Äôs been complaining about is that it will take forever until he can really be himself and I can‚Äôt really help that cuz he‚Äôs so young. I try to tell him about people who‚Äôve had to live half their lives in the wrong body and how lucky he is to be able to start treatment at 12. And I found out recently he can even start hormones at 16 if he wants which means he‚Äôll only be a bit behind his male peers as far as starting puberty. And hey I started puberty at 16 and was the last person in my peer group to start puberty and looked like I was 12 when I was 16 but I got through it and so will he. But it‚Äôs hard to explain to a 12 year old that he can‚Äôt just get everything done in a day. These things take time. But I also know that time tends to fly by. I‚Äôm so excited to get him started on his path to his true self. 

Anyway, sorry for the long rant. I honestly haven‚Äôt had anyone to talk to about this and it‚Äôs been eating me up just keeping it all inside. Thank you so much for your kind comment. I know I‚Äôm not perfect but I‚Äôm trying as best as I know how. I didn‚Äôt have the best role models for parents and I also rushed pretty quickly from my parents abusive home into a marriage with an abusive man, which took 12 years for me to get away from and even in the last year since I left for good, he‚Äôs still got a hold on me (as the biological father of my son) and my son sees that and it hurts him. He doesn‚Äôt even want anything to do with his father who isn‚Äôt really a father at all. I‚Äôm basically his mom and dad. Which sucks for him, I know. He deserves better. I know I‚Äôve got so many problems. And I know my kid has had to deal with a lot because of me. I‚Äôm really working hard to make our lives better. I‚Äôve always put my own mental health aside because I didn‚Äôt think it mattered and I tried to control it myself and hide it but I know now that I can‚Äôt be a good parent unless I take care of myself too. So that‚Äôs what I‚Äôm doing now. I know that things will work out and one day my son will be happy. No matter what he will always have my support. Because that‚Äôs the minimum I can do as his parent. 

Anyway, it‚Äôs time for me to go get ready for the morning routine. I have to wake kiddo up for school soon, which is never easy. 

I hope everyone has a great day and week and all of that. I appreciate all the kind comments. You have really made my day. I‚Äôm glad I took the chance to post here because I was not sure what kind of reaction I‚Äôd get. But I feel a lot better now. So I‚Äôm glad I went for it. Thank you so much. You‚Äôre all amazing.
Thank you so much. I‚Äôve made a lot of mistakes in my life and as a parent but accepting him for who he is is the easiest thing to do. I don‚Äôt have any problems there. 

I did try my best for his birthday. You can read my comment above (you might not want to though cuz it‚Äôs so long). Basically, I got him a new phone (with some financial help from my parents), a haircut he loves, a few other little things I knew he wanted, and also I‚Äôm gonna take him shopping for some new clothes and shoes for when schools reopen (which I would have done sooner, but he just told me yesterday that he wants to go to the mall to get clothes so I hope I can take him today if we have time after everything else we‚Äôve got going on today or if not today, then sometime this week for sure). 

And the thing I‚Äôm most proud of: I managed to get him an appointment with a pediatric endocrinologist today! Initially, the appointment was a month off. But after I bugged them to please fit him in sooner because he was suffering a lot, they called me back on Friday and said they had an opening for Monday which made me so happy. This whole thing is hitting him pretty hard and I want to make it stop like before it started (if I knew it was going to start so young, I‚Äôd have started planning things way sooner, but sadly I can‚Äôt go back in time and I thought I had so much time because I didn‚Äôt start puberty until I was 16 so I was not ready for this to happen at 11, but it‚Äôs happening now and I‚Äôm trying my best to correct it). I just hope things go well at the endo today. I‚Äôm happy that we are finally on the path towards a better life for him. Because my sons happiness is the most important thing in the world to me. üòä
I know but it‚Äôs crazy because I am also AFAB and didn‚Äôt start puberty until way late. I was almost 17 before I started menstruating and thought something was wrong with me until my mom told me that she also started late. So I was so not ready when my kid started at 11! We have been trying so hard to get him puberty blockers but they are expensive the the insurance keeps denying us. Luckily we have an amazing team on our side who will fight this. We are now waiting for an appeal and we hope it will be good news. I wish I had known sooner. I started my son on therapy when he was 11 but I had no idea that it was already happening. I wish I had known so I could have gotten this started sooner. But I really was surprised given my own family history. I was just as devastated as he was when I found out it was happening so soon. I cry a lot about it because I just want to make life easier for him and I feel so helpless right now just waiting for a decision. It sucks. All I can do now is be there for him and try to be a source of comfort and support while we wait. Hoping we get a positive decision very soon! ü§ûüèª
Thank you; my son is the most important person in the world to me and his happiness is very important to me. I think this is just what should be the norm for any parent, even though I know it‚Äôs not. It saddens me that so many parents refuse to accept their children for who they are. I love my child no matter what gender identity or sexual identity or anything else. He‚Äôs always going to be my child and nothing can ever make me love him less. 

So I‚Äôm not sure how it goes in other places, but I can tell you the process we had to go through (and are still going through). The first thing we had to do was get him a therapist who specialized in gender dysphoria in children his age. We went through three therapists before we found a good one and he‚Äôs been seeing her once a week for several months. Before anything can even begin, therapist must get to know my son and determine the correct diagnosis. If she thinks that he is in need of medical intervention, she must then write a letter explaining her diagnosis and recommendations for my son. She will be the first person who decides whether he needs and is ready to be put on puberty blockers. Once we got this letter, we then had to go to his pediatrician (or a general practitioner depending on what you have) to speak to them about the whole situation (which they have been aware of as they have been getting regular updates throughout). At this point, his doctor must provide a referral to a pediatric endocrinologist. With the referral from the doctor and the therapist, we were finally able to schedule an appointment with a pediatric endocrinologist. After meeting the endocrinologist and discussing our short and long term goals with her, she then had to order a bunch of tests, which required us to schedule an appointment with a lab where they took my sons blood for tons of tests. Once the results of all the tests came back clear (as in there was no reason for concern), then we had to meet again with the endocrinologist to go over the results of the bloodwork, what everything meant, and whether he was clear to take blockers. She explained to us the possible side effects, we discussed our options, and made a decision together as to what would be best for my son. Through all of this, he is still meeting once a week with his therapist. Once our team of doctors, along with my son and me, agreed on a course of action, we then had to put in a request to our insurance for the puberty blockers, which they have already denied us twice and we are now waiting on an appeal. In the meantime, the endo put my son on a form of birth control pill to stop him from menstruating in hopes of reducing his dysphoria just a little bit. All in all, it‚Äôs been about a year and we are still waiting for him to get the approval to get started on puberty blockers. A little side note, when I called to schedule the appointment with the endocrinologist, I was told that both parents would be required to show up there in person and sign a bunch of paperwork. Fortunately for me, I did my own divorce papers and my crazy ex just signed them so I have full custody and legal rights to make medical decisions for my son without my ex husbands approval. I can only imagine what it would be like for other kids who might have one sympathetic parent and another who wasn‚Äôt so much because if they are married or shared custody, then both parents would be required to appear and honestly if I was in this situation and my spouse refused, I would leave him immediately and do whatever it takes because my child‚Äôs happiness matters the most. Luckily for us, we didn‚Äôt have to deal with that. I feel terrible for all those kids who have to deal with horrible parents who can‚Äôt accept them. Anyway, since I didn‚Äôt need my ex there, I was able to sign all the parental paperwork and my son had to sign some paperwork as well. And now we are just waiting. We were told that they do give hormones to kids usually around age 16, but that it could be given a bit sooner if the whole team (doctors, therapist, parent(s), and child) all felt that it was the right time. But that wouldn‚Äôt be for another several years yet. Which means my son is just being forced to deal with going through the wrong puberty and it‚Äôs very difficult. 

So if anyone tries to tell you that it‚Äôs an easy process, they are lying and most likely have an agenda. I‚Äôve heard so many stories  from people who want to ignore the existence of trans people, despite the science that supports their existence. They want people to believe a young child could just walk into a clinic and walk out with hormones. That is absolutely ridiculous and an outright lie. Stories about kids getting hormones and irreversible treatments at a young age with no parental approval and many many sessions with a therapist are so fake and lie simply propaganda to scare people who don‚Äôt know what it is really like. No child is getting hormones or any other life changing procedures. Puberty blockers only delay puberty to give the child a chance to think about how they feel and figure out who they are without have to deal with the stress of going through potentially the wrong puberty. If the child changes their mind, they simply stop the puberty blockers and there is no long term impact. They will eventually go back to having their natural puberty and no harm done.

I‚Äôve also spoken to many young trans people in various stages of transitioning. None of them had it easy. Not a single person. Everything we have done for my son so far is just to get him on puberty blockers and it‚Äôs a long, complicated process. My son is suffering all the time because of this. It‚Äôs so hard to see him in pain. I wish we had a better system in place. Way to many young people cannot get help and end up doing things that are just tragic. Sorry for the rant. I hope I answered your questions. And feel free to ask me anything else. I‚Äôm always happy to help. 

Oh wow I also just realized it‚Äôs been a long time since this message was posted and I am so terribly sorry that I didn‚Äôt see it before now. Life has been crazy. 

I hope everyone is having a wonderful Holliday. Merry Christmas and happy new year to all! Here‚Äôs hoping that 2021 will be a better year than 2020! ü•∞
Thank you! I wish you two the best as well."	ixi1bn	trans	39	0.9	2020-09-22 06:17:16
So I left most all my trans support groups on FB	"So I'm posting here as I'm assuming I'll get hate and I'd just rather it be from random internet people I guess. 


So i left pretty much all the trans support groups I was in on FB because I found them neither supportive nor caring. I find that pretty much all trans spaces are geared towards trans women only even if they are listed for everyone. I find that there is little care about trans men one way or another. And there definitely isn't any support out there. 

I don't fully understand why trans men are so disliked by most of the trans community but it seems like unless we are a bottomless pit of support and love and encouragement for trans women and non binary individuals and never ever seek support ourselves we are not welcomed or wanted in trans spaces. 

I'm tired. I'm struggling. And i need some kind of support and care. It's just not out there for me or those like me. I feel I made a lateral move instead of one upward. I traded being a short fat ugly woman to be a short fat ugly invisible guy. I feel more at peace in my body but less loved. Less cared about and not supported. I spend near constant engery pouring love support and care into trans people. From my partners to strangers on the Internet. I have helped women get meds, hrt, therapy, jobs, i have helped find safe havens for them and helped fight off transphobic shitty bullies. All for my community and the sake of the greater good of trans people. But any time I'm on that edge about to fall. I cry out to help and I get back nothing short of someone telling me to just shut up and jump. Trans women recycling shitty toxic masculinity advice like just shut up and deal with it. People dont like men who are emotional. Cis male ""supporters"" telling me to man up and accept this is part of being a man. Other trans men giving either recycled toxic masculinity advice or just remaining silent. And non binary people telling me they have it worst so I shouldn't expect them to give me any support. 


Trans men still have crazy high suicide rates after transitioning.... Doesn't that alarm or bother anyone besides me? Why do we care so little about some 49-51% of our community? Because they arent always hot? Because they aren't beautiful? Because we can't ""fully"" transition in the same manner women do? 


I'm not going to kill myself but I find I think about it more then I would like. And more often then I was.  I get so lonely. So isolated. I get constantly reminded I don't matter. No one would care if I was dead beyond those immediately affected. There are no headlines about trans masc suicide rates, sexual assaults rates, or murder rates. It happens. We just don't report on it or share it. Or pay attention really. We honestly just don't care what happens to our men when they arent playing unlimited support giver.  No I'm not gonna kill myself anytime soon. But I do believe I added to the chances I might someday. 


I miss attention. I miss being cared about. I miss people listening. I miss being able to dress up and show off. I miss people being physically attracted to me. I miss knowing which parts were sexy parts, though I suspect the reason idk anymore because I don't have sexy parts. I don't put high value on looks but that doesn't mean I don't enjoy looking attractive or giving myself care. I haven't able to shop for my new body for most all of my transition. I silent cry when I walk into the men's department. Knowing every thing there will just help me look short. And fat. And even if I feel mildly cute in anything there's no validation to be given by anyone. 


I'm trying to work on myself to fix the other things that aren't right thanks too trauma and violence against me. But most days I wonder whats the point? So i can do all this work just to take care of other people who don't care when I'm hurting who wouldn't lift a finger to stop me from killing myself or don't care to try and save others like me. I feel I'll only get healthy to be torn down and used up and left behind yet again... 

I'm tired.  I'm hurting. I need something from people. I don't expect to get it or to feel better. But I wanted to shout into the void of the internet in desperation and pain. Maybe someone will hear me crying.. "	"I can't speak from personal experience but I've heard that online support is usually flooded with MTF folks but in person support groups have better FTM representation? I'm sorry that you've found it so hard to find help. Your struggles are valid and you deserve love and support! It pains me to think that you've been pushed out of any space that should be welcoming and supportive. On the other hand you seem really level headed despite this, which is great. I really wish I could do or say something more to support you. Please don't give up hope!
I see you. Your feelings are valid. You are important. You can do this. 
You know 

My friend killed himself because of something like this his name was David he had the same thoughts and feelings as you he thought no one supported him and no one cared he felt like he went from an ugly woman to an ugly man 
And you know what no one else matters I‚Äôm here and I‚Äôm sure trans women and trans men alike will stand with you we need to kill the suicide rate in the trans community I‚Äôm here to support you pm if you need to 

We‚Äôre all trans here so we need to support all trans people 
May I suggest a group to you? It‚Äôs called stand in families and it‚Äôs for all  LGBT people and their allies - I‚Äôve added trans men to it before and you‚Äôll find nothing but love there 

[here it is ](https://m.facebook.com/groups/182960185905448?ref=share) 


I myself am not transgender- I am in all of these subreddits however because my daughter is and If you ever need someone to talk to or a shoulder then I‚Äôm right here my friend


Albeit, I would rather not notice some things, you are indeed correct. There is a favourtism toward MtF. And that is coming from one. For more direct support from our brothers, r/ftm is a wonderful place filled with the same love and respect we all expect and share. 

We are brothers and sisters in this cause and in this stand. We are all valid equally without the offhanded favourtism. To put my point clearer, you and all ftm, all trans in general, are valid. Are loved. Are respected. 

Just because we fight against it, it does not make our own community without toxicity. As sad as it is, it is the truth. Keep speaking to this void of randoms here. Keep your heart open for those that will listen. We are here. Reddit has become the one common ground that i actually feel respected (when i speak). There will always be a troll or two, but here love and respect definitly wins out.

Power to you and your endeavour honey. 
One of the reasons I'm terrified of admitting to myself I could be trans is because of the way it seems ftm people are treated. I am scared of being even more invisible. I'm scared of feeling invalidated because, despite feeling male, I still have feminine interests, I still want to be... cute? And I feel like, if I admit this, I'll become even more invisible. Just because I don't want facial hair (I find body hair uncomfortable; I've got ASD and sensory issues). I still like pink, and glitter. I just feel like I am a male. I feel like there won't be any support out there at all for me, and instead I'll be bombarded with ""maybe you're nonbinary"" statements. Maybe I am. I could be trans male. I could be nonbinary. I'm still confused, and I'm still heavy in denial, and I don't even want to think about not being in denial if this is really how ftm people are treated. I'm sorry, I've been bottling all these feelings up for weeks. It's hurting a lot. Not the invisibility of ftm people, just the whole possibility thing. 
I definitely get it, as trans women we are still socialized as if we are men early in our lives and I think there's a tendency to carry some of the habits picked up from that into our womanhood. I've actually gotten the most out of predominantly trans man general trans support groups because there's rarely a few people dominating the conversation, everyone gets to speak, it's quiet and respectful, and my introverted self doesn't come out of it feeling exhausted. 
You are visible. You are valid. And you are correct, at least from as far as I've seen.
Men in general are left to suffer their emotional problems on their own, and I never liked that. I hate that the society we live in coddles women to an extreme while isolating men to the opposite extreme. It's not a good thing for anyone.
But I know it isn't going to change over night, nor will it even begin the slow process without someone talking more about the problem. So thank you for sharing and bringing awareness to the fact that men deserve support too. I genuinely hope you find someone in your life you can help support you when you hurt as well.
Sending love and hope your way....
You sounds like you need some cuddles and love from the girl who is in love with you.

(HINT: that's me!)
I know this won't feel great, but that isolation, loneliness, and lack of support? That's something all men feel in this era. 

Most of the acceptable norms are toxic. No matter what you try someone will view you as suspicious, a threat, dangerous.  Social services send you to the back of the line, there's an innate need to nourish the vulnerable and men are not the vulnerable ones. Empathy is scarce, non-sexual touch is all but nonexistent. If you've experienced any other type of environment, the male world can be cold, cruel, and unnecessarily desperate. Male suicides rates have always been high, and young, aberrational men have always been society's go to scapegoat. When a man is murdered, surely he pissed the wrong guy off. When men are sexually assaulted, the typical response is to push it down and tell themselves they wanted it in the first place.

As a MtF who is still exploring everything, I am sorry for my prejudices.  I am sorry for my ignorance. Testosterone has been nothing but a curse to me, an unwanted poison, and I'm still working on purging the toxic aspects of my male identity that muddled every potentially healthy relationship with errant desire. I can empathize with your situation to a point, but I can't process why anyone would trade softness and style for rough fabric and cold steel. 

It shouldn't be surprising that within a subculture of a system so heavily divided by gender there should be another gender gap, but it's disappointing. We can try to be aware and caring, but it seems like we can never shake ourselves fully out of genderfucked slumber.

I'm guessing you are stuck in the limbo where safe spaces that are available to cis men to unwind and commiserate are not safe for you due to bigotry and ignorant misogyny. I encourage you to still look for spaces outside the immediate LGBT community where you can make connections and form bonds outside of the nexus of identity. Take up a hobby or pursue an established interest outside your home. Otherwise, I think trans men should form an international brotherhood, handshakes and rituals, smoking parlors and big pool tables, and a code of conduct of the utmost respect. There's an old school masculinity that could be very cool if it was only stripped of the toxic power dynamics, and you get to be part of an emerging cultural movement.

I hope that I didn't adopt a bullshit tone, but it's hard to write about this kind of thing without ordering up a full platter of feet.  I want to share the love and support that I have felt with my FtM allies, but I'm just so messed up from past trauma that I keep dredging up my own shit.  You are valid.  You are worthy.  You deserve love, respect, and your own supportive crew.
It doesn't matter be the real you
I'm not a trans person and being completely honest I don't know any either, I'm not anti trans or anything like that I'm a live and let live kind of person just how things have occurred.

As a 41 year old guy who all through my life has been incredibly uncomfortable in my own skin mostly the worry of what others think of me, I've kind of hit a realisation in recent years that has really helped me cope with my issue with self image.

It is essentially that I can't control how others feel or think do why waste time worrying about it.  Essentially I've thrown myself into all the things I love and enjoy in life, my hobbies, walking the dog and just decided to be comfortable being myself. 

That's not to say I don't have anxious days but I've found through experience I've learned coping mechanisms for it that really help. 

For me it's stretching everyone is different, sometimes I'll read a favourite book and both of these distract from my feelings of anxiety. 

The thing to remember is you deserve to be happy just as much as the next person and don't let feelings of self doubt or the odd ignorant person make you feel any different.  There's a great line in the film Cool Running where a guy is upset at the hostility they are recieving and he's talking to his friend about it and he tell him ""it's because we're different, and people are always afraid of what's different"". 

For every idiot out there though there will be people who will want to be a part of your circle so don't be afraid to seek them out. 

It has been nearly 3 months since this post I found right now, so HOPEFULLY there are some things that have changed for the better, but if not, at least you're still here (HOPEFULLY) so there are more opportunities to be had.

I'm a trans guy and acknowledge the tendency to give up on social support seeking, especially because I identify as a transsexual, and most local groups are transgender specific.  While I am a transmedicalist, personally, I respect various dysphoria experiences different from my own, but feel:

1. jealous (working on it) of trans men with less dysphoria
2. sad to be reminded of when I was pre-surgery because I actually at least had a girlfriend then

So, I am a loner now.  And even the presence of presumably (you never really know) cis men pisses me off, because they usually have more energy to banter and thrive, and, frankly, because, I find (most of) them obnoxiously territorial, and I can't keep up with the powerplays.

However...
If the local trans support group available to me is mostly trans women, I would be a happy camper.  Because trans women are women and trans men are men, and I am straight, and I never get to be in close quarters with women.  Not to date, even, but for women presence, because life is a real pr1ck fest; actually, that is another reason I avoid trans men, too.  No more pricks, I pray.  I am so tired of men, whether long or short, non-op or post-op, cis or trans, it's always a poke or be poked poney parade.

Idgaf about operative status of trans women, because I try not to think about womens' private areas, as a gentleman.  But, with guy presence, it's... different.  Anyway, there's nothing wrong with crying, and it is super typical and particularly manly, honestly, because most guys do have what I call Open Mouth Syndrome.  You can't get fed if you're not begging, as a guy, whether trans or cis.  Something I love about trans women is that they seem to have the intuition to notice, and with the perspective of being socialized around guys, seem less judgemental (or more desensitized, more patient, more run down) about this fact.
Yeah we‚Äôre not immune to gross attitudes. Many mtf folk totally seem to have a majority mentality in our little minority. And like hey, just maybe consider who your audience is, and make sure you‚Äôre not making the most vulnerability among that group feel even more marginalised? Yes we‚Äôre all struggling, yes we all need to vent our emotions, but maybe take an extra second to put someone else‚Äôs feelings before yours when you‚Äôre making a public post?
Last time I went to an irl support group. There was me and 1 other transman with 9 transwomen. 

The other ftm and I left to get New York fries cause it was very uncomfortable. 


That being said.
I stick around normally cause someone needs to be there to prove we exist and to help the others out.


Being trans does not exclude one from toxic masculinity. I've seen both the carry over from living my life socialized to be a man, as well as trans-men who take on a hyper masculine role to pass as male. It's harmful and something I actively fight against in my own experience and call out in others when I see it. OP, I'm sorry that you've run into this more than not. 
I'm not interested in hiding out in solely trans masc spaces because trans women struggle to face their own toxic upbringing. All those things you listed about society and not caring about cis men, they also don't care about cis women when those happen. Hence the questions of ""what was she wearing. Its probably her fault. She probably provoked her husband that's why he killed her.""  We still say this shit now about cis women. They die every single day mulitple times a day from rape, murder, sexism and we dont even pay attention. 

I know what is part of male era. I was well aware of this before transitioning. I just was not aware that trans women ran trans spaces and made sure we understood they didnt give a fuck if trans men live or die. 

Your statement of why anyone would give up being a woman to be a man can be flipped around just as easily. We give up what we do so we don't kill ourselves just like trans women. 


As far as not being able to get past previous trauma, you know no one listens to cis women/afab people about be raped or assaulted right? And it normally starts for most of us long before puberty.  


I'm actually not stuck in any limbo. I move in and out cis male spaces just fine. Its the whole issue that trans women think and expect trans men to leave trans spaces alltogether and either go hide in solely trans masc spaces or go stealth in the cis world. Just as long as we stay out of trans spaces that they must deal with us and their toxic views or habits they picked up. 

I actually have a whole lot of hobbies and an active social life. It doesn't stop me from being aware of these facts
Yea this. My local trans group is mostly all trans women who talk about nothing but vaginal plasty while claiming that they are too upset by the word penis/dick to allow the men to talk about phalloplasty. However the men are deemed too senistive if we say the same thing about vagina. 

Trans men shouldn't have to HIDE in trans men only spaces just so trans women dont have to face certain bad habits or toxic thinking they carry with them.

So I have been on a fairly intense workout plan/path for the last 6 years of my life. I eat clean. (No sugar. No bread. Limited boozr intake) I have seen every single medical professional you can dream of for my weight. I have been subjected to every single medical test you can have done for my weight. Guess what? I'm extremely fit and healthy. Just fat. 

I'm not rich. I have a family who depends on me for the necassity. I'm not going to waste money on clothes or beauty things just cause. I take very good care of my skin, hair, and teeth. 


I don't hace self loathing. And i have accepted myself. Hence the whole transitioning. Been in therapy the whole time. Made the changes I needed. 


There's nothing left to deal with. There's nothing left to fix. 

Calling out toxic behaviors and thought processes isn't transmysgony. Some of the most amazing inspirational women I know are trans. My girlfriends are trans. Their are several trans women in this thread agreeing with me and atesting to seeing the same behaviors I am talking about. 

You said in your orginial post you didn't understand how anyone could give up being a woman to be a man basically. And that tells me a whole lot in itself how you both view men and trans men. I didn't give up being a woman. I loved myself enough to not force myself into a gender and role I was not solely for the comforts of others.

My grandpa died this morning.	"He was in his 90s and passed in his sleep. I have so many conflicting feelings. He's the source of so many good memories, and if you could get him to open up, a wealth of stories about his time in the Korean war, life as a government employee, his 11 siblings and the ranch he was born on, worked until his 80s, and died on. I visited this ranch almost every summer as a kid, and even lived on it briefly as a child.


I don't have a single photo with him that I can share. The last time I saw him was pre transition. He's never even seen me in person as an adult. And one of the first things she told me was that it would be okay if I missed the funeral. When I said no, I want to go, she mentioned all her siblings would be there, with the implication being that my more transphobic uncles are included. It'll also be in this small town in South Dakota where everyone has known everyone since birth, and I have no way of knowing if I'll be clocked or outed, but I don't care. I've been stealth for 18 months and I'm not too worried about anything but the hostility from family, but I don't even care about that. I only regret not showing him who I've become before he went.


Edit: just remembered that I disowned one of my mom's brothers and he'll be there. Fml"	"If you want I'll Photoshop you two into 1 pic
Sorry for your loss. üòî Hope you can have your own experience of dealing with his passing, maybe put a picture of him somewhere special for you and tell him everything you want him to know about you. I am sure he, wherever he is now, will be proud of you üíñ much love!
Go in stealth! Even if it means separating from your family for the processions

I lost both my grandparents recently. They considered me as the most important grandson to carry on the family name even before I was born. I didn't really talk to them since if they knew the real me, there'd be real family dramas.

As the most important grandson, there were lots of rituals for me to lead during the funerals and there were so much patriarchal thinking. Still, I did it anyway, since I never talked to them much when they were around. Usually, I'd have gotten a huge chunk of the inheritance, but I never bothered to, because by accepting, it means I agree that I am the most important grandchild, the one who would continue the bloodline.

Once I can move out, I would stop all this pretending, And deep down, I'm glad at least they don't have to know that I am not what they thought I am going to be, that they passed peacefully. At least, I didn't have to attend the funerals with my hair grown out and body hairs permanently removed.

(Am super okay and have moved on, just procrastinating on Reddit and came across this post)
I might take you up on that
I fully intend to! I have a huge family and they all know though, so it's unlikely that I won't end up in a few uncomfortable conversations.


For example: last time I saw one of my aunts she asked what my orgasms are like. And she's an ally.

ETA: I don't think I could pretend to be a guy if I wanted to at this point.
I'm fortunate that all but 1 grandparent is still alive in my case. Though all are in their 80's.

2 years back I still had a great grandparent living. My sister's not so lucky, noms deceased and her dad died. We're half siblings, I have no full siblings, and I'm basically my dad's only biological kid so I know I'm wiping out the family line by transitioning but I intend to keep my last name and would hope if I get married my spouse would be willing to take my last name so I can at least try to keep it alive as it's the least I can do.
Dm me if so
Well, there's cryopreservation, if you want to have kids. I'm from a second world country, where transitioning and cryopreservation just don't exist, so I can't say I know much.

I'm not exactly a trans, but kids just aren't my thing.
I have a autoimmune disorder that more than likely would be passed on and it's made my life hell and I would rather not give it to my kids knowing how much it has impacted my life.
Hmm, I might pass down Parkinson also. Unfortunately, I cannot know for sure, since my grandfather was adopted.

Sometimes, I really wonder if it'd happen to me. I do hear that women are less likely to have Parkinson and often wonder if that applies to transwomen.

From what you wrote, I assume your autoimmune disorder isn't affecting your transition?
It does to a degree, generally speaking I have widespread symptoms from my condition including nerve damage, fatigue, vitamin deficiencies etc but it's not any more risky transitioning."	nd4ybd	trans	43	0.91	2021-05-15 18:13:33
I‚Äôm every day the transition is like this and educates us to have patience and wait and hope to do everything calmly and carefully! I started my HRT March 19, 2021 at the age of 40!		"You're 40??

Is it appropriate for a cis person to explain gender to you unprompted?	"Not as bad as it sounds, maybe, I don‚Äôt know. 
Possible trigger warning: transphobia? Maybe? 

I‚Äôm not out to most of the people around me (22MtF) but my cis roommates know, and have so far has been very supportive, except sometimes while I‚Äôm doing things one of them (19F) will ‚Äúcorrect‚Äù me on ‚Äúhow to do it more feminine.‚Äù 

For example, the other night I was making a whiskey sour for myself because that‚Äôs a drink I‚Äôve always enjoyed. She comes down stairs and asks what I‚Äôm doing, I tell her making a drink, and she starts telling me about ‚Äúgirly drinks‚Äù that would help me ‚Äúbetter get into the mind set.‚Äù That ‚Äúgirls don‚Äôt really drink whiskey‚Äù

And believe it or not I found the whole thing very condescending and uncomfortable not only because I didn‚Äôt ask but I didn‚Äôt care. I‚Äôm at home, virtually alone, I just want to drink my drink. I don‚Äôt need people evaluating my gender presentation. 

But, I also think that she‚Äôs legitimately just trying to be supportive, in her own way. And to be fair the drinks sounded good. I just don‚Äôt know if I should accept what ally-ship I can or confront her about this behavior. I‚Äôm woman enough without needing her approval. She‚Äôs done this about outfits, the media I enjoy, and while I appreciate guidance from time to time it sorta just feels like she‚Äôs judging me. Like, I‚Äôm not a woman yet until she decides. 

Any advice? I could be over reacting. Just feels like a sore subject.

Edit: I appreciate everyone‚Äôs enthusiastic support of girls drinking whiskey, but I guess it‚Äôs more the principle that she seems to feel like she can critique my choices under the guise of ‚Äúhelping me be a better woman‚Äù unprompted. Has anyone else ever been around someone who supports you but is pushy at the same time? Like I‚Äôve been out to my apartment for less then a month, and she‚Äôs constantly bringing up how, apparently, ‚Äúthe longer you wait to get on hrt the harder it is to pass so we should look into that as soon as possible‚Äù which I don‚Äôt know if that‚Äôs true but I don‚Äôt want to hear it. There is no we in hrt, that‚Äôs my decision and my transition and I‚Äôll do what I want with it when I‚Äôm ready. 

I‚Äôm glad I have people who support me but it almost feels like I‚Äôm being bullied for not being trans enough by a cis person. 

I‚Äôll wake up and make some coffee in my gym sweats and hoodie and she‚Äôll go ‚Äúare we boymoding today?‚Äù 
No? I‚Äôm just wearing clothes. I almost think she‚Äôs just trying too hard to be supportive. Maybe. I really should talk to her."	"Women do drink whisky! Even single malts!
GIRLS DRINK WHISKY!!!! Seriously, I know more women who drink whisky than men. It is condescending and inappropriate, even if she means well. You both need to talk.
One of my best friends is a cis female and she loves whiskey so i don't see the problem here. SHE thinks it's not a ""girly drink"" but since when do drinks have a gender ?
That sounds so annoying I‚Äôm sorry you‚Äôre dealing with that. No one should be coaching anyone on how to express their gender you should definitely say something if you‚Äôre uncomfortable
What if you had a conversation with her about the support you need, the support she's offering, and the differences between those two things? Like, I tend to give people the benefit of the doubt and assume their good intentions, but when those intentions aren't grounded in reality, there's a lot of potential to do harm. 

I'd recommend talking with her, at the very least, and explaining that while you appreciate what she's trying to do, the ""help"" she's offering isn't actually helpful.
Feels like shes forcing you into a stereotype of femininity that has nothing to do with your own gender identity.
Lots of women drink whiskey, and lots of men drink ""girly drinks."" Your friend sounds like an asshole.
Your roommate sounds like an ass. Please continue to drink whisky, it means there is less of it in the world, vile stuff. I'll have all the ""girly"" drinks instead.
Not appropriate, shes expecting you to perform gender for her and in most cases, if you were a cis woman this isnt something that would be challenged at all. Youre valid in feeling uncomfortable with it and i think you should have a talk with her about it.

Also, the whole boys interests vs girls interests thing has always been kinda stupid. If she cant support what brings you joy then what exactly is she trying to achieve? Again, i think that applying ""would she treat you this way if you were cis?"" Is a good way to think about what is and isnt acceptable. If her honest answer (and not one just being used to placate you) is ""yes"" then personally i wouldnt like being around someone so controlling but that's up to you
No, her critique of your gender is flawed and problematic. There are MANY different ways to be a girl, conforming to socially accepted stereotypes is NOT the only way. As a nonbinary person, this just especially grates me the wrong way. Clothes, drinks, etc shouldn‚Äôt be gendered anyway, that‚Äôs part of the problem. People shouldn‚Äôt have to fit into neat little boxes/perform gender a certain way to be accepted for who they are.
As with most things, I think the best thing to do is just to talk to her. Tell her something along the lines that while you appreciate her support you are not looking for people to give you unsolicited advice on how to be more feminine.
My mother in law drank scotch, and Irish whiskey. She was cool as hell and I‚Äôll miss her dearly. I think your roommate is just trying to push her ideals onto you, and that is not ok. You are your own person, and while trying new things is fun no one should tell you how to live your life.
Lol, no
Other people already said that it is inappropriate and that she shouldn't do it. It does sound to me that she tries to be supportive and ""help"" you be a woman. Probably she read a few things online and didn't dig much deeper. My best advice would be to just kinda confront her about it, not in a bad way, but just ask her something like ""hey, are you doing all this to help me?"" and let her explain. Then you can probably just tell her that it makes you uncomfortable but you appreciate the nice thoughts. Just mention everything you said here, that this is something personal that you want to deal with alone, or more like you want to decide what kind of woman you want to be and that you feel she is a bit pushy. If you can manage to say this in a very friendly way, I'm sure she would be ok with it and understand (hopefully)
I can understand that she‚Äôs probably trying to help. If it were me, I‚Äôd explain how I felt about it being nice she would be offering me advice, but that the advice wasn‚Äôt about something I was worried about.
Are we boy moding today? 
She probably thinks she‚Äôs being funny. She‚Äôs not, it‚Äôs actually quite a dig. Women can wear relaxed clothing, not wear makeup and not necessarily be feminine. I think some cis people think we ought to over compensate our femininity or masculinity so that we can pass according to their standards. Bleh.
I mean I prefer root beer so‚Ä¶
CIS, straight Woman here, yes it's well inappropriate. Also last time I checked being girly doesn't equate with being womanly. Sorry you have to educate her..
I had a high school English teacher who apparently considered drinking straws to be effeminate. Super ridiculous and insecure.
At McDonald‚Äôs; ‚ÄòI‚Äôm a man I‚Äôll take it without the straw!‚Äô"	szmetn	trans	35	0.9	2022-02-23 17:07:52
Ellie's (incomplete) Master Guide to Transitioning.	"This is an old post. You can find the latest version of the masterlist [here.](https://www.reddit.com/r/trans/comments/dn6qd2/ellies_master_list_of_trans_resources/)

This is my attempt at creating a comprehensive guide to help trans people in every way I can think of through the sharing of information and resources. The guide is largely community made, and while I continue to make as many contributions as i can find, I'm really happy for any help I can get in making it larger and more helpful. That being said, this will likely be reposted once every 3 or so months, in the hopes that new people will see it, and that it will encourage others to share. You may notice that there is **an imbalance of resources geared toward the mtf community.** This is my fault. I simply am not familiar with and have not had much luck finding resources for other parts of the trans community. It doesn't mean that I don't care. If you have any resources from other parts of the trans community, please please please share them! If you feel like there is an issue with the guide, feel free to pm me or leave a message in the comments.

Realising why I want to be a girl	"A few years back another Transgirl like me asked on why I wanted to transition however I felt so pressured that I was doing to make myself sound fake that I just said ""it's the closest to who I am and I need to go for it"" and then cried thinking I didn't wanna say that.

Few years passed and that question rattled in my head like a chip of bone in a skeleton skull and this time I was confident in saying why I wanted to. I want to transition because it is me, a person who hated themselves to a painful extent and had so many repressed feelings and things I wanted to do...but now I wake up in the morning, do my skin care routine and look in the mirror...some days are bad but the days when they are good and I see myself fem even without hormones or surgery, I smile and dance and I love myself

I'm glad I'm finding myself after so many years"	"I know why I want to be a woman, I really want breasts, but Im actuality not obsessed with every thought I have anymore, I‚Äôm less stressed and way happier, I‚Äôve always wanted to be a beautiful princess and I‚Äôm only 22 days hrt and I‚Äôve never cared more about my body or my clothes I love myself more. I need to talk myself down less like I totally need to reprogram how I think but I‚Äôm happy that I‚Äôm here and I‚Äôm not letting myself stress about every little thing because I know everything is going to be alright. Now I can finally sit and smell the flowers, their is nothing to worry about.
I can relate to this, so much. I was a very feminine guy for so long. When I wasn't deeply depressed I'd do my nails, shave my body hair, work out to keep slim, and even let my hair grow out to longer and longer lengths. But I never felt happy. That's because recently I've come to realize I might be trans. I'm still working on everything, but the more I'm thinking that thought, the more I'm feeling... Weirdly euphoric? Like if someone calls me she, or her, or hun, in public I get this rush of joy!! Like holy fuck does it feel incredible!!!! Ahem... But yeah! So please, keep doing what makes you feel better. Dress up, smile, paint your nails, do whatever you think that'll make you love yourself."	t6h2zk	trans	37	0.98	2022-03-04 11:39:22
"My mom asked me to ""not dress girly"" today a distant family, old lady is visiting us."	"God I need to vent, i recently started to wear dresses and feeling so good on my body, all of my own effort btw because my mom have been showing resistance for my transition since the start and basically didn't help with anything in my presentation.

Wearing dresses have been liberating and I'm preparing to go out wearing them and feeling more and more free in my body, it means a whole lot to me. Well today my mom woke up and first thing in the morning she asked me to not wear a dress because some distant (and elderly) family is visiting and it's basically Christmas night ahead of time for my mom and grandma.

I felt so fucking insulted that she asked that of me, I've been struggling with my presentation for so long and she has the audacity to day that because idk, she is worried they will not understand? I don't care, I'm not dropping a part of myself for.my mom's comfort, she is being transphobic, as she has been many times with me with these types of comments, ""your going too fast"" ""don't you think you are being too extra?""

I'm sorry you're having a hard time with your family.
Young children are usually cool with anything tbh. I'm not sure if I'd be comfortable being girly in front of my grandmother, but then I get how that could be an issue for people. It's really invalidating to ask that of someone. 
Hope things will get better, and all the love to you <3
I‚Äôm sorry. I hope your distant relative is more supportive than your mother. (It‚Äôs been my experience that age only loosely correlates with acceptance, I have many supportive friends that are the same age as my slow to accept parents.)

PSA: Dysphoria Isn't Always Obvious	"I'm sure a lot of people on the same wave length have heard people describing early onset dysphoria with obvious symptoms and felt like they didn't get that. The truth is, it's entirely subjective to everyone and high affected by your circumstances, and sometimes you might not notice it's there until it's too late. For me, I started experiencing more obvious dysphoria about 7 years ago, in the sense that I actively had thoughts of transitioning (at the time I passed these off as intrusive thoughts) and I only actively ""knew"" as soon as 2-3 years ago (still told myself I shouldn't transition because ""it couldn't be me"" clueless.jpg). But still, looking back on it, I've noticed so much stuff that just makes sense suddenly;

* Body dysmorphia - being afraid of not being a ""manly man"".

* Having little plans for the future, not being able to envision myself past a certain age.

* Always envisioning myself in third person as being more masculine than I am.

* Overcompensating from my natural attitude to appear manlier.

* Lack of care for appearance. Lack of grooming.

* Extremely low care for fashion sense and awareness.

* Difficulty making friends with men. Pretty much all my friends were girls growing up.

* Apparent social awkwardness from the above reasons.

* Having sonar ears whenever someone says your name or previous pronouns.

* Actively disliking your previous name and wanting to form your own identity.

* Being largely unphased by encounters with makeup or femininity.

* Encounters with trans women and actively telling myself ""nah, that's not me"" subconsciously.

* Fantasising about what it's like to live as a woman.

* Seeing the above point as being cis in any way. Lmao.

This is all the stuff I know I've experienced before I even thought of transitioning or that I could be trans. It could even be lesser than this for you, don't ever invalidate yourself because you're a late bloomer or it wasn't obvious to you."	"The lack of grooming especially.

The ""how can I be a woman when I don't even shave"" argument.

But the reason I didn't shave is that it requires looking in the mirror, and recognition of the self.
The grooming/fashion bit really makes sense. For me it's like, ""Why bother when I'm not going to look the way I want to look anyway""
Holy shit 
I thought this was due to other stuff 
Thanks a fuck ton
Great post. 

I have recently realized that I am trans. 

I used to workout lifting heavy weights for hours every day to become as masculine as possible. Grew a large beard and generally compensated in every way I could while I was never happy with my looks. 

I just pressed the thoughts of being trans so far down and locked it away, because that surely couldn't be true.

Once my body broke because of the extreme exercise (and a car crash) I was forced to give up working out. 

I went from size extra large to small and I have never been happier. I am so excited... And scared
I think I can put a check mark next to pretty much every single one of these bullets.

You are valid.   
We are valid. 

‚ô• Thank you for sharing. ‚ô•
I really didn't think I experienced dysphoria at all until I read genderdysphoria dot fyi 

It really opened my eyes to the ways dysphoria can manifest. Turns out my whole life had been a sign I was trans.
You just went down the list of me.
I‚Äôm shaking and crying right now because I just came out to myself as non binary before Christmas. I was and am leaning towards HRT. 

After reading this, it certainly resonates with me. The part about the grooming especially. I am also reminded that in 2nd grade, I didn‚Äôt want to wear a see through beach shirt for spirit day. In 4th and 5th grades, I didn‚Äôt want to go to swim class(somehow the school allowed me to stay back and do homework), but I thought it was body shame. In 5th grade basketball, I refused to be a skin in ‚Äúshirts vs skins‚Äù. In 7th grade, I was horrified when my leg hair got really thick. At the time, I thought I was simply dealing with dysmorphia and not dysphoria. 

Then, there was the one time where I tried on clothes that my mom was giving to charity and had placed on my bed for 2 weeks: bra, pantyhose, and panties. I pleasured myself in them and cleaned them before putting them back in the box. I always thought that I was just a cross dresser. 

I also remember not fitting in with the boys(or girls) during sex Ed talks. But I did always think about what it would be like if I was a girl on the softball team instead of baseball as I was. 

All of these revelations are a lot. And this post hit me like a ton of bricks. Maybe I am just non binary trans femme. I wish there was a general guide to knowing if I am trans.
The ‚ÄúLack of Grooming‚Äù part really hits me hard. Since coming to my own realization, I finally noticed that out of over the 2100 pictures / videos on my phone, maybe 4-6 of them contain my face. 

I literally had no idea I did it because of my looks until I also found out that I either subconsciously avoided mirrors or deleted images I THOUGHT looked good at the time. Truth be told, I haven‚Äôt taken images of myself that I like, maybe once I start transitioning I will, but til then, no images
The ""recognition of self"" comment hit me. I posted about my experience of when I would look in the mirror, occasionally I would look into my eyes and feel a pain that I would never get to be a girl. I never even remotely had the thought that the sadness equaled me being trans. So what I always I wished I was a girl? No big deal because I wasn't. End of story. Right after this last Christmas, my egg partially exploded, yet still the doubts weighed heavy. But now, after reading your words, I guess that was where the pain I felt came from - my true self realizing she was locked away with no hope to live!!! My heart has been so free and confused and crazy and twisted and all the things since December 29 when I realized that I wasn't just attracted to women, but that I wanted to be one in my heart. The doubt that I struggled with, I think, may have come to an end with your words, as simple as they are. Even they only slow, I am so thankful that you are here and I hope you are Happy and Wonderful!!!!!! Thank you!!!!!!
I was literally just thinking about this as I was shaving this morning. Never had any motivation or desire to put work into my appearance beyond just seeming put together enough to not get judged. Now I do.

Sending championship belt to transgender jujitsu opponent who killed themselves, any guidance?	"I am the jujitsu youth champion of my state. I have been it for the past 3 years. I broke the leg (not on purpose) of one of my opponents last year and it has deterred challengers.

Earlier this year I was challenged to a title defence by a transgender man (I think that is the correct term, they have transitioned to become a man from being a woman). 

Admiring this courage I accepted and we were supposed to compete soon (the coronavirus has delayed everything).

What I didn‚Äôt realise and am disgusted by is they have been bullied online relentlessly for being transgender. They took their life last week.

I don‚Äôt care that they were transgender, they were a worthy opponent in my eyes. I think their bullies are cowards and parasites.

I have got the permission from the sports authority to send the belt to their family. I would like it buried with them. They have more than earned it.

I don‚Äôt know what to say to the family. I am lucky to have never lost anyone to suicide and I can‚Äôt imagine the pain."	"Say literally that. Send them this post, word for word. It's a beautiful thing that you simply recognize your opponent as valid. I promise they'll be happy to know you thought so highly of them, and that you wanted so badly to meet them in battle. Or... Their family will be happy, and that has to be enough sometimes.
If you want a taste of their battles, head on over to r/gendercritical or r/lgbdroptheT
I want to cry I wish everyone in the world was this nice. But yeah, send his family this post. If he (and yeah, you got the term right he is a transgender man) were to see this, he would definitely be incredibly touched. I know that sometimes this kind of sentiment is not appreciated, but I am sincere when I say that I'm sorry you had to experience this. 

This may not be true, but you may want to prepare yourself for potentially dealing with some transphobia from your opponent's family. I'm not saying that all families are like this, and families who support the transgender identity of their kids, wives, husbands, etc. are absolutely amazing and need to be more recognized for it, but it's unfortunately kind of common. Disregard this if it turns out to be wrong. I just don't want you to feel shocked or heartbroken if this turns out to be the case.
[removed]
Yeah, I am open to all people and dislike intolerance. I like to be very competitive in my sport (although I didn‚Äôt intentionally break that other persons leg) but away from the sport I have no hate towards anyone. 

It is pompous to say but I think of it as like being a general in war. Wellington fought Napoleon but he certainly respected him. I like to do the same with anyone I compete against.

It is selfish but I feel cheated at being denied the opportunity of a fight.
Can confirm. As trans myself I can say if they were FtM they likely took he/him pronouns. If they were open about being trans the best thing is always to ask, but in this situation I honestly think a little assuming is reasonable.

When in doubt just use whatever name they chose. There's much power in a trans individual choosing a new name.
Our enemies deny our very existence.  To them, trans doesn't exist - we are instead delusional, mentally ill or perverts. I'm sorry our struggle has touched you in this way. x"	gfh72r	trans	36	0.95	2020-05-07 22:55:42
Transition in Sweden	"!PLEASE READ/HELP!
I‚Äôm a 16 year old trans guy living in Sweden and I came out about 3 years ago. My parents weren‚Äôt super supportive at first but now they help me and after about 1 year of being out they put me on a list that makes me available for a medical transition after a dysphoria diagnosis. It took me about 1,5 years to get in to the program and now I‚Äôve finally started. My goal is getting on testosterone or hormone blockers but recently sweden put a ban on providing trans people under 18  with hormones etc. I‚Äôm completely broken and it has affected my mental heath a lot. I‚Äôve made some of my friends sign a Swedish petition to provide trans kids under 18 with the care they need, if I put the link could anyone help sign it? (It is Swedish but the only thing you have to do is answering a question about how not having hormones etc for trans kids under 18 could hurt trans people). Thank you!:)"	"Send the link, I would be happy to sign

Law suit against states banning transitioning past the age of 18?	Hi! The situation in some conservative states is starting to worry me due to bills like the one mentioned in [this link.](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&source=web&cd=&ved=2ahUKEwj23-OPmeH8AhXmZzABHVAXCuoQFnoECBIQAQ&url=https%3A%2F%2Fabcnews.go.com%2Famp%2FUS%2Fnew-bill-ban-gender-confirming-care-26-oklahoma%2Fstory%3Fid%3D96261603&usg=AOvVaw1XciAFklWwrIhdTK2oUWAn), and I was wondering if when/if they pass (but they probably will), would it be possible for people to sue those states because being able to transition once you‚Äôve become 18 might (and definitely should) be protected under the 1st Amendment as it would be infringing on our rights to free speech. It might be a stretch though. Which also brings up the topic of that ‚ÄúRight to Free Speech‚Äù should be changed to something along the lines of ‚ÄúRight to Free Speech and Expression‚Äù or something like that.	"Yes, you can sue. The ACLU is working with four minors in Arkansas and their families who are suing the state. Their efforts have resulted in a ruling that temporarily banned the ban so their care has been able to continue for now. The case is Brandt vs. Rutledge if you want an example. The situation is terrifying and is  getting more and more extreme. Just know some states are also passing safe haven laws to protect trans rights. Washington and Illinois are the most recent. But you should not have to flee your state for your right to medical care.
Unfortunately, all these bills are popping up because SCOTUS shot down RvW and basically said that body autonomy isn't a federal constitutional right.

At this point I don't know what *legal* recourse we have left except not voting for dipshits... But we've seen how that works out.
Legal doesn‚Äôt mean shit, if it‚Äôs morally wrong we all need to actually ban together and organize ourselves as a population against it, but it‚Äôs hard to do that because there‚Äôs this sceme governments have been putting together and implementing where they make as many different communities of people and then feed them all propaganda about how they‚Äôre the most correct community and that all others are worse and need to go.  So now everyones fighting themselves and there will never be one group big enough to actually overthrow and re-establish a new system.  Also doesn‚Äôt help that they keep the largest and most problematic communities (the conservatives and the christians) as close them and on their side as they can so that if any community opposes the gov then they have all their resources to stop them PLUS the backing of two major communities in society.
I don't live in the states but it makes me really sad to see all these laws they're trying to pass to make our lives harder. Stay strong out there everyone!
It can and will be challenged under multiple clauses.  (also, members of [TST](https://thesatanictemple.com/pages/faq) will be able to make claims of religious freedom).  These bills aren't meant to stand up in court.  They are meant to whip up their base for the next election without having to do anything of real substance.  The average person has no idea how the economy actually works so any gains in that area would be relatively meaningless or, worse, get attributed to the opposition.  Far easier to pass a bill based on fear, that will get struck down in the courts, so that they can claim conspiracy and increase fear to get new votes.  Once they have milked us for all we can get them, they'll move on to the next best target.  They don't actually want to ""fix"" anything because then people will start looking to closely at what they are doing behind the scenes.  Which really isn't all that much or surprising,  they are just doing whatever gets them the most value (for whatever it is they value).
I heard that laws could be overturned if there‚Äôs enough signatures or something? Is there a petition? If yes link it here please.
I wanna cry. I waited until I was 18 to come out to my family because I was afraid that laws targeting trans kids would be made, but now they aren‚Äôt satisfied with ‚Äúkeeping the children safe‚Äù! I hate them. Why do they hate us? What did we do wrong? What next? I‚Äôm scared. It looks like things are only getting worse. I wish I didn‚Äôt exist.

it would be cool if america functioned on logic instead of a 250 year old piece of paper that's worshipped as a divine artifact
You could probably make a Freedom of Expression argument here, but it would also be good to look at other rights relating to privacy and autonomy.

The courts have recognized a right to *refuse* medical care, though I don't know of cases which have specifically recognized a corresponding right to *obtain* to care. To me it seems reasonable that if you have the right to refuse something, you must also have the right to seek it.
Not even mentioning ones right to happiness and health. I would say this seems to be number one reason to sue, like if it is hampering your presuit of happiness. And what of liberty? It isn't like trans is a threat to anyone, why ban it. You'd have to have some kind of erroneous take on gender to ban gender affirming care. Like what of the 34-62 million people world wide who are intersex, or chimera, or some mosaic system? They are even represented in a ban like this because the system doesn't even try to type their sex let alone gender. This fucking country is a joke right now and has been for far too long. How dare we say we are the land of the free. With as much systemic hate how could anyone live free here?
Good!
I think we need to learn from the French sometimes
To an extent, you are right, but these laws blatantly go against the 14th amendment, and there aren't any fetuses to argue that they also have bodily autonomy to use, like with RvW. That was the reason RvW was able to be undone. The Supreme Court believed that fetuses have bodily autonomy. With these, however, it's just straightforward.
The problem is that legality is what matters in the eyes of the people who can do something about it.
I do live in the states. It‚Äôs not safe.
This reminds me that I need to join TST and help them fight here in Oklahoma.

We didn‚Äôt do anything wrong - they are fascists and are cowards.  Yes, what they are  doing is scary.  One reason they target us is because we are authentic and are able to think for ourselves and be who we truly are despite all they throw at us. Our sense of self threatens people who are insecure.  Please hold on, as there are many of us out here in the world- there always have been and always will be. We are glad you are here and the world is better with you in it.
I know. It‚Äôs like what did we ever do to them? Hopefully you‚Äôre not in the states or a place where they are passing these laws. Stay strong. I know you can get through it. One day we will get our rights back everywhere.

I said goodbye to my little brother, and hello to my little sister.	"I couldn‚Äôt of been more proud of her. Really, she‚Äôs a brilliant, kind, and wonderful teen. And I‚Äôm so glad she felt comfortable telling me before anyone else about her transition and name change. 

Although, she‚Äôs not 100% comfortable yet. She goes by she/her to me & other selective people. They/them in school. And he/him at home; as well as deadname. At home, she asked me to call her deadname but in public her new name. Her deadname is a very masculine name, such as Curtis. Where it can‚Äôt really be a feminine version, so her chosen name is something completely different. (For the sake of the post let‚Äôs call her Alice.) 

Alice loves her name, she feels it suits her perfectly and I couldn‚Äôt agree more, however we live in a conservative household with our parents who are not ‚Äúyou are what‚Äôs in ur pants‚Äù and their parents who are very ‚Äúthis is for girls, this is for boys you can‚Äôt change it you will always be ur assigned gender at birth ‚Äú this makes it very hard for Alice to want to express herself. She already gets picked on by our grandparents for having long hair, painted nails, and feeling comfortable in dresses. And I wouldn‚Äôt say our parents support it, more or less they just don‚Äôt care. 

Our parents do stick up for Alice where‚Äôs needed, but I‚Äôm worried about set backs on her wish to transition. There is so much she wants and I think she deserves, I know she will have zero regrets because she‚Äôs always been like this growing up. This is who Alice is, and I want her comfortable with herself. Even if it means she starts going by Alice at home.

I want nothing but love and support for my sister and her development. But she feels right now I‚Äôm the only one at home who gives that to her, and that‚Äôs so unfair to her & I wish there was more I could do while still pushing her to be the best version of herself she can be"	Sometimes family is the worst when it comes to supporting their progeny.

Trans Teen Adoption Update	"Nine months ago I made [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/trans/comments/vjq2ps/adopting_a_trans_teen/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=android_app&utm_name=androidcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button) asking for advice, and you all were really helpful/supportive. Someone asked to keep you all updated, so I wanted to do that. 

Before we were officially approved to adopt, his bio was removed from the local adoption photo listing site. We were so bummed but really happy he got a home. We were told January 4th that our home study was approved, and we could finally go through the matching process. Flash forward to last week, and we had not been matched with a teen yet, despite putting in a lot of inquiries. It's hard to encapsulate the foster care system, but basically if someone got back to us for anything is was a miracle. Even though his bio had not been on the local photo listing since last July, I saw his bio on Adopt US Kids. I assumed it was a mistake, but after almost three months of seeing him there we finally decided to inquire about him just so that his name could be cleared off the site. When they asked for our home study we were shocked. Apparently he fell through the cracks, and we have no idea why he wasn't on the local photo listing site. We had what is called a ""child life history"" meeting last night with our case worker to determine if we wanted to move forward. He's been through a lot with no support and is in a group home. We said yes, of course, and we are on our way to hopefully meeting him soon! The next big step is what is called a ""staffing,"" where we get together with our case worker and his team to make a plan for the best way to transition him into our home. Then he will get to know that we exist, and he will also get to decide if we are right for him.

We are very excited to give him the opportunity to just be a teen and to give him any gender support he needs. My husband is excited to teach him to drive and take him through those rites of passage he hasn't gotten to do, since he's in a group home. 

If anyone has any advice, please share! Anything you appreciate people doing to respect you and your gender identity. Anything you think/wish the parents of a transgender teen should do."	"My god. The level of detail in your thinking about this young man makes me want to weep. It's clear you've thought of little else since you found him. He'll be so loved.

Good luck. I'm so happy for you.
Hoping this goes great for all involved!
Y‚Äôall sound like the absolute best parents! I am so happy for him because that sounds like such a supportive household. I never had that opportunity certainly so I‚Äôm wishing you and your family the absolute best!
You know what? The amount of time, thought, and effort you're putting into say to me you guys got this. Hoping it all turns out for you and him. ü´ÇI think you'll be a wonderful family.
awesome to hear there are still people like you in this world. I am confident you'll be great parents
Thank you! He's been let down a lot, so we have a big responsibility.
Thank you!
We hope we will be for him! It's a leap of faith that ai hope he is willing to take with us.
Thank you! We are excited to meet him!
The day after we said yes, we read the news that there has been a ban in our state for most transgender health services, so we are nervous about that! We hope we can get him taken care of."	121ktma	trans	36	0.89	2023-03-25 12:46:12
Do you ever wish you could start over? Even as trans?	"So, I'm trans, MTF. I'm 25. I started my transition in late 2019 and recently finally had SRS. I still have a couple surgeries in mind, but anyways...

&#x200B;

Do you ever wish you could start your life over? Whether it be as your chosen gender, or even as trans with the knowledge you have now?

I know people may get mad at me for saying this, but even though I started my transtion at 23, I feel like I started it way too late and missed out on so much.

Schooling from the beginning all the way to HS, was pretty horrible for me. Because I was trans (but didn't know) it caused me to be depressed. I was the loner in the back of each class. I missed out on so much because I just wasn't happy, and wasn't a girl.

I DREAM about being able to go back, even just to HS, and start off as I am now, or as a girl, and living through everything again but finally being myself. I cry about this so often because I feel like I missed out on some of the most fun, or most important childhood stuff. I didnt get to live through what it's like being a girl during HS. Even the bad parts. I don't care. I missed out on all of those experiences and it kills me knowing I only have one life & it's so fucked up already.

I have been told that sometimes I act like a kid, or childish. I don't do it purposely, but have been told & feel like I am almost living out those years, now. My room is overly feminine. The things I say or do, are somthing a teenaged girl would say/do. My friend said it was almost like I was going through the years and learning and doing things. Or maybe that that side of me is just finally living itself out.

Regardless, I have the realization that I can't focus on what I've lost anymore. It really sucks. But I know if I spend the next couple years wishing I could go back and change everything, I will end up 5 years down the line wishing I didn't spend the last few years reminiscing. If that makes sense.

'Time' by Pink Floyd reminds me that before I know it, time will pass and I'll still be no where wishing things were different.

I feel like I have already lost most of my life because I'm trans, and it's hard, really hard, letting go of that and moving on with my head up high happy for the future.

Idk. I'm not depressed. I plan on finishing my transition with the last couple of surgeries I have, and moving on with my life, but fuck I really fucking wish I could go back even 10 years.

I look at my life so far. Optimistally, I have 40 years left. That's so fucking scary. Maybe it's human nature to look back and wish we could regain time/change things. But it feels especially unfair as a trans person.

Anyone else feel the same way, or sorta like this?  


(Edit, I am at work but will reply & respond as I can)"	"I do get the occasional, ""I wish I had started transitioning sooner,"" or ""If I had just been born a cis woman, life would be easier."" I think my experiences are valuable not only to myself but to others who have to go through the same things I have. Going back or starting over completely would be nice, but I'm more or less okay how things turned out and look forward to the future.
While it wasn‚Äôt as drastic for me I totally relate to this. Am going to see a gender therapist at 22 after longer time of self-denial. However I feel like before this age and all the experiences I had I wouldn‚Äôt ever have been ready to transition. And ofc it would‚Äôve been easier being born as our real genders. But since we already missed out on so much I feel like we shouldn‚Äôt look back in regret and fear of having missed out and rather spent our remaining time in happiness and joy of what‚Äôs to come!
I totally get it‚Ä¶I‚Äôm ftm and i started transitioning when i was 14. I guess that is pretty young but it took so long to get to where i am now at 19. I sometimes get so bogged down and wishing that i could relive everything, childhood and high-school especially. I feel really really sad when i look at old photos of me from childhood, because all i wish for is to go back to that point and do it over. I‚Äôd dream that i was a cis guy all along and what my childhood and high-school life would have been like. other times i fantasise going back in time and transitioning as a young child, and getting to experience a better transition, perhaps a bit less awkward than what it was actually like. Again i know 14 is young still (although from what i see online very common), but i didn‚Äôt get on hrt until i was 18, so highschool was a very weird experience of looking incredibly awkward, rarely passing and having some horrific fashion to compensate for feeling inadequate for not being masculine enough. But i‚Äôm also happy that i got in early, and i could get top surgery and hormones when i did. I bet that if you had transitioned at 14 or whatever, you‚Äôd feel bad about not transitioning sooner, its never really enough i guess. (and i feel bad for being so jealous of those really young trans kids who get to bypass the awkward early transition teen/young adult phase).I‚Äôm a very nostalgic person and i always like to think back to the past rather than the present, so i really get that feeling of being caught in a reminiscing cycle, i always find myself creating scenarios of how it could have been, what i wish it was etc and it makes me really depressed, but i‚Äôm working on it. I‚Äôm now trying to focus that energy on the future and what it can be, sounds hella cheesy but it feels more healthy. i didn‚Äôt get the teenage experience that i wish i had, but i‚Äôm going to make sure my adult years are better, (and if they suck‚Ä¶we‚Äôll at least they will suck whilst i‚Äôm a transitioned fully passing man).
Absolutely. I'm very close to you in age and transition timeline (+1 year to basically everything you said) and I still dream about it.

If I went back as still trans, I'd have done everything sooner and a bit less frantically. If I could go back as a cis-girl, then that's like a dream come true right there.

But, I'm at peace with where I am. Like you said, we can't actually go back. And we've had some permanent changes we can't exactly undo. I feel like I'm where I'm supposed to be, even if things aren't perfect, and I can actually focus on living life without the whole ""transition"" thing hanging over me.
I do wish I was brave enough to tell my parents when I was a kid because they have always been supportive. I started hormones at 28 and now I'm 29, my mum says I have a certain childlike demeanour from time to time.

I don't really notice it but it's probably me going through the missing childhood xD with the dreaded need to work so I can afford hrt ._.

But my boy self defence mechanism is still very active from the bullying days and I only notice that when I'm on guard and threatened (though by pointless and mundane things :p).
Honestly I wish I just had my current knowledge as a teen. Idk if I'd want to be born female just because my experiences that are important to me would be different. For example my wife is bi and accepts me as male or female, but when we got together she thought she was straight. I feel like if I was born female we probably wouldn't have gotten together in the first place and I'd have a much different life. I love my life I just would like to have started transitioning sooner
I started hrt i think when i was 16 now i‚Äòm almost 18 and i still wish i did it way before that bc i was  already in puberty so yeah that would‚Äòve mad things so much easier when i didn‚Äôt even had to go trough male puberty
When I was fourteen my mom moved me and my brother to Saskatchewan. For those that don't know, it's basically the Texas of Canada.

I wish I'd run away from home before that move. I didn't have much stuff. A backpack of clothing and a box of video games and a handful of books would have been all I'd want to bring with me.

The box I could have hidden away at school and I know a bunch of places both inside the school and outside where I could have slept without being noticed. The local youth center would have given me somewhere to do my homework. The showers at school would have kept me clean and between the cafeteria and shoplifting I could have kept myself fed.

I ended up on the streets four years later anyways after my mom kicked me out. I can't help but think if I'd just run away from home *then*, I'd be doing so much better now. At the very least I wouldn't have spent four years hating myself in the middle of redneck country.
There have been so many mistakes of my life that could be avoided by a redo.  I wish that I could restart with the knowledge I have now just so I could remedy those mistakes and sure redoing it cisfem would be way better!
Lately my escapist fantasy has almost exclusively been starting life over with the knowledge I have now. The things I‚Äôd change, the ways I‚Äôd help and fix my fucked up family, the people I had met that I‚Äôd be able to help, the ways I‚Äôd finally be able to enjoy my childhood, and get back the 21 years of my life I lost to neglect and dysphoria.
If I could srart over with out the hell and torture of my childhood and the 35 years of misery that followed it I would gladly be trans or whatever amyone wanted! To live free of all of that shit and misery I would start over as anything anyone could imagine!
Yea, I definitely wish that I could have realized I wasn't cis sooner. I dont know why but the thought just never entered my head. I feel like early HS would have been way better for me
I think about that *a lot*. Like, so frickin much you have no idea. There will be days where I literally just go through an entire fantasy play by play on what would I do if I were to wake up tomorrow in my 8 year old body in 2012 or something like that. I only started socially transitioning sixth months ago so in school, I‚Äôve only ever presented as my true gender my senior year of high school. There are so many times where I wish I had realized and started transitioning sooner than that.
i‚Äôd love to. even as trans, then i could have got on the NHS waiting list in time lmao
Yes, of course.
I‚Äôd start right from the beginning if it meant I got to be cis, or even just transition before puberty.
Hell, even a couple years earlier would be a big difference, like I transitioned early last year but I almost did in 2019 only to repress it again and I think a lot about how much further along I‚Äôd be if I‚Äôd done it then. Especially since I started at 23, right before turning 24, and starting at like 21/22 would give me a better chance of hip growth (not a big chance but being stuck with super narrow hips forever with zero chance for change sucks)
Yeah, I think im finally getting to that point, too. I can't spend the rest of my life wishing lol
Good point! and yeah, I'm realizing that! Thank you :)
Yeah, you make a great point. It probably would never be early enough, no matter when I started. Id always have wanted more. Sounds like you have a lot of the same issues I do, even though you started way earlier than me, proving to me that that just how it is. I wish you luck with the rest of your transition. :D Thank you for your input!
Yeah, I wish I started years earlier. And yeah, true. Once I finish the rest of my surgeries, itll be like leaving everything behind for a new life. Already feels like that in a way. Thank you! :D
Exactly! 

Yeah, haha. I get it lol. Thank you!
Yeah, thats kind of where im at, too. Being born as a woman would have been great, but the people that are in my life are only here because I was male. So, if I could just change when I started, def would do it. Ty for commenting :)
Good, I'm glad, and yes, good luck on the rest of your journey!"	smv2m3	trans	37	0.96	2022-02-07 17:02:49
Came out to my doctor	"I did it. Just an hour ago I got out of my doctor's appointment and, as nervous as I was, I went through with it, telling him I wanted to start HRT. To my relief, he was very chill about it. I knew, really, it was unlikely he would react badly, as he has an obvious motivation not to aggrieve me, but, after decades of keeping your feelings tightly locked up, it really freaks you out to actually tell people about them, y'know? 

He's the first person who knew me beforehand I've told; the only other person being the hair stylist I got from a trans-friendly salon after I walked in and told them I was looking for gender-affirming hair-care.

My doctor and I didn't discuss the matter in any detail. He told me I'd need to see a specialist and I said I was planning to make an appointment with a clinic that offers gender-affirming care. Going through with that is next.

Together with going to that salon, these are the first real steps I've taken to prove to myself that transition is something I'm actually going to do and not just dream about. Just half a year ago that was unthinkable, a brief flight-of-fancy to be ruefully discarded. But now, finally, I can see a path ahead of me to a life I actually care for the thought of living. It's a fraught path of many pitfalls and hazards, but it's there."	"Yay! Congrats to you!
Oh honey, that‚Äôs a massive step. It takes so much bravery and strength to do that. I‚Äôm super proud of you! And happy!

You‚Äôve done the hardest part already. It gets easier the more you come out. Just keep your eye on the prize, and keep pushing forward. Small steps are steps. Never forget that. 

And it‚Äôs okay to be proud of yourself. You‚Äôre kind of a badass."	waley4	trans	32	0.93	2022-07-28 21:09:41
"*RANT* ""have you thought about how this effects us/me?"""	"To start off I would totally understand this question if I was being inconsiderate and wasn't open to discussing other peoples feelings and answering their questions etc. but this is the first thing that comes out of everyone's mouth during every discussion about my transition. and . its . so frustrating. because they cant put their own feelings aside for one second during the scariest part of my life so far. the first thing anyone ever thinks about is themselves. and apparently me making decisions for MYSELF even after careful consideration of the people around me I'm still obviously not considering  how it effects them. even if I'm bending over backwards and stressing myself out trying to appease them. If I'm not agreeing to everything they say and going back into the closet then IM the inconsiderate one. and the more they ask this question the less I care about their feelings cause the people who do this always show they don't care about mine.

I understand that people need time to adjust and to figure out their feelings and everything but why do they all try and make out that they are so much more affected by my being trans than me?

Its so hard I thought I knew these people and that they all cared for me but I'm starting to see just how conditional their love is."	"Don't set yourself on fire to keep other people warm. 

If it's your wife, then it's fair to slow things down to help keep the relationship alive (but not try and suppress everything - that doesn't work). If it's family, it does take time but so does transition.

[deleted]
Honestly, this is one of those statements that is inherently hypocritical.  I think the best response is literally to ask the same question right back to the person saying it.
[deleted]
One of the first things my folks spun around with. ""Oh gosh, you're going to have it so hard with everyone around us. Think about your dad and the people he works with....""
My Fiance actually been the most supportive so far.  He implicitly trusts my judgement when i tried to talk to him about how it might affect him he shuts me down and says ""thats not for you to worry about, I dont give a crap what people around me think of me you need to do whats best for you""
This is a good response
HA! maybe I should say something like this
They keep trying to make me delay getting medical treatment or seeking it out and im just like ""the NHS waiting list is TWO years I'm not delaying any more than I have to for you.""

The reality is that I've found that most people either don't care, or are 'supportive' in the way they say they 'support you' and do nothing else, which is of course fine. The family think other people will care a whole load more than they really do. They should think about what they think, rather than worrying about the reactions of others.

I wouldn't use that line. It's pretty bad form, dangerously close to emotional blackmail. Maybe ""You get to have a family member who's able to function"".
Thats true but to be honest they have said way worse stuff to me and I have tried to be very PC/mild with my language and they just use that to shut me down and say my feelings obviously arent that important or strong. I feel like they dont know how much they are hurting me and need it brought to them in real terms. trying to  say ""im upset, im sorry you feel that way, I understand but""is getting me no where I feel like they dont understand what the stakes really are for me. maybe not suicide but its definitly getting bad.
It's hard I know, but try to keep to the moral high ground. The 'I' statement you had there is good.

My in-laws tried to blame my being trans on my FIL's cancer a few weeks ago... like, WTF? Like it wasn't the two packs of smokes a day for 50 years that gave him lung cancer, definitely my being trans."	4j0hbq	trans	35	0.96	2016-05-12 12:42:45
Came out to my grandmother, it was not what I expected...	"Ok so I've now come out to virtually my entire family that actually matters to me. But I still had to come out to my grandmother who is now 80. 

My sister who was the first I came out to over a year ago warned me to be careful when telling her as she was not doing well lately as her oldest son/my uncle had passed away of cancer just two years ago, it was one of the events that pushed me to start transitioning. 

Well, I came out to my mother a few months ago and she said that grandma may be confused but she wasn't a hateful person. I know that she isn't hateful, she raised me for 50% of my childhood since my father was a loser who left and my mom herself was in the Army and therefore away for an extended period. But it was because of that I was really worried about how to approach the topic with her.

Well, this summer I'm flying out to Kalispell Montana to see my mother and grandmother. Needless to say, it will be my 2-year anniversary on HRT when I get there, and I won't exactly be able to hide the breast growth by then. It's already pretty obvious. I knew I would have to explain it to her when I got there or really try hard to hide it all.

So yesterday my mom texted me and asked if I had spoken to my grandma. I played dumb and asked her ""about what?""

She says that grandma was asking if being transgender means you have had bottom surgery already. Mom says she probably saw the news in the last day or so and was on the topic... Well, I can't have my grandmother's only context for trans people being the one time that someone committed a mass shooting. 

I swallowed my fear and called her up. It took some time to get the conversation where I could say something. I finally told her I was trans. She was totally unphased and cool with it. But this isn't the crazy part....

So she tells me that when she was 8 years old (back in the 1940's) her father bought a heffier to add to his milking heard on his farm. Small town in upstate NY for context. Apparently the animal would never go into heat. It even went as far as to act like a bull mounting the other cows that were in heat and acting aggressively as a Bull would do. A veterinarian examined the animal and told her father in my grandmas earshot that it sometimes happens. Great grandpa then told my grandma that it happens sometimes with animals and people sometimes and for her to never judge someone for it ever.

This was 1940's America, and my grandmother and great grandfather were discussing trans acceptance! 

I told her then that I knew since I was 6 years old, and she told me that she did see hints that I was actually a girl from that time. I started crying because my fear of upsetting her was one of the things that stopped me from telling anyone when I was a little kid. I now know that my mom, and grandma would have eventually supported me, and I could have avoided a lifetime of pain, and suffering. 

I'm so happy that this turned out well, but at the same time I'm filled with more regret over not having the courage to some out sooner. Life is twisted.."

Woah I feel happy for you my grandma told me that it's just a stage and I'm going to hell and also who am I trying to impress and all the transphobic stuff and my dad agrees with her because it's against their religion
What I want most in life is my dad hugging me and  saying to me that he  raised a beautiful daughter and is actually supportive of me but all he does is role his eyes and say who am I trying to impress and saying my boyfriend is brainwashing me sorry I'm rambling again
Oh, I'm only going to look forward. The regret is more of a passing notion that faded out when compared to the relief that I'm out to all of the family that matters.

If my Bio-dad ever found out I was trans, he would become violent. So, I'm cutting him off entirely without telling him anything."	126px24	trans	32	0.89	2023-03-30 15:13:27
Confronted My Transphobic Dad -- CW(Mild Transphobia)	"Today I bought my first set of femme clothes, that I actually loved the look and colors of, and I even picked'em out myself in the store. For context, I'm 34, MtF (she/her), eleven months into my transition, ten days from three months on my hrt meds.

For a lil context... the last time I actually wore clothes I loved... I was like fifteen, maybe sixteen years old, and the insecure, hateful preacher I lived with at the time, humiliated me and made me feel so bad for just being authentic to me.

Back to this afternoon...

My dad says to me, ""Keep it in your private life."" -- Referring to me being authentic to who I am.

I said to him, stern in my reply, ""No, it's because of people saying things, just like that, that humanity, loses precious lives everyday. I refuse to live in secret because of your insecurities, lack of understanding and lack of empathy."" He shut up after I spoke those words to him.

One day I'll be 100% out to the entire world and I am so over playing pretend and putting on a face for the happiness of others... over choosing my own well being and happiness.

Trans lives matter just as much as cis lives. No less and no more. We are equal and we deserve to live and be happy just as much as any cis person. However, f*&k the hateful, ignorant people who refuse to just try and understand where another human being is coming from. I will live every day of my life, till I've got no life left to live, doing my best to raise awareness, help and stick up for my brothers, sisters and brethren found among the LGBTQ+ community. The very community that has encouraged me to be authentic to myself and try my best to be happy as myself.

Wish me luck everyone, but like it's been my goal now, for almost four months, that in two/three years time I'm a certified mental health peer counselor in my state. I can't ignore the hate I've experienced and lived through in my life... let alone the hate and hell wrought upon so many people just trying to simply live and be happy as themselves.

Peace, safety and love to you all!

--edited to add my intention--
Thx for the reply!
I don't think I could be this strong, or alive, without the awesome support my higher power blessed my life with and the welcoming and loving LGBTQ+ community that very same God blessed me to be accepted and supported by. I don't really have any real family, but, I personally, thank God I've got some friends who actually believed in me and had the courage to be like, ""Hey hun... plz try and heal yourself."" or ""There's not a dang thing wrong with just being yourself.""

One thing led to another, over the past few years, some shadow work and EMDR and some time later:

 True story, I just took my first long actual bath in like idk...  twenty-six years. 

Lavender Dr Teal's... candles, my fav incense, my favorite cottagecore soundtrack and my favorite book. I don't know if I've been this happy before... üò≠ Like oh my gosh, I am so thankful to be alive and able to say I have decent health, electricity, food and shelter.

My hrt meds changed my entire existence from completely miserable, from my lowest point, the point I hung myself in my literal bedroom closet during the dark winter of 2018.

The only reason I am still alive right now... honest to God, my dad, same one this post is about, woke up from a nap and came into my room to see why I was so quiet. For a lil context, I have a trauma bonding kinda relationship with him and he'd had me in complete tears earlier that day.

Well, needless to say, he found me with our dog's leash wrapped around my neck on the verge of losing consciousness.

That was after what had happened to me on July 5th, 2018. From complications due to the flu and Diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) I got to spend like my sixth or seventh time in a hospital bed, of my local ICU. 

Ever felt potassium chloride in your vein without enough saline pushing behind it? I have... spoiler alert... it feels like literal fire moving through your vein. Not fun... anyhoo...

I used to hate my life every single day. I still do sometimes, but goodness I look forward to being myself always and never hiding my face in fear again.

I've been through a lot and honestly, my God as my witness, I am thankful to be able to say my last HbA1c was 6.4 and not 14+ like it used to be. Pretty amazing what happens when a human being embraces themselves as they are and doesn't try to morph into the f'd-up social constructs forced upon everyone from pretty much birth till said person is able to experience their form of freedom from those societal constructs; societal constructs, mind you, that are used to destroy and dehumanize normal, everyday, human beings like you and I.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

I just wanna live long enough to see peace for everyone, not just some, privileged few. I literally have vowed, before my higher power, I will live the rest of my life never to harm another. It's not roses and daisies, but this is a life I've never had before More importantly, a life I chose myself and even a name I absolutely love and cherish, not one my abusers gave to me with zero thought of how I would feel later in life

My life today vs just two years ago is one filled with peace, happiness, belonging and fulfilment.

I will not repeat the hate shown to me. Nope, this girl isn't about the violence she was raised by. Lol 

Also, little secret about me, I despise the society around me that, I feel, basically worships violence and not caring about your neighbors and having excesses while others suffer from hunger and complete hopelessness. I cannot ignore those things... not after everything I've lived through and watched happen in my short life.

Thank you for the opportunity to share and the amazing support. You rock and so does this amazing sub for being here and quite a few more trans and LGBTQ+ ones. Sorry for the book, but I can't not share about what happened to me tonight.

Thx for letting me share. I never dreamed in all my life that I'd be blessed with a community that would help me find courage and strength to heal and grow to be happy as myself.

Like I feel pretty blessed reading everyone's comments. This is just a lil of what I've lived through, but my gosh it's so relieving to be accepted by friends here and to know I actually do have a place of belonging now... like I used to feel so alone and like that it was me vs the hateful world...

I was wrong, big time wrong, it's my community and my friends and family, found in that community, who are fighting right along beside me and so many others to stop the hate and injustice brought down on so many who are completely undeserving of the hate. ü•∞

Need to get this off my chest	"A few days ago, my mom told me she didn't want me to transition or try to under her roof - that I'm too young to make decisions about my body and my life. She told me she didn't want me ""becoming a man."" She kept saying how she wished I was a normal girl that wanted kids, would marry a man and go down the aisle in a white dress. She didn't care that I have been feeling dysphoric and uncomfortable for so long, that I am sure about my decisions. She flat out told me that I was just a kid and wasn't allowed to make my own decisions when I live under her roof [I didn't get a say in living with her or moving to a more expensive and dangerous state]. She kept saying that just because I was an adult on paper didn't mean I was an adult to her. She kept telling me that I had no reason to be depressed because ""your life really wasn't that bad."" She kept telling me that I was selfish because I was putting myself and my feelings before her feelings and wants. She kept telling me she supported me but didn't accept me. 
My dad was no different, even going as far as to threaten to hurt me because I defended myself. I don't have family that I can turn to, all of them are homophobic and transphobic. I've actually been considering cutting all my family off when I finally move out and get off my father's phone plan. This feeling has been looming over me for the past few days and her words still hurts."	"Your mother is one of the worst kinds of people. Forgive me for what I say here. Your mother is a hypocritical piece of human garbage. She cant declare that the law dosent apply under her roof as if owning a house stops the laws from effecting the premises. And she should be apologizing to you for the total B.S. of you ‚Äúnot‚Äù thinking of her feelings. And your mother sounds. like one of the parents from insaneparents. Her bigotry should not be tolerated. Your father is an even bigger bigot aswell. No parent should ever threaten there child with violence just because the don‚Äôt believe in what there child does.

I know that you will get through this and after this experience you will come out stronger. I am sorry you have to go through this.

P.S. if you need to rant my dms are open to you. And remember you are loved by someone for who you truly are. Not what other people think you should be.
I‚Äôm so sorry. That‚Äôs disgraceful of them. You have a family here who loves you and respects you just the way you are. I know these words are painful, but they‚Äôve lost the privilege of calling you their family.

The comment about your dad has me **extremely** worried. Can you leave? If you can‚Äôt leave immediately, please quietly pack a bug out bag. Legal documents if you can get them without being noticed, anything irreplaceable, any money that‚Äôs yours. (Don‚Äôt take their cash, no matter how tempting; we want to reduce the chance of police involvement.) If your parents could trace your phone, make preparations to ditch it.

Take care of yourself.

Damn I‚Äôm sorry to hear this, I‚Äôm sorta in the same bout I‚Äôm 23 and still live with my parents I‚Äôm working hard to save money to move out (cost of living is expensive tho) and my parents are more or less the same (mainly my mum tho) they‚Äôre both religious and have quite strong beliefs so coming out is a no go for me I don‚Äôt really have many family members to turn to as majority of them are religious and the ones that aren‚Äôt live very far away from me, and the whole ‚Äúmy house my rules‚Äù thing it‚Äôs silly af and I get that I have that problem myself at 23 years olds! For now just keep urself safe u might have to go girl mode for quite sometime until ur able to move out or find safety and that‚Äôs ok it‚Äôs annoying it will take a long time but it‚Äôs important to keep urself safe for now you have many people online that care about u and will support you even if ur real life people don‚Äôt‚Ä¶.

Was posting about how I'd never come out to my mom after a bad conversation on issues and.. then I came out to Mom.	"Everyone is likely aware of the FL law about Gender Tests. My mom's a boomer but barely by a year. Can't seem to get her to look beyond over-optimism about how it will be fixed eventually etc. I am moving from FL to the opposite coast and it's been a really intense emotional rollercoaster. I almost felt pressured to come out to her in this moment. I've been denying it even while living it pre transition but I couldn't just move across the country, and say oh also I'm trans! So I did it now. 

I was deep in dread. I thought I made a mistake. I'm constantly transphobializing myself back and forth. And 5 minutes later she said, oh wow, how is your GF taking it? Take care of yourself, I love you! 

And then I ugly cried the worst I ever done did. It's probably not good but I feel like I can give myself some grace and permission to do this finally. 

Then I went on a tirade about Porter Robinson's new album and most likely now seem wildly unstable, but. It feels good either way."	"I'm in a very similar situation, glad it worked out for you! I still haven't come out to anyone yet, and I'm moving across the world in a few months, and I wasn't sure whether to come out before or after moving. 

Also what didn't you like about Porter's new album? I absolutely loved it!
It's totally up to you though, I just felt it well up and in the last few weeks I've found a lot to become much clearer so I just.. knew I had to. 

>Also what didn't you like about Porter's new album? I absolutely loved it!

Oh shit. I totally meant the opposite. Loved it enough to buy Second Sky tickets and the Live Tour 5 days later too LOL I've legit been on a 2 week roller coaster of Porter music obsession.. Nurture came out on my BIRTHDAY amidst all this emotional storm. I just said oh wow Shelter just made me pretty emotional giving voice to my fears of leaving! Next thing you know Look At The Sky and Sweet Time, Mirror, Musician, the whole album felt like my soul was being called out on every front. 

Hopefully that makes up for making someone believe I did not like Porter's music...
Well to my knowledge, tirade meant going on a long rant, which is why I assumed you didn't like it. Glad to hear you loved it! I've also been on a Porter obsession over the past few months. I used to listen to a LOT of Worlds and Shelter back in 2018-2019, and I came back to the album with nostalgic glasses over the course of Nurture's release. Nurture was probably one of my most anticipated albums of all time, and it somehow still managed to exceed my expectations with some of the experimental songs like Wind Tempos and Lifelike that I didn't expect at all from the singles. Unfold is probably one of my favourite songs of all time now.. I really want to go to Second Sky as well, but there's no shows even remotely close to any place I can go to :(

>It's totally up to you though, I just felt it well up and in the last few weeks I've found a lot to become much clearer so I just.. knew I had to.

Maybe this clarity will come to me in the final few weeks too, hopefully it does."	ncrv3n	trans	32	0.95	2021-05-15 05:49:17
My state just banned gender-affirming care for minors	"
I‚Äôm a 17 year old trans man from Utah. Our state government just banned gender-affirming care for minors who have been established patients for less than 6 months. Obviously I oppose this decision and would like to contact senators and our governor regarding this decision. 

If anyone can provide me with reliable studies about anything relevant to transition (effects on mental health, rates of detransition, etc.), I‚Äôd really appreciate it."	"https://med.stanford.edu/news/all-news/2022/01/mental-health-hormone-treatment-transgender-people.html

Sorry, but I am going to put it out for you. Hopefully either you turn 18 soon or you can cross to a neighboring state to receive care. It is a solid red state and they don't care about you and they don't care about your health. They don't care about facts. The only way to change this is to vote all of these politicians out. Right now, your state is like mine heavily dominated by the right wing bible thumping bigots. It will take quite a while to bring about change.
Arkansas has done the same. Four minor youth and their parents have filed a lawsuit with the help of the ACLU. Until now, they have been able to block the new law and their care has continued. Two appeals have been filed by the state and a final ruling is expected in a few weeks. A favorable ruling will help in other states where these bills have been passed. Much testimony has been given by experts with the information you are seeking if you can find a transcript of the hearings (Brandt v. Rutledge). Our student will be seeking college in a safe state where her care can definitely continue.
It actually doesn‚Äôt effect me. i‚Äôve had top surgery and am an established patient for hormones. It makes sense that they probably don‚Äôt care though. It was really devastating to hear the governor supported it as he‚Äôd just spoke out against a bill that would prevent trans girls from playing sports with other girls. i guess i just expected better than him"	10p42kg	trans	32	0.89	2023-01-30 14:31:44

 ""It's irresponsible for anybody in health care to provide or recommend life-altering surgeries that may later be regretted,"" said Olsen, a Republican.

OK so I guess...literally EVERY surgery should be banned because legal adults aren't responsible enough? We already seem to think anyone with a uterus doesn't know what they want in life their entire life if they want to be sterilized because they'll regret it, gee it's almost like it's not about trying to protect people from harming themselves, it's actually all about keeping people from making their own choices if they don't align with a certain ideology...."

need to ask.	"I'm on pc, i normally use my phone but its broken, so, I'm sorry for spelling errors.

I'm dating this bi girl (she's cis) and I'm mtf. she uses he/him pronouns when she talks about me. i told her how much it hurts, but she still uses those pronouns. A week ago i asked if she will call me a girl when I  transition, she said she will. so, would you guys say she's transphobic?

Edit: it's an online relationship, she lives in germany, and I live in the U.S.

edit 2: some of you might see this as a win... but my partner and I are not an item anymore... i have abandonment issues and everytime when she looked at my message and when she didn't text back i use to be really sad and my anxiety made me think she was gonna break up with me so i told her about it... but it did not help so i said we should take a break until she comes to America. then she got mad/upset/hurt and told me to delete pics of her i didn't have. i told her that the relationship is just put on hold, then she said she didn't care about the relationship she just want the pics delete i told her that i don't have the pics then she told me not to text her again. i told her please don't let it end like this, and that i still love her. but she said i only used her to fill a hole in my heart and that i just wanted her to send me nudes of her. (i did ask her from time to time, but i wasn't using her, and if anything she showed me what it's like to love again). she then blocked me, i went to visit my mother then i checked to see if she still has me blocked, and she doesn't. i hope you enjoyed my update."	"She‚Äôs being mean, I‚Äôd keep an eye out for any other rude behavior
I feel like if she loved you shed at least try to not hurt you yk?
Are you out to other people besides her? Maybe she just doesn‚Äôt want to out you to people who don‚Äôt know
You don‚Äôt need to put up with that shit!
Yeah, if she keeps misgendering you when you correct her and she doesn't even try to use your correct pronouns, she's being very ignorant, and kinda transphobic. Also why would she wait to call you a girl till you transition. You are a girl and she can call you a girl now, because you already are a girl.
Save yourself the pain and leave girl. I just read that it‚Äôs an online relationship and it takes zero effort too type she instead of him tf üôÑ
Not phobic but I'd say she speaks on what she sees so its hard to see you otherwise. Because you've chosen this identity for yourself, the switch isn't made for others that easily or quickly. Many don't acknowledge the change until a change is seen BUT if you keep asking her to respect your pronouns and she doesn't then that's a problem.
Guatemala
not acceptable at all. regardless of whether you look like a girl right now (as you talked about in other comments) she, as your partner, should be making the effort regardless. it's simply not good enough that she won't call you by your pronouns.
she can get rude at times. but only at times.
I'm pretty sure she loves me. I just don't understand why she is using male pronouns with me. She even called me a man the other day.
it's an online relationship and I'm out to everyone online. I had to go back in the closest because I'm scared that my brother will start a fight with her when she uses male pronouns when she moves to the U.S.
do you have any tips to make her stop calling me he/him?
I don't know, maybe she doesn't see me as a girl until i transition?
if i do leave her it won't be easy for me.
I talked to her about it a few times, but it doesn't seem like she'll call me she/her until i transition or maybe she'll never call me she/her. i really don't know yet.
>Guatemala

what?
sadly she isn't my partner anymore.
That sounds like she isn‚Äôt a nice person if this is a pattern of behavior. You don‚Äôt need to be in a relationship if it doesn‚Äôt make you happy. Not being in a relationship is better than a bad one
It's a simple answer, she sees you as a man right now. Not saying it cannot change. But if you talk about it with her and she still refuses to change then- üòê
Then, I‚Äôd say she‚Äôs transphobic, which I‚Äôm sorry to say, and I know you probably don‚Äôt like to hear. Luckily, it seems like she‚Äôs open to change.
I think I would tell her you are transitioning, and part of that is that non-bigots who you keep in your life use your chosen pronouns. Transition looks different for everyone, you have started transition and are hiding aspects but you are a woman and deserve to be talked to like one. 

Not everybody does all the ‚Äòsteps‚Äô of transition, even if you haven‚Äôt begun any physical work on it you are transitioning just by knowing you‚Äôre a woman and sharing with people you trust
Honestly if you‚Äôve told her it hurts and you don‚Äôt want her to do it and she STILL does it, That‚Äôs a deal breaker for me. I want to be fully seen and respected in a relationship and pronouns are the most basic way to do that. So if someone can‚Äôt respect that then I don‚Äôt wanna even talk to them let alone be in a relationship with them.
Transition starts the moment you identify as a woman. End of. If they don't respect your identity, they don't respect you.
Well if she doesn't see you as a woman now, she's completely blind and you should dump her.
Aww, I know. But she literally does not care enough about you for something as simple as pronouns even when you‚Äôve told her how much it hurt you. It‚Äôs your decision at the end of the day but you don‚Äôt deserve someone like that. You know what‚Äôs best for you at the end of the day just know you deserve everything in life.
Guatemala
i wouldn't call it bad. she does make me happy when she isn't calling me he/him or a man
her and i broke up.
Her and I have been dating for almost a year, i really don't want to break up with her.
I'm gonna do every step of transitioning. but i don't think she'll call me a girl until i look like one.
well, she does help me with my depression when she's not calling me he/him. Plus i do love her when she's not calling me he/him
i mean, she does make me happy other than calling me he/him and a man
like the country?
You deserve someone who will respect you, which she clearly isn't doing
Sometimes change doesn't need to be immediate. Communicate clearly how much it's important for you that she uses the right pronouns. Correct her when she does a mistake. That's personally how I got all my older friends to call me correctly
Well, you‚Äôre a woman so you look like a woman. Some women don‚Äôt look like how people expects a woman to look like. 

Even if you plan to one day appear as more of what people expect a woman to look like; you are still a woman today. She needs to know this
You do what feels right for you. I‚Äôm just saying that with the info you gave it‚Äôs a major red flag and sounds like you‚Äôre making excuses for her. Either way I hope you work something out xx
Well, Its your choice ofc. I hope she stops misgendering you.

i did try a couple of times, but it didn't work. But I'll try again.
maybe i am. if her and i don't work out i'll be done with love. maybe that's why i am making excuses for her? and thank you
her and i broke up, so, it'll be hard to do that.
Don't give up. It can be a long process but it will be worth it
thank you for your help
well i can't correct her anymore, we broke up and she told me not to talk to her then blocked me, then she unblocked me but i don't think she'll text me again

I'm not trans but my best friend came out to me last year and I want to know how to support her.	"I (18F) have a best friend (also 18F) who I'll call 'Autumn' for her privacy. She came out to me last year after I connected some dots and very carefully broached the subject to her, and she confessed that she's known she's a woman since the age of approx 8-9. I immediately asked her what she wanted from me as the person she confided in for this, and she told me she wanted help coming out to our friends and being honest with herself. Fast forward a year and all of our amazing friends know and respect her, I helped her pick out her name and have been calling her ""Autumn"" ever since I found out how euphoric it makes her feel. 

The issue is she's from a very religious family, and knows for certain that her strict christian grandparents and her psycho mother are transphobic - among other things. Because of this she knows very little about transitioning and how to be herself, and can only find unreliable sources on google, or false information that upsets her until we disprove it (this has happened a few times). 

We live in the UK and she is extremely concerned about money / costs of gender reassignment.

Does anybody have any tips on how I can support her more, or any useful information that I can pass onto her to comfort her anxieties? TIA xxx"	"You just keep being a source of love and support and that's the best thing. Show support for the community where you can in an organic manner, show patience and love even to the arseholes because that really gets them angry lol. Thanks for being a great friendüíú
It sounds like you're doing great. Based on my own experience, there's a nonzero chance she tears up a little when she talks about you.

At home, she's probably getting the message (if only indirectly) that she's a freak and that being trans isn't a thing. Simply treating her like ""one of the girls"" in your day-to-day interactions can be a valuable antidote to that, just on its own. 

In fact, I think that would be my only advice: identify the specific ways in which she would like to express her gender, then make those feel *normal* to her (as best you can).
I'd say keep being a safe space for her as you have been. Is she able to express herself when around friends?
Just being there for them is all it takes, for me at least. This includes just, not making it a thing, IMO. Just roll with it. I would hate it if people around me who know I‚Äôm trans made it wayyyu too apparent in conversation, or in general. Just let them know that you are there to support them, and make sure you actually follow through with that if you say it!!
put her on the list for hormones. idk if they'll send her a physical letter so maybe let her use your address so that her parents won't find out. The waiting list is extremely long in the UK and it usually takes years, so by the time she can actually get hormones she will likely not be living with her parents anymore
100%. I threw her an 18th birthday party at my own home this weekend with all our friends where everybody called her Autumn (including my mum) and she got to try on feminine clothing etc. I've made it very clear to her that at the very least my home is always going to be a safe space for her and my door is always open.
Thank you I'll pass this onto her
That's lovely! I think you're doing a great job of making her feel welcome. Keep it up. Don't be afraid to check in on her to see if she has anything to say about anything she might need.
that's so sweet! honestly you're a awesome human being and a great friend  
keep being a supportive friend to her and inform her if you find anything you may find useful  


just an idea - you can organize online therapy session at your place, so that when she comes over she can talk about her mind with a specialist
Thank you! It's reassuring to know I'm doing this right, it means a lot to me that she gets to be herself, I feel very strongly that she deserves it and I worry that my own ignorance to trans life will hold her back
I'm happy to see you care so much about her and that you want to learn more. I wish you both good luck and a good long lasting friendship."	y9i48g	trans	29	0.98	2022-10-21 03:08:29
Working towards coming out + Accepting I want validation	"I've felt this yearning in regards to being the opposite of my assigned at birth gender for over 15 years (I'm 29) and it started as mostly subconscious -- how I carried myself, socialized and even how I saw myself in dreams. I was male assigned at birth but there was always this hardwired part of me that knew it wasn't correct. My mind rebelled against it and this big inner conflict just sort of started brewing over the years. In a way I never looked into what it meant to be trans, I think, because I knew it'd open a door I couldn't shut and I was scared. Two years ago I started realizing part of why I have been so unhappy for so long is because there's a part of me that has been present for well over a decade and I keep it locked up and hidden. I grew a beard to double down on being masculine, I purposefully leaned into my voice being deep and I pushed hard in the opposite direction rather than leaning into what felt like \*me\* and being happy. I kept this up, despite it doing so much damage to so many aspects of my life, including various kinds of relationships, and then I started realizing I needed to stop and let myself just breathe and exist as I really am... And COVID hit. Not to be dramatic but the past year has felt like I've been deep in this cocoon of trying to decide who I am and I've had a lot of less than great people try to tell me who I am, but I know now and I know that I am, without a doubt, a transwoman. 

Over the past 6 months I realized that if I could come out, be accepted as a woman even if only by my immediate friends and family, I would be so happy and I would feel like I could truly just breathe and live for the first time ever. But the fear of even one person who I care about hesitating to accept it or denying it or trying to tell me it isn't real shatters me. I crave validation so much and I just really want to lean on this community but I am scared of seeming needy or annoying, I just am tired of hiding and I really need advice. I keep dreaming of transitioning fully, there's a name that's been on my mind for a long time that feels like my \*real\* name and I have so many questions and google only goes so far. I can't tell if it's ""too late"" for me to transition -- When I am clean shaven I can look in the mirror and see a feminine face, when I relax my voice I can hear a much more female voice... But I keep expecting to get hit with this realization that I waited too long or that I could never possibly pass (and I know passing isn't what matters most, but it's a goal for me) without several expensive surgeries... Basically I am getting ahead of myself and an anxious mess.

**Is this the right subreddit to help figure all of this out?** I feel silly asking, but I'm really just making this thread to finally tell someone or anyone in full length that I am trans. I feel like I've been holding it in and sometimes when I am with people I care about and I want them to know so badly but I can't get the words out... I just feel like I can't breathe and I am going to fall apart if I don't get it out there into the world. Before anyone mentions it, because I know it's a very appropriate suggestion, I am seeking a therapist out to help with this as well. I just moved to California fairly recently and just want to have the right person and am being very picky in that pursuit. 

tl;dr: Hello, I have privately known I am trans for a long time, interacted with the community from a distance and wished I was on the inside rather than outside and I am finally here. Better late than never and I just want to live as my authentic self."	"I think this is definitely a place you can post this. I can only really speak for myself, but I'm sure almost everyone in the community is happy to help you and give advice where we can ‚ò∫Ô∏è
Hello and welcome. I'm so happy that you are starting the first steps!
I can relate to a lot of things you say here. I‚Äôm soon 24, ftm, and despite so many people on here telling me I‚Äôm not too ‚Äúold‚Äù to transition, I still feel like I missed a huge chunk of my life, that I‚Äôm less valid because it took me this long to realize. I too doubled down on my agab, presenting considerably more feminine, when in reality I was not at all comfortable like that. Not to say I‚Äôm some manly man, but since coming out as trans I have embraced my own femininity in a less toxic and hurtful way for myself. 

But anyway, to stay on topic, I know how you feel. It breaks my heart to even consider a loved one taking the news poorly, and I choke up every time I try to come out to friends. The only ones who knows are my roommates who are supportive, for sure, but also have absolutely o insight and can‚Äôt really understand the ‚Äútrans experience‚Äù so to say. The one thing I‚Äôve found so far to make my mind stay clear of hurtful doubt and anxiety about this is to try to find people to relate to. And sure, in the beginning, that meant finding coming out stories that somewhat aligned with my own realization, but at this point what is really valuable is just watching like trans ppl on tiktok making jokes about their day to day life and finding a spark of recognition in it. Makes me feel like I‚Äôm less alone. Even just ranting about masc clothes to my friend who is questioning if they are nonbinary is a huge thing sometimes. 

So while I can‚Äôt exactly give you any solid advice, having not travelled very far myself on this journey, I will say that my inbox is always open if you just wanna go and be yourself with someone, rant about things, or whatever you may need. Sometimes you just want to feel understood and heard. ü§ç

I am now out as trans most everywhere, before I even started meaningfully/significantly transitioning. And I'm just - happy?	"This post is inconsequential to the point of being fluff, but I feel like there is some value both in its specifics, and in adding some positivity. Plus I have a surplus of good energy I want to share? So here goes.

I'm a trans woman, 35, born and living in Poland. I figured out I'm trans in early December of last year. After years of vague unease, things finally clicked.  


I'm honestly shocked how fast things developed from there. Long story short, I gradually came out, first on social media, then to my team at work and close friends, and on the Trans Day of Visibility, I surprised even myself by going ahead and full-on coming out to most everyone. At work, on social media, why the heck not.  


It feels surreal because it happened fast, and otherwise I barely even did anything that counts as transitioning. I dress differently - but only at home, for now. I shave body hair regularly. I experimented with makeup like once, and then stopped because it gave me insane dysphoria. No therapy, no psychologist appointments, no doctor visits. I want to proceed with all that, but it's mostly been coming out, and talking to people about my gender a whole lot.  


Which is why I'm making this post. If you follow anything at all about what's up with Europe, you know I live in a pretty shitty country as far as LGBT+ rights in general, and trans acceptance in specific, are concerned. And it's easy to fall into the trap of thinking everything is terrible forever, and I can be nothing but miserable.  


My experience is... disturbingly positive. I've made new friends thanks to coming out. I am better friends with a few people I've known for years but never really talked to. A lot of people are crazy supportive, and no-one has been negative about my coming out. People seem to understand, and those who do NOT understand either try very hard to learn, or keep a respectful silence. I don't remember the last time I've felt so loved, sometimes by people from whom I'd never expect this sheer LEVEL of warmth and support.  


I keep expecting the other shoe to drop, for bad stuff to happen, but other than dysphoric episodes and a truckload of self-doubt, this has been amazing. And again - I have barely started transitioning at all, if you can call it that. And I keep putting off meaningful transition steps, even ones I can handle at present. But I continue to be happy.  


I think I'm writing this because things that are trans-specific are often presented as either scary and dangerous (which they very well can be), or if they're positive, seem to centre around either young people, big successes in terms of physical appearance, or both. I'm in my mid-30s, I look very masculine and in some cases, I have strong doubts as to HOW to even change that. I am moving at a snail's pace with transition (and I'm starting at such a late time in my life, argh), but I'm happy. It's worth it. It's scary, but not overwhelming.  


I think on some level I am sharing this because I wish I'd read something like this years ago, to nudge me forward. I'm not saying ""don't be careful"" to anyone. I'm not saying I'm not lucky (and undeservedly so. Seriously). But - things may surprise you. People may shock you with how supportive they are. Things may work out? Maybe?

There are things I'm not wild about (for instance, my parents do try, but my father accidentally misgendered me like seven times in a few minutes yesterday. Yikes), but in some ways, the past 4 months have been more meaningful than the past several years at least. Everything seems meaningful now, even things that are not related to my being trans whatsoever. I'm excited for and about things in my life. All sorts of things.  


Transness is not all doom and gloom. It's pretty neat."	"Glad to hear you're doing well! I'm mid 30's yet to to start HRT as well due to circumstance and it's really nice to hear a positive story that's so relatable.
I kinda keep waiting for the shoe to drop where I am. The only people I've had issues with have been my family, but some of my friends have had issues and so I'm being careful with information for now.
Good luck, hopefully things continue to go well for ya <3"	twxik4	trans	31	0.99	2022-04-05 15:25:46
I DID IT	"I CAME OUT TO MY PARENTS
I mean it went mostly tepid, but I DID IT AND IM STILL IN MY OWN BED! It took me like thirty minutes to get the words out of my god damn mouth and when I did they weren‚Äôt happy but they didn‚Äôt yell. I think they know I‚Äôm smarter now, and also I just talked for ten minutes without stopping so they got to zone out and process thoughts. I tried to explain everything I could as best I could, I didn‚Äôt actually let them read the letter I had planned out for them but who cares. Maybe tomorrow. The next step is convincing them this is Not a phase, that it‚Äôs Not Bad, and to let me transition. Well, after I get them to call me by my name and pronouns. It‚Äôs just... they didn‚Äôt kick me out but they aren‚Äôt any kind of happy about it either, which sucks ass. They‚Äôre really not accepting but they‚Äôre not rejecting? Idk. Anyways, CELEBRATION."	"Congrats üéâ 


Unfortunately my own folks weren‚Äôt happy with me when I told Mom and then Dad much later on. Yes, they still financially support me, but they don‚Äôt support my transition. I‚Äôm going to have my GRS Surgery in April and I can‚Äôt bare to tell them this. I live in Hawai‚Äôi, now on my own. My parents live on the East Coast. They only know I take hormones, but that‚Äôs about it. I encourage them to read up on gender and gender identity related topics, but they refuse to read more about it. I don‚Äôt want them to cut my financial support for me cause my work place doesn‚Äôt give me the financial cost I need to live in Hawai‚Äôi on my own and live at the place I currently live at. 

Hope they still will financially support you in however they can. This is the first step in truly being you. You have a whole family of transgender females and transgender males who can help you in your process. 
Well, it's certainly better than yelling and immediately kicking you out! Congrats on having the courage to do that, it took me forever. Now you can start experimenting and see how far they will accept it. I wish you the best on your journey!
Congrats! I came out via text. Actually, sent a video about trans people to my mum when I was out of the country. Went best that way. She told my dad. 
Congrats to you for living your life and being your true self to the people you love.

I am not trans, so take my comments with a huuuuuuge ""she doesn't really know what she's talking about"" grain of salt, please. But I am a parent, and that is where I'm coming from. As a parent, you have an idea of how you think your child's life is going to go. I have two sons and two stepsons, and I picture them getting married to their wives some day and having kids and coaching little league and stuff. If one or more of them came to me and said that I was wrong all along and I have a daughter rather than a son...I think it would take me a minute to adjust. But know this, I'm wrong, every parent is probably wrong. Our kids are not extensions of ourselves, and they are going to live their own lives whether it is coming out as trans or joining the peace corps and running away abroad instead of settling down and giving us grandkids, or whatever it is. If we are lucky, if we hopefully did an okay job, our kids will be strong enough to be who they are and live the lives that bring them bliss, even if those lives are not what we expected.

Your parents are most likely processing all of this right now. But my hope for them and for you is that one day soon, they will finish processing and realize that you haven't changed. You are the person you always were, but now you are old enough and strong enough to ask that it be recognized. And that no matter what mistakes they made (trust me, we all do, making mistakes is the ever present bane of parenthood) they raised a child who knows who they are and who is chasing their bliss. And that's a beautiful thing.

Good luck and much love to you, Fishie. From this mom: ya done good."	akkehw	trans	28	0.91	2019-01-28 05:39:23
Oregon mother sues after state refuses adoption for not affirming trans procedures	"I saw [this Fox News article](https://www.foxnews.com/us/oregon-mother-sues-after-state-refuses-adoption-not-affirming-trans-procedures-attorney) in my news feed this morning. We all know Fox is hot garbage, but I decided to see what it was about.  I was amused & annoyed at this woman's audacity.

> Jessica Bates, a mother of five who lives in rural Malheur County, Oregon, ... whose husband was killed in a car accident in 2017 ... felt called to adopt because of her Christian faith ... 

This lady has five kids and no partner, and now she wants to add two more to the pile?! How is she going to pull an income while also giving each kid the love and attention they need? How does she do it now? 

> The agency reportedly denied her application because she was unwilling to abide by¬†the Oregon State Code¬†requiring that foster parents must ""respect, accept, and support ‚Ä¶ the sexual orientation, gender identity, [and] gender expression"" of an adopted child. ... Bates, who was seeking to adopt two siblings under age 9 ... [wrote] ""I don‚Äôt know how many children there are out there under the age of 9 who fall into this category (and to me it‚Äôs kind of crazy that society is wanting to get kids thinking about this stuff¬†at such young ages; I think we should let them keep their innocence), so this may not even be an issue,"" ... An ODHS official later asked whether she would hypothetically support providing children with cross-sex hormones if they requested it, and she responded by saying she believed that was child abuse, the suit said.

Setting aside whether or not a 9 year old is old enough to make any kind of decisions, she's completely glossing over the idea that as the kids get older, they may want to transition.  If one of the kids is 16, realizes they're trans, and in her care, that's 7+ years that these two have lived with her - it's not like she can say ""well now they want hormones so I don't want them."" The state is trying to protect against this eventuality.

> ""Oregon‚Äôs policy makes a sweeping claim that all persons who hold¬†certain religious beliefs¬†‚Äî beliefs held by millions of Americans from diverse religious faiths ‚Äî are categorically unfit to care for children,"" ADF Legal Counsel Johannes Widmalm-Delphonse said in a statement.

There are plenty of Christians who love and accept members of the LGBTQIA+ community and have no desire to force them into a cishet box."	"It blows my mind how quick bigots are to say that their religious rights are more important than someone's else's right to self-determination. Just because something isn't a part of your religion doesn't mean your religious rights are being violated.
this woman was looking for a lawsuit, quite honestly.
Props to Oregon. Religion as a protected class is flawed as shit. It is not a characteristic of someone, it's a mutable belief system and being a part of a cult shouldn't exclude your shitty values from being put under a microscope.
Exactly. The ""I don't care what you do in your own home, just don't force me to deal with it"" argument goes out the window when you're bringing other lives into it. The only reason she might have that kind of control over her existing 5 kids is because she (presumably) birthed them, so she didn't have to tell the government / adoption agency that she's a bigot until now.
You know, that kinda makes sense. Like maybe she didn't actually want another 2 kids, but wanted to flex her bigotry."	12crxsg	trans	28	0.89	2023-04-05 17:38:22
so i came out to my therapist...	"Yesterday i came out to my therapist as trans masc and idk what to think about her reaction. In a way she was very supportive and i know that she has many clients who are trans, so i felt secure to come out to her. On the other hand she said some things that made me sceptical about her understanding being trans.

She's cis so i cannot expect her to know what it's like to be trans but she's a therapist who is (seemingly) specialised on queer topics. So i guess i expected her to know that some phrases like 'having a complicated relationship to your body is also common for many 'normal' people' feels very invalidating.
Especially when after dropping that sentence she said 'well you know i don't wanna say that trans people aren't normal, you know what i mean' and i think it's exactly what she's thinking even though she's trying to be supportive and doesn't view trans people as something bad or disgusting.
I think that she's trying her best and she also told me about the options i have for my transition which i thought was great. 

Maybe she didn't understand that i'm telling her i'm trans at first bc i didn't say 'oh btw i'm trans' but carefully put hints until reaching that topic in a session and then put it in other words and primarily tried to describe what i feel and experience. 

Now idk what to think or do when i see her the next time. In a way I feel both supported and criticised at the same time which isn't really helping with believing and supporting myself (ig there are many people out there who know the struggle) 

Does anyone have a similar experience or any advise?

Thanks to anyone who read this

Tamino"	"Ouch, ‚Äûnormal people‚Äú.  
Would definitely bring this up to her next time, how it makes you doubt her views on queer people. Hopefully it was a genuine slip up.  

If you didn‚Äòt say it directly, she might think you don‚Äòt know much about the topic, yet. Or maybe that you are questioning.  
If you feel very secure in your self-diagnosis, tell her directly next time. If you did a lot of looking up or trying stuff already, tell her that, too. I bet that would help her support you better. :-)
Does sound a little bit like she said the quiet thing out loud and then tried to backpedal. Idk, if she's trying her best overall and is supportive otherwise, I'd forgive it.

When I contacted one of my country's top LGBTQ+ therapists for help with my gender she asked how long I ""planned on identifying as non-binary for."" And she is trans herself. I ended up sticking with my cis therapist that helped with my CPTSD for help with my gender issues too, she was way better.
Tell her, explicitly, narrowly and specifically, when she says something you're not OK with. She's human, and she might have blind spots or a flawed approach that she might not be aware of. It's probably not malicious, but that doesn't mean it doesn't have to change.

For instance, when she described cis people as ""normal""? Next time you talk to her, explicitly mention that. Say she talked about cis people and described them as normal and that it directly implies she thinks trans people are not normal. Say that it bothers you that she would say that, and think that.

My advice is - don't skirt around things she has said. Don't talk about it in vague or general terms. Go through it point by point. Name things you think are wrong about what she said, say why, and be polite by extremely direct about it. Make a written list if necessary, in case you're worried you'll miss something or won't know how to describe something, in the moment.

Then go from there, based on her reactions.
I don‚Äôt have any experience with this, but if she‚Äôs a good therapist who is simply uneducated I think the best think you can do is bring up that some of her comments were very invalidating and why (you can do this while she makes them, but you can also totally do that in your next appointment as time to think about how to talk about it can be very helpful). I would also correct her if she uses normal when she means cis. She definately should know the term cis, but she might not, so maybe she just needs someone to explain that there is a better word for what she means
I had a similar experience last week. I told my therapist that i was trans (FtM) and her next question is ""so you like women?"".... *insert eyeroll*
Anyway, i had to explain to her what being trans ment, cus i understand that there's a lot of misinformation and that she's a 50+year old cis het woman who probably doesn't know any trans people. 
But she kept asking questions about my sexuality, and then she said ""there's some people who  become homosexuals after a sexual abuse"" then proceeded to ask if i was abused, ""some people are just looking for their parent in a partner"" then asked about my relationship with my mother, ""some people decide to be homosexuals because it's a trend,  but actually aren't and are very unhappy"". Tbh i stopped listening at this point. I know that she was well intentioned and she is quite ignorant in this issues, but i felt very insecure bc she's supposed to be the expert here, and i felt like i had to justify my existence, and to prove that i was not pretending to be lgbt because of a trend, an abuse or bc i miss my mom. I left that session feeling deeply sad, angry and disappointed. I felt like all the progress i made in therapy in the past months was worth nothing. I have calmed down since then but i'm still questioning whether to come back.
Idk if this advice can help you: my friend told me to get out of there, that my therapist shouldn't make me feel judged, and that talking to them should feel like a conversation between friends. 
Personally i think i will come back for another session, i don't think my therapist was trying to make me feel judged or insecure, so im giving her another chance, but if i start to feel worse than when i entered , i think i would start looking for a therapist specialized in lgbt matters. I know this is not much of an advice but i just wanted to let you know that you are not alone, and that there's a lot to be done when it comes to education of lgbt issues. I hope you can find a solution , and remeber that you are valid.
You have to understand that as a healthcare provider you cannot just diagnose someone in a second even if they‚Äôre telling you right there of course she should acknowledge your situation and of course she‚Äôs probably planing on helping you from her professional point of view but I believe she wants to talk about it; discuss and disregard other possible causes, like any other provider and any other diagnosis; lots of trans people think that cis people never question their gender and that‚Äôs just not true at all.
Apparently my therapist has quite a few trans patients but I‚Äôm constantly educating her on lots of trans topics and lingo and I‚Äôm a little surprised that her other trans clients don‚Äôt mention these things \*shrug\*
Thank you so much, sounds like a good advise. I think I'll try to bring up that topic again next time and prepare what I want to say before session. It's just that I've experienced that some people (e.g. my parents) are more open and supportive on topics they understand bc I told them how I feel before telling them it means I'm trans. I also heard from people experiencing discrimination after coming out to their therapist so I tried to go the same way as I do with my parents. But I think you could be right. Maybe I have to say it directly for her to understand that it's real for me.
Yeah I'm not very resentful anyways. I'll definitely give it another chance and then I'll see if I can work with her or if I should look for a new therapist ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
Thank you so much! This is some very useful advice <3
Yeah I think it's too soon to decide whether she's a good therapist (only had about 5 sessions with her) and I'll give her a chance and try to tell her when I feel misunderstood or if she seems rude or ignorant. Thank you <3
Ouuuffff that sounds like something my dad would say with a very sincere and knowing voice. Also i know that, feeling like you have to justify and defend yourself in a place that should be safe and accepting...it helps so much to not be alone with that topic, so thank you! Also for your advice and validation!! I think I'll give her another chance and try to tell her how I feel about the things she says. If she keeps making me feel questioned, I'll probably stop going there for therapy but it's too soon to decide yet.
Probably due to not knowing how to handle such situations ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
I think it was a great way to test the water. One never knows who might turn out to be transphobic. Good luck OP.
Thank you buddy"	txhpyq	trans	30	0.89	2022-04-06 08:54:40
I see a lot of the same posts, so here's an FAQ	"**Question: Am I trans?**

**A: No one can answer that except for you, and only your answer is valid.** 

That said, there are things to look for. Do you experience pleasure, maybe even great happiness experimenting with items and activities not of your Assigned Gender At Birth? That's gender euphoria, and is an excellent indicator. Do you only experience pain and self loathing about your current body and/or situation? That's called dysphoria, and might potentially have a different cause if you're not able to experience euphoria. Maybe.

**Question: What is a good name for me?**

**A: Don't ask reddit.**

Names are serious business. You should find a name that really calls to you. Something that you can feel as you (maybe eventually, name changes take time even emotionally). Also, make sure it's a name you'll be comfortable with in 20 years time, 40 years, or more. Naming yourself Lucifer Pendragon (not something I actually read) or some such might sound neat now, but imagine you're interviewing for a job or out on a date and trying to explain that name. Might not be the best idea, but also is entirely your choice.

**Question: How do I come out?**

**A: Whichever way is easiest for you.**

We don't know your life story, your personality, you living situation. We can offer suggestion like ""use a note"" or ""have a friend do it for you"". Ultimately, you'll need to be the one to do it *if you feel safe doing so*, and will need to face your anxiety and fears to do it.

**Question: What do I need to know before XYZ medical thing?**

**A: Ask your doctor.**

Reddit is a terrible place to ask for medical advice. Most of us are not doctors. Some of us might have a fair amount of experience, having done the things and asked the questions, but we **cannot** be counted on as a reliable source of medical wisdom.

**Question: Where do I get a Bl√•haj?**

**A: Ikea.**

**Question: Am I valid?**

**A: Yes.**

**Question: Am I cute?**

**A: Yes.**

**Question: How do I DIY?**

**A: Don't.**

If you're asking this question, you are not a medical professional, and neither are we (as previously stated). DIY is ***EXTREMELY RISKY***. The people who do it are taking severe risks because they have no more options left. If you for some reason feel like you really do not have an option, do your own research. **AT LENGTH**. Waiting still counts as an option.

**Question: Am I too old to transition?**

**A: No. HARD no.**

There are people who are happy and fulfilled who first start their transition in their 60's. If you had to wait a few years, I promise you will be okay.

********************************

A final note: We are a self-absorbed bunch of people out of necessity. Being trans means we need extra self care. However, don't forget that other people are on their just as valid journeys as well. We sometimes get lost in our own worlds that we forget that our struggles can and sometimes do make our friends and loved ones lives difficult as well. Self care is amazing, but don't burn all your bridges in pursuit of it.

Also, there is so much more to life than being trans. Don't forget all the other wonderful things in and around your life that you can still experience. If you base your entire life on the trans experience, you will eventually crash and burn...I promise. Live ALL of life, not just the trans part of it."	"Good job sis !

"Any more information on ""ex-trans-kid"" and anti-trans activist Chloe Cole? (Or her parents for that matter?)"	"(Disclaimer that I'm not trans myself, but simply interested in this topic. Also, mods please delete if this sort of post isn't allowed. Also, this is not a call to doxx Chloe Cole or anyone close to her.)

For anyone who is not aware, Chloe Cole is an 18-year-old, self-professed ""former trans kid"" who, according to her story, began medically transitioning to male at 13 before top surgery at 15, after which she had second thoughts and detransitioned. She has gained some attention in the media by using her testimony to help lead a crusade against any sort of trans care for minors, and just recently announced her intention to sue the doctors who treated her.

It goes without saying that her story is very upsetting, though not for the reason she intends; she is ushering along the wave of anti-trans legislature and is doing an unmeasurable amount of harm to the trans community based on her single experience. While the impact would be just as negative if everything could be taken as truth, it's worth noting that there is a lot that does not add up about her story.

It is difficult to find any information on her to verify her claims of sketchy treatment options (like going on T just a month after beginning puberty blockers), nor does she have much of a digital footprint that could help build a profile on her. The only people rallying around her are fellow anti-trans activists and politicians and whomever is handling her travel to all the rallies and events she attends. It's as though she came out of nowhere and only exists for this specific, toxic purpose.

Does she have friends (online or otherwise)? What do former classmates think of her? Most importantly, however: where the hell are her parents?? Chloe has avoided making her parents available for the duration of her activism, though she states that they would like to remain private and that she sees them as also having been misled by doctors for allowing her to transition. But why would they let their daughter go up to the podium(s) alone and make herself vulnerable to criticism and scorn if they were on her side? (My theory is that they disapprove of her ""work"" and don't wish to publicly criticize their daughter; if this is true, however, their lack of input on the narrative she's pushing is still cowardly, at best.) It's bizarre that legislation over people's lives and medical care has been influenced by one teenage girl's intimate crisis, but we know so little else about her. If there is any more information about her or where she came from -- or if she is credible -- it is very, very difficult to find. Am I missing something?"	"Something smells off with this story -
I had the same initial thoughts so I made a timeline assuming the first post on her Twitter was made when she was at least 18 years old.

The dates in the lawsuit are way off from her public comments. She would have been in transition for less than 1.5 years before her surgery consult and would have attended a top surgery class at 14, not 15. It sounds reasonable that she had been prescribed puberty blockers at 13, but I have serious issues with an endocrinologist also starting her on testosterone one month later as WPATH does not recommend this simultaneously, and does not recommend irreversible interventions prior to 18, and also requires a sign-off by a licensed psychologist. 

Was the treatment center Cole went to unaware of WPATH guidelines and fast-tracking care due to ignorance? Absolutely not.  The article here from 2018 discusses the steps that [Kaiser Permanente has been taking to provide gender-affirming care in a responsible manner](https://www.apa.org/monitor/2018/11/care-transgender). 

She slapped a lawsuit on everyone who could have spoken out right before she went public. She then immediately commenced a speaking tour that went live immediately following the November election. She also manages to go to and fro as an 18-year-old despite the inability to book hotel rooms (her words), rent cars (try it for yourself before you're 25), and ""on her own."" Cole says she is the youngest of five and speaks of her parents in testimony but none of them are visible. This is not an attempt to doxx her, no one has come out to speak on her behalf. If she's the youngest at 18, her older siblings are all of age and able to make their own statements. She also blocks ""ex-friends"" on her Twitter.

Her lawsuit states a total damage recovery of $1,050,000.

Her story, if it is real, is horrible. No one seeking gender-affirming care should be met with providers who fast-track care that gives a 13yo puberty blockers AND testosterone and then puts them through top surgery less than two years later at 15. Her advocacy is being used to very vocally support the blocking of ALL gender-affirming care for youth no matter if it follows the WPATH guidelines and this is what I take issue with. She is being held up as a poster child and advocating for zero interventions prior to the age of 18. *This will kill kids*. 

Youth that could have had life-saving care with puberty blockers will now be denied because one detransitioned adult might have had an extremely negative experience with irresponsible providers. Being able to poke holes in her timeline in less than a day only adds to this feeling of an overall and extremely coordinated hoax. Chloe Cole may quietly disappear one day much in the same manner that she appeared out of thin air. The damage she has done and continues to do will stay with us forever if she is, in fact, a convenient plant.

I know I‚Äôll probably be downvoted for this, but I‚Äôm very suspicious about her medical transition. She says that she was on T for around 3-4 years, yet her voice has barely dropped, she literally just sounds like a cis woman with a deep voice. Also all of the actual detransitioners I‚Äôve seen have shown their top surgery scars to prove that they actually had it, and Chloe still hasn‚Äôt shown her scars to this day, even tho she‚Äôs 18 and is now an adult. I doubt that she ever medically transitioned, she socially transitioned at most.
Not sure if you‚Äôre still curious, but I‚Äôve had much of the same questions myself. I speculate (ie, this is an educated guess) that she probably transitioned to some extent (but not as extreme as the story she gives media) because of the attention she gained from it. I don‚Äôt think she ever truly believed she was trans. Once that burst of attention wore off, she went with the next most attention-grabbing option. Seems like someone who just wants eyes on her & doesn‚Äôt care what it takes to get it. She‚Äôs young enough that I don‚Äôt think she either realizes or cares about the amount of damage she is causing. A one-woman (girl?) force with the power to influence legislation across the country. She likes it, and is getting paid to do it, and will continue doing it regardless of the morality. 

Whoever is backing her had enough foresight to completely eradicate whatever her previous online presence once. If they did their work well enough, I don‚Äôt think we will get the truth until her parents come forward and give their story. She‚Äôs already been shown to be willing to lie, and continues to give a narrative that doesn‚Äôt add up while declining to name any names. I don‚Äôt believe she‚Äôs withholding names out of any desire to protect those involved, because she clearly doesn‚Äôt care about that. But the more sensational her story is, and the less places people have to cross-reference that story, the more money, attention, and influence she will gain. 

Now we either wait for family/friends to step forward (those who can‚Äôt be bribed out of doing so), or wait for someone to uncover the truth on their own.
Ironic that I find this thread after only a few minutes of searching for more information about Chloe Cole, following some Twitter transphobe using her as a reason to parrot the old ""trans people brainwash children! Agendas, mutilation, blah blah"" argument.

Highly suspicious that somebody that young could progress through a medical transition so quickly, when most trans adults have to fight for years to be able to even access treatment. I'd love to know if there's more details or proof to back up her story.
Agree. Something doesn't ring true.
Even in the recent letter where she says she is going to sue the hospital, literally they keep referring to her parents as ""the parents"" no names, nothing. It seems very off, and the fact that she never mentions where city she is from, she always says ""central valley of California"". Curious enough, nothing about past friends or family around her or even supporting her online, only these alt right grifters.
I found this thread as I‚Äôm having all the same thoughts listed above and was even googling the medical conditions her lawyers allege she has as a result of her treatment but as my name states, I‚Äôm not a doctor. I find the whole thing very strange but I also have no idea why I‚Äôm so invested.

Saw this recently about her. Look at the link in the comments and you can see is Chloe is willing to lie about anything.
Only other thing was this article which highlights the exact weirdness you're pointing out.

Do you also get the vibe that something could be off about one of the key details that of her story? Like, that she‚Äôs not just some vulnerable detrans person who took whatever support she could get? The timeline of her transitions sounds implausible (though not impossible), and there‚Äôs no proof she even had a mastectomy. That‚Äôs not impossible either, but the next person would have put their doctor on blast by now.
2 issues with all of this, but first, thank you for putting so much real and actual thought into this, something that is exceedingly rare in a time where everyone thinks that having Google at their fingertips makes them an expert on absolutely anything. My first issue is your emphasis on her story if true somehow resulting in people dying. The reason I take issue with this isn't necessarily because of the overly extreme nature of the comment, it's pretty common to hear that, but because it is that precise argument that her parents would have been uppercuted in the stomach with when the conversation of her treatment was had. Every time this argument is used, which it is not true as all of the psychological research has indicated that 80% of all gender dysphoric children come to terms with their gender by the age of 18, and preliminary investigations of young children transitioning indicates that at least 70% of those that decide to transition end their lives. That is a strong indication that messing with people's ideas of gender before they have grown into an adult actually leads to more deaths, not less. But every time that argument is used against parents they're being manipulated with an untruth and socially shamed into abiding by whatever decision their child, well under the age of consent for sex or anything else in their life, makes. I have another issue with your comment but at this point, I can't really continue. That being said I would greatly appreciate your thoughts on this.

I do not mean to degrade, just continue the conversation. Again, thank you for your well-developed thoughts.
Could you PM the lawsuit documents? I wanna read the thing in full cuz I‚Äôve only seen the first page on social media
Her lawyer is Harmeet Dhillon, former VP of the California Republican Party. She ran for Assembly and Senate but didn‚Äôt win either. She was a legal advisor for Trump and was supportive of the big election lie. So, she definitely has an agenda. I agree it‚Äôs very suspicious that there is no background information on this Chloe character. It‚Äôll be interesting to see if they actually try to sue the doctor and what details come out.
I‚Äôve noticed that with a lot of TERF-flavored detransitioners: you never see their families rally around them. It‚Äôs just other detrans people, transphobes, and misinformed people who mean well and feel bad for them. It makes me feel a little bad for them, tbh; particularly since Chloe is so young and, while her decisions and opinions are her own, she could still use a lot of guidance and support.
Can you drop the link(s) for the sources of that research? Please don't take that as negative - I have different numbers which are much, much lower, and want to compare study methods. Detransitioners do exist and should be supported, they are also a subgroup of a subgroup that is a subgroup of gender incongruence.  Not all people with a gender identity or expression that is in discord with their sex at birth engage in gender-affirming care that involves hormone replacement therapy and/or surgery. For those that do take pathways with semi-reversible or permanent effects, the amount of detransition is extremely rare (not nonexistent but rare). Out of those with regret, it is more common that the regret is related to not having the desired outcome as opposed to being related to their gender identity. That regret, what this thread is related to, even more rarely leads to suicidal ideation. [https://doi.org/10.1016/j.socscimed.2021.114477](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.socscimed.2021.114477)

A person who alleges (according to her own lawsuit) to have taken depo-testosterone between 2/12/2018 and 5/28/2021 would have irreversible effects that do not appear present in the online videos and images available on her Instagram and Twitter. It's more than a coating of vocal cords resulting in a deeper tone. I can not locate any media showing facial hair growth, or redistribution of fat. Her fingers, visible pre-regimen, and post-regimen remain identical and this is not in line with redistribution. Anyone on depo-testosterone can feel free to chime in on this one. Rings that were worn comfortably pre-T no longer fit the same way within the first few months, and are no longer wearable on the same fingers within 1 year.

I‚Äôm a lefty but the idea of slicing, dicing and drugging kids when their frontal cortex is nowhere near developed seems like an agenda as well. When you are 18 and an adult, you take the risk with your adult body but leave kids alone.
I'm re-reading this and realized I did not provide an answer to one of your comments in my reply. Yes, the dialogue she engages in at general assemblies and rallies which calls for the cancellation of all gender-affirming care for minors will result in the self-harm, suicidal ideation, and suicides of youth who will no longer have access to that care. I can not speak to the ""would you rather have a dead daughter or a living son"" portion of her lawsuit as I was not inside the room where those words may have been relayed to her parents. Those words would have been extremely unsettling to any parent, in my personal opinion. But, they are very true examples of legitimate claims for the parents of youth whose gender incongruence rises to a level wherein they develop an unresolvable disruption of their ability to live coupled with an inability to address that incongruence through gender-affirming care.  Blocking access to gender-affirming care in those cases would be the equivalent of pulling the trigger on a loaded gun.

If you're reading this and gender-affirming care is no longer an option to you where you live or within your circumstances, please know that you have people looking out for you, and do not dare give up hope for yourself or for the person you are reading this thread on behalf of. We. Are. Everywhere.

Please, stay here and help us find you. You are not alone, you are valid, and you mean the world to someone you might not get to meet if you leave too soon.

Most kids aren‚Äôt getting surgery. In Chloe‚Äôs case, it sounds like she was suicidal and her parents signed off on the surgery instead of seeking a second opinion from a different psychiatrist.
Chloe is definitely bending the truth, there are extremely rare cases were doctors will agree to preform surgery on a minor, and that being said it would have to be with parents consent and constant check ups with a psychologist/psychiatrist, and all parties would be well informed of the long term affects and then have to sign off on everything, any doctor preforming surgery on a minor would most likely not want a case like this where the child then decides they are going to sue the doctor for malpractice, so I‚Äôm almost certain her doctors informed her of everything her future would hold if this wasn‚Äôt the right choice for her and I‚Äôm 100% certain they wouldn‚Äôt do an early surgery unless the child was threatening suicide consistently. 

I agree with someone else‚Äôs statement that it sounds like she is hoping from one attention grabbing thing to the next and doesn‚Äôt care about what consequences she is forcing on the trans community for her and her parents mistake of either not listening to the doctors or reading over any documents about transitioning, or it was a long and lengthy process to convince the doctors the surgery was absolutely needed
What about the drugs bring put into these kids, the hormones and the parents definitely trying to get attention by acting like thrive done something ‚Äú progresdive‚Äù and cool. There's some needed psychological questions that need to be asked her. There is a political- cultural agenda on both sides that has nothing to do with what's best for kids.
What‚Äôs best for a child is a decision for the child, the parents, and the doctor to make together, you should not be voting to control other peoples decisions if it doesn‚Äôt affect you in the slightest, trans kids should be allowed to take puberty blockers if they aren‚Äôt sure what they want to do, kids who are extremely rare cases and get surgery or take hormones before 18 are  1% of the 1% who are trans, again you shouldn‚Äôt be making a decision for them, that‚Äôs up to their parents to talk to the child and the doctor to talk to both the child and parents and saying no one can ever receive care based on a extremely rare basis is asinine. 

Most psychology and psychiatry recognizes there has been more than one gender in MANY cultures long before the 2000‚Äôs we are finally able to help these people and blocking puberty doesn‚Äôt do anything irreversible, and if an adult decides they want to go through with transitioning then that‚Äôs none of your business, and if a parent decides that their child needs gender affirming care then that‚Äôs also none of your business"	ytneur	trans	30	0.89	2022-11-13 00:47:19
Every time I go to my monthly psychiatric assessments, I wanna throw up. Possible trigger.	"Hope you're having a wonderful year. I was keeping this inside myself for a while, decided to speak up. So I need to visit my monthly psychiatric assessments as a trans person receiving gender-affirming healthcare, it's not optional sadly. And doctors there can be very ignorant, or even worse they can act weird sometimes. Every time I go, it's a different doctor and the hospital staff is supposed to have knowledge and be willing to help transgender patients, hence it's the only hospital serving gender-affirming care in my area.  I really didn't felt safe there and I was very anxious. He asked me very intrusive questions that I'd never expect from a medical professional.

Part of our conversation was like this;

Him: ""Would you have sexual intercourse with someone if they offered you?""

I was like... whaat...?

Me: ""So... if I trust a person enough and we have trustworthy, reassuring communication, I would have, just like every other person.""

Him: ""I mean if someone just asked you to have sexual intercourse with you now, would you accept?""

At this point, I was aware that he was crossing the line. I've repeated my last sentence, explicitly.

Me: ""As what every person with healthy thinking pattern would do, I would be with someone I trust enough.""

This is also because I wanted to divert the conversation and let him know that I'm not comfortable talking about this, since it's something very private. Let me ask you, would he be able to ask this to a cis woman with that entitlement and ease?

What actually made me sad is, from a medical point of view, as a psychiatrist he's supposed to ask me if hormones and my further social transition are affecting my mental health positively, or negatively. Or if I'm experiencing diminishing/increasing symptoms of depression and anxiety. He didn't even asked about this. He asked me about the effects of estradiol on my body (not asking about psychological effects) with details like he doesn't know... heaven only knows how much trans patients he's treating. Like he could easily Google it or has already heard them from other patients like me.

Vent is over, thank you if you ever read this long. I'm a sad girl tonight."	"Any way you can get a psych that's not fucked up in the head?

Or complain about the existing one? I'm concerned that they are being unprofessional and harming you.
Wildly, Offensively inappropriate.

Please report that to the hospitals HR department.

No way is that kind of questioning allowed.
Wtf is this even?  One. That guy is edging into sexual predator territory, bitnpsychiatric assessment?  I just get my pills and live life.
I‚Äôm sorry. Unfortunately, some of the ‚Äúscience‚Äù community has been pretty ignorant and full of quacks.

Kinda like the Bedford Level experiment, complete bullocks.
Sadly we cannot choose them, all docs are picking random patient documents all I can do is pray that he'll not be there. I really want to complain but I'm afraid I might not be taken seriously, my country is so backwards.
I‚Äôll try audio recording my next appointments, so if something like this happens I can easily have evidence to prove. Thank you.
I was thinking maybe younger generations of doctors would be more professional in terms of treating transgender patients. Sadly, I was wrong. It hurts and scares me that my existence itself is enough for even a healthcare provider to easily fetishize me, and I really don‚Äôt want to think about the rest of the people like potential dates etc. I bet he watches too much trans porn‚Ä¶
I'm sorry that's happening to you. That's really fucked up. Take good care of yourself. ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è Don't let them hurt you.
I always record my trans, and lately non trans related appointments, at least the first time I meet the doctor, there are too many assholes in the medical field and you never know if you might get a) hate crimed b) lucky, if you get lucky you could possibly sue and make some money lol

Will I regret not transitioning?	"I'm a 21 y.o. Male and have felt for many years now that I'd be happier as a woman. If I could snap my fingers and become a woman completely I would do it in an instant. Most if not all of my career options do not care all too much about trans people. I've talked to a therapist and he was down for starting me on hormones but I left. 

However, my family is sort of on its last limbs, extended and immediate. I think transitioning would blow it up. I have a straight partner I love who I'd have to break up with and not many friends otherwise. 

I think if I transitioned I would never actually be satisfied with my looks and I'd feel ugly. I'm tall and broad shouldered so I dont think I'd feel, idk, done? On top of that I dont have the money for it. 

Finally, I just dont care much? Like, I think I'd be happier like I said, but ultimately I really dont care much about my personal identity or looks. Its just not a thing I value like others do. Being a Male is honestly just easy and I while I dont like society is set up to help males more it's hard to ignore that. 

So can someone help me? Am I going to regret not transitioning? I've read the best time to start is as young as possible. I guess to sum up, theres just a lot of things stopping me from doing it and I dont know that I care enough to do it.

Edit: to clarify, I've bought makeup and clothes, I definitely feel trans and happier in them. "	"Yes, I regret not doing it earlier. Best time would have been at 21 from a family stand point but doing it pre puberty would have been amazing too and saved so much money. 

Also I had the same thoughts at 21 and really it seems like you can just ""force"" yourself to be happy or think it ""doesn't matter much"" but you will find that it does. 


I'm 40.  I was questioning at your age, but that was a very different time and information was harder to come by.  I didn't really have a clear idea of what was possible.  I figured I'd just try to make the best ""male"" life I could.  It seemed ""easier"".

But it wasn't easy, and now 20 years later, married and with a kid, I'm going through the process I wish I could have done 20 years ago.  Because those feelings never went away.  If I could send a message back to my 20-year-old self, it would be ""Do it now.  Just do it.""
I‚Äôm 21 and just starting HRT. The issue you have to decide here is how you decide your happiness. Personally I chose to transition no matter what because I believe that a person needs to value their personal needs for mental health above everything else. In terms of your family blowing up I‚Äôd say that you need to remember that outcome isn‚Äôt your fault, you didn‚Äôt chose this. In terms of your significant other, if they would break up with you over this then you have to realize you were in love with someone who couldn‚Äôt accept the authentic you. As for your friends, I personally wouldn‚Äôt want to be friend with someone who wouldn‚Äôt support someone going through a transition. As always remember that I don‚Äôt know your whole situation so I can‚Äôt give a for sure what to do answer, on you can do that. All I can say is do what‚Äôs best for yourself no matter how hard that is.

Believe me as someone who has anxiety and thought about similar issues before my transition, I‚Äôm glad I‚Äôve gone forward so far.
Don't be too sure about your partner. I also thought I was a straight female, until my partner came out as trans last month. I was surprised and had tons of questions, but I still loved my partner and realized that I don't care what they look like on the outside. I just love who I love, so I guess that makes me pansexual, and I'm now happy with the fact that I'm in a relationship with a female. You never know what your partner will say, until you tell them. If you explain that you will still be the same person, and that this is going to make you happier, they might take it well. It can shocking news at first, but I think you should go for it! Stuffing this realization may seem like the easier choice right now, but it will only make you miserable in the long-run.
Since you have doubts, it might be a good idea to talk to a therapist who specializes in gender issues.  Tbh, it sounds like you could be trans, but getting an objective opinion should help make things clearer to you.  
I‚Äôd say yes. I wish I‚Äôd had the courage to go through with it when I was 13/14 rather than when I was 19. 
Hi! Thanks for reaching out. I'm mtf, in my mid 20's, came out a year ago.

About caring about your personal identity or looks... I had a toxic metaphor that enabled my thinking on this.

""It's like video game avatars! Some people care about them, how they look and behave. Others don't. There's no wrong answer and I'm just one of those people that don't care about their avatar that much.""

While there may be no wrong answer, I was justifying my indifference and apathy because I thought I would always feel that way. Before I came out, I had basically never voluntarily shopped for clothes. I hated shopping and I hated clothes. But I didn't know how pronouns really made me feel until I tried them out, and I had no idea I could like clothes either. It took trying on fem clothes and dresses, and after a while I didn't want to go back to boy clothes.

I'm so happy I began my transition, I only wish I had started sooner.
This, so much so.
For cost, if you live near a Planned Parenthood, a lot of them now offer Hrt.

As for being tall and broad shouldered, my cis wife is very tall (6'2) and built like a brick shithouse. You would be joining the amazon club. There's tons of us who fell in love with the Xena type.

As for friends and family, you have to do what's right for you as you're the one who has to live this life, not them.
I would say that you are on the same place I was 12 years ago, and I thought the same thing. But these thoughts and feelings don't and won't go away. You can distract yourself, but as soon as you have fown time, there they are. If could tell 21 year old me, 16 year old me, and younger to go ahead with the plan, I had a whole plan figured out if my family rejected and cut ties with me, and just do. Everything feels right with me now, everything I used to hate about myself is gone. I am truly happy with my life, I feel complete. I just wish I could have felt like this sooner. If you don't do it now, you'll be just doing ten years from now. And my family supports me, can't say the same as when I was younger, but people grow and change. I hope you find the right answer for yourself, try going back to therapy and try talking things out. It's a scary thing, trust me I know, but I want what will be best for you. And wish you love and luck, we're here for you no matter what.
I started transitioning MtF January 20th this year. My mood is constantly higher, my emotions flow more freely, and I love myself and who I am becoming. Learn to love yourself, no matter what.

Meditate by looking within yourself for the answers to the questions you seek. If you know that you would be happier as a girl and can not (or will not) fully remove the desire to be a girl, that is the start of this journey. It is time to consider transitioning if you realize that your spirit is feminine and you wish for your body to become more feminine. If you let go of all reasons and desire for being masculine, you are fully ready to be transitioning.

For myself, changes have started, and it's a marathon; not a race. Although I'm changing faster than I expected, I still have a lot of work to do: hair removal, yoga for flexibility and general well being, daily exercise to tone my body, and reading teachings of enlightenment to better my spiritual understanding. It will be about a year/ 1.5 years until I make the jump from guy to girl. I'm OK with waiting, because I am making progress  every day to get there; I am learning constantly, so I'm not truly waiting and bored. I love myself today, because my body is an extension of my mind, and both are becoming better as I am constantly improving them. Faceapp showed me a good idea of how I will look when I make the change, and I love who I will become, too.

This is a serious decision that you can make to change your self. To improve your life, start meditation, exercise, yoga (stretching is Super important to attain a nice body), healthy eating, and be celibate unless you're with a partner (balanced hormone cycles are also key). You will feel 10,000&#37; better if you do these things every day. Tell your friends that this is who you are, and surround yourself with those who love you back. Forgive those who don't, and you can let them know that you need to take a break for them in order to live your authentic truth. Love yourself, and everyone else, because the world is you as much as you are the world. 
>Finally, I just dont care much? Like, I think I'd be happier like I said, but ultimately I really dont care much about my personal identity or looks. Its just not a thing I value like others do. Being a Male is honestly just easy and I while I dont like society is set up to help males more it's hard to ignore that. 

You've got some good advice from others here, but that section I really related to. 

I'm tall. I'm built like a linebacker. I'd been depressed before I started to question my gender. And I just did. not. give. a. fuck. About anything. About my appearance, about my work, my identity, nothing. I figured I was just doomed to a fate of endless apathy and numbness. There was no reason to try to improve myself because I knew that I'd never be happy anyway. 

Eventually, the pieces fell into place and I realized I was trans. Makeup and clothes and stuff made me feel great when I finally did it. I decided that I would try hormones. If I didn't like them after a couple months, well no harm done. I got on hormones and I flat out could not believe how much better I felt. I cared. I felt. I was genuinely just *happy*, I'd wake up and just be *happy*, for no particular reason...something that I legitimately don't think had ever happened in my entire life. I could cry, and it felt good. It felt so much easier to just be myself around people. 

So I'm still in boy mode and still don't know how I'm going to go about all the details of transition, but despite being ugly, obese, tall, and broad, I'm sure now that it's something I have to do. 

As far as it being a phase, it's been almost a year since I came out to my best friend, and I'm certain it's not a phase. I had a lot of similar doubts going into HRT, but they vanished pretty quick. 
How do I know this isn't just a phase or that I'll be happy when I've transitioned?
So much this.
I guess my concern is that my mental health will be worse off after transitioning. I'm imagining waking up unhappy with my trans body, no family support, no SO, wondering if it was worth it. Or even worse, realizing that I'm not actually trans.

You're right, and everything you're saying makes sense. It just feels like a huge risk for not much reward (for me, more reward for others).
Well unfortunately I've brought it up with her before and I could just tell it's something that's deal breaking. 

Which, I dont know. A couple people have said she would love me regardless of what I look like but I completely understand if we would break up. Besides simple things like having sex it's just a big bomb to drop on someone. It's a big change of who I am and it's a bit like asking someone to be gay for you when they thought they were straight their whole life.

But I appreciate the encouragement. I am planning on at least opening it up with her again soon. 
One of the big reasons I left the therapist was because I felt he didn't really challenge me on if I'm trans or not. But maybe it's because I had the wrong attitude going in, essentially expecting him to tell me I'm wrong about it? 

The [button test] (https://www.reddit.com/r/asktransgender/comments/895rvr/reversing_the_button_test_something_to_try_if/) which you already said you passed 
You don't. I know I pray every day that all these feelings just *poof* go away. Maybe they will, who knows? Best you can do for yourself is keep an open mind and see how other people who've started their journey from your position feel about it. For what it's worth, the vast majority of people who transition don't regret it. I think the actual de-transition rate is like <2% of transpeople, and most of those people de-transition due to stuff other than being unhappy with themselves (i.e. political climate, etc etc).

I know for me once I accepted I was trans I was terrified of these feelings going away, because I don't want them to. This, more than anything cements for me that I should at least give HRT a try on the down-low. Also the whole losing all my ability to cope and constant suicidal ideation helps me. 
I mean you are right, it is a huge risk. I still have the voice in the back of my head saying it‚Äôs a mistake, but I‚Äôve gone through all the steps and all signs point to it be right for me to transition. My decision took over a year of thinking and multiple times where I just repressed it. You have to decide what‚Äôs best for you and try and surround yourself with people who also want to do what‚Äôs best for you. If you really are trans though I‚Äôve talked to a decent amount of older people who waited and they said that waiting was something the regret, on the other hand there are stories of people who regret the transition. That‚Äôs why I think it‚Äôs best to talk it out with someone like a therapist who specializes in stuff like this. Ultimately you can‚Äôt let worry rule your life.
Sorry to hear that. Good luck!
Imo a good therapist will help you explore yourself and your feelings....and help you make better sense of yourself.  Yes, their opinion matters, but I don't think it's their job to challenge us like that.  Although some therapists seem to do that based on posts we've all seen here.  You could always ask your therapist to take a more ""challenging"" approach with you.....just my two cents worth.
therapists won't necessarily challenge you on it... Honestly with WPATH standards saying ""I am trans"" is more or less enough to get access to treatment. Yes, you can get gatekeeper therapists, especially outside of the USA (cough Italy cough), but I wouldn't necessarily expect a therapist to help you decide if you're trans... you are if you think you are, eh? More so I'd expect a good therapist to help you navigate the issues that occur because of your gender identity (accessing care, coping, etc)
Ugh. Fuck
Thanks for the reply. What does ""trying hrt on the down low"" entail?
A good counterpoint, which I think feels honestly more truthful : if there was a button to make you female everyday, would you push it everyday?

That's where I feel I'm at in my transition. I can be boymode or girlmode, even though mostly I feel my future is girlmode, I have doubts and, also, just hell yeah boymode is easier.. Societal wise and for me personally with my 40 years of practice

> Finally, I just dont care much? Like, I think I'd be happier like I said, but ultimately I really dont care much about my personal identity or looks. Its just not a thing I value like others do.

Felt the same way for a long long time. Until the effort of not caring weighted me down me than I can possibly articulate.

If you can exist comfortably in boymode forever than by all means. But you've already got girl clothes, makeup, a desire to transition,... For me I realized that if there is an end to that rabbit hole I haven't found it. After being held back for so long all I seem to be doing is rushing at it full speed. Not even on HRT and I don't know shit about makeup and I seriously want to be full time.. And it's been less than 6 months.. So that's ONE vision of what it might look like..

I suggest you read [The Null HypotheCis] (https://freethoughtblogs.com/nataliereed/2012/04/17/the-null-hypothecis/), is a really good one for questioning. Also, regarding your choice of forums: you came to a place filled with trans people, most of whom are questioning, transitioning, or wishing they could, or have transitioned successfully. It's the same place I came to. I could've gone to the hateful places. But instead I came here to this loving place. And most people encouraged me to love myself and listen I myself. If you're like me, that's why it's really so hard.. You're struggling to love/accept yourself. And anytime that gets tricky the brain changes the rules and says ""well sure you think you want that but if we do then: ~~terrible ~~ things ~~ will ~~ happen"" thus competed distracting you from the prior thought of trying to listen to yourself. Your brain thinks it's helping: scare you away from the scary thought.. But it doesn't really know what to do with the fact that your thoughts keep returning to the same place. So it just tries scaring you again, harder, telling you anything it things might stick.. Just so long as you don't open the scary door. Your brain is not totally sure what's behind the scary door, but it's pretty sure it's scary, so it makes the thought of opening it terrifying. And sure you might've wedged it open briefly and had the odd peak and seen girl stuff in there but NO MORE says brain. That door stays closed. But it's just for own brain. You can turn that door transparent if you wanted. 
This is not *always* true. I used to pass the button test, but I don't anymore.

As a young child I strongly insisted that I was a boy (whereas everyone else was of the opinion that I was a girl). I then had rather mild gender dysphoria up until perhaps my twenties. It was actually more gender euphoria than gender dysphoria: I would imagine myself as male and dress up as male, and it made me feel a deep sense of satisfaction/euphoria. Even though it was mild, I would have passed the button test in my teenage years.

I looked into the physical process of transitioning and it was too much for me. The next thing I'm going to say is potentially quite upsetting / offensive to trans people, so I apologise in advance: this is genuinely how I felt, but I'm just talking about *me* - not about you. I eventually felt that I was faced with a choice between being a ""complete"" woman or an ""incomplete"" man, with a body I could never be 100% at peace with. That way of thinking about it was a turning point for me, and I was able to feel at peace in a way I hadn't before. Now, in my early thirties, I have no gender dysphoria at all.

Trans people are talking to you from their experience, which might not be the same as your experience. It might be that you are more like me. You're the only one who can figure this out, so don't be too swayed by what you read on the internet.
like I'm planning to be on HRT for a year+ before I socially transition or tell anyone, at the moment. no one has to know but you, your SO, and your doctor. you can start HRT and decide if it's for you or not without having to uproot your whole life, if you don't want to. 
This was really helpful. Thank you
The Null HypotheCis was a really good read. I'm going to have to save that, thanks!
Sorry for replying so late, but this comment is the most helpful here. I might end up trying hormones or not, but I think I relate to this the most. Gender euphoria is a great way to put it. 

I'm really busy at the moment so I cant reply in full, but thank you. 
Glad to help and I hope you figure it out. Maybe you could talk to some detransitionsers within your country / healthcare system as well, just so you know what life would look like for you if you started transition then changed your mind."	8s9oaa	trans	27	0.97	2018-06-19 15:18:59
My dads reaction	"I was always scared to come out to my dad. He is conservative (conservative in german standards, so still not republican), christian and never really experienced love in his childhood.

So one day i was like ""fck it"" and wrote a letter that i wanted to leave at my parents home. I wrote about my feelings, my need to transition and that it would kill me if i don't. 

I left the letter at my parents home and left to my flat. I was prepared that i might not see my family for a long time, because i didn't know how my mum and dad would react.

My parents would find the letter and read it together. And the first thing my dad ~~wanted~~ had to do was to write me a message that he loves me no matter what and unconditionally. He needs time to process all of this and luckily he has some people in his life that are far more experienced in this topic than he is (his older brother was an actor in the 90s and his younger brother is a primary school teacher), so he can talk about it. But most wholesome thing was when he said that they did not care about my gender before i was born and that a parents love to their child always must be unconditionally and that all parents need to be there for their children at all time.

I thought i'd like to share a more wholesome story since there is so much transphobia out there lately!

(I hope my storytelling isn't bad, i'm non-native and i am bad at storytelling even in my native language haha)"	"You conveyed the story beautifully.  So happy that your father feels the way he does and is supportive.  How did your mother react?  Hopefully, she's onboard with the same feelings!  Good luck in your journey!
This made me want to tear up. Seriously. I wish my father was this great. And your English is better than 60% of US citizens. I am so happy for you.
I wasn't really worried about my mum, she is not very educated about lgbtq+ people, but she was always pretty chilled about it! Like in 8th grade she defended me in front of my dad when i shaved my legs"	rhlh7q	trans	28	0.93	2021-12-16 07:25:15
I have no more future	"Apparently I won't get enough money to go to the school I want to go in. I worked years for that, without any rest. Except that time I tried to kill myself.

And at this moment, nobody in my family egen cared. My parents went to the hospital, sure. And apparently they think it was an accident. I fucking told them that day I want to die.

And my transition ! I live in France and apparently needs to go to Paris according to my therapist. It's too godamn expensive.

I just can't live like these. I don't even have anything that looks like a small little step into my transition, which I want for 10 years now.

Edit: I want to thank you all. You're all wonderful and right now, I'm feeling a lot better. I read your answer and they gave me a good part of that hope. So thanks for that. I can't answer individually, so I do that here."	"

I'm not sure what you want to hear (or rather what would be best to say), but this world would miss you in it, maybe not the people, but the world itself, I'm not religious, but I do believe that the universe, it puts everyone here for a purpose, to have an impact, big or small to it, that doesn't matter, you make an impact in this world daily, and I think it's something that should stay.
I've been suicidal before, and in many situations where I thought I had no future. The first time a doctor told me that they can't help me and I'll always be in pain was when I was 14 years old.

I dropped out of school three times due to sickness. I thought I'd just have to get by leeching off my family, because I'd never be healthy. 

I'm starting nursing school in August and making leaps in my recovery.

Our situations are different. But a lot of people who have been suicidal will tell you that there is hope. There is a future, and its worth fighting for tooth and nail.

I don't know much about the problems you're facing, since this is a vent post instead of your whole life story, but there are always options or alternatives. Sometimes you just need a new set of eyes to see them."	s8gckq	trans	28	0.98	2022-01-20 10:52:01
On Monday, I will come out to everyone I know. All in 24 hours.	"I‚Äôm gonna do it. I‚Äôm ripping off the band-aid. I‚Äôm early transition and I‚Äôm sick of being afraid. I‚Äôm sick of worrying. I‚Äôm sick of not feeling strong enough. I‚Äôm sick of doubting. I‚Äôm going to come out to everyone next Monday. Everyone. I. Know. I don‚Äôt care what they say. I‚Äôm not doing it for them. I‚Äôm doing it for me, to live freely and start my life before uni. I have never felt this self assured in my life. A year ago I was suicidal. I thought I was weird. I didn‚Äôt tell anyone. I realise now how far I‚Äôve come. I‚Äôm about to take the biggest step. Wish me luck, all of you. I feel like I‚Äôm metaphorically armed for the final battle. And yet I know it‚Äôs just the start of many to come. But I‚Äôm ready now, and that‚Äôs what‚Äôs important.

PS: shoutout to my sister for helping me reach this decision day. I came to the decision myself, but she has always been there for me to help build up my confidence. I have reached the turning point. I‚Äôm ready for anything.

Do you feel like you don‚Äôt align with the typical trans experience? My thoughts after 2 years of HRT and looking within myself.	"I‚Äôve been on HRT since November 2020, and am coming up on my two year anniversary soon. In this time I‚Äôve discovered a lot of things in my journey that go outside the lines of the typical trans persons experience, and wanted to share these thoughts. I know I‚Äôm not alone in this, and I thought it‚Äôd be nice if other people could share their own unique discoveries.

-I don‚Äôt care about my pronouns at all. If someone sees me as a guy I go with it. If someone sees me as a woman I go with it. If someone uses they/them pronouns I go with it. I don‚Äôt identify as non-binary. I identify as a trans woman. I gave NB a lot of thought and it doesn‚Äôt fit me. 

-I don‚Äôt care about passing. I‚Äôm not even sure if I want to. I like being a boyfriend who looks like a girlfriend that you had in February of last year. My body passes as feminine, which is all I really care about (minus the manual transmission package I came with) 

-I don‚Äôt give a single shit about bathrooms. I don‚Äôt want to use the women‚Äôs restroom, and I have the benefit of being 6‚Äô2‚Äù, so even if the mens bathroom was unsafe for me because of my appearance, no it isn‚Äôt. I avoid conservative areas and establishments, and public restrooms as it is, so a huge non issue.

-For me, transitioning had nothing to do with being treated as a woman in the world. My only goal was to be able to see myself. Looking in the mirror and agreeing with it, ‚ÄúAh yup, that‚Äôs me. Makes sense now.‚Äù I didn‚Äôt see that before HRT, and I almost see it completely now.  

-Don‚Äôt care about my voice. Sometimes I talk with a deep voice. Sometimes I get read as a woman on the phone or off of voice only. It‚Äôs been like that my whole life, always had different voices for different people and situations.

-I typically wear mens clothing and am unbothered if it fits well. I‚Äôm not opposed to womens clothing either when it fits well (rare when tall). I don‚Äôt wear much makeup often and only sometimes enjoy it. sheer foundation and some eyebrows and light mascara is the extent of it for me. 

This is only some of it, but the biggest shock to me is that despite how ‚Äúnon-chalantly‚Äù I view my transition and public perception, I know that HRT changed my life. That I‚Äôd be miserable if I didn‚Äôt live as myself. In the last year with my partner, I‚Äôve felt I kind of play the role of masc lesbian/tomboy with long hair. Not surprisingly, I don‚Äôt really identify as a lesbian either, or view my relationship with a cis woman as a queer relationship. Maybe I‚Äôm just tired of labels and boxes and expectations and reactionary politics, and I want to be myself without restrictions or fear of judgement. 
Or maybe I‚Äôm enlightened and existing on a higher plane of conscious, looking down on you mere mortals, as I‚Äôve ascended my corporeal form. (jk) 

¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø"	"FTM here and literally same. I‚Äôm in the earlier stages of my transition (low dose for the last 6 months) and I don‚Äôt care about pronouns or anything like that. We probably fit into non-binary more accurately but I want a beard and feel better presenting fully masculine so I‚Äôm gonna go with he/him bc it‚Äôs the easiest. I‚Äôm glad I‚Äôm not the only one that feels this way!
Not looking to far down, 6'1 here and dig alot of what you've said.

This‚Ä¶ is going to be long üòû	"I feel like I‚Äôve been posting a lot and I‚Äôm sorry I‚Äôm just going through‚Ä¶ a lot. But imma give y‚Äôall the full rundown cause I‚Äôm so conflicted rn and I honestly just need support. And I‚Äôm sorry if this is rambly/all over the place. I‚Äôm high af rn üòÖü•¥

My parents are hurting me so so bad. And allow me to elaborate-I feel so gross and wrong. Ever since I came out, they‚Äôve been using feminine terms literally every chance they get. They deadname me constantly and only use my actual name as a sneer. I‚Äôm example, one of my friends sent me a package a few months ago and it had ‚ÄúLiam‚Äù on it, cause that‚Äôs my name, and I got home and when I got home and asked if a package came for me my dad said ‚Äúa package came for a *Liam* but no I didn‚Äôt see one for you‚Äù. A few weeks ago they cornered me in the living room and literally didn‚Äôt let me leave until they had told me that 1. God made me a woman 2. I have certain chromosomes and that makes my statement false and 3. Being trans isn‚Äôt even real. And they were actively weeping the whole time A little context: my mom is a doctor and my dad is a preacher‚Ä¶ not the best combo for a trans kid üòÖü•¥ and then they said that as long as I lived there, we would be having those conversations everyday. Fast forward a few weeks, I had told my sister I want to actually physically transition, and a few days later I had a really bad seizure and stopped breathing for a few minutes, and my sister called my mom cause she was scared and told my mom that I wanted to transition cause she didn‚Äôt know if I had started yet or if that would even have made a difference. So my sisters husband gave me CPR, and that was that, but when I got home, my parents sat me down, once again, but this time they were just angry. They said I had two weeks to get out of the house, because they weren‚Äôt going to ‚Äúsupport the destruction of Madeline‚Äù (that‚Äôs my dead name ü•¥). I got let go from my job like a month ago cause I had a seizure and my job was driving ambulances so obviously I couldn‚Äôt keep doing it, so I don‚Äôt have a job, I‚Äôm broke. And they‚Äôre just‚Ä¶ tossing me out like the fucking trash. (My CashApp is on my profile if anyone wants to/is able to contribute; but no obligation at all üòÇüò≠ü•∫) And then they changed the Wi-Fi password so it would be harder for me to be in contact with the people that support me being trans, cause the service at my house is indeed shitty as all get out. Fast forward a little bit to two days ago, my mom printed out a SEVENTEEN PAGE ARTICLE on how this one person transitioned and then regretted it so they detransitioned, it was literally written by this person, and the entire fucking thing was just ‚ÄúI can‚Äôt believe doctors let me do that to myself‚Äù ‚Äúthe people who supported me doing that just supported the destruction of my life‚Äù and all that type of stuff, and at one point they even say ‚Äúthe people you see in these clinics are just boys and girls playing dress up‚Äù. I- ü§¶üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è I cannot articulate how furious that made me. 1. This person is completely invalidating the ‚ú®entire‚ú® trans community 2. Okay. Cool. You‚Äôre not trans, go you, but I am‚Ä¶ like just cause this one mf backtracked a lil bit, doesn‚Äôt mean trans people just don‚Äôt exist and it‚Äôs all just a performance. So she gave me this article, and told me that we were going to have a conversation about it to make sure I actually read it. I was gone all day yesterday and most of today, cause I‚Äôm desperately trying to find somewhere to ya know, live. And as soon as I got back today my mom goes ‚Äúhow‚Äôd the hunt go?‚Äù And then looked at me and said ‚Äúyou know I bet ‚Äòone of your little people that support you so much and tell you want to do‚Äô may help you‚Äù. And not in a helpful kind way. It was sarcastic and demeaning. Anyways. She brought up the article and I told her the issues I had with it and why and I kept it level headed and for the most part she did as well besides the crying, but the things she said dude. She kept talking about how she loves *Madeline* and how she‚Äôs gonna miss *Madeline* and she was like ‚Äúyou‚Äôre just like the girl that wrote that article!! You just hate yourself so much and you think this is going to fix everything‚Äù and then proceeded to list off medical stuff and then said ‚ÄúYou are never going to be a boy. You‚Äôre always just going to be a girl pretending to be one‚Äù and that‚Äôs when I was KO on that convo, mind you, all of these convos I‚Äôve mentioned all last ‚ú®hours‚ú®. But the thing is. I know they love me. And I know they care about me and want what‚Äôs best for me and they think they‚Äôre doing things that are conducive to that. But there this massive fight going on in my head where I‚Äôm mad at them for not even trying, when even my sister did and I did NOT expect that (she doesn‚Äôt use Liam but she uses nicknames to just avoid it cause she doesn‚Äôt want to actively hurt me). And I am massively hurt by the things they are doing and saying, and it‚Äôs putting me in a really bad headspace. But at the same time I still love them and care about them so much because they‚Äôre my family, and there are lots of good things about them as well. And I want to keep a relationship with them, but I can‚Äôt if this is all they‚Äôll ever do. They keep saying to me that my depression is getting worse since I came out because it‚Äôs ‚Äúdestructive‚Äù. Mf my depression is worse since I came out cause me being me is hurting people I love and I can‚Äôt do shit about it. I literally have to choose between me and them, and I am not good at all at picking myself like, ever. But I‚Äôm really trying to with this and it‚Äôs just so hard and it kills me to see them hurting because of me. I take care of people, it‚Äôs what I do, I wanna make people happy, and laugh, and smile. My goal every day is to be the best person I can be for myself and the people around me. My tiktok platform is based off of wanting to be there for people. All I ever try and be, is good. But it‚Äôs not good enough to make my parents happy, much less proud of me. I‚Äôm 23 years old (I lived in Utah, away from here and them from when I was 16-22 (16-18 was conversion therapy programs üëèüèª) I just came home last year cause I was going through a really bad break up and my mental health was really really bad) but I‚Äôm 23, I strive to be kind and help people, and I just feel like I‚Äôm a decent enough human to just‚Ä¶ try. Much less their own kid bruh. Literally I just want them to be proud of and love their son. But that‚Äôs never going to happen üòû idk what to do anymore. I‚Äôm exhausted and I‚Äôm at this crossroad where I really have to pick me or them, and I can‚Äôt do that. It‚Äôs been on my mind more and more to just remove me from the equation all together. Cause it‚Äôs genuinely breaking me to be hurting people I love just by being me. This was really long and I‚Äôm really sorry I just feel massively alone right now and idk. Y‚Äôall got any advice? üòÇü•¥ anyways. You‚Äôre amazing and loved and beautiful and valid! I love you all you mf kings and queens üíõ and if you read this whole thing, thank you so so much, I genuinely appreciate it. I hope everyone is doing well ü•∫üíõ"	"Wow I am so sorry. I don‚Äôt have much advice but I truly hope it gets better for you! 
Never stop being yourself üíô
Oh god that's so fucked up. Marry rich, get outta there. Jk but for real I'm so sorry. That whole thing sounds so traumatic, I hope you're able to get out of there really soon. Make a GoFundMe if you're willing, I'd be happy to help advertise it on some Instagram pages
Oh my gods. Your parents are absolutely horrible people. I hope your mother loses her medical license because she is clearly not fit to practice, not treating you the way she is. I hope you find somewhere safe to stay. You are valid and your parents are idiots. I do not understand a doctor can be so incredibly transphobic. Best wishes. I too unfortunately can't give much advice other than get your parents arrested and cause them to lose custody of any siblings you have because they are not fit to parent whatsoever. There's other things they ain't fit to do but i'm not gonna tempt the reddit gods. Again, best wishes.
Liam fits you‚ù§Ô∏è
I don't have any advice, but god, your parents sound awful, no offense
I'm sorry, I can get to understand your feelings and situation with your parents. I had something of a similar situation, life gave me a little gift when they divorced, but yet, the trash talk never ends.

I know how the fear of loss is, but, is something that is natural, I would rather lose everyone than myself, I know there's more people out there, those who will support me and give me happiness, like this lil community, maybe we won't make a long time relationship, but just knowing that there's more for me out there that give me more from what I have in here is enough. 

If I could give you an advice, don't give a f about them, is not your job to make anyone happy, your happiness is first, and forever should. Because when you live for other people you let yourself aside, and as you may experienced, it isn't worth living. 

They may never understand you or try to accept you, but, is better if you live your life boy, because is yours, and yeah they are gonna hurt, but didn't they hurt you before?

Stay strong handsome üíô the pain is just for a moment, it will go away, I promise üíôüíô
Liam, ily (sincerely, like i love you) and as a fellow ""yOu'Re gOnnA rEGrEt iT"" child, i wish you good luck, euphoria, and to find a chosen family that can support you. i have no advice (except crowdfunding maybe) but i really really hope you're gonna be okay soon
Liam, I'm sorry that you're going through such a rough time. I wish I had an answer for you, let alone *the* answer. I hope you can find a way to get to a better situation, to being able to look after and look out for yourself.

They might be a doofus (narrator: ""Oh boy, AJ is definitely a doofus""), but you've got a long-distance, adoptive big sibling who wants you to be safe and wants you to be you!
Hey you‚Äôre not hurting anyone by being yourself. I can‚Äôt speak for your parents (they sound awful) but my mom used to put on an act to keep me under her thumb, it‚Äôs not real. As a 30yr old adult I can see it a lot clearer now.

It‚Äôs not love if they‚Äôre trying to control you. Love is letting your child grow into the person that makes them happy. I feel what you‚Äôre saying, it‚Äôs a hard truth to face, but you really don‚Äôt have to live another year pretending that their abuse is loving.

34 twoc ‚Äî dating feels weird af	"I started my transition a bit later in my life at 27 years old. My longtime gf at the time was unsupportive and the breakup, along with the lack of support from my friends & family, completely shattered my sense of confidence. 

Over the past 7 years I‚Äôve been rebuilding my life. I‚Äôve met a small, but caring, group of friends. I have a standing weekly counseling session to help me work through things. I am also fortunate enough to have a reliable job & secure housing. 

The issue is that I still don‚Äôt ‚Äúmake sense‚Äù to myself. I have always been romantically attracted to feminine energy, and physically attracted to masculine energy. I don‚Äôt think this to be ‚Äúweird,‚Äù that‚Äôs not my intention in calling it an ‚Äòissue‚Äô‚Ä¶ the trouble is that I personally feel unable to approach courtship because of the discrepancy. 

I have limited experience with dating, I‚Äôve only had two serious relationships in my life‚Ä¶ and even more limited experience with physical intimacy. So much of the world seems to be aligned around sex‚Ä¶ that I feel a great pressure to have myself ‚Äúfigured out‚Äù in that regard by this age. I don‚Äôt. 

When I think about talking to women, all I can envision is the pressure of expectations. In the event that this person is comfortable dating within the trans community (which in my own personal lived experience already feels like a narrow field), there comes the matter of intimacy‚Ä¶ and I am just not really physically drawn to feminine energy, so I feel like I‚Äôm setup for failure before we‚Äôve even begun. This has made the entire dating process feel awkward for me, and I‚Äôm not sure what I can even do about it. 

I‚Äôm signed up on apps, and I get quite a bit of attention ‚Äî but most people on apps don‚Äôt read profiles & end up un-matching after they do. I‚Äôm open to trying to meet people in person‚Ä¶ but to be honest, I cannot differentiate between if a fem person is flirting with me or if they‚Äôre giving ‚Äúsister vibes.‚Äù In turn, I generally interpret everyone as just being nice & probably up end up coming across as disinterested if they are actually flirting.

This is not a ‚Äòpoor me‚Äô post or anything. I know that plenty of people within our community find love. Heck, some of my NB friends have met, married, and divorced several times in the time that I‚Äôve been single. I‚Äôm just at a loss for what I can do for myself. I get compliments on my looks & personality from people that I trust, so I don‚Äôt think that I‚Äôm entirely hopeless‚Ä¶ but I do feel like I‚Äôm running out of time. Most people are seriously partnered at my age, and meeting people is only getting more difficult. Any constructive thoughts or ideas would be greatly valued."	"Any romantic and/or sexual relationships entail emotional risks. It's okay to date casually to explore, to enjoy meeting new people and getting to know them and being okay to decide the chemistry isn't right.

Participating in activities with people who share your interests, such as classes or volunteering, is a great way to meet new friends who might become more than friends. Based on what you have said, I would suggest not being a wallflower, waiting for people to approach you. At the least, you may need to take the initiative to show that you are approachable, interested in meeting others.

I hope I have said something you find helpful and wish you well as you try to find connections with others.
Your absolutely gorgeous üíóüíóüíóüíóüíó
I began during age 27 too. Congratulations on not giving up. I wanted to give up *MANY* times. Stay strong sis. 

Dating  often does have weird moments. Protect yourself always.
I‚Äôm a straight male and I think you are absolutely beautiful and reading your post I think you will be just fine, trust yourself and give yourself a chance.
Girl I feel the same way! Possibly a trans girl may offer the best of both worlds in a sense as we often have a good balance of both energies more than cis people. Dating is always hard and even harder for trans, stay positive"	yel4bd	trans	27	0.95	2022-10-27 07:05:53
Scolded & Belittled for wearing Mascara.	"Wanted to get this off my chest, as it really upset me, and I feel like I‚Äôm not the only trans person who has experienced something like this with family, but yesterday I put on mascara when my parents were out of the house for the day, also I was wearing my skirt and actually felt quite good about myself & how I looked, but that all went crashing down when my parents got home and voiced their unsolicited opinions.

Almost Immediately I got a poor reaction, just wearing the makeup alone in-front of them, didn‚Äôt have my skirt on then. My mom said ‚Äúoh god‚Ä¶ really?? Hey (Dads name) ,look at Kyle right now.‚Äù Then started their tirade..

‚Äútake that s*** off NOW or get out of my house tonight, you weirdo!!‚Äù ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs f***** up, I don‚Äôt want to see that in front of me ever again!‚Äù ‚Äú Do you SERIOUSLY just prance around the house in your girl clothes & makeup when we‚Äôre not around to see, huh?, What is wrong with you!?‚Äù ‚ÄúYou hurt us so much by doing stuff like this, it effects us so much and you don‚Äôt even care‚Äù ‚ÄúGo do your transition thing somewhere else where we wont see it happening‚Äù 

Idk who in their right mind would ever say that to their own kid. Absolutely zero empathy to say such awful things! Thank god I‚Äôm 22 and financially well enough to move out very soon. I‚Äôm cutting them off permanently as I can‚Äôt take this abuse and I refuse to anymore. Both of them should‚Äôve never had kids. 

Anyways hope you all have a good Sunday! üòäThanks for listening if you read this much into my post."	"thats awful :( is amazing that you have the courage to walk away ‚ù§ it pains me to know some people are in this situation and arnt as financially  stable or are younger and cant move out and have to endure this horrible abuse. they are a disgrace to the parents name.
My heart was breaking till the last bit, run! Im so glad youre on your way out of there! You deserve to be treated with compassion ‚ù§Ô∏è
Ouch. What a shitty situation. Stay strong.
I'm sure you looked very pretty with your makeup on, and I am also sure that a lot of people will love you when you are presenting as the real you every single day of your life. We can't choose blood relatives, unfortunately. I'm lucky in that my only bigoted relative is my asshole grandpa and my parents are awesome.

But there are many, many people who will grow to be your family. And you'll know when you meet them, because they'll love you as you are.

Keep your head up, and stay strong until you move out. I'm glad you know you deserve better.
Do you want a hug, sister?
Thank you! ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏èHonestly, I really just don‚Äôt feel anything for them anymore, just a strong resentment more or less. You make your bed you lie in it, because if you treat a human being like this, you do not have the right to watch them grow as a person or be involved in their life anymore. Blood does not equal family.
I really appreciate your comment ‚ù§Ô∏èüòä I‚Äôm currently trying to find roommates but that shouldn‚Äôt take to to long. I mean really, it‚Äôs better to feel alone with just yourself then alone around the company of others. It‚Äôs bullshit that people are willing to drop a friend or family member so quickly simply for finally choosing to be themselves. Ignorant people eventually do show their true Colours one way or another tho I think.
Thanks ‚ò∫Ô∏è!! I‚Äôm trying to. The last couple months have been tough.
""blood does not equal family"" possibly one of the best quotes to tell a trans person, i hope you prosper in life without them
Yeah being by yourself is 1000√ó better than being surrounded by assholes. And youre absolutely right, what theyre doing to you is not love, its abuse. So many people create an ideal version of someone in their heads and mistreat people when they dont live up to expectations."	116hepb	trans	27	1.0	2023-02-19 16:41:35
A couple fair warnings for those about to rock.	"Even though I frequent the Reddit trans forums and consider myself well read in transness, I felt like I should speak to those who are about to start hormones (speaking to MtF) about somethings I could not have foreseen. Please keep in mind I'm only speaking from a short term limited basis but I speak none the less.

Are you a ""tough"" person? Ask yourself before you start hormones ""how do I deal with my feelings?"" Hormones are gonna change you sister. Tough doesn't stand a chance against estrogen. However as you break down and pick yourself back up will be stronger, emotionally. 

Is your partner straight? Your partner may love and cherish you, hold you close and promise you they'll always be there but they may not be able to change the orientation they were born with any more then you are able to change how you were born. If they leave, get ready to greave like you have never grieved before. Tears will flow.

Are you ready to change? There are in fact some aspects of your personality that are gonna change as you transition more and more. Weather it be a reaction to your change in environmental response from coming out or your physiological presence slowly reforming, you will act some what different.

Your probably gonna ask your self over and over if your trans, wondering if this is right for you. I think it's normal and for the record I don't think a lot of CiS gendered people ask if they're CiS. I think most Transgender (that I've met) people have questioned hard if they're trans or not. 

It's up to you to educate your health care professionals. Come prepared with quantifiable data you can vet by peer reviewed sources. If they don't feel comfortable giving you care, challenge them. You deserve treatment.

There's probably more but I'm tired and emotionally exhausted. Please keep in mind I probably face less challenges then a lot of other girls. I live in western Canada. I just wanted to get this out in front of people who are starting HRT. It's a ride. Hold on.

"	"Just for the record, cis isn't an acronym, so you don't have to write it CiS. It's short for cisgender, and cis- is just a prefix from Latin meaning ""on the side of"" (as opposed to trans, which means ""on the other side of"" or ""across from"").
I have extreme emotional instability (because of borderline personality disorder). I'm still glad I'm rocking. I dunno if HRT has made that stuff better or worse. I'm kind of a mess. But I've always been kind of a mess. Just thought I'd throw that out there. At the end of the day, though, I am feeling a bit better. And the whole gender-affirmation thing has been generally good for me (BPD peeps don't really deal with invalidation very well.)
For those about to rock, we salute you?
This is all excellent advice. Very true.
Thanks for the ideas (not sarcastically at all) - I just started. I'm kinda hoping for some changes in how how I am, because it's too easy to be nonchalant and apathetic about life, just hiding how I feel about so much. Negativity (as well as the positive) from my real life I hope will make me stronger in a better way. And I know many of my family and friends will not react well when I tell them, so it's better to be prepared. Probably will take them years to figure it out. 

Sorry if you had problems in a relationship, I guess not everyone is non-binary üòï. I can only wonder at what I'm going to live through through the next few years. 

Thanks.
You speak the truth about BPD.
If you don't have practice in being alone, this will be tough. I'm not saying you'll be abandoned, I'm saying that being okay being alone is a pillar of strength in every and all humans. The ability to be alone and love yourself will carry you through most things. That which you give yourself no one can take away. This process takes along time and the older you are the longer it takes. Hormones help develop your out ward appearance but they don't ""make"" you a woman. You are trans and you will win. Say it out loud.

-Hope 
I have found very few people are outright objectionable. The subtle othering bothers me quite a bit however. People treat you different, like polite, but at a distance. I'm slowly getting more stealthy, but it's hard to do that without cutting everyone off really.
Thanks. It's not always the easiest thing to deal with. Do you have it too?
I am bi-polar.
I was (mis)diagnosed as bi-polar for about 14 years. I finally got diagnosed with BPD in October of 2014. That was probably the best thing that ever happened to me. It allowed me to actually get proper treatment, see improvement, and finally confront my gender dysphoria and transition.
That's tremendously awesome!! 
Yes, it is. It's still really hard. BPD remains a daily struggle. I'm ""better"" but I'm not ""better"". Like...when I get upset I don't do really dangerous stuff anymore (I used to do the whole sex & drugs with strangers things when my emotions went wild).  But, I still get really upset and I now use a ton of mental energy just managing my emotions, and not giving into the self destructive urges I have.

In many respects, my thinking patterns have changed very little in the last 2 years. My emotions are just as chaotic as ever. I'm just a lot better at dealing with it.  I think in time I will be able to change some of my ingrained thinking patterns. And I'm really grateful about how far I've come. I'm happy that when I get upset I take a hot shower and practice mindfulness. And, (and I think this is valid) I really wish I didn't get so upset in the first place."	58eshw	trans	25	0.85	2016-10-20 03:35:35
Public toilets again	"I feel like public toilets are the worst thing about transitioning. I can't go to the toilet at a restaurant or at the pub without first making an estimate of how accepting people in the place are gonna be, checking how busy the toilets are and of course freaking out for half an hour until I almost pee my pants.

A couple days ago I (ftm, don't pass well) went to the pub with friends and eventually, after a couple of beverages, I couldn't ignore the urge anymore and excused myself. I went downstairs and immediately ran into a staff member. There was another guy behind me. I looked a little lost because there were a lot of corridors so the staff guy said ""the lady has to go right"". Then the man behind me laughed and said ""Pff, are you sure?"" Now I was completely confused. I didn't know where left and right was, didn't know what the words ""ladies"" or ""gentlemen"" even meant anymore. I just wanted to find a toilet. And the guys laughed at my confusion and eventually almost pushed me into the ladies' room. 
I must admit that's where I had planned to go anyway - because I know I don't pass and I'm afraid of trouble. But obviously that's not what I want for me. What I want for me is to not need to think about it and to just go pee without people questioning me or my place.
Of course when I was done and was washing my hands a woman walked in and was very confused by me. She stopped walking and only after looking me over twice did she go into one of the stalls.

I was immediately reminded of a conversation I had had with my friends that very day, where I said ""did any of you grow up in the country? Don't you just miss being able to pee anywhere in nature because nobody cares?""

When these things happen I just wanna bury myself in the sand."	"I am an amab trans women. The male washroom norms tend to be opposite as women‚Äôs, in the way that men do not make conversation and usually are in and out as quick as possible and rarely make any eye contact. Chances are nobody is paying that much attention when you are in there. For me I try to be as confident as possible with with my head held high and like I belong in the women‚Äôs washroom because I do. Hopefully this gives you a little more confidence.
I feel you very much. I'm passing ok-ish though, so it's just me having to go through with it, but it would be so nice to just have neutral bathrooms (I just don't belong to either). fuck heteronormativity üôÉ
I feel you, I (mostly) pass these days but it gets easier and I still sometimes get those weird looks and double takes, and the occasional very authoritative security guard trying to stop me going into the ladies room...

I wish we could just throw it all away and have unisex restrooms everywhere! It's so needlessly stressful X\_X
dont pass too much to go in own gendered toilets, dont fit the norms of our agab to go into the other toilets, ye it sucks hard
This is why I hate going out to malls and public places. It sucks having to make such a big decision for something as simple as going to the stupid restroom. 
And the worst is cis people dismissing this concern because they never have to think about it, one time my mom forced me to go to the male restroom (knowing perfectly well that I'm trans) and just said that is not a big deal and just get over it... I can't get over it! But that's something they can't understand
Hey there! I happened to stumble upon this and I just wanted to tell you I'm with a free app called Lulu that could help you. We list all public toilets in NY, filterable for gender-neutral all the way down to bright lighting. We also partner with private businesses that would let you use their restroom no questions asked for as little as $0.99.   


We will be expanding to many more states in the coming months.   


We are also members of the LGBTQ Network Organization, and are going to be adding more lgbtq filters. If you have any specific filter suggestions, please throw them my way!   


You can learn more at [www.luluapp.com](https://www.luluapp.com)
Transfemme here. I'm an outlier. Though I am only 5'5"", I was in the army and I'm pretty good in hand to hand combat.  I also have a compact pistol and a conceal and carry license.  I go into the men's restroom so I can piss standing up. Anyone wants to fuck with me, well, they will find out.
I keep hearing that but my fear gets in the way. I guess me wearing skinny jeans and female-type glasses and having a very female face frame don't particularly help.
Once I just went into the men's room because there was a queue to the ladie's room and I was like 'fuck it'. But to get to the stall I had to pass a man standing at a urinal. I could see him get incredibly startles by my presence, even making movements to tuck back into his pants even though I wasn't even looking. Then we had some sort of shy-bladder-contest. Really weird.
Hi there!
Sounds like a great app you have there. Unfortunately I don't live in the US, so this app will not be useful to me. I use a similar app with a few less functions than you mentioned that is available in my country but when I meet someone from the US I'll make sure to point them towards your website.
Have a great day!
Where do you happen to be? Would love to know if we are heading your way any time soon as we are expanding internationally.   


Best of luck!

"Is saying ""I don't care about the parts, it's the personality that matters"" always well intentioned?"	"I've heard this from a few guys on first dates or on first interactions. 

I think it's thoughtful of them to say, but most of the times I've heard it the phrase came unprompted. 

Discussing sexuality can be important to some and this is how many pansexual or demisexual people describe themselves. 

For some reason, I just dont like when specially cis people tell me this for some reason. Maybe it's because I want them to care about my trans identity? 

When it comes unprompted or forced into conversation, I start to wonder if they feel like dating me gives them a sense of moral superiority. Like they're a hero for being willing to date a trans person, and see past genitalia.

Last guy I dated before I transitioned was like this. Maybe I'm stuck comparing them to him. 

I'm new to dating as a transgender man, and I was wondering if anyone could relate to this? 

I am in the wrong for feeling kinda patronized when people tell me this?"	"My opinion: It sounds like they aren‚Äôt communicating clearly. There isn‚Äôt anything wrong with asking someone to clarify something they said. IE: Ask them why they said that. 

If they can‚Äôt explain why, it‚Äôs a compatibility problem.
I can't speak for other people, only for myself. I am someone who, for whatever reason, has no care what parts you have or don't have. All I care about is the person. I have told some people this but usually never unprompted. Usually, someone says or mentions or hints that they worry about me caring, so, I let them know I don't.
I mean personally I'm bi so I don't really care what someone is, just that they're a good person and fairly cute/hot/pretty. So I can see it being well intentioned but I can also see it as like ""I don't actually see you as a man"" kind of thing. Better communication is needed
Context is definitely key there (as it usually is, I guess). But you're not wrong to be a little bothered by it, either. Communication is tricky, and the world can be poopy.
Sounds like an excuse, but will deppend on the case.

Like... for some people, sexuality and attraction is complicated.

They may think they don't care but actually do, they may think rhey care but only out of indoctrination.

For some it may just be the novelty, or the unease from something unexpected or uncommon.
I'm attracted to feminity so understand what they're trying to say but yeah it's maybe a bit crude to say it that way? Lol
It sounds like they are overthinking being respectful and accidentally looping back into being a smidge rude. If there isn't any other red flags i probably wouldn't worry about it
It might be that they are observing some amount of apprehension or something that looks like it in how they read social cues and they might be telling you to try to assure you that you have no reason to worry about that because they want you to be comfortable with them.
Tbh a lot of people are scared of offending. They probably intended to let you know they like and accept you. I feel like this becomes a catch22. If you don‚Äôt care then you don‚Äôt care about their identity, if you do care then you‚Äôre fetishizing. I think the fact they‚Äôre out in public on a date says they have respect.
Speaking about this as a person with a cis/bi partner . I specifically asked him something similar to this, along the lines of ""am i enough for you as a man?"" The answer? Yes.

It comes down to communication. At some point you have to ask some hard questions. If they really care about you, they will make an effort to be genuine and honest. My partner sees me as a guy, and his sexuality didn't change just because i'm trans. We joke about being gay quite alot. It comes down to communication. I have told my past partners the titular ""I don't care about junk,"" thing as a way to affirm them that being trans doesn't change how i see/ am attracted to them. Some people **do** care about genitals, and they are perfectly valid as long as they are not rude or aggressive about it, and still treat you with respect in regards to your sexual orientation and identity. I would see it as a good thing, but i highly recommend to ask if you are unsure."	10y0fi7	trans	27	0.93	2023-02-09 17:25:47
I pass and have surgery booked in but i still want to kill myself	"Eh. Ok so this may be a bit of a ramble, so sorry. 

I will have been on hormones for 3 years in February next year. i have no issues with passing. No one gets confused by my voice even though im unhappy with it. 
Basically things have been improving over the last year and i can see i will get to a place in a couple of years after srs where i can forget about the whole transitioning thing and just be me. 
But I still fight the urges to go out and end it on an almost daily basis. I know i cant change things. I have to be able to accept it all and move on. But i hate that i wasn't just born a cis girl. I hate that i cant have children the way i should be able to. I hate eveything i missed out on by being trans. Dating, sex, exploring your body and sexuality. Going through that awkward teenage phase as a normal girl. Being able to just go out and have sex without any of the bullshit or compromises that go with being trans.
But im trans, so none of it happened. 
Im going to be taking medication for the rest of my life.  Dialation or some substitute for it will always be necessary. 

It is so tempting to just try and re-roll on life. Start again as someone else. If re-incarnation isnt a thing once you die, then who cares. Ill be dead and wont have to deal with any of this crap any more. "	"Please don't hurt yourself.

There is support all over the place. You must be in terrible pain but there are people who will understand.

Anytime you wish yourself harm, reach out instead.

On a side note, I honestly don't know if I will try suicide again. Im not in the right state of mind to do it properly. Maybe thats why i want things to go up shit creek again with my mental health.
Have you called the hotlines? 1-800-273-8255

I understand your Pascalian wager (if reincarnation, yay, if not, who cares), but the one thing you do know is you have this life in front of you. You know you have the chance to find happiness here, regardless of how much you've missed or how much hardship there may be. Also, suicide isn't just harmful to you, it hurts everyone who cares about you. I'm sure someone does, even if only a little. I know I do, even though I only know you through this post. 

I can't tell you what to do. But I can tell you I, for one, **don't** want you to kill yourself. Please keep living.

Edit: sorry. I'm just trying to help. I don't think suicide is a good idea.
I normally keep quiet with things like this, because I‚Äôm cis and therefore have no experience with feeling like the wrong gender. But I do have lupus, and it‚Äôs really bad. I know what it‚Äôs like to wake up and feel like your body is wrong. I know how it feels to miss out on life, even if the reasons are different. I know how it feels to wake up and think, ‚Äúthis is as good as it‚Äôs going to get. I‚Äôm never going to get better than this and I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs worth it.‚Äù Mostly, though, I know what it‚Äôs like to be stuck taking medicine every day for the rest of your life. 

What you do is brave. And it‚Äôs brave because it‚Äôs so hard to even get up in the morning when you‚Äôre depressed. And here you are taking steps to set yourself right. That‚Äôs more than most people. You fight so hard. 

But you don‚Äôt have to do the fighting alone. Call the numbers. Even if you know you wouldn‚Äôt take your life right now, call them. This was news to me, but apparently there are people out there who never need to call those numbers. Depression makes you feel like it‚Äôs so normal. But it‚Äôs not. Keep fighting.  
I am very aware of how many people would get hurt by it if i did it. I have definitely been lucky in that there are so many. 
Thanks for saying it though. 
Yeah I get that. It's like there are two parts to it. One of them is saying dont bother, give up, it will get worse again.  The other is actually realistic and can deal with all the problems and make things better.  
They both kind of influence me to some extent but it's never just one of them.  The other one is always in the background to some extent.  

I don't actually think I could attempt suicide again at this point. But I still find myself thinking about it quite often.  
I hear you. If you ever want to talk, I‚Äôm a hell of a listener. "	7fveer	trans	26	0.96	2017-11-27 14:09:56
Trans & Detrans Solidarity! ‚ù§Ô∏è	"I‚Äôm a trans man and I wanted to make a post to push for solidarity between trans and detrans communities! I‚Äôm constantly seeing the narrative of trans people fighting against detrans people, but the reality is many of us support one another and we have many common struggles! 

I think the media plays a large part in dividing us because we would be stronger together. A lot of the most prominently platformed detransitioners demonize trans people and our communities, or try to assert that because transition wasn‚Äôt right for them that it shouldn‚Äôt exist for anyone else. I believe this is wrong. However, I also believe it‚Äôs wrong to hold animosity towards detransitioners who haven‚Äôt done anything to hurt us. There‚Äôs nothing wrong with questioning something and realizing the best path for you is different than you expected. Additionally, many trans people have detransitioned and later retransitioned for a variety of reasons, so there‚Äôs a lot of overlap between our communities. The existence of one of our experiences doesn‚Äôt erase the existence of another.  

While we all have different experiences, I can think of a lot of things that would help a great many of us, like an increased acceptance for people who are (or are perceived as) gender nonconforming, an increased push for gender neutral spaces, affordable and accessible housing, and most of all easier access to healthcare including mental healthcare and gender affirming care (both for trans people and cis and/or detrans people). I would love to hear more ideas in the comments.

I‚Äôm a teenager and not a doctor or anything, so if I phrased something incorrectly or disrespectfully, I apologize and would love to hear constructive feedback. However I really wanted to start this discussion! I would also love to repost this in respectful detrans spaces as well if anyone has recommendations! (I went to check r / detrans but one of the first posts I saw was about how every trans person is in a ‚Äúcult‚Äù so I didn‚Äôt think it would be super productive lol).

Wishing everyone a nice day/night!"	"The only detrans people I don't like are the ones who use their experience to push the idea that it's a bad idea to transition and that most trans people regret it. Otherwise, I think detrans people should be given the same respect and help everyone else deserves!
are these the ones who transition very young and then make a career out of trying to ban anyone else from doing it
Yes you are totally right, we should stop letting transphobes put a divide between us and using detransitioners as a weapon. Transitioning is a process of discovery and people should be allowed to try things out without outside pressure or judgement.
Agreed ‚ù§Ô∏è
FWIW, I have seen only support respect for detrans folx around here. Their journeys take them down so many of the same roads we walk. Their experiences shed important light and validation on the importance and power of gender. And they, too, have their existence politicized.

I‚Äôve said before, and will say again: I‚Äôll still happily call them family. What we have in common are ties that still bind.

I‚Äôve gotten the sense that the sub you mentioned has been dominated by a vocal and non representative group. And that anti-trans ‚Äúadvocates‚Äù dominate a lot nominally detrans spaces.
as long as detrans folks don‚Äôt say ‚Äúi used to be trans‚Äù or as someone else said, push their experience as proof being trans is wrong or whatever
That‚Äôs definitely how I feel. Also who is the funky creature in ur pfp?
Detrans people are anyone who stopped/reversed their gender transition in some way. Some are cis and some are trans/non-binary people who detransitioned due to societal pressure or another reason.
They are one of the digital drawings I made, I'm not sure what I'm gonna call them. But It's a mix of a red panda and a bunny. (Maybe a little hint of whatever Grogu and Yoda are.)
I like them a lot!!"	12j9zj0	trans	25	0.81	2023-04-12 04:32:12
Help Me Get Over a Crummy Lack of Knowledge	"Alright. I have honestly wanted to ask this question for awhile now, and I think I need to find a way to address this to help me be a better person as well as to silence something that is causing me a bit of anxiety.

Confession: I am uncomfortable with non\-medical transness. 

It is the comparison that gets to me. I am a trans woman and my ""transness"" is firmly rooted in biology. I have a medical condition that makes me honestly unhealthy when I am testosterone dominant. As far as I am concerned, my ""transness"" is pretty under control because it is being treated, finally, with great results. There are plenty of further hurdles and this is a journey that never truly ends... however that line between ""unhealthy"" and ""healthy"" is clear, trans\-specific and able to be treated by medication that has literally turned my life from being all upside down to suddenly just making sense.

To be very specific. I have to confess that I am made very, very uncomfortable (both socially and philosophically) with the idea of individuals who are AMAB trans women (specifically) but then do not make any kind of efforts to actually medically transition.

This isn't necessarily a straight\-up transmedicalist position (though I consider myself one, because it is pretty impossible to deny the scientific basis at this point) and I certainly am aware that one of the common, shitty elements of our culture is a lack of access to proper medical care or that for some, the regimen of HRT isn't something the body can always easily handle. Individuals who desire treatment but cannot for reasons (including the common self\-inflicted kind of psychological wounds!) are completely understandable to me.

But, to be blunt, I simply do not understand how someone can be AMAB, claim a trans woman identity and then... intentionally remain full of testosterone. I'm sorry, but I don't care how someone identifies, but I do care about the severe effects of HRT and how different running on different hormones can be for a body. At this moment, I would be inherently uncomfortable allowing someone full of testosterone and with non intent to change that access to women's spaces. This goes double when I am full aware of how... terrible many trans persons can be while they suffer with the wrong hormones and social contexts and everything nasty we deal with.

I sincerely want to move past this because I know this is lingering internalized transphobia and not something that actually matters at all. That said, contexts which reject or erase the bio\-medical aspect of transness are very threatening to me because my transness is absolutely, 100&#37; a shitty medical condition I never asked for nor desired. Now that I am receiving treatment, like most trans persons who go on HRT, I am without a doubt healthier. Help me understand how this works, because as things stand now I have been fairly unable to shock myself out of this mindset. I need to have a context to understand this different experience of transness because it inherently sits so polarized opposite to my own lived, researched and understood trans experience in ways I honestly struggle to accept due to my own limited (and strong) experience.

Uhg, thanks. This probably won't be fun, per se, but I really hope I can be prodded outside of myself to be able to better get away from my own deep experience that is super\-tough to break away from. 

TL;DR: Affirming myself in some ways causes an inherent problem with affirming some other trans persons, and I don't find that acceptable and want to change what I recognize isn't a healthy place to stand."	"It seems to me that you are considering the problem being faced by governments all around the world, that is how to define what is a male and what is a female when the terms are used to determine access to segregated spaces. This is a complex issue and I don't pretend to have an answer but I am as concerned about it as much as you because it will directly effect my life.

I too don't think it can be as simple as 'I'm an XXXX therefore I can go in here'. That clearly will never work and where it is the case at the moment is causing immense hostility. There is going to have to be, in my humble opinion, a legal definition at some point that protects us all.
I think it may be helpful to consider the changes that happened when medical diagnosis shifted from gender identity disorder to gender dysphoria. Gender identity disorder was viewing being Trans as disordered in that you had cross gender feelings / identity that created emotional trauma that packed your life negatively. It accepted that those feelings were normal but considered their severity the issue. Gender dysphoria shifted things and said it's not a disorder at all regardless of the severity of feelings, rather the condition is the conflict between felt identity and perceived identity. 

This is all relevant because it then comes back to your concern over Trans identification. Transgender has shifted it's definition a little over time and these days refers to anyone with non-binary gender identities. So people with cross gender feelings who wouldn't qualify as GID or who can cope with those feelings on their own and thus not experience significant gender dysphoria are still Trans. It feels a little like your internal definition of Trans is someone who wants to transition though you know that's not quite right intellectually. I don't blame you for this. I think a lot of older Trans women have issues internalizing the more flexible definitions. I've had those issues too.

As this all applies to gendered spaces. The other thing to consider is the medical nature of it as you mentioned. Do you treat every broken limb the same? No, you do x-rays, establish the severity of the break and splint or cast as needed. Do you treat every laceration the same? No, sometimes you self care with a bandaid at home and sometimes a surgeon is needed to repair the damage. Likewise gender dysphoria exists in levels. If someone can alleviate their dysphoria by socially transitioning without needing to medically transition it's far better for them to do so, however, having appropriate access to gendered spaces is just as much part of that ""treatment"" in some individuals. 

Finally, access to care, as you mentioned, in the US at least, is abysmal and people's responses to what they do in the face of various conditions is often influences by that larger lack of access, even if their personal access is better. I have a personal opinion that we will have no idea how significant the non-medical transition group would be with universal access to care. Once that existed and people truly had the option to go as many of few steps as they wished in transition without worrying about money or social stigma or the rest I suppose that group would be much smaller than it is today. I could be completely wrong but that's just where that is.

Tldr: just because you need metaphorical stitches doesn't mean someone else can't get better with bandaids but you both still had cuts.
Reading some comment chains, it's clear that you are convinced that testesterone is some magic drug that makes you act in ways one can't control.

But the real shit is this: if you can't act like a decent person because of your hormonal state that's on you. The cis males you constantly refer to are just as responsible for their own actions as the rest of us.

So how to deal with non-hrt trans women in women's spaces: if they're being an asshole, kick them out. Easy.
If gender is truly modular and self-defined, the idea that it would rely on externalities is at odds with that idea. This includes others' opinions or thoughts, things like medical treatment to relieve dysphoria, and the idea that one must fit in certain social categories. Some people can't transition, some don't want to, some don't need to. Their gender is their own. Not everyone treats it like a medical condition too, many treat it as a very personal matter of identity. The way a cis person would treat theirs. It's often shifting and flowing and complex. Maybe it needs medical attention, maybe not. But nonetheless it is resolute, even if the matter of resolute-ness is just that they don't have any particular gender at all.

To put it like this- **people transition because they are trans. People are not trans because they transition.** Regardless of what you think or can understand, that is how most transgender people parse it.  
[deleted]
I think it's important to recognize that you are not all trans people. Not all trans people are going to feel/think/be the same way you are.

You are aware that HRT comes with its own health risks, right? That are amplified with age and certain medical conditions? Oh, and that it costs money, and not everyone has that? And that someone may simply do all the weighing of options and decide that simply being themselves is enough without medicalizing it? 

PS Listen to HIRS.
I guess the fact that this text that you made and the stuff you are thinking are transphobic is something you already got, so I'm gonna pass through that and tell you a story.
I'm afab, binary trans masc, and most of my social circle is based on trans people. I have a friend, she's 18 and socially living as a woman (she changed her documents and everything) but she doesnt have money to buy her hormones (bc she was kicked out of her parents house) and also the lack of a supportive network and information over the years made her afraid of hormones as well.
There's free medical care for trans ppl in my town but the waiting time for an endocrinologist is insane (but still free and very good tbh).
This is one story of a friend, but I also have an afab friend who really wants hrt and most of its effects, but is super afraid of getting bald and loosing hair (he, as me and many trans ppl ofc worries about appearance and this is no vanity but survival) 
Me, personally, think that this hole thing of guiding a ""transness"" through a medical point of view is really overdated, specially bc being trans is considered a disorder by the white dudes (which we know is mainly the ppl who are prevelant in producing this mainstream knowledge)
Idk, whenever I write long texts I forget the point but yeah girl, if u know its transphobic and all, don't get on defensive and try to listen I guess? As I said, my opinion 
Okay, so, you're saying that you're uncomfortable with someone who is AMAB, who identifies as a (trans) woman, but then, specifically for their own personal reasons (and not because they have a bad living situation) elect to not undergo HRT.

Does this extend to people who present or even pass as female while not on HRT? Or does the prejudice end with someone presenting still?

It's really hard for us to police who goes in what spaces. I feel like right now the general accepted rule is being that assigned gender or having a presentation that more or less lines up with social expectations at the time.

Can someone not having undergone HRT, not planning to undergo HRT, and not planning change their presentation still experience gender dysphoria? Most certainly! One of my partners falls under this very pointedly. I've never seen the expect to occupy woman/femme spaces before, I'm not sure how I would feel about them doing such if it isn't an already trans-centric space as well.

Now, if someone elects to present/socially transition without taking HRT, (independent of the previous paragraph) I personally don't have a problem with it. But that's mostly because:

Something that will help you, will be accepting the notion that everyone has control over their own body. And with that agency, it is up to them to decide what they wish to do. Whether it be to transition, or not, and how to go about that. Some people need HRT, some people need some surgeries, some need a lot. Some people don't need any of that, and it's okay.

And most importantly, no one needs any reason to change their presentation. Everyone has the right to their own body and their own presentation. Once you accept that no one needs any specific reason to present themselves how they want, no more than just on a whim, you'll see this, what you've defined as bigotry, quickly fall away.
One thing that could help is the number of studies coming out that show that transgender people, regardless of if they have had HRT or not, often have different biological markers than cisgendered people. 

I've outlined a few that might be helpful to you

Wildly varying chromosomes in nature, much more than the XX and the XY we've been led to believe are the only combinations of chromosomes. (this one is very detailed so I won't be offended if you don't read it through all the way. It's good information though!)

The grey matter in the brain is LITERALLY different for transgender people, meaning their brain is structured differently than in cisgender (non transgender) people.

https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19341803

Change in a specific gene is very common among transgender individuals.

Transgender brains respond similar to the gender they identify with, not the gender they are assigned at birth. https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/is-there-something-unique-about-the-transgender-brain/
I have to start with saying I basically disagree with you 100%, every step of the way. 

For someone who seems to think empathy is so strongly tied to hormones, you're showing a remarkable lack of it given your HRT. 

Some people don't want hormones for any huge number of valid reasons. Instead of being empathetic, you're refusing to accept that their experience is valid and that they know what's best for themselves. 

I don't understand why anyone would want kids. 20 years of hard work and financial ruin; they're loud and dirty and you'll give up all of your free time and relaxation (almost); we live in a dystopic hellworld defined by police violence, corporate dominance, and outrageous inequality all while facing potential climatic destruction and willfully choosing to make a child grow up in it seems borderline immoral; and it is such a huge responsibility that the anxiety of potentially being a bad parent despite your best efforts is crushing, for me. But there are people that want kids and have them and decide that that is what's best for them, and they know themselves better than I do.

You know, respect people for making the decision that they've decided is best for them. Kinda like how I expect all my cis friends that have zero comprehension of what I'm going through to trust that I am making the right decision for myself in transitioning. 

Respect that trans people who are secure in their identity without HRT are making the right decision for themselves. You don't have to understand it. Just respect it. If you can't do that on your own, then a non-HRT trans woman coming here and explaining isn't going to help you. 

I mentioned in my other comment that I am currently medically unable to get HRT. I get that in your mind there's some arbitrary distinction between people who are medically or financially unable to get HRT and people that choose not to for some other reason. That distinction doesn't make sense to me, because if (in your apparent belief) testosterone is the arbiter of one's behavior, then trans women with medical complications shouldn't be allowed in women's spaces either. If the space has some benefit to a trans woman and the requirement is self-reporting that you are incapable of, rather than choosing against, acquiring hormones, then who wouldn't just lie, and who would be able to tell? And why is someone who's transitioned socially without choosing HRT less valid than someone who socially transitions because they physically can't choose HRT? Moreover, you are putting WAY too much emphasis on hormones as the arbiter of one's behavior. Even among cis people attitudes and behaviors have a HUGE variation. Pick any gender you want, and you're going to find great people alongside shitty people. Testosterone isn't what makes a shitty man shitty, it's his choice to behave the way he does that makes him shitty. And if you're following the mindset that testosterone IS the reason, then explain shitty women? Does ""too much estrogen"" make you unpleasant? Or is it that they have too much testosterone, too? What about old men who are low-T but still assholes? What about trans women on HRT that are still assholes?

Last, talking about ""estrogen dominated spaces"" is outrageously truscum-y and very TERFy. We are defined by our identities, not our hormones, not our bodies, and not other people's expectations. 
>I too don't think it can be as simple as 'I'm an XXXX therefore I can go in here'.

I'd also note that the ""Self\-ID"" processes that are being discussed (especially in the UK) are *legal processes*. It isn't waking up and saying, ""Today I ID as X,"" because you need to have the paperwork and get it (their version of) notarized with a witness, etc.. Practically, you probably couldn't get the paperwork processed anywhere fast enough to be able to change gender day\-by\-day legally.

I'm not that interested in exclusion, and I sincerely want to have an understanding of how someone can be trans without being an absolute dumpster\-fire due to hormone imbalance. And how does dysphoria show itself when there isn't a problem with hormones? (And I firmly believe that there is no such thing as a trans person without dysphoria... dysphoria is a chameleon of an experience and self\-reportage for many trans persons is woefully too subjective\-\- not a bad thing! I used to think I had ""low dysphoria"" until I actually started HRT and all the walls and excuses I had built unknowingly just... tumbled down.)
why not just not have segregated spaces
>Do you treat every broken limb the same? No, you do x\-rays, establish the severity of the break and splint or cast as needed.

But you always *treat* the problem. There is no situation where someone presents to an emergency room and says, ""I have a broken arm but I'm cool with it!"" and isn't seen as... well, downright stupid if they refuse treatment.

A lot of what is presented in your post is absolutely true, but I still feel like it sincerely sidesteps the very real fact that testosterone and estrogen have a huge effect on one's thought/action processes and regardless of anything else. Someone with testosterone flooding through them at cis man levels has the bodily chemistry of a cis man and *acts accordingly*. I mean, pre\- and post\-HRT testimonials and research backs this up really succinctly.

Part of this is that I tend toward being pretty afraid of testosterone in general.
Amen.
>If gender is truly modular and self\-defined

I thoroughly, 100&#37; reject this notion as it is hogwash.

We are the arbiters of our identities, but our identities are not constructs of our arbitration. Self\-ID is a process of existing translation, not new creation. Individuals learn who they are, and live their lives accordingly. But ""what we are"" is so very often not a choice on the level of gender identity, sexual orientation, etc..

If gender were self\-defined, conversion therapy would work. If all it took was for the individual to *believe*, it makes conversion therapy a real option. (It isn't.)
No. Read again. This isn't some stupid exclusionary shit. Medical conditions do not only exist when there is treatment. That's a silly thing and I'm sure you know that that isn't true.

I nowhere said nor believe, at all, that someone not taking HRT isn't trans. And in fact, the whole purpose of this is the aware self\-reflection that my experience causes me to inherently not understand how some other experiences of transness work because they are not my experiences. I am literally looking to understand.
>You are aware that HRT comes with its own health risks, right? That are amplified with age and certain medical conditions? Oh, and that it costs money, and not everyone has that? And that someone may simply do all the weighing of options and decide that simply being themselves is enough without medicalizing it?

I'm going to assume you missed the part in my OP where I say the same \*shrug\*
off topic, but have they considered DIY?

They could do that until they get a doctor, who could take over from there.
This is probably the closest I have gotten to hearing about a non-hormone-based transition. But even still, your friend's hesitation seems based almost entirely off of the gatekeeping. I mean, so many trans persons suffer immensely due to gatekeeping and delays and all kinds of bigotry in the world. But these are also people working through their issues and likely will end up on HRT. At least, the intent is there but there are various personal and non-personal barrier.

I guess that I find, ""Out of fear"" to be a real-but-sad reality? But that isn't ""being okay with one's transness without HRT."" Sort-of the opposite. I certainly had to convince myself a lot of stuff would be fine before I could go ahead with HRT, myself.

I sincerely hope someone who is trans and has zero interest in any kind of medical intervention can share their experience. I think that is the only way I'll be able to understand because this is something internal and personal.
>Does this extend to people who present or even pass as female while not on HRT? Or does the prejudice end with someone presenting still?

It really comes down to hormones. I sincerely do not believe that someone who is testosterone\-dominant at normal cis man levels **and desires to always stay that way** has a place in women's spaces. Now, I mean, that isn't some kind of zero\-sum thing. But way beyond ""presentation"" I suppose I have seen the microaggressions enough from pre\-HRT trans women that I know very well that they're struggling to deal with the poison testosterone in their system. And behaviors and responses very frequently betray that existing hormonal balance. 

As someone who has been both testosterone\- and estrogen\-dominant as a trans woman, the idea of self\-inflicting testosterone is unthinkable, to me personally. That's a straight line to drunken suicide.

I'm uncomfortable with the idea that things like women's spaces will be opened to individuals who are testosterone\-dominant, bringing with it all the nasty that comes when you have testosterone\-dominant persons in near\-exclusively estrogen\-dominant spaces. It doesn't tend to end well.

And our science and biology absolutely supports gender as a spectrum. There is a whole universe full of individual persons who are all different in their own ways.

I suppose that this is really about hormones and an inherent distrust of testosterone that I sincerely doubt I am ever going to get over. I'd really love for someone who actually is a non\-HRT trans woman to explain this to me because I need to hear about their personal, individual experience to have that window into understanding.
Wow, this is a great post! I've come across most before, but one or two look new to me :) Thanks!

So... all of this, at least to me, is evidence that transness is biological and is, pretty clearly, a medical condition like so many different medical conditions people live with in the world.

It very succinctly sums up my confusion. Everyone is different, but the science shows that transness is a clash between our brains and hormone balances. We have AGAB hormones with a trans brain. That is the genesis of all dysphoria. I don't doubt that people can be different and not need everything everyone else does. Even amongst HRT there are a number of combinations and options and paths. Some enby people take HRT for a short while and then stop. There are many ways to do it.

The most blatant example of what I am talking about is someone who does not seek any medical treatment at all. Including social, physical, hormonal... Someone who is, say, AMAB, presents as a man, does not take hrt or have any medical/social intervention at all.
My honest reply is 'I don't know' but some people can cope with standing on the edge of a high vertical cliff but most of us cannot. I think it's called 'vertigo'. So what makes it possible for some to cope with that but not others?
I feel like it's a chicken and egg scenario.

The reason we need segregated spaces is because people are so weird around the other gender, which is because we have segregated spaces and not much non-romantic and non-sexual contact.

Maybe sexual assault wouldn't be such a huge problem if most men had deep platonic relationships with women.
non-binary people would theoretically be best with a mixture of both sex hormones. If someone leans towards male, but is non-binary, then having male typical hormone levels might not be a big deal (they'd still experience dysphoria, but not as bad as you.)

Most people don't think that a mixture of sex hormones or sex characteristics is possible since so many people say ""you can't pick and choose the effects of E/T"" (you can, but it's really hard and poorly understood/researched, so most doctors won't/can't do it).

&nbsp;

I feel like you're also severely downplaying the benefits of social transition. It's a huge part of any trans person's treatment, and even though it may be peanuts compared to the relief you felt through HRT, for a non-binary person (or even just someone with different pre-HRT hormone levels), it could be a much more significant thing.

Imagine saying that a trans woman can transition medically but ""pretending to be a woman isn't allowed"". They'd still have a large portion of their dysphoria fixed by hormones and surgery, but they'd still have to live as a man? I think it's obvious that they'd still have dysphoria.

What you're saying is basically the same thing, but directed at people who don't need HRT/surgery (or it's infeasible for them or they believe it's impossible).

It's like prescribing someone anti-depressants, but not caring about whether they have social support. Just therapy is enough for some people, so should we force them to take anti-depressants?

&nbsp;

I think there's ultimately 2 problems here.

1. The terms that we use to self identify aren't well defined, and no one enforces them (nor should they). So, you're assuming that someone who calls themselves a trans woman is binary, and they have the same problems as you, but they might be non-binary and just have trouble expressing or understanding that (can you blame them with society's treatment of gender?)
2. There's a ton of misinformation about HRT and trans people out there. Someone might believe that medically transitioning isn't good for them because they think that they'd have to go all the way to the other side of the spectrum, and nowadays they're largely correct. 30 years ago a binary trans woman might have self identified as a crossdresser because they didn't know HRT was possible, or maybe they thought it was deadly (it was much more dangerous back then), or maybe they thought it wouldn't change much. Hell, there are probably trans women like that today, and maybe they're part of the group you're talking about.
The problem is that your not recognizing that someone's ""cross gender feelings"" can be treated by social transition which plenty of case work backs up. The other side to medicine is using the least severe impactful intervention. If I have an infection in my foot, a doctor could indeed treat it by cutting off my foot or excising that tissue but that's far from necessary when keeping it clean and using antibiotic ointment would equally resolve the problem. HRT is about halfway along the , impactful treatment spectrum for gender dysphoria. It is super effective for those who need it but not everyone needs it. 
> Someone with testosterone flooding through them at cis man levels has the bodily chemistry of a cis man and acts accordingly. 

I very much resent this sentiment. I have normal cis-man levels of testosterone because my doctor will not put me back on estrogen (or even antiandrogens) until some conflicting conditions are treated. I'm not certain when, or if, those conditions will subside to the point of being healthy enough for estrogen. 

*I do NOT act like a cis man*. I'd argue that I basically never have, although how I used to act before I came out to myself was much closer to how cis men act; once upon a time I was definitely *trying* to act like a man. Now, though, very different. I'm not presenting female but I'm considering the possibility that I might have to transition socially without access to hormones and this insinuation that I would be a threat in women's spaces is pretty offensive, frankly. As are your comments elsewhere about a lack of empathy arising from T. I've noticed a colossal shift in my emotional response just as a result of ending the emotional repressions I had kept up for years and years. I felt happier and experienced emotions more strongly on E, but I still feel the same emotional gamut without it, just less intensely. 

>>Do you treat every broken limb the same? No, you do x-rays, establish the severity of the break and splint or cast as needed.

>But you always treat the problem. There is no situation where someone presents to an emergency room and says, ""I have a broken arm but I'm cool with it!"" and isn't seen as... well, downright stupid if they refuse treatment.

Right. Which is why you would do other dysphoria-reducing things like changing your presentation and pronouns and perhaps hair removal, etc. That's not *refusing treatment*, for some people that might be the most appropriate treatment. For some non-binary trans people (or tbf even some binary trans people) the physical changes incurred by HRT might actually make dysphoria worse. 

The treatment for dysphoria is not, specifically, hormones. The treatment is *transition*. For some people, transition involves surgeries, for others it means hormones, for some it just means social transition. Whatever route gives the person adequate relief is up to them, individually. I mean, there are trans femme people who don't shave their legs or even their beards. I can't fathom *not* having dysphoria about my hair, but if they don't, good for them and who am I to question. 
[deleted]
I think we're using different interpretations of self-defined. I define myself as a trans-girl because that's what's most comfortable. And because there are things on the far end that are actively uncomfortable. That's why conversion therapy wouldn't work on me. Or anyone else that subscribes to this interpretation of self-definition. Identity isn't a matter of belief I think either. It just is. Whether you believe or not.

Semantics aside, I think we'll probably just end up disagreeing in the end anyways. -w- But I see more of where you're coming from now.  
[deleted]
Fair. I apologize. I get frustrated by the question as a whole because it carries the implication that understanding is required for acceptance, and it parallels the rational of many in the general population who refuse to accept trans people because they ""don't understand."" Whatever. At the end of the day, you're probably never gonna get it and nobody's obligated to explain to you, so you can move on and accept or you can be gross about it and think you're better.
Yeah, me and my gf tried to help them out with that (we're diy waiting for the doctor) but in one of the cases i told is money related (she got kicked out and has no support) and the other one is related to not wanting some of the effects that HRT does (he wants two things: a deeper voice, and now he's starting voice therapy; and a beard, which there are several creams that help out with body growth in specific areas) so he actually doesnt want hrt (:
> I'm uncomfortable with the idea that things like women's spaces will be opened to individuals who are testosterone-dominant, bringing with it all the nasty that comes when you have testosterone-dominant persons in near-exclusively estrogen-dominant spaces. It doesn't tend to end well.

I just want to make sure that you're aware that that paragraph is just replacing specifically ""man"" and ""woman"" with something more this-space specific and less controversial to say you hate all men. While I get that the same framework is used, understandably so, in many other respects, I hope that your end-goal is that while you hate all people of a current group, that you still expect and hope that it will change in the future.

It seems that you have a pretty deeply ingrained belief that your hormones make you who you are and are the only controlling factor. So I suggest working on breaking that down. Regardless of hormones, you are who you are, and that's determined by your brain, not your hormones. 

I commend you trying to change, but at the same time, despite being told things, you're still defending your beliefs, so it makes me question if you *really* want to change.

It is also critical to point out that your current line of thinking is the exact same one as TERFs and Truscum believe. So you're riding a thin line right now. 
As long as people can retain self-control over their dangerous behaviors, why would that be so important? And it is not like only ""testosterone-dominant"" people can lose self-control over those behaviors. It is not like womens spaces are free of any form of violence.
>The problem is that your not recognizing that someone's ""cross gender feelings"" can be treated by social transition which plenty of case work backs up.

I do not at all dispute this, but hormonal balance is pretty super\-important. Someone who runs on testosterone at cis man levels... has the responses of someone with cis man levels of testosterone. We're not talking about stupid, meaningless day\-to\-day ""*Oh that trans woman isn't feminine enough!*"" but the fight\-or\-flight, very very very well backed up studies that show inherent and severe differences in various mental processes when the body is dominant in different hormones.

It also has a huge amount to do with empathy and the effects that testosterone/estrogen have on an individual's empathetic responses. They differ greatly.

This isn't a gatekeeping. I firmly and well believe that transness is a spectrum with all kinds of expressions and experiences. And I do really hope to find a trans woman who has declined any medical treatment to be able to explain to me what is going on. I don't understand this, have difficulty understanding it, and cannot fathom how one can be trans and reject HRT for no other reason than they don't want the cornerstone thing that helps trans persons. Not understanding, and being super open about that, isn't invalidation in the least. These are trans women who I simply cannot understand and I recognize that is almost certainly from a place of my own internalized transphobia.

This was partially sparked, I think, by my enby partner having a conversation with some other various partners of trans women (specifically) who were all commiserated about how irritated, unhappy and awful their trans women partners get when they miss a dose of their AAs, which is corrected rather quickly once the meds get back in the system.

I cannot reconcile my experiences such as this with the experience of being a trans woman without any need for HRT. It is so alien to my own understanding of transness, which is inherently personal, that it causes me problems in my larger process of getting myself as mentally fit as I can... because I'm on HRT and am a real person again.

And at the end of the day there will always be something wrong with one\-size solutions. People are certainly different, but I'm really discussing the non\-outliers here. Trans is a wide umbrella with room for everyone, and I am a strict, firm believer that there is no ""test"" for transness... it is something the individual knows in a complicated bio\-esoteric sense. Medicine is also showing that there are certain *patterns* to certain biological/medical stuffs in trans persons. I'm not worried about brain scans, for example, because I firmly and without doubt believe that everyone who says they are trans will have a ""trans brain"" (which is a spectru*m) because they are tr*ans. It is the whole, ""Well, you don't end up on r/traaaaaa actively questioning and wondering unless there is something there. It may not even be transness, but our minds are good at letting us know something is off, even if the result is sometimes terrible.
Hey I just wanted to say thanks for making the arguments I was going to use. Op is clearly in need of working through some androgen-phobia. 
>The whole idea of ""women's spaces"" is pretty silly to me TBH.

Wow. Okay. So you need to know that I find that just... sad :/

Women's spaces exist for some pretty damn important reasons. 
...yes? That's the whole point. I have internalized transphobia over this and want to work it out so it isn't transphobic.

You're literally raking me over the coals for what I openly admit I want to change. The only place this exchange has been going is to maintain my internalized transphobia.

I mean, I'd love to hear about this experience of being trans without HRT? I don't understand it, am frightened by it, and do not desire to be any of those things. The only way I am going to change this is exposure and understanding.
Sucks. I wish them the best. They deserve exactly whatever kind or amount of HRT they want/need!
>I commend you trying to change, but at the same time, despite being told things, you're still defending your beliefs, so it makes me question if you really want to change.

>It is also critical to point out that your current line of thinking is the exact same one as TERFs and Truscum believe. So you're riding a thin line right now. 

I think you answered your own question there.

They recognize that their thoughts are similar to toxic people, and that makes them uncomfortable. It's not necessarily because they understand that their thinking is bad inherently (then they would be able to figure it out without making a thread)
>It seems that you have a pretty deeply ingrained belief that your hormones make you who you are and are the only controlling factor. So I suggest working on breaking that down. Regardless of hormones, you are who you are, and that's determined by your brain, not your hormones.

So this strikes me as inherently contradictory. These are not mutually exclusive, and the experience of dysphoria is, at the base level, a conflict between body and mind. Hormone balance is essential in that process, and governs a large swath of our unintentional behavior and how we approach things.

Without a hormonal imbalance, there exists no phenomena to create dysphoria at all and there wouldn't be dysphoria.

I need to say, as well, that all trans persons experience dysphoria. But there is no general, ""standard"" experience. Dysphoria manifests itself in an endlessly myriad of ways, and one of the crowning features of dysphoria is the ability to hide itself completely under compounding layers. Every trans person has dysphoria, but dysphoria is not the driving force of every trans person. 

> It is also critical to point out that your current line of thinking is the exact same one as TERFs and Truscum believe. So you're riding a thin line right now. 

That is actually a part of this, tho a small one. The idea that transness is some nebulous, solely self\-identifying thing is exactly what makes the TERF argument strongest. They say, ""Oh, someone can just say they're a woman!"" and regardless of the fact that it is a thoroughly wrong argument, having zero standards and definitions no conscious, good\-faith attempts to understand the complexity is exactly the kind of ""self\-ID anarchy"" that is being blown to hell by TERFs. As I pointed out before, currently Self\-ID is not fluidity and is a legal process of declaring one's gender. It is a legal process that creates legitimacy. In the same way that medical understand and knowledge creates legitimacy.

My position here is not that some people are trans and others are not. My position is that there is a trans experience that is so foreign to me I literally cannot figure out how to wrap my head around it, and I want to understand.

I dunno, i said elsewhere that this was partially sparked by a converstion my enby partner hasd with a few other partners of trans women where they all were commiserating over how irritated, unhappy and generally ""bad place"" their partners go when they miss their AA and their testosterone even begins to climb again, and the noticeable difference when the next dose kicked in.

At the core, the idea of living my life being full of testosterone is a one\-way ticket to stepping in front of a train. It is so inherent and ingrained in my experience alongside the very different state of mind while on HRT, which is healthy and calm.

To get back to the simplest... I am uncertain how to conceptualize the idea of a trans woman refusing hrt and continuing to basically live and present as a man while taking a trans identity. (And let us not even get into where male privilege intersects with all this, because when you're AMAB and present ""as a man"" you have it in spades regardless of what your pronouns are. For most trans women that is an extremely temporary place as that privilege dissipates completely the moment one is perceived to be breaking the rigid masculine.)
Sure, but then we're getting into the area where people actually *do* judge individuals as individuals. That is how things end up (and should) but getting there is another story entirely.

It isn't even about ""violent behaviors."" I mean, I think everyone has, at some point, watched a room full of trans women aggressively dominate conversations with cis women and trans men. 
I dispute the importance you're putting on hormone levels, not just from a trans perspective, but from an anthropological one. This is really the nature vs nurture debate all over again. But the fact that cis men do not have universal behaviors across cultures (despite cis men having similar T levels cross cultures) is indicative that behaviors are more cultural than biological.

Beyond that, the typical serum levels of T in cis men has a *huge* normal range. If it were such a key determiner of behavior then how masculine a person acts would be correlatable with hormone concentrations. Indeed it's common for young cis men to not feel masculine enough and worry about their testosterone when nothing is wrong. 'more T = more man' is an unfortunate and harmful myth.

> trans women (specifically) who were all commiserated about how irritated, unhappy and awful their trans women partners get when they miss a dose of their AAs, which is corrected rather quickly once the meds get back in the system.

Psychosomatic. I know that Spiro at least builds up in your system over a few weeks and often takes months to significantly alter hormone levels in a person. I'm extremely skeptical that any dose changes would be noticable overnight.
Does the idea of a ""men's space"" seem silly to you?

women's spaces are necessary because our culture is ridiculously sexist and discriminatory, but they aren't inherently a good thing.

IMO the objective should be to take the high road and be as inclusive as possible without sacrificing the whole idea of a women's space (not let toxic masculinity in). If a non-binary woman comes in and expresses horrible toxic masculinity, then ask them to leave. It shouldn't be about their identity, it should be about their behavior.

I mean, at this point, you're pretty self aware that you have a prejudice and that you want to fix it. The answers have been laid out in front of you. I'm not really sure where else to take things other than where they have already been put.

You're either going to have an open mind and accept other people's experiences and choices, or you're not. And it sounds like you're putting qualifiers that you've determined onto people in order for them to receive a certain type of treatment from you. For whether right or wrong, or how far is okay, is up to you to decide, but that doesn't mean others have to respect those requisites or stance.

The end-goal that it sounds like you're trying to achieve is that you want to be able to accept everyone. But you're trying to be either convinced, or shown how the dots connect in a way that makes sense to you. However, I can't really see into your mind; I don't see what points are between where you believe now, and where you want to go towards. I can give you examples of people who I have met and how they experience things, but that's about as far as I have the capacity or knowledge to reach. you have to make these connections and come to accept that this might not make sense to you, and trust that it does to other people; or continue to stay with your beliefs as they are now.

That is of course, without going through and replying to a dozen things in your post.
>I mean, I think everyone has, at some point, watched a room full of trans women aggressively dominate conversations with cis women and trans men.

I never saw such a thing happening.

What hinders us from judging individuals as individuals?
Yeah that's what I've gotten from this thread. Itt op is super concerned that testesterone is the reason for all that ails them and is uncomfortable with anybody with too much of it in women's spaces. 

I mean kudos to op for trying to understand. But their responses demonstrate that they have an idea that they need to rationalize regarding t levels in people = bad things.
Hey, pastelfetish, just a quick heads-up:  
**noticable** is actually spelled **noticeable**. You can remember it by **remember the middle e**.

This is legit a MRA talking point. \>.\<
You're misunderstanding. OP is talking about people who have access to  HRT but choose not to use it. 
> If you can wrap your head around the fact that trans people existed before the modern invention of a drug then your problem will be fixed

Yeah, this isn't the issue at all.
> You're either going to have an open mind and accept other people's experiences and choices, or you're not.

And I think I am going to have to actually find someone with those experiences to actually share before any of that is really possible. There is an element of this that I am realizing that I may be in a place where what I am talking about doesn't really exist, which would actually make a huge amount of sense. There's really nothing anywhere here I sincerely disagree with when it comes to the question of, ""Do we treat people respectfully the way they desire to be treated? Do we affirm instead of deny?""

The trans woman who doesn't take any steps toward what we call ""transition"" seems to be quite a myth. Be it social or medical, the commonality is seeking treatment even if the treatment isn't some kind of straight line for everyone. I feel like the idea of the trans woman who rejects transition is a false narrative completely.
Dictionaries are tyranny
Non-binary people have less rights and representation than you...

men's rights activists are idiots who think that men need (more) representation or power.

&nbsp;

Isn't the idea of women's spaces to not let men take over and demand things and try to make it all about them?

Not letting a NB person into your space is pretty similar to men not letting women gain any power or respect in society.

I mean, I only know of one trans girl who is socially transitioned but not medically (that isn't hard specific because she isn't able to financially or medical-gatekeeping). And it's not a big-deal for her right now to pursue HRT. I think she will eventually, but for now, she's fine without.

I don't live locally to her, so I'm not sure what her day-to-day is like, or how she presents outside of online interactions. As I understand, her situation isn't well enough that pursuing HRT is easy, but I believe that she will eventually go for them.

But on the whole, I don't think the type of person, someone socially transitioning but flat refusing medical transition exists in large numbers. I'd like to think that I could accept them for who they are.
That is straight up equivocation.

Someone without access who has a desire to take HRT is completely different from someone without barriers to getting HRT but who chooses otherwise, intentionally.

Hormones are pretty important.
And yet there's many, many reasons why this would be the case. 

I take it you're not a parent.  If you were/are I can't believe you'd have this much of an issue realizing that some people choose to sacrifice their own happiness for that of their children.   And it's a choice every parent makes every minute of every day as soon as you conceive a child till the day you die. So perhaps they can treat their ""transness"" without HRT and be the parent their kid needs to have in their life. 

We live in time of increase visibility and therefore danger.  There's a good correlation between trans rights being publicly discussed and the rise of trans related hated crimes.   This becomes more of an issue when you fear for your life due to social or religious teachings that support the hostility towards LGBT individuals.  

While you are quick to claim equivocation between this situation and others, there is merit in that comparison.  There are many people who either through ignorance, inability, or indifference choose to not seek medical treatment for conditions that they may or may not know they have.  

Informed Consent and DIY hormones are still a realitivly new construct in HRT. there are many people throughout the world who love to do HRT, but due to insanely stupid and unreasonable buearacratic policies are prevented from pursuing their desired transition.

It's like saying you don't want chemotherapy to treat your cancer, even though there's a 95% chance that it will cure you no problem. (that's OP's mindset)

Obviously before chemotherapy was a thing, no one would ever use it, but those people aren't making a decision, while someone today would be actively refusing it.
tbh with how awful chemo seems I would probably refuse it unless I was still very young. 
I think the awfulness varies depending on the specific treatment, but I wouldn't blame someone for that. Assuming they are well informed about it, imo it's their decision. Personally, I would only ever consider that with my family's blessing though."	8q0cq6	trans	25	0.84	2018-06-10 12:01:34
Thoughts from a cis Dad on this Transgender Day of Visibility	"
Life is a journey and a process. When our daughter began her transition a few years back it felt like there were many uncertainties and much to learn. Our goals at the time were simple though. We wanted to provide a supportive and loving home, to raise a happy and healthy child and to nurture through education, acceptance and understanding. The decision to love each of our children unconditionally is an easy one. We are blessed to have stability at home and an amazing amount of family and friends support for decisions that so many people still consider taboo or unimaginable. We have come to understand so many truths in regards to our family‚Äôs path and journey - some of those truths being quite eye opening, some of those truths so simple and often overlooked, some truths beautiful and inspirational, but also some truths that are ugly and difficult to accept.

As parents we have always held a strong belief in letting our daughter choose for herself to be the individual she feels herself to be from within. We tried to not force her to be something she wasn‚Äôt. We let her gravitate towards her interests and desires. She wanted to hang with the girls in the family and at school. Her favorite colors for a long time were purple and ""rainbow"". With time it became very clear who our child was. The dialogue at home evolved. Eventually we asked some simple questions, ""Do you see yourself as a boy or a girl?"" Without hesitation, ""a girl!"" Later ""Do you want to pick your own clothes? What would you like to wear?"" Can you imagine the ecstasy of being able to wear a dress for the first time and feeling like your true self? Around that time I asked my daughter ""Would you like me to call you a boy or a girl? I will love you no matter what and I will love you no matter anyone else thinks or says."" The response was immediate. ""A girl of course Dad!"" I said, ""You can think about it and you can tell me when you are ready for us to call you she/her."" There was no hesitation and no waiting. She already knew who she was and was waiting for our validation. 

In this process we have shared many moments filled with love and happiness. There have also been moments that have been scary. Letting your child be their true self and accepting that fully is a life affirming experience. Letting your child stand on their own at school while away at work, not able to protect them is frightening as hell. Knowing that as parents we will be judged and criticized is very discouraging. I am fearful for the ignorance that my daughter will encounter through the course of her life. At home we strive to nourish healthy humans and to build strong characters. It takes love, energy, support, dialogue.

In sharing our perspective with others I hope that people will come to understand that we are all humans and our differences are what make us beautiful. Today more than ever I want to encourage people to see a trans person as an equal. Trans people deserve every single bit of life as everyone else - the same love and respect, the same happiness, the same protections by law, the same benefits, the same opportunities, the same access to health care and everything else that most people are blessed to have as Americans. Let‚Äôs not live in fear. Let‚Äôs be vocal. Let‚Äôs encourage love, encourage fairness and let‚Äôs stand together with the beautiful, vibrant people in our lives that we love.

Please share this message"	"Sounds like your daughter‚Äôs got a really good dad.
I couldn't help to have a few tears in my eyes reading this.  
Such a wonderful message filled with love an acceptance <3

It's so beautiful that you let her being herself from the beginning, I think she is a really lucky girl to have such an open minded father and mother that take care of her and is there for her.

I can only imagine how scary it must be to send her to school where sadly certain things are frequently not managed well, but don't worry with a root as strong as her family I'm sure she will overcome anything. Stay strong and keep doing an amazing job as a parent and I'm sure with such great sense of morals and values she will become a ray of sunshine in the life of everyone she will meet.

I think I speak for all the community when I say thank you from the bottom of my heart for all the love and encouragement and kind words, but also simply for raising your daughter the way you do by letting her being herself and being supportive. So many of us dreamt of a family like yours and reading about your family's story warmed my heart.

Sending you lots of love and take good care of your wonderful family as I know you will <3

Thank you Mel for such a warm and heartfelt message. It means so much to me to get those affirmations at a time when there is so much negativity in the world. My intention in posting yesterday was not to seek praise whatsoever. I really wanted share a little bit of my experience and possibly show some people, maybe somebody who is at that place we were at several years back, that you can do this and it will be ok and that it‚Äôs not as scary as it might seem once you start making good decisions from the heart. I remember that those decisions felt so huge. Is this ok? Am I doing the right thing? Will my family understand? Will we have support at school? Will people change how they think about me? Is it safer not to be open? How do I protect my child? It felt really scary especially once we accepted our path let our daughter be herself. I expected so much adversity. But the light that has shined on our whole family has been incredible. My mom is pretty liberal but also very traditional and religious. I was really worried that she just wouldn‚Äôt understand. Yesterday she told us that she was so grateful to have J. in our family and that J. has opened her eyes and educated her in ways that she never expected. The light from this experience shines bright and far. Our little girl is strong and sharp as a tack. She knows who she is and I can‚Äôt wait to see how far her light will reach as she matures. Thank you for your words, your love and your support. All the best‚Ä¶
Thank you for that. Fortunately I‚Äôm not parenting alone. Our daughter has a beautiful, intelligent mom that provides her strength, love and much more. She also has three supportive brothers and many cousins, aunt, uncles, and grandparents that all have her back. We received many positive and supportive messages from all sides of the family yesterday. I‚Äôm so grateful for that visible show of support. I truly wish that all kids (adults too) who are trying to find themselves and trying to determine their path could have such love and support. I know without a doubt that that is the foundation for raising a healthy trans child. Thank you again.
Sorry Mel. I meant to reply directly to your message. It‚Äôs above ^. I think üòÅ
Thank you! I'm glad, that's something that happen in my family too, it opened up the eyes of lots of people. The more information people have the better, it's hard to educate people on a subject so touchy but when it's happening to someone related to them they tend to slowly get around and start understanding better. We can only do our best to try to explain to people and when well explain lots of people tend to open their mind and realize that it is not a choice, it is who we are."	tt960y	trans	25	0.9	2022-03-31 20:39:39
I don‚Äôt know how to take care of my hair as a woman.	"Basically as the title says. I have really dry and frizzy hair naturally with slight curliness. I never really was able to tame it living as my amab, but I also never really cared until transitioning made me finally care what I looked like.

As I've experimented with those I've gotten my hair to a much nicer state. It might be curlier than you realize too!
What is your current hair-care routine? It might be helpful in pointing you toward the next right direction (granted, I am no expert myself... yet!).
Treat yourself to a trim (and possibly a color) at the hair salon, and before you leave buy some of their haircare products.
I've got similar hair. I just condition the hell out of it and that seems to work well enough.
Conditioner and leave-in conditioner work wonders.

Talk to your doc about finasteride if you aren't already on it.
Absolutely! Ive been using cg (curly girl) products now for over two years and my hair is better in every aspect! (Hrt has played a part in that too) 

For over 20 years my hair has been the exact same length without going to a hairdresser or even cut it myself. It just did t want to grow longer.

I wash it with conditioner 2-3 times a week and use a leave in conditioner sparingly on a daily basis. Too much and my hair seems too heavy, so I try to be careful. 

I occasionally wash with shampoo, but it dries out my hair super bad even with conditioning afterward.

My shampoo and conditioner was recommended to me by a stylist and I bought it at the salon she works at. 

I don‚Äôt really like blow drying my hair because of the frizz explosion
Only if your T isn't suppressed tho. If your T is suppressed then finasteride is superfluous.

I came out in the worst possible way and time and I just had the darkest night in my life.	"  

I'm at a complete and utter loss of what to do now. In just two short weeks everything in my life came crumbling down in an instant. I feel so fucking hopeless about the future right now. I'm sorry this is a bit lengthy. But I feel like screaming into the void and hoping someone will listen is better than bottling this up. It's split into three main issues that are making it hard to even get over one of them.

I(28m?) recently came out to my friends as trans, and I never thought I would. It was more reactionary than anything really, because I was terrified that I was losing my closest friend because she thought I still had romantic feelings for her. These circumstances were not ideal in any way and now it feels like everything is piling into itself. Everything feels way more real since I came out. The fake personality I put on in public feels like it's impossible to maintain now. I've always been more emotional than most guys, but now it's just insane. During work I can't even keep it together anymore and I'm worried I'm going to lose my job.

For a bit of context, a few years back I started dating my best friend for two years. It didn't work out and we went no contact for a little over a year. During this year of no contact, I finally accepted I was trans instead of denying it, but decided I never was going to tell anyone or act on it. Part of me knew since middle school, but I just refused to accept it as anything more than a fetish. I wish more then anything I told her at literally any stage of our friendship.

When we reconnected, we became best friends again, and it made it clear it was just as friends not as anything more. I agreed with it, and it only took me a few weeks to know I couldn't even feel that way about her anymore anyways. I literally felt closer to her in this iteration of our friendship than ever before. I wanted to always tell her, but I never worked up the courage too. I just kept repressing it for fear of losing my best friend again, let alone if others in my life found out. Without the overlaying romantic feelings, or fear of messing up that kind of relationship, I was honestly the happiest I have ever been in any iteration of our friendship.

Two weeks ago, she decided to let me know she was seeing someone else. I was honestly extremely happy for her. Then the conversation turned very similar to the post break up talk. It sounded like she thought I still had those kinds of feelings for her and was trying to cut me out of her life. I didn't say anything at the time and just congratulated her and told her to go for it and be happy. But it didn't sit well with me at all. I felt like I was losing my best friend over a misunderstanding. I decided I would rather lose her for her having a bad reaction to her finding out I'm trans then over a misunderstanding.

I spent the next week telling people close to me before I told her, to varying degrees of acceptance, and only a couple bad reactions. I thought I was ready to tell her but figured she wouldn't let me say it in person. If she thought, I was still capable of those types of feelings for her I figured she would think it was some dumb attempt to win her back. So, I opted to tell her over text.

It did not go well. She was pissed I was being vague when I tried to be precise in as short of text as possible. She was pissed because she thought I was trying to take back the green light of her new relationship. Most of all she was pissed because I lied to her for years about this.

The last one hurts the most because I don't know if she's right or not. When we were together, I felt like I could go either way. It wasn't until we went no contact that I finally accepted it. When we became friends again, I wanted to tell her, but it was extremely hard to even approach. I regret more than anything not doing so. I always saw her as the core of my support group if I did manage to come out, and now I‚Äôm not even sure if she wants me in her life at all. Was I really lying to her, or was I lying to myself more?

So now what?

I lost my best friend, the person I felt I could tell anything, but didn't. My friends either are distancing themselves from me or don't understand. My support group feels shattered when I need it the most.

I think having to explain this to people has in some way made me more rapidly internalize things. Things that used to be minor annoyances are now extremely heart wrenching to me. Facial hair? Despise it. Looking at myself in the mirror? Nauseating. Having to put on men's dress clothes for work? I threw up forcing myself to the other morning. Everything is just starting to feel so much more real and painful now that my public fake self is fading away.

I never gave much thought about what I would do if I came out. Since I couldn't tell my best friend I figured I wouldn't tell anybody. Why think past the first step if you can‚Äôt even approach the hurdle? Transitioning was the furthest thing on my mind because I never thought it would work. Now I'm regretting everything. I was never happy with my appearance and knew I probably never would be. I just stopped caring. I almost hit 300 lbs at one point, I'm almost 30, balding, and I'm 6 foot. Just a horrible person because I could never stick to some sort of plan. I always knew I would never be happy with the result after years of hard work, so I always gave up. If I started years ago maybe I could have put an effort in, but I feel like that ship has passed.

I keep having this dream now, with only minor variations. I'm just going throughout my day without even realizing it's a dream until I see a mirror or reflection. It's not me. It's someone I can never be. And before I can even comprehend, I always wake up and am just utterly devastated. The hair may be a different style, might be wearing something else, but that face is always the same. I‚Äôm starting to see it during the day and it‚Äôs ruining me. I would trade almost anything in the world to trade places with her.

Just minor thing after minor thing is driving me insane. Stupid jealousy on things like the women at work being able to wear professional dresses, being able to show emotion without getting the dead awful stares and whispers. Just so many little things I'll never be able to fully list out.

Then to top everything off, my car caught fire and is now completely totaled. I was not in a financial situation to be able to afford this even remotely. Every single credit loan I've applied for rejected me. Can't even apply for their minimums. So, I'm shit out of luck living in rural south Dakota without a vehicle. Being rejected on every loan really scares me. What if I transition? How will I even afford this if my finances are even worse than I thought? What about the future? I probably won't ever get a house, or anything substantial for a life achievement. Not to mention since this state is a hellhole, I would never be able to come out at work without my work life being ruined.

Any one of these would already be extremely hard to deal with on my own. But all these at once is shattering me, and my support group is fractured.

That brings me to last night. Horrible morning at work, got rejected from another auto loan in the morning, and it was my best friend's birthday. I tried to reach out to wish her well, and only got short answers akin to go away I don't care anymore. Finished up my day to try for another auto loan to just get rejected on the spot.

The night was probably the darkest night I have ever had, and I have attempted suicide before for less. If it wasn't the fact that I didn't want to stain the day for my friend, I don't think I would be here right now. I‚Äôm slightly better today but I‚Äôm scared of what happens next time when a birthday doesn‚Äôt stop me. 

I don‚Äôt know what I‚Äôm even hoping to accomplish by posting this. It‚Äôs some form of self-therapy to write this out for myself, I guess. To just try and see where I went wrong. I wish I told her sooner, and now I regret telling her at all. I don‚Äôt want to interrupt her new relationship, and I feel awful for being selfish and trying to maintain the closest bond I‚Äôve ever form when its clear that bond didn‚Äôt mean the same to her. I just wish we could remain friends, but I don‚Äôt believe she even wants that. I feel used, I feel like my trust is meaningless, and I don‚Äôt know who I can even trust anymore if I didn‚Äôt see this coming. 

If you managed to actually read all this for a stranger you will never meet, thank you. If just one person can offer insight, I think the pain of typing this up might have been worth it. 

TL;DR I came out reactionary and everything is going to shit in my life rapidly. I lost my friends, including my best friend, my outlook on everything is changing and it hurts, and to top it off my car catching fire is really hammering in how financially ruined I am."	"A factor that seems to be missing is that you took your friend's agency when you assumed what she was thinking rather than communicate what you were thinking.  She may or may not have been thinking you were still pining for her, but you did not allow her to tell you what she was thinking.  You did her ""thinking"" for her and then reacted to your projected thoughts.  At this point, she could be mad at you for numerous reasons, but you can never truly know as you are not communicating, you are assuming.  

The only solution I see here is to own it.  Send her an email acknowledging the above as well as what you wrote in your post.  Then get out of the way and hope that she feels your past friendship is worth continuing the conversation.  It sucks losing friends.  But you had good intentions when wishing her well in her relationship.  If it has to end, end it on a high note and cherish the good memories you have of your friendship.  If it tries to grow, give it space to rebuild trust.  She doesn't know the REAL you.  Odds are high you also do not know the REAL her.  Hitting 'do-over' can work wonders.
Cliche incoming

It's always darkest right before dawn.


When I left home after graduation ( high school) to go to college, I told very few people that I was trans/sissy. My family all but disowned me ( thank goodness for scholarships). My friend's left me , except my best girl friend. It was hard to move states to go to college after, but I am 3 years into school, and I am happier than ever. It took probably 8 months to realize I needed to move on, and I started going to the ""gay"" bar and having a good time. Im sorry your friend is all like she is. I'm here for support if you need someone to talk to.
I know that this feels all consuming and catastrophic right now, but you can ride this out. You might consider looking into online/virtual support groups. Maybe it will help to hear stories of others who have been where you are and are getting through it and shaping another life.
Getting it all out is good, I think. Bottling things up never ends well, in my experience.

I'm sorry you're going through all of this, and I do hope things will get better for you soon. I think they will.

Your friendship with your best friend sounds like it hasn't been healthy for quite a while. It's really hard to lose friends; I lost ties with one very dear to me recently. It hurts a lot, even if the friendship was causing us pain. You will make new friends; it's almost inevitable. Give it time, and new people will come into your life.

I don't think you should write transition off 100%. Ultimately, whether you decide to or not is completely up to you, and remember that it's okay to change your mind in either direction. Most importantly, whether you transition or not, I think it's important to start living as yourself. You mentioned having a personality you put on that's become difficult to keep up in the wake of everything (paraphrasing here). It's going to be confusing and maybe even shocking to the people in your life to stop playing that role, but I don't think there is any true benefit to keeping that fa√ßade up. Whether you live as a man, woman, or any other gender, you would benefit a lot from letting your true personality come through. I think you'll attract friends that will be more supportive and more understanding of how you're current feeling, if nothing else.

It's never going to be easy, but things are going to get better. I sincerely believe that.
That... makes a lot of sense from a different perspective. I always tend to assume the worst in these scenarios. Thank you for that.
Trans/sissy? What?"	vj9ax9	trans	25	0.9	2022-06-23 22:45:24
Am I the only trans-person like this?	"My fiance and I (both transmen) disagree heavily on the use of labels. I absolutely cannot stand them and he has to have a label for everything. He's very much the ""out and proud in your face and if you mis-gender or call me by the wrong name I will wreck you"" kind of person, where I am more ""meh"" about the whole thing. I don't care if someone mis-genders me, or calls me by my birth name. Neither of us have started to transition and the way I see it is I'm not going to force my friends and family into this if they aren't ready for it yet, yeah it feels pretty damn good when they call me by my chosen name, and I was a damn near crying puddle on my birthday last year when my mother got me a card that said Son on it but I don't feel the need to enforce it until I start making the physical changes. My fiance though is on the complete opposite side of the spectrum from me, he completely cut off family and long time friends because they didn't ""snap to"" and start calling him by his chosen name the moment he came out (which I thought was utterly ridiculous). And I honestly can't stand a good portion of the LGBT community because of their ""in your face"" and ""oh you're not going to do this for me because I'm [insert label] well I'm going to blast you everywhere because you're a bigot for standing up for your own freedoms as a business owner"" attitude.

Now my main question has to do with the fact that I HATE labels with a passion, so when I transition I will pretty much live a ""stealth"" (I think that's the term?) life. For me I DON'T want that ""trans"" title, I will be a man and that is all I have or ever will see myself as. Because I am constantly being told that this makes me a horrible person and that I am ruining the community with my views, hell I've even been told that I'm not a ""true"" trans person all because I have a very blas√© attitude about the whole thing.  

Am I alone in this? Am I the only trans person who feels this way?"	"I'm pretty much in the same boat as you (except I'm heading in the other direction :P). I don't kick up a big fuss just yet, despite the dysphoria getting to me a lot. And I'm not a big fan of the labels game.

>but I don't feel the need to enforce it until I start making the physical changes

I'm on hormones and I don't see the need yet. Once boy-mode starts failing, then I'll start nudging the issue. But until then, why cause strife? I haven't even really settled on a name yet.

>so when I transition I will pretty much live a ""stealth"" (I think that's the term?) life. 

Stealth is when you don't let anyone know you're trans. And yea, that's my plan as well. But I can't predict the future, so who knows how things will end up?

>Because I am constantly being told that this makes me a horrible person and that I am ruining the community with my views, hell I've even been told that I'm not a ""true"" trans person all because I have a very blas√© attitude about the whole thing. 

Your attitude towards words doesn't dictate whether you're trans or not. The body doesn't care what you call it (outside of social conditioning and association).

But yea, we definitely seem to be in the minority. Seems like a lot of trans people hop on the 'switch name/pronouns nao!' train.
>I've even been told that I'm not a ""true"" trans person all because I have a very blas√© attitude about the whole thing.

Lucky for us, it's not up to them, huh?

You're not alone. We're a minority within a minority, though. It's not that I don't care about pronouns or how I identify, it's that my identity matters to me. I learned a long time ago to not care about what other people's perceptions of me are. I'm doing this for me and me alone. If other people are slow to catch up or whatever, then fine. 

I'm also a writer, so I have a very sensitive relationship with language and I'm extremely uncomfortable with dictating how other people use words. I have told everyone what my preferred name is, and I've had the question ""do you want me to call you 'she/her'?"" dozens of times. My answer is always ""if you want to"".

I know it's a very sensitive issue in the community and I actively try to be respectful of everyone's choices and preferences. Anyone who doesn't acknowledge that it can be difficult is looking through a rose-colored lens. People are creatures of habit.
It's actually quite hard for people to switch names and pronouns, especially for people you've known a long time. If you want to make a clean break, and rebuild from scratch then go for it. If not then a little humility is helpful. 

For sure don't tolerate assholes, and correct mistakes, but going nuclear is more trouble than it's worth mostly.
I'm similar. I will say that my opinions have shifted back and forth a lot during the transition process. Just keep in mind that your opinions might change and then change and change again and nothing is wrong with that :)
I'm sure there are plenty of stealth trans people out there, it's just hard to know because, well... They're stealth! But wanting to live as your preferred gender and not be out about being trans doesn't make you a bad trans person. 
Well I'm glad I'm not alone in this lol. I was honestly scared that I was going to be met with some pretty nasty replies to my post. 
I only care if people close to me use my name or gender me correctly; people who care about you, should respect who you are... all of you-- while people who don't, may not know what your deal is. They can call me Ma'am or Sir and I'll go on about my day without a care in the world. 
  
And I don't call people who disagree with trans people or LGBT views bigots; some people just have a different view. If they go, ""I don't support trans/LGBT people, I don't agree with their 'lifestyle', but it's their life they can do what they want with it."" that's not a bigot... that's someone with a differing point of view. Bigots are people who are absolutely intolerant and almost hateful or spitful in their rhetoric... and make no mistake, there are plenty of LGBT bigots within the community who are intolerant of those who disagree with them.
  
I can't count the number of times I've been called ""cis performing"" trans by some ultra left wing whack job bigot because I didn't align with their gung-ho activism. 
  
Bigotry can go both ways, and I think some people in the LGBT community forget that.
On what you said about not needing to enforce until there's physical changes: I have a friend who is nonbinary somehow (he doesn't really know what's going on, he just knows he's not a man) who's on HRT, and he has very similar attitudes to a lot of what you've said here. As you can see, he still uses he/him pronouns and he hasn't changed his name- he says he'll probably switch over when his body looks more noticeably femme. He's very lasse faire (did I spell that right?) In regards to identifiers. There are definitely people with similar attitudes to you, don't worry. And nothing of what you're saying makes you ""wrong"" or ""bad.""
You are 100% not alone. Thank you for putting a thing into words that I've been feeling strongly.
Almost always, if trans person A reacts differently to certain treatment vs trans person B, it's caused by a difference in how their dysphoria works. It's not them against you and it doesn't have to be you against them. It's only us(yes, *all* of us) against our own personal dysphoria. It's not fair to judge others for not feeling the same way you do about being trans. 
You're not alone. Everybody's different, not all trans people want to be exposed like that. You don't have to be out and proud if you don't want to, and some people simply can't because it's not safe everywhere. Also, there's nothing wrong with not identifying as trans at all. We want to be a gender that we were not born as. I want to be male. I feel like I'm male. That makes me trans, which kind of detracts from it because I want to be male, not a trans male, but **male**. Yeah, we are what we are, but for some people it feels better to forget. 

I personally don't mind being out and identifying as a trans male, but my mtf partner does. She's very sensitive about it, and gets very distressed by any possibility that someone knows. She hasn't even told her wife's family, and they've been married two years. (To clarify, we're poly.) We've been together ten years and transitioned together, and she took it a lot harder than I did. It took her years before she felt comfortable enough to begin, even though she passed. Whereas I started my transition asap. Though I was nervous about my chest being visible, I otherwise didn't care what people thought of me and was pretty open about it. I think if she told her inlaws it would make her life easier, she wouldn't have to worry about what she looks like as much, but she doesn't want to. No one can force you to do anything, there is no right or wrong way to go about being trans.
I am kind of doing what you're doing but its making me miserable and I wish I had the strength to do what your fiance did.
I think I'm probably more nonbinary than a trans woman, but I use the woman label because it's easier for me and it's hard enough to get people to respect that identity. 
This is something everyone has to decide how they feel about. The problem that comes from not correcting people is that they will never learn and society never learns to change. Its ok not to want to be out and proud but never be ashamed of who you are. being trans is part of who you are and to deny it, is to deny your heritage and rights.  Your partner feels most likely this is who I am. Its a difficult one because to allow your family to continue will damage you and confuse them also in the long run. The best solution is a compromise, give those around you time and then decide a point at which you say. you can be in my life or you cannot be.
I'm right there with you (but going mtf). I came out to my family in January of this year but have been clear with them that they aren't expected to use my chosen name or female pronouns until I actually start my transition. It feels weird to me to have them calling me Madison and referring to me as ""she"" or ""her"" or ""sister"" or ""daughter"" when I still have more body hair than a gorilla.  I have asked them to stop using ""son,"" ""brother,"" ""nephew,"" etc as much as possible. My mom has been amazing, her facebook birthday post never once had the word ""son"" in it. That made me smile.

I think everyone just has to go at their own pace. Have people switch when you are comfortable with it.
Everyone is different about this. Also, you haven't started transition, yet, so it's quite likely your views will adjust over time and through transition. You can't say now how you will feel later.
[deleted]
Same boat here. (And also in the opposite direction as OP).

For me, if I'm not presenting I don't make it an issue. Why should people have to take my transition more seriously than I do? (That's not the best way to say it, but I'm not entirely sure what the best words are).

I'm usually boy mode, so most people don't know, and if they do, I don't ask them to refer to me as anything.

In places when I'm more girl mode (or neutral if I have less confidence about being stabbed), I get a little miffed if people notice and continue with sir/he/etc. but I don't push it unless the person seems to be doing it out of malice. This has happened exactly one times.

I know one trans man who holds similar opinions, but everyone else seems to be fairly militant about it. I can't blame them, people need an outlet to vent, but it can be exhausting.

The worst was someone in my school who stormed out of a class when a teacher (who was only part time, so hadn't been informed about the schools (then) only transgirl) called her a he. It had only been a few months since coming out and looked like a guy. Her hair was long, but it was a liberal school and everyone's was. Idk. People are weird.
>You're not alone. We're a minority within a minority, though. It's not that I don't care about pronouns or how I identify, it's that my identity matters to me. I learned a long time ago to not care about what other people's perceptions of me are. I'm doing this for me and me alone. If other people are slow to catch up or whatever, then fine.  

I need to get that embroidered and framed over my mirror. I would love to read that every day. 

>I have told everyone what my preferred name is, and I've had the question ""do you want me to call you 'she/her'?"" dozens of times. My answer is always ""if you want to"".

That was always my response too. But after a weekend of having people use my preferred name and pronouns, I'm going to (slowly and gently) start pushing more. I liked it. I liked it *a lot*. 

I couldn't agree more. I just don't see much point in enforcing my family and friends referring to me by my chosen name at the current moment because I am not currently transitioning, doing this doesn't change how I see myself as a person because to me it isn't a deciding factor in who I am as a person. To me, physical attributes don't play a key role in my personality, this is probably why my opinion is so drastically different from everyone else.
(Disclaimer: This is probably going to ruffle some feathers. I am a VERY science heavy person, so my opinions are determined by what has been discovered within the scientific community, there for my opinions are also quite unpopular.)

First, I never said I was ""ashamed"" of who I am, being trans doesn't define who I am as a person, it is not a deciding factor in how my personality works and has no determinate factor into how I see myself as a human being. (This is also where I believe the LGBT community fails as a whole, because if you're not ""out and proud"" you must be ashamed of who you are.)

Second, transgender isn't a heritage, it's a chemical and hormonal imbalance in the brain causing a mental and in all technicalities physical disorder that is cured by either prescribed medications, surgery, or a combination of the two. A heritage is your genealogical make-up, where your ancestors are from (I.e. European, Latin, Asian descent.) and your ""rights"" are to receive treatment to fix that disorder, not to demand people see you in a light that you are not yet walking towards or standing under at that time.

Third, my family isn't causing me ""damage"" nor are they confused about who I am as a person, once again being ""trans"" isn't what contributes to me being a kind-hearted, loving individual with an open mind. And my family is intelligent enough to understand that who I am as a person is not defined by the shell that personality is housed in.

How I view being trans IS my compromise with my family and friends. You wouldn't expect people to treat you as if you had nothing wrong with you if you had Schizophrenia/OCD/Bi-Polar if you are not taking the necessary medications or steps to fixing the problem, it is the same with being trans in my mind. I don't expect my family or friends to see me as something I physically am not until I am taking the steps to correct the problem, and seeing as I am not currently taking those steps I see no need to enforce this with them.
> It seems to founded in some kind of wish to not inconvenience others at all, idk.

I mean, that *is* like a legitimate reason to do things. I don't talk with my religious parents about god not existing because I have nothing to gain and they'd be annoyed. 

I strongly agree people shouldn't let that force them into things that hurt them. But if (as with me and god or OP and gender) it doesn't involve sacrifice then sure, why not."	518bq3	trans	26	0.96	2016-09-05 07:19:52
Where can a parent start in helping their kid transition?	"Mods, please feel free to remove if this is in the wrong spot!

I'm a proud parent of a 15yr AFAB t-mac who has 1000% support from myself and my wife. They are looking to start their journey transitioning, but I don't know where to begin. Is their pediatric doctor the right start, or should we find a group dedicated to trans health care?

Any recommendations in the Chicagoland area? We assume any major decisions will need to be supported by a mental health professional? Thanks for any help and tips you can provide! It is incredibly rewarding to be a parent and watch your kid on their journey, and I'm honored to be along for the ride! My only goal in life is to keep them safe and happy."	"Hello Proud Parent!  I have been medically and legally transitioning over the past year and in Chicago while doing it. Feel free to DM me with any questions you may have.
I don‚Äôt have any advice to give. But the nature of this post warms my heart exponentially. Your child is very fortunate to have y‚Äôall as parents.
First... Google if they need a note from a mental health care provider to transition in some states you don't need it... If not... Just set up an appointment with a gender clinic... If so... Try to find said mental health provider. They should say they work with trans people in their bio. Also google what they need in order to diagnose gender dysphoria. They have to be up to date and follow this thing in order to write a not for hrt. Hopefully that helps some. üòä
What exactly do they want, medical transition-wise? A gender therapist would be a good bet to begin with if your kid doesn't know how they want to transition physically.
Here's a great reference:

I do not have experience transitioning as a younger teen but I know of lots of resources in Chicago. The first place that comes to mind is Northwestern! I have friends who have done their entire transition-finding mental health professionals, getting dysphoria diagnoses, surgeries, etc-all through Northwestern med. They have all given great reviews. I believe they offer services for trans kids and teens and they are really family-oriented. I have another friend who went through the process of top surgery at Lurie Children's and he said they were fantastic as well. It is not for everyone but there are some amazing therapy and support groups in Chicago for trans teens, I would check out Howard Brown and Center on Halstead. I think it's really fantastic that you are so supportive, I wish I had my parents help navigating my physical transition. Hope this helps.
Any parent who is not 100% behind the choices of their kid should not be parenting. As parents, our only job is to keep our kids happy, safe, and provide a good future. 

As I said, this is THEIR journey. I can't pick the destination for them, just be happy they trust us enough to share, talk, and come to us for help and advice. It breaks my heart when I read the posts in this subreddit where parents are not supportive, or worse, kick their kids out of the house.
You can also look into/call planned Parenthood. They do informed consent and probably have a lot of information on this as well.

Transgender reality	"Maybe I've spent too much time in transphobic online spaces recently, but I feel like I'm frequently seeing comments from people saying the trans community is encouraging people to transition, that when kids and teens start questioning their gender, they go online and find a ton of support from people who push them to transition.

And, seeing the accounts of people who have detransitioned, it seems like a lot of them admit that they got sucked into the 'idea' of being trans, that they had other issues going on but that the trans community just swept them in ('like a cult' some say) and convinced them they were trans and had to transition.

I personally disagree with these accounts, and here's why:

I think the transgender community is very supportive because living life before you realize you're trans is hard, realizing you're trans can be traumatic, and actually transitioning is really difficult, painful, expensive and takes friggin forever. This community has compassion for those dealing with this stuff, and I'm constantly seeing people in this community being open to questioning people and not ""pushing"" people to call themselves trans or telling them to transition.

But, if you're suffering from any number of life's difficulties, the open support of the trans community can be a welcome salve, and I can see how someone would want to assimilate into a community like ours to have that support and sense of belonging. Unfortunately, only you, yourself can tell you if you're trans, and only you will be able to tell if transitioning is really right for you or not. If you try to transition just to be part of this community, you will probably give yourself gender dysphoria and want to detransition. And if that happens, I'm very sorry and hope the best for you, and the trans community will still be here for you, as long as you don't turn into a victimized transphobe who calls the trans community 'a cult'.

**For anyone questioning their gender and browsing this sub: Here's the truth about being trans.**

I'm fortunate enough to be in a position to have health insurance, and a very supportive wife, and can afford most of the trans care my insurance won't cover. And I live in a trans supportive state in a somewhat accepting area. Relatively speaking, my transition has been, well, 'easy'.

Transitioning is really rough. I'm 49 years old, been on HRT 2 years and recently have had some gender affirming surgeries. I've struggled with undiagnosed gender dysphoria since I was a little kid and only realized what it was in my 40s, and the realization and subsequent transition have been the hardest, most difficult, most emotional things I have ever had to do in my entire life.

Being trans means having to deal with discrimination, with bigots, etc. Being trans means healthcare isn't as straightforward as it is for cis people, and can be downright aggravating and discriminatory. Being trans can be full of self-doubt, anxiety and depression. There's frustration and anger and exasperation. There's mind games with people who knew me before transition, will they be supportive, will they be weird about it? Sometimes I wonder if the gender dysphoria I experienced before transitioning was truly worse than the shit I deal with now.

But, its also been one of the best, most rewarding, most fulfilling things I've ever done. NOT because being trans so great, but because I had this MASSIVE HOLE IN MY LIFE, and transitioning completed it for me. And I realize I can look at myself in the mirror now and its me, not some stranger. That is better than any of the anti-trans bullshit that I have to deal with now.

If you are questioning your gender, that's fine and I 100% support it! But keep an open mind about your life, and make sure your reasons for transitioning are entirely yours, not someone else's."	Great post, thank you	10o04g7	trans	23	0.93	2023-01-29 05:39:46
A Hair Stylist Ruined My Hair Today	"First off, I'm a ftm trans masculine person who hasn't undergone any medical transition. I'm socially transitioning and present as a male and have been for months now. I had heard rumors about hair stylists refusing to do trans people's hair, but I'd never imagined that my hair would be ruined the way it was.

What happened is I went to a fairly popular haircutting chain this morning. I checked in and got in line and waited for the one stylist available to finish up the other clients in front of me. She was an older woman, and she finished up the two men before me fairly quickly, and their hair ended up decent enough.

I had two pictures with me of two different styles I liked. I had wanted long bangs for years, and so I spent over six months growing out all of my hair until it reached shoulder length. It was long, thick, and perfect for the kind of bangs I wanted to have.

The woman called me over, washed my hair, then asked me what I wanted to do to my hair. I showed her the two pictures, and she said that one of the styles I was considering wouldn't work well with my rounder face, and so I told her I wanted the other one, and she agreed to do it. Keep in mind, the picture was of a butch woman with the cut I wanted, that'll be important later. Once we'd agreed, the stylist had me remove my glasses so she could cut my hair (a regular occurance when I get a trim or haircut). She began hacking away at my hair, and I knew she had fucked up my bangs. I just didn't realize how much until much too late.

She finished cutting my hair, dried it with a hairdrier, then handed me my glasses to look at the end result.

I was horrified. She'd chopped off way too much hair, my bangs barely had an inch covering my face, and it was a woman's pixie cut. Nothing like I had asked for from her.

I had to fight back tears as I told her, ""This isn't the haircut that I asked for.""

She only laughed and said, ""That was a man's haircut! You can't have that, you're a girl!""

I repeated what I had said two more times, making it pretty obvious I was unhappy with what she had done to me, but she only repeated what she had told me. Then she fluffed my hair up to make it look larger and said, ""Look! I made you look cuter than before!""

She made me pay for the hack job she had done on my hair, and I practically ran from the shop, close to tears.

I walked a few shops over to a nail salon my mother was getting a pedicure at and as soon as I walked in as she was paying, she knew it was nothing like the photo I had showed her. She finished paying then we walked to the car, and I burst into tears. She had no clue what to do. All of my hair was gone, on the floor in the haircutting place I had just left. I had no more than three to four inches of hair on the top of my head left to work with, and I didn't know what to do.

My mom and I drove to my sister's house, and she got to work trying to salvage my hair. It wasn't that the haircut itself was bad, as it could look nice on someone who wanted it like that! But I hadn't wanted anything like that, and so my sister is scheduling me an appointment with her stylist, and we've emailed corporate, left a review on Yelp, and on Google Reviews (which was deleted not ten hours after posting). If I don't get a reply to my email by the end of a week, I'm going public with what happened and posting it on Facebook as a way to warn others.

I feel disgusted, belittled, and I'm currently trying to fix what's happened to my hair, something that I've always held a lot of pride in. The stylist could have told me walking in that she wouldn't give me the cut I wanted, and I'd have left and found another place to go to and gotten the haircut I wanted, but instead, she ruined my hair, then refused to fix it, made me pay, and made me feel horrible about myself.

Be careful where you get your hair done, my friends. I know hair can be a big part of your transition, and this has left me feeling horrible. Ask your stylist if they'd be willing to give you the haircut you want, and double and triple check. Don't end up like I have.

Update: I got a response from corporate. They said they're getting into contact with the owners and the employee who did my hair. Hopefully a resolution will be found."	"I am so sorry for you, no service person has any right to disrespect someone that horribly.
That's the worst. I feel very strongly about my hair as well and I couldn't imagine being disrespected like this. I hope she gets reprimanded. This is ridiculous and sheshouldn't get away with it.
Hair is huge in our self esteem.  I'm so sorry this happened to you.   Damn people and thinking they know what we want better then we do.
Oh my god, this is my biggest fear! My hair is my most precious treasure, it's got me through many dysphoria filled times.

My mom is a hair dresser and she wanted to cut my hair (she doesn't know I'm trans) and it took me weeks telling her that I don't want it short until she  said she would only cut the ends, so it can grow better. It took me days until I said fine, I'll let you cut my hair, but only if you just cut the ends.

I went into the bathroom to wash my hair before cutting out and for the first time in over 10 years I cried. I cried for solid 5+ minutes, the whole time I was washing my hair... I was scared, even though I knew I shouldn't be, I'm sure she wouldn't cut my hair short if she promised she wouldn't? But just the thought of it was terrifying...

Luckily, she kept her promise and my hair looked great, but if she had done something like what happened to you, I honestly don't know how I would react...

I'm sorry this happened to you, I hope your hair grows back fast! ‚ù§Ô∏è
It sounds like one or two people at that salon need to be fired.
Report her to the cosmetology board, get her license number and name (should be posted over her station) and give a written account. Anyone who has a license has to answer to somebody.
Thank you. Most people in my life don't seem to understand that it wasn't just that my hair was ruined, but it was the way I had been treated. I've had many a bad haircut in my life, but it was more the mix of the stylist mistreating me, deliberately doing the opposite of what I'd wanted, and then ruining my hair. Now all I really want is my money back so that I can put it towards either a wig or a different cut.
exactly and hair is actually rather important to pre medical transition people (it's why i grow my hair way out and screech at anyone coming near me with scissors) and the audacity to demand payment after going the exact opposite of what you asked for is unacceptable"	cxrzq6	trans	24	0.97	2019-08-31 05:03:27
a letter to my mom	"just spent an hour writing this entire thing and messaged it to her because i honestly dont give a shit anymore. she can chew me out for the nexr week about it but my feelings are not going to change lol

It‚Äôs always been about you. Every conversation we have about my identity, it‚Äôs always about how you feel. You‚Äôve never apologized, never acknowledged how you make me feel, never tried to support me because you‚Äôre proud of me for being trans. You support me conditionally, holding your approval above me like fish bait and giving me just enough so I stay hopeful. Whenever I get too hopeful, you threaten to take away my things and reinforce ‚Äòrules‚Äô to control me into your comfort zone. Rules are supposed to help children, not make them scared of expressing their own feelings. Your actions affect me negatively. I am more than a child, I am a human being that is hurt when you invalidate me and don‚Äôt hold up to your word. I am hurt when I confront you about these things and you claim you never said them, playing with semantics to make me seem stupid.

Anytime I tell you how your actions make me feel, you dismiss it and go on about how much it is on you, making me feel guilty for things that aren‚Äôt my responsibility. I am juggling so much mentally and you piling on guilt about dad only paying child support, claiming I don‚Äôt love you because your actions hurt me; it doesn‚Äôt help. It makes it worse. You conditionally supporting me makes it so much worse. I‚Äôm so emotionally exhausted trying to just get it through your head that you have been mentally torturing me for half a year now, that you not supporting me is so detrimental to my mental health I have seriously contemplated moving to dad‚Äôs place. I love you mom, and I‚Äôm so sick of this going in circles month after month, but I still put myself through all of this because I love you. I still wait and give you chance after chance and keep trying to get through to you because I just want you to support me unconditionally. You are allowed to be confused and hurt while trying to understand my transition, but that will never, ever be my responsibility as your child. That is not something to put on me. I am not responsible for teaching my own mom to love me for who I am, for who I am beyond who she wants me to be.

This conversation is not about you, and it never will be. My identity is not about you. My identity is not yours to pick and choose which parts you approve of. My feelings on my identity are above anyone else‚Äôs because it is mine, and this is who I have always been. I didn‚Äôt have the words for it for the past fifteen years, I didn‚Äôt know how to describe the sick feeling in my chest I felt every time I was made aware of how people perceive me as a girl. I didn‚Äôt know how to describe the happy feeling I got anytime I held up my hair in the mirror and pretended I was anything except a girl, I didn‚Äôt know how describe any of these little moments of euphoria I got. I was never given the words for it. But I know now, and I am finding those words. I‚Äôve always known my identity, and now I have the words to describe it.

I know you wanted your miracle baby to grow into a wonderful girl, and I tried. I tried so hard, I would stay up googling how to talk like a girl and how to dress like one, copying mannerisms of other girls so that imposter feeling would go away. I wanted to fit in with all the girls at school that just seemed to find it so easy to be one. Yet I don‚Äôt remember a single second of feeling right in my own body during that time. I can‚Äôt do it anymore, and I‚Äôm tired of trying to force myself to be something I‚Äôm not. So please, please just stop trying to control me into it. 

Saying you‚Äôll let me get mens shorts, then getting me one pair and saying I can‚Äôt get anymore is conditionally supportive. Only complimenting my outfits when they‚Äôre feminine under the guise of neutral terms is not supportive. Treating me like I‚Äôm making up things when I hold you up to your word about trying to use different pronouns is conditionally supportive. I am not accusing, I am stating how you are treating me and how it makes me feel. You rejecting this and making it about you only makes me trust you less and less.

I don‚Äôt know what to do anymore. I have life to focus on, school to work on, a busy summer, a drivers license to study for, jobs to apply for in the fall. I‚Äôve already figured out my identity, and I‚Äôm not going to sit around waiting for you to catch up and stop hurting me. Your actions and refusal to accept change are putting me through emotional turmoil that is making it near impossible for me to function. I don‚Äôt care what you do, I just want it to stop. Fake being supportive when you‚Äôre not really, only use the right pronouns when I‚Äôm around and not behind closed doors, get us a counsellor, just something other than this. You are a fully grown woman and helping you cope with your feelings about my identity are not my responsibility as a sixteen year old. 

This letter is meant to be a formal explanation, not disrespect towards you. I am not comfortable saying all of this in person because I don‚Äôt think I could word it properly verbally. I have no intentions to hurt you or make you out as an irredeemable parent or something. I am writing this because I believe you can change. I just want you to understand perspective and how your actions affect me. I‚Äôm trying to suggest steps for you to accept this change because I really can‚Äôt do this anymore. Your struggle is an overwhelming weight on me, and I would appreciate you taking steps on your own to deal with it rather than putting me through more of this. I want to enjoy being a teenager, not cry myself to sleep every night wondering when the most important and impactful person in my life will support me unconditionally. 

Thank you for taking the time to read this"	"Man I‚Äôm really sorry your mom acts like that and for what it‚Äôs worth I have a lot of respect for you after having read this. You are valid and things will get better eventually even if it doesn‚Äôt seem like that right now.
I see you, and sending that to your Mum is very brave.
Saying this to your mom takes a lot of guts.  I mostly avoid talking about it with my mom because I don't have the spoons to have a big discussion about it.  I've pretty much given up on getting support from my family and have settled for just being ignored.  Luckily, I don't live with them anymore so I don't have to deal with that shit very often.

I‚Äôve wasted too much time being scared. Being nervous. Letting other people‚Äôs opinions keep me in fear of transitioning. 

It only matters to me what I decide to do with my body and life. Other people‚Äôs expectations and opinions are their problem... I‚Äôm going to do what makes me happy and the people in my life can either leave or support me. 

Pass-ability was always a concern for me but I think besides my voice I can most likely pass. Either way, it‚Äôs better than being the person who I am now. A guy with an alcohol dependency to cope with things going on in my life and dysphoria. A guy who can‚Äôt stop smoking cigarettes for stress. A guy who continues to give himself false reassurances that going on as my current self will work itself out. 

I‚Äôve been thinking about transitioning off and on from 17 - 26. Nearly 10 years of my life have gone by that I could‚Äôve been my real, genuine, authentic self. 

I came to the realization that if I don‚Äôt do this, I will probably push my body to the point of no return with the alcohol and cigarette consumptions. I need to quit, if not for me, than her. 

I feel that the current me, with these habits, is losing touch with reality. Pushing my friends away. Pushing my family away. Not being able to properly function or show up on time because I‚Äôm always hungover from the night before. I feel that I am starting to have cognitive dissonance. 

I know I shouldn‚Äôt use transitioning as an excuse to better myself but I obviously do not have the motivation or self esteem to quit for my current self. 

I just want to live my best life. It‚Äôs obvious with thinking about transitioning for 9 years and nearly doing it at 20 years old that this isn‚Äôt some phase. It‚Äôs a part of me. 

I have to act on it. There is a fork in the road. One leads me down a spiral of self harm. The other leads me to a life of self care. 

Thank you everyone for your support here, I don‚Äôt think I would possibly be this close to teetering off the transition cliff if it wasn‚Äôt for the support and words of this community. 

I will see you all on the other side! ‚ù§Ô∏è"	"You can do this fren!
Best of luck on your transition, remember you are a valid and valued member of this community and we are here for you whenever. Please be safe and be kind to yourself, I‚Äôm sure you will live a better and happier life after transitioning. You mean a lot to me and this community xxx
Good luck on your transition! I wish you the best.
""if not for me, than her.""

Warms my little heart to read this. Boy me has been keeping the lights on but girl me is moving in and we need some serious remodeling to get this place up to code. Good for you for taking charge of yourself. I'm not used to doing things because it's what I want, but feels real good.

Exposing my unsportive father at Christmas.	"Hi, I'm mtf, throw away account, and was hoping to get help with issues Im having with my father.

My dad is a peace of work. He's not actively deniging my transition, but hes treating it like a phase at the best of times. The only reason he hasn't falt out denied it was because he's quite the narcissist, and dosent want his perfect family image ruined. He doesn't care about what's happening at home, just that you come to family events and pretend everything is perfect. 

He's ruined my last two Christmas because of the choice of gifts hes gotten me. This year I want to confront him about it, at the family gathering. Talking to him quitly, and with my brothers hasnt worked. Each time I have he's wormed his way out of responsibility. First time he forgot, second time he mixed up gifts.

My brother's, both times have written it off as ""an honest mistake"". I dont know how a book called ""man up"" is an honest mistake, but w/e. 

I want to suggest something to him for Christmas that will be hard for him to lie his way out of. I honestly have no ideas to suggest though."	"Buy him panties and say oops an honest mistake they were in the ""mens"" section of the store
If it‚Äôs a ‚Äúguy‚Äù gift you can laugh and say ‚ÄúWelp there‚Äôs one for the thrift store! Next!‚Äù
Rough! I'd hesitate to stoop to his level as ""the best revenge is to be happy""

Of course, that's easier said than done, and if you think tactical drama could cause a long-term improvement in your family Christmases, than maybe it's worth it! 

Good luck this Xmas
When it comes to narcissists, the best approach is head on. He wants a perfect Christmas? Well, he'd better behave himself then, lest you, I don't know... set fire to the Christmas tree in front of him? Make sure you tell him, very calmly, but firmly, that this is the last time his antics will be tolerated, and you expect your chosen name and pronouns to be used from now on, and if he can't bring himself to buy you a feminine gift then he can skip buying you one at all. Any further bullying on his part, and he won't be having a very merry Christmas at all. You'll be making quite sure of that.

A Guide To Supporting Your Transgender Child	"This guide is aimed at cisgender parents of trans kids, to help them learn how to better support them. (Trans kids/teens - feel free to send this to your parents!)

(Trigger warning for mentions of dysphoria, transphobia, abuse, self-harm and suicide.)

Content list:

1. Supporting them when they come out
2. Educate yourself
3. Use their new name and pronouns
4. Ask them what you can do to support them
5. Accept that it's not a phase
6. Use gender neutral language
7. Listen to them

&#x200B;

***1.*** ***Supporting them when they come out***

So, your kid has made the decision to come out to you as transgender. You probably will be feeling overwhelmed and you might be feeling confused. You might not even know what transgender means.

The first thing you need to understand is how hard this was for them. They might have planned this for ages, and would have been terrified that you wouldn't be supportive. You might be wondering why they would be scared that you wouldn't accept them. After all, they're your kid, right? You love them and they know that. But it's not that simple. Some trans kids get kicked out by their parents. They get beaten, abused and driven to the point of suicide. The best thing you can do is listen to them and let them live as their gender identity.

Another thing you need to understand is that being trans isn't a choice. Your child didn't just wake up one day and decide to change their gender. This is who they are. Sex and gender are different things, and just as they had no control over their biological sex when they were born, they have no control over what they feel they are inside. They can live in denial and misery, if they force themself to live as their biological sex, or they can let themself be who they are inside, and live a normal and fulfilling life.

&#x200B;

***2. Educate yourself***

Many trans kids don't realise how little their parents know about the transgender community. You may quickly feel out of your depth with all of the new terminology they're using. A few terms you should familiarise yourself with are:

* Transgender - identifying as a gender other than your biological sex (e.g. a man who was born female)
* Cisgender - identifying as a gender which matches your biological sex (e.g. a woman who was born female)
* Non-binary - a person whose gender identity doesn't fit cleanly into the categories of male and female
* Intersex - someone who is biologically neither male nor female
* Gender dysphoria - a feeling of extreme distress (experienced by many but not all trans people) which is caused by one's body not lining up with their gender identity, and by not being seen as their gender identity
* Gender euphoria - the opposite of gender dysphoria. It's a feeling of extreme comfort and happiness caused by being seen as one's gender identity, and by presenting as their gender identity
* Biological sex - what someone physically is (e.g. a biological male has XY chromosomes and a penis)
* Gender identity - what someone feels like they are. It often matches their biological sex but it doesn't have to
* Gender presentation/expression - how someone shows their gender through what they look like. (e.g. a feminine-presenting person might wear dresses and skirts, have long hair, and wear make-up) It often matches their gender identity and/or biological sex but doesn't have to
* Transitioning - the steps a trans person might take to live as their gender identity (e.g. changing their name, getting gender-affirming surgeries etc.)
* Deadname - the name a trans person was given at birth
* Misgendering - the act of deliberately using the incorrect gendered terms to refer to a trans person (e.g. referring to your trans daughter as your son). This includes using the wrong pronouns on a trans person
* Transphobia - the act of discriminating against transgender people
* Assigned gender at birth (AGAB) - another word for biological sex
* Assigned female at birth (AFAB) - another word for biologically female
* Assigned male at birth (AMAB) - another word for biologically male
* Assigned intersex at birth (AIAB/AXAB) - another word for intersex

&#x200B;

***3. Use their new name and pronouns***

In our society, names and pronouns are typically gendered - when you see someone called Sarah, you'll think of a woman, and when you see someone named John, you'll think of a man. Because of this, trans people's birth names often cause them a lot of distress, because of the gendered connotations of names. Most trans people change their names to one that better fits their gender.

You should respect your trans child's new name (if they change their name), no matter how strange it is for you to use a different name after all these years of using their deadname. You'll most likely mess up at first, but don't make a big deal out of it - simply apologise and thank your kid for correcting you (if they do).

Please don't say ""it's so hard for me, I've known you as \[deadname\] for so long"" or something similar. It might feel weird for you at first, but you don't stay up all night crying because saying their new name feels wrong. For trans people, having their deadname used is immensely painful, and yes, (some) trans people do stay up all night crying because their deadname feels so wrong. No matter how hard it is for you to get used to using their new name, it's a million times harder for your kid to have to hear people call them their deadname day after day.

If you're talking to your child about their deadname, don't actually say the name - just refer to it as ""your deadname"", ""your old name"" etc. Even just hearing the name without it being associated with them is still often painful.

Trans people often use different pronouns than the ones associated with their birth gender. Again, you should respect this. If you wouldn't call a cis boy a ""she"", why would you call a trans boy a ""she""? Just like with names, having their birth pronouns used causes a lot of distress for a trans person.

However, pronouns don't equal gender. They are usually associated with gender, but at the end of the day, they're just words. Even if your kid's pronouns aren't what you would expect someone of that gender to use, you should still use them. This also applies for names, too - a trans girl might choose a more masculine name, and that's okay too.

&#x200B;

***4. Ask them what you can do to support them***

You're their parent. You can do a lot to help them, and you will often be the first person they look to for help. This also applies to transitioning - since they're a minor, there are many things they can't do without parental consent.

One of the first things you should do when they come out to you is ask them how you can support them in their transitioning journey. Is there anything you can buy them? Any appointments you can drive them to? A good thing to do is ask them to write a checklist of every step in transitioning they would like to do. These could be anything from a haircut to bottom surgery. Next, ask them to select some steps which are realistically achievable in the near future. Then, ask them if there are any things you need to do which would allow them to complete those steps. These are often simple, affordable things - such as buying your non-binary child a binder, or buying your trans son some masculine clothes.

Helping your child to transition will improve their mental health, reduce dysphoria, and make them happier overall.

A common thing that parents have against transitioning is that they feel their child's transition is moving too fast. One word: no. It's their gender. It's their life. It's their transition. Who cares if they're 8 or if they're 28? Obviously there are things that have to wait until they're older, like hormone therapy. But why would you let your child consider slitting their wrists because you won't buy them gender-affirming clothes since they're ""transitioning too fast""?

&#x200B;

***5. Accept that it's not a phase***

Your transgender child isn't going to get bored of being trans. It isn't a trend. They aren't copying their friends. They don't just want attention. It's who they are. You shouldn't mourn the loss of your cisgender kid - they're not dead. Instead, you should embrace who they are now - this more authentic version of themself.

Don't dismiss their feelings by claiming it's something everyone experiences. ""Everyone hates their body when they're that age!"" Not everyone tears apart the skin on their arms because they're stuck in the wrong body and they can't do anything about it. ""I was a tomboy too when I was younger."" You didn't cry yourself to sleep because you were a boy forced to live as a girl. ""It's just a hormones thing, you'll get over it."" Mood swings are a hormones thing. Excruciatingly painful gender dysphoria isn't.

(These aren't universal trans experiences, just examples to show the suffering trans people go through.)

&#x200B;

***6. Use gender neutral language***

Even if your child isn't non-binary, you still have no excuse for saying ""he or she"". It's more effort to say ""men and women"" than ""people"". You're denying millions of people's existence by saying ""brothers and sisters"". Being inclusive of non-binary people isn't that hard.

&#x200B;

***7. Listen to them***

As much as you will never be able to understand what they go through, it can be helpful to have someone to talk to. Listen to them if they're ranting about the transphobic popular girls at school who make fun of them. Listen to them if they need to talk to someone about how much they hate their chest. Listen to them if they confess to you that they're struggling with their mental health. Being trans is stressful. They will need a shoulder to cry on sometimes, and you're that shoulder.

Find out what they are and aren't comfortable being called. Change how you talk about them if something you're saying hurts them. Be as supportive as you can be, because you love them."		uye886	trans	20	0.91	2022-05-26 18:34:27
My first wedding as a woman	"Hi, cuties! Just want to share something. A month ago a workmate invited me to his wedding. Well, he doesn‚Äôt know that I‚Äôm a trans woman bc I haven‚Äôt came out yet at work, but I hope there won‚Äôt be any problem with him when I came out (at least not because of my transition). So‚Ä¶. If everything goes right I‚Äôll have my first wedding as I really are in November and just by thinking it I get so exited! I mean, to find dresses, look for best make up,  taking care of my figure till the day, etc‚Ä¶ all these things drives me crazy! 
Any advice or similar experiences?"	"Oh, fun!  I dream of being a bridesmaid someday!
Hell I'd be excited to attend a babby shower
As a bride, less than a week away, I‚Äôd definitely not stall longer than necessary to tell him. It could impact their wedding count etc, if they go all transphobe on you."	src34e	trans	21	0.9	2022-02-13 06:26:06
My boyfriend outed me at work	"So to give some backstory rq, ive known my bf for 4 years. We met freshman year and were still together in our senior year. Hes non binary and queer himself. I am a transman who has only been out to friends for abt a month now. Ive only slightly transitioned physically (binder and a haircut basically) and the way i dress is pretty gender neutral. 

So into what happened, me and my boyfriend got a job at a local pizza hut together. Im friends with one of the managers (who is also a trans man) so i was able to get me and my boyfriend hired together at the same place. Its been about 2 weeks and so far everythings gone smoothly. Weve gotten along rlly well with everyone and the works been really easy. But today everything kinda changed. It was really towards closing so i sat down to take a break. I get on my phone and i can hear one of the shift leads call my boyfriend over. Its not a very big store so while sitting in the dining room i can hear the convo from the kitchen window. He calls my bf over and is rlly calm and chill and goes ""hey man, what's your girlfriend's pronouns? Are they a girl or boy? What should i call them?"" My shift lead is a rlly cool guy and honestly i dont care if he knows im trans. But right next to him was an extremely homophobic and transphobic manager whos been extremely nasty to my friend who is one of the other managers there. And without hesitation, my boyfriend outs me to the entire restaurant. While my coworkers and shift lead is cool, a few of the people there are like not friendly ppl at all and they definitely heard him. He told them my name, pronouns and that i was trans. I was so gutted, i dont think it was his place at all to do that. And as a queer couple weve talked about not outing eachother to ppl we dont know or havent approved of knowing. He didnt have any bad intentions doing it but i feel so crushed and honestly terrified of going back to work. My transition has been going so good so far and weve both been really happy abt it but this kind of put a huge dent in everything. Im scared people at work are going to be upset and ill have to quit or detransition to fit in."	"I think you should have another chat with your boyfriend and see where he was coming from. After you get his point of view act accordingly depending on how you still feel after the conversation. I wish you two the best of luck. I‚Äôm so sorry that happened.
That‚Äôs rough, I‚Äôm sorry that happened.  I totally know how it feels too.  My wife told her family I was going to transition MTF before I told literally anyone else and after I told her I wanted to tell people in my own time.  She did it from a good place (to show me I would have their support) but it was still painful to be outed before I was ready.  I did forgive her right away because she‚Äôs the love of my life and I would always forgive her.  I suggest you do the same for your BF.  What‚Äôs done is done,  no reason to hold grudges.  Forgiving those we love is the best way to keep them near us.

Don‚Äôt be one of those people that brings up every little past slight in fights and arguments.  I had a former roommate that did that and it was fucking awful and made me leave.
I‚Äôm not a relationship professional but I think you should tell your boyfriend that what he did was absolutely disgusting. Or however you want to put it. I personally hate the idea of being outed and if anyone dared do that to me, positive or negative intentions, I‚Äôd tell them off (in private). It doesn‚Äôt matter that much that he meant well. Intentions do NOT equal decision. He should‚Äôve stopped at your gender and pronouns because being transgender is nobodys business but yours and whoever you deem fit to know
Outing a trans person without their consent is incredibly disrespectful and potentially dangerous.  It‚Äôs a massive breach of trust that would make me seriously reconsider being associated with that person at all.  

There‚Äôs a lot of hate and transphobia out there.  In this instance your boyfriend may have cost you your job.  In another instance it might get you beaten up.  Or even killed.

Being trans isn‚Äôt an issue"	qr9iyv	trans	22	0.97	2021-11-11 01:28:00
Where i‚Äôm at in this process	"(Some samples of negative mental voices in here)

AMAB. For a while now I‚Äôve had this thought pop up in my head from time to time. ‚ÄúYa know, self, you‚Äôve never really liked your gender. You‚Äôve always thought of it as something foisted upon you. Resented that even. Ever considered that you might be trans?‚Äù And I‚Äôd smile and nod. ‚ÄúGood thought, self, there are some solid points there and it warrants more consideration‚Äù and I‚Äôd put the topic aside and merrily go about my life for a while until it popped up again.

A few days ago it was cold outside and I was bitching about it to an online friend when she responded with something like ‚ÄúGirl, go get a sweater!‚Äù. She doesn‚Äôt know me in real life, I don‚Äôt have any pictures of my face online, and I choose not to display my gender. She might not even know that I present male and so this wasn‚Äôt a joke, I was being mis-gendered. But my reaction to being mis-gendered was not neutral, it was positive. Being referred to as a girl somehow felt good. ‚ÄúHey self, why does this feel good?‚Äù . . . ‚ÄúOH, FUCK ME‚Äù Then a bomb went off inside my head.

Since then I‚Äôve been a wreck. I‚Äôve read enough at this point to realize that the resulting panic is pretty normal. Such as ‚ÄúOh my god, this can't be happening. This can't be real. You can‚Äôt be serious. Stop. Just stop it.‚Äù One part of my brain basically running a slideshow of memories of all the things I‚Äôve said, done, or thought that point towards my being trans. The other half of my brain reacting to every word from the first with pitchforks, torches, and crying sessions. In an attempt to resolve the conflict I even started logging them to a spreadsheet. First column: things that point to me being trans. Second column: place for reactionary brain to get out it‚Äôs panicking, venting, and curse words. Third column: arguments that I‚Äôm not trans. I don‚Äôt know if it helped but either way this turns out for me, that spreadsheet is going to be a very amusing read later in life.

And of course the doubts of if this is even real or i‚Äôm just losing it. But if there was no validity to the idea i might want to change my gender, then why am I freaking out. If i‚Äôm not trans, then why won‚Äôt this thought let me go. Why would I be losing sleep over this, and why is there a civil war going on inside my head.

One of the biggest hang ups i‚Äôve had is that so much of the narrative around transitioning, at least from the outside, is ‚Äòbecoming who you really are‚Äô and ‚Äòleaving your old self behind‚Äô. That being trans is going to change _everything_ and you should be happy about it. But even if you‚Äôre not happy with your current life, that is a massive bucket of anomie to dump on someone. There is a fear that things won‚Äôt be better, sure, but there is also a (to me, greater) fear of losing yourself along the way. That who you are will no longer be recognizable in who you are to become.

But there is a response to that which shows up in basically every thread, it just took a while to get through to me. I don‚Äôt actually have to do anything about these feelings. That its OK to feel them and act or not act on them as I choose. That i could say, ‚ÄúI really love low color saturation and that‚Äôs not manly but so what fuck you‚Äù, and still also say ‚ÄúYou know what, eyeliner is really just too much right now. No, I don‚Äôt want to do that‚Äù

I still don‚Äôt know what trans is or what it means on a personal level. I still don‚Äôt know. And part of me is still calling this whole thing an absurd dream that I will wake up from at some point. I do know I‚Äôll try experimenting with clothing a bit. Maybe dig up my good looking earrings and nail polish.* But that‚Äôs it. That‚Äôs all. I‚Äôve done more for a Rocky Horror showing than just that. But then it was a ‚Äògame‚Äô and this time its real. Does this make me trans? No, maybe, but mostly who cares. If I like it then i‚Äôll keep doing it. If I don‚Äôt then I‚Äôll stop. If I want to do more I‚Äôll do more. What label people want to put on that doesn‚Äôt really matter right now. That word is no longer a threat to me.

As a bit of an aside, I think the trans community can improve how it deals with prior selves. Deadnames, dead identities, that prior selves are dead. I understand why people think and why people feel that way. I understand that for some people that is explicitly the point, or is a lynchpin in how you think about transitioning. And I‚Äôm not objecting. But at least for me and perhaps people like me, I need to be able to draw a contiguous line from who I was, to who I am, to where I‚Äôm going. So if trans is the way i‚Äôm going, and I don‚Äôt know that yet, then the current me doesn‚Äôt have to die to get there.

Just change a little.

Lots of your experiences and feelings will resonate with most mtf's perhaps in a different timescale and in a different order but ""excuse me ma'am"" really does make one tingle all over as it seems you're likely to be experiencing more often quite soon. Love your sense of humor and love 'Contact' tooüòÄ
I just want to take a moment to say that your description of the ""oh fuck"" moment, and the ensuing chaos in your mind...Were precisely how I felt. 

I had my ""oh fuck"" moment when I was 19, and I immediately internalized and outright denied it. And for years, it slowly killed me.

Four years ago, I had resigned myself to come out and accept it. But it took me until this past October to fully accept it.

Give yourself some time, and try not to deny the path that feels right.

I'm still very early in my transition and one of my big pre acceptance fears was firmly centered on my mental identity, what was me, what was performative due to my lived male gender role, what was a coping mechanism, etc... There was a worry there that I was a complete cipher, a non-person, that when I took away everything that had been built that there was no core to my personality, and little to nothing on which to build a new identity.

I'm not going to say that I have untangled every piece if myself, heavens no. I have not examined at length every component, past thought, and behavior. However, I don't think I'm going to need to. Surprisingly it has been a non-issue. As I remove those things that I know are, or come to understand as artifice, there is plenty of me that actually feels like me that comes shining through. It's a surprising, joyful, and natural process of self discovery.

I don't know if my experience is universal or even common, but I hope my perspective helps.
Thank you! I also like the name Ellie, but I made a mistake. 'small moves ellie' is a resonant movie quote and I've edited the post to make that clear.

It also really helps me to know that people really feel the same. And Claire is a super cute name as well :>
I saw that movie five times in theaters as a kid. 
Thanks for sharing your experience.
Oh shit sorry. I was just trying to be nice and call you by your name cause it always makes me happy when people do the same for me. I‚Äôll edit my post too. My movie knowledge has failed me today. Guess I have to watch contact now, it has been sitting next to my tv for a while. Anyway I‚Äôm rambling.

 Glad I could help. Reading and sharing stories means so much to me but never forget even if it were just you feeling that way it wouldn‚Äôt make your feelings any less valid. Just be the you that you want to be. 
This is me as well, going through this process since ~Christmas Day. All I have to say is: 1, yes, there's evidently heaps of us who are going through this; and 2, do not ignore it. Seriously. I still can't confirm that what I'm feeling is dysphoria but every day I get more certain internally that it's real and it's the reason behind all my neuroticism throughout life. So just don't push it back down and try to ignore it - I've realised I already did that 4 years ago, and I can't imagine where I would be now if I'd gotten help then. Whatever's going to come out of it, it's obviously something worth resolving, and if you pretend it's not real it's evidently just going to stick around. Small moves, *definitely*, but don't let it get away.

An old lady trying to be nice derailed my day and I disdain what it's doing to me	"I live in a liberal city. There is no fear presenting in public; everyone is an ally or at least has to pretend to be. I am just over a year into hormones and there have definitely been a lot of positive physical changes. Unfortunately, I'm 12 laser sessions deep and have maybe seen a 30-40% reduction in facial hair. I don't know if it's hormones. I just started at a new laser place that was a lot more painful so I'm hoping that does more, but for now I've just accepted my fate. I have very dark facial hair and I'm pale as hell so it's really noticeable. On top of that, I just have some masculine facial traits. But it is what it is, I'm not going to hide from the public over it. Generally, really happy with how I look and act now, and I'm trying to lean into seeking the positives instead of berating the negatives.

Today I'm at brunch with a few friends. Towards the end, an older woman walked up to me, patted me on the back and said ""you're so brave"". I was appalled immediately, but just politely said ""thank you"" and moved on. She did not. She kept going on about how one of her friends transitioned and was so happy. I am dead inside roughly 45 seconds into this experience. My best friend is trying to shoo her away politely to no avail. Eventually it mercifully ended, and I proceeded to hop in the car and bawl on my way to the store. I am a grown adult letting someone who was just trying to be nice destroy my weekend.

I refuse to ask for help generally. I've had similar experiences before, but it's starting to hurt a lot the further in I am. So now, because I push away any self care I could be doing, I am berating myself because I *didn't say anything*. Not because it would have made me feel better; quite the opposite, that would have made me super uncomfortable. But now I'm worried that because I didn't say anything, there is a poor future tran girl who is going to have to deal with it because this woman thinks what she did was okay. 

This is just one example of backhanded stuff that happens. I'm tired of people saying they think I'm strong or brave. No, living as a cis male would have killed me; this is survival. I marked this as vent, I'm not really seeking any resolution. Just hoping there's a board of people here who can commiserate with me because it sucked, I'm tired of it, and it may be something that happens forever."	"God OP I'm sorry.  That sort of thoughtlessness hurts almost more than actual hate sometimes, and like.  Shit.  Maybe you don't want to be brave.  People say this about all sorts of groups - trans people, cancer patients, whatever, and it's thoughtless every time.  Nobody's ""brave"" just for trying to *live*, and it just comes off as... Othering?  They only think it's brave because they can't imagine being in your shoes, you're a curiosity to them, and they never *think* about how overt that is when you're on the receiving end.

I'm sorry that happened to you OP.  I hope your day gets better from here."	115yfv6	trans	23	1.0	2023-02-19 01:55:26
A slightly positive experience of someone not knowing how to talk to trans people	"So yesterday my uncles and I (a trans woman) went out to eat at a Japanese place. I'm at the point with my transition where I either pass or people are confused about my gender, I just haven't been misgendered in a while basically (today is actually my one year hrt anniversary!) 

Anyway, the manager was taking care of us for the most part and she was super nice n everything. Towards the end she comes up to the table and says ""So we all can't tell if you are a boy or a girl but we decided it didn't really matter because you are stunningly beautiful. Like seriously. You have the eyes of everyone in the room and it's crazy. You're just so pretty ""

I didn't really know how to respond especially because of the first part so I just awkwardly said thank you. Then I looked over to see that practically the whole resteraunt staff is just standing over there staring at me. She definitely could've just left the first part out and told me that I was pretty but I guess I'll take it? People are weird. When I got up to leave everyone was still just staring at me as I was walking out. I felt uncomfortable because I don't like when people stare at me at all, but at least it was for a good reason?"

My name is Cassie	"And I've finally come out to myself.  I'm 34 AMAB with a wife and two kids, but for as long as I can remember, I have wished I had been born female.  Every time I thought about it, I reasoned about why I wasn't trans or why I shouldn't act on it -- ""I can't be trans, I'm attracted to women"" or ""how would I explain it to the people I care about, or the people I work with?"" or ""You're not trans, you don't have dysphoria."" or (trigger warning) >!""Even if you transition, you'll never be a real woman.""!< And I'd push those thoughts away and keep living life as a man.  And, even though it wasn't ideal, I could live with it, I told myself.

In my teens, I was a goth kid, and that gave me the excuse to wear makeup and nail polish without much additional grief from anyone because I was dressing like a weirdo anyway.  But looking at my beautiful hands, tipped with shiny polish, I felt something fantastic that I didn't have the words for (I now know it to be gender euphoria).

And on a a couple of occasions after high school, I attended parties in skimpy ladies' clothing ""ironically."" You know, as a joke, right? Ha ha, so funny and edgy! But secretly, I felt beautiful.

Once I met my wife, I pretty much put aside any notions of outwardly living life as a woman, but the thoughts remained.  I might not think about it for months at a time, but eventually something would remind me, and I'd have the same conversation with myself -- if only I could be a woman, but here's all the reasons I can't.

This past week, the feelings returned. And for reasons which are not entirely clear to me, this time, the conversation went differently -- ""Trans woman can be lesbians!"" and ""Who fucking cares what society thinks?"" and ""Trans women ARE real women.""

So I decided to look for stories similar to mine, which is how I discovered this subreddit, and I was not disappointed. I see so many stories here that echo my experience so far, or people asking the same questions I have, and getting replies that give me the clarity I need.

In the past week, I've learned that you don't need gender dysphoria to be trans, that gender euphoria (what I've experienced) is a very real thing that many other trans folks have experienced, and that cisgender men generally don't spend time fantasizing about being women.

Thanks in no small part to this subreddit, I have gathered all the evidence I needed to make this simple statement: I am trans.

Until yesterday, my desire to be female was my deepest, darkest secret.  Yesterday, I said those words out loud to my best friend, and she was so supportive and amazing. And it was cathartic. Words can't convey the joy I felt (and am still feeling) having shared this secret with another human being who listened thoughtfully and told me no matter what I look like on the outside, she loves me for who I am on the inside, and that will never change.

I know not every interaction will be so joyous.  I still have to tell my wife, and I'm absolutely terrified.  It has the very real potential to dissolve my marriage.  I can't in good conscience ask her to stay married to a woman any more than she has any right to ask me to continue being someone I'm not.  Once I let the genie out of the bottle, I'm absolutely powerless to what happens next. I have a long, difficult journey ahead, and I hope to have her by my side.

Thanks for reading,

Cassie"	"Hey Cassie! Your post only just got on new. I'm sorry you had to wait so long, the mods must have had to verify it or something.
Well this was a lonely first few hours in the trans community üò¢
It's so good to read your story,  and so good to meet you Cassie. 
Many things I find familiar... the lack of dysphoria (most of the time), the chances taken to dress up as female and make light of it, whilst actually feeling the most euphoria ever!.
I'm so happy for you that you have taken this first step and I hope that the future for you is full of happiness and joy. And love.  X
It‚Äôs lovely to meet you (166 days after you posted this :p)

I found your story, after creating my alt today, by search for ‚Äútelling my wife‚Äù in this subreddit. 

I‚Äôm struck by the similarity with your story. We‚Äôre similar and age and situation. I just wanted to say thank you for putting this out there. It‚Äôs encouraging to see. I saw you‚Äôd posted about telling your wife, how have things been since then? That was an extremely courageous thing to do!

Congrats!! So happy for you; your story sounds very similar to mind (I just came out about two weeks ago).
I wish you the very best. I have been where you are and it is challenging. It is hard but these feelings progressively get more intense and so does the suffering. You will feel better once you take the steps to let your self shine through. I am pulling for you.
Hey Cassie, welcome to the familyü§ó
When I created my alt, multiple trans subreddits had holds on posts and comments from new accounts. I imagine this is to reduce abuse from transphobic parts of Reddit trying to be shitty while still hiding their identities behind fresh throwaways.
Yeah I messaged a mod about it who explained the situation, as it's a brand new account I made solely to talk about being trans.
I have had a similar experience to yours, especially the excuses I made why I wasn't trans, and not fully grasping what it meant to begin with. I just recently came out to my wife and it went well. I hope you find what you have been missing and I am so happy for you
Thank you, Emma!  It's weird re-reading this post, because I've come so far since then, and honestly in a fairly short time.  I'm out to a whole bunch more people, and once I know I won't be leaving the house again, I'm in girl mode, head to toe.  I've got plans to start HRT by year's end (whether that happens is a different story).  This post is such a good snapshot of me as I was just emerging from my egg.  Thanks for sparking this trip down memory lane.  Have a fantastic day :)
Hi Kenzi!

Thanks for reading and for the comment. Things have been shaky. We had a really rocky summer, and there was a low point where neither of us trusted the other, but we've had some frank conversations since then, and emotions have cool a lot. We just had our first couples counseling session this week, which I think brought more understanding. We've still got a long way to go before we're back to where we were, but I think there's still a chance for a future together.

-Cassie
Thanks. Since coming out to myself, I've already experienced a bit of what I'm guessing is gender dysphoria. A lot of masculine terms applied to me have started feeling like nails on a chalk board, and the beard on my face that grew out of laziness suddenly looks and feels disgusting. On the other hand, I feel like a wall that had been built up around me my entire life has been torn down, if that makes any sense. Like, having finally accepted who I am, I'm more free to think and feel things that I would have avoided previously, that feels really therapeutic.
Thank you!!
That makes sense. It's a shame that's how it has to be.
Yes I just saw it as your last post.  It's an amazing journey and things do seem to happen so fast. I can't believe how much I have changed looking back at my posts and photos and all since January. 

I'm really keen to follow your journey, and see what life has in store.  All the very best you you.  X"	ni7kgt	trans	21	0.96	2021-05-22 01:15:48
Happy Transgender Day of Visibility!	"Today is the first Transgender Day of Visibility where I get to walk among my community and be seen as who I am.

Last year I shed my cloak of camouflage that hid me from everyone and presented them with the false person I was encouraged to be for my entire life.  I had to hide, so I would fit in and not be targeted by hateful people and legislation that would prevent me from not just succeeding but potentially from even being able to stay alive.

In June 2021 so many things just came together and I knew that I could hide no more.  I needed to free myself of this prison that was partly self-imposed and also partly imposed by society.  This was not an easy task but, as compared to some, it went a lot smoother than anticipated, at first.

As most know, shortly after cracking my egg and coming out to my family and community I found myself in the global spotlight after confronting a local bigot.  This was before I had started on any hormone therapy and before even getting my first therapy session to start the medical transition process.  I needed to do what I did though, I could not stand by while this vile person spewed hate into our community that targeted the core of who I am.  This did put me in the cross-hairs of the right-wing hate engine and that is a very scary place to be, but I would do it all over again.  The result was that our community became much more aware of the hate and bigotry that had been allowed to fester for so long.

There are parts of my story that are unique but so many that are shared among the Transgender community.

I feel very fortunate. When I made the decision to come out there were members of our community that were ready to help me.  My family was also accepting and happy that I decided to shed a burden that has plagued me for 45 years.

There is so much more to say, and I hope to share more in the future.  Today, I want to send a message:

To everyone that is Trans, whether you are out or not, I see you and I love who you are.  You deserve to be seen and accepted for who you are and I will never lose hope that one day the need for hiding will no longer exist.

You do have a community and people that care about you and will fight for your rights.

I need advice for being an mtf	"

Back on February 27th i came home from a birthday party of one of my friends. When I got home I saw that my closet door was open and my girl clothes were thrown all over the floor I am mtf for context. My parents come in and have a conversation with me about if I am gay or transgender I wanted to keep myself safe since they are very against that lifestyle. I won‚Äôt go into all the details because I don‚Äôt want to relive it and writing this is painful enough. They take my phone, computer, switch, and playstation. They say that there gonna ground me for the time being. A week 
later my parents sat me down and told me that they found out I was transgender. They told me I‚Äôll forever be there son and nothing else. Told me I was making a huge mistake and a bunch of other hurtful things. They prayed over me to take it out of me and said that they‚Äôre would be serious changes from henceforth. They cut off all contact with all my friends and I can‚Äôt see them cause we go to different schools. Changed my therapist from one I liked to a Christian therapist who is not right for me. They also kept saying that I have no friends and that everyone will leave me and abandon me except my family. My friends had no way of contacted me so there was no way they could comfort me. My family said that if they truly wanted me they would be there for me and talk to me. I tired telling my sister but my sister just said ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre not my kid so it‚Äôs not my problem.‚Äù She went ahead and told my parents what I told her which is just what happened and they told me to stop manipulating her onto my side by lying and breaking trust. Fast forward a month to March 26th and they sit me down and have another conversation they say that they‚Äôve decided I‚Äôm not ready for college and are transferring me to a different one. I will not say the name but the college is through the church we go to which is a mega church in the area. They do not offer anything but one degree and it‚Äôs not even in the field I want. It‚Äôs church ministry and I want to be a graphic designer/illustrator. I had already signed up for practically everything for the college at that point but I had to do what they said. For reference they are paying for my college. They said other hurtful things and made me repent while I was sobbing. I begged for death that night from God. Sadly nothing came and months passed. It‚Äôs now the tail end of May and I got my phone back but my parents went through all my messages and saw I was talking to my friends again. They think they made me this way because they are messed up and wrong in the head. They block all numbers on my phone except my families. I‚Äôve truly lost all hope on transitioning I don‚Äôt want to be trans anymore. My friends have left me to rot alone in this prison cell. No one cares my parents monitor my phone and have devices on it that tracks my activity. I am 18 but can‚Äôt move out my family has made it adamant that family will be forever and I will break there hearts if I go. I can‚Äôt do college on my own I presented the idea and my plane but they said it was impossible and extremely hard. They were right. I‚Äôm still grounded I have no internet capability on my phone but I have a VPN to get around that. I got my car back too but I have to tell them where I am going at all times. I‚Äôm still grounded from my laptop, switch, and playstation. I‚Äôm not allowed to talk or see my friends ever again. They also took me off the health insurance now that I‚Äôm 18. And my dad has said that if I go away with the car or the phone he will call the cops on me and have me charged with theft. I don‚Äôt mean to ramble and complain I just need to get this off my chest. My life is completely miserable I have nothing and no one. What I plan on doing is going to the church college for two years and then going on to finish my bachelor degree of possible. I know I want to transition and become who I truly am but I can‚Äôt not with my family. They‚Äôve made it clear through gaslighting, manipulation, and other tactics that I can‚Äôt. I want to be happy and not upset them but I can‚Äôt be happy unless I am a girl. My friends and my old therapist both agree that my parents are emotionally abusive and also domesticity. I don‚Äôt see it though but that‚Äôs probably some stockholm syndrome. I don‚Äôt know what to do I‚Äôve fully given up at this point. Does anyone have any advice fellow trans people who have experienced similar things. Or other people I will be posting to multiple subreddits. At this point I don‚Äôt want to be trans anymore it‚Äôs too scary and I‚Äôve been scarred."	"So, the car they have some claim to if it‚Äôs in their name. The phone however, was a gift and can‚Äôt be called on. You need to leave. Plain and simple. You need to get out of there. You are 18. You are legally an adult. They can‚Äôt go through your stuff unless you let them. 

Ask your parents to go to a store or something. Ask people to borrow their phone. Go to a library and use the computers to send an email to someone. Get your friends phone numbers. Something. That way you can head to places and use their phones. Call your friends, make a plan, leave with a small bag of your belongings and take off. If your parents want the phone so bad just leave it. If you have any money I suggest a burner phone for like 20 bucks. 

From there, start to find work and work your way through school and start your life.

I‚Äôm gonna be honest. My parents spout that same crap. But I had a solid group of friends with me. When I came out (honestly too late imo) I had already organized a place to live and had all the necessary precautions done before I told them and left. That is an incredibly toxic environment. They won‚Äôt ever listen to you and will guilt you your entire life. And worst of all you‚Äôll believe you were in the wrong. 

If this is who you are, then be you. It‚Äôs not an easy journey. But with no insurance, no income, no car, no phone, and no understanding from them you don‚Äôt have any real reason to stay other than it‚Äôs the easiest path to just conform and keep your head down.
It‚Äôs probably been said and if not I‚Äôm going to say it (pardon my French): ‚ÄúFUCK YOUR FAMILY‚Äù
Family is not forever in that situation. You do need out, but you need to plan carefully. If you have to leave the car, the phone, do so. College is possible with student loans and grants, but it puts you in debt. Still it would be 1000s in your pocket now and a possible place to stay like a dorm. Do not go to college through the church, that is a con and not a real education. Go to a real college, or a university. Get a job at a grocery shop or thrift shop, even fast food. Them paying for an education in religion as something you do not want to do will destroy your life. You need to get away from them asap.
Do you have any friends or family that are not in this cult like situation?
Hi OP. I looked for some resources for you. 
It depends on what country you live in but here are resources that can be followed.

If you have a trusted friend, who is most likely trying to get into contact with you even if you don‚Äôt know it, message them using something like what‚Äôs app or google voice.  Ask if you can use their address to send mail to. 
Get a job if you can. Save, apply for government insurance. Get the fuck out of there and live your life. 

You‚Äôll maybe be homeless and risk it more while trying to escape or be independent. Follow the steps in the link. 

https://endhomelessness.org/how-to-get-help-experiencing-homelssness/

You can get a post box at the post office  by applying for one if you‚Äôre homeless and then get a government phone for free sent there.

There are may be free and discounted mental health services in your area too.

Also here‚Äôs info on blocked numbers

And this is for abuse it has help on staying safe.

So if i take what you are saying at face value. You are 18 and still being grounded? That's the first one. Two your 18 and you parents have this much control over you? Something is not right here. Seriously not right. 
College. There is no time limit on college. Sure its easier at 18 but there is nothing stopping you form doing that at 21 or older. I have met plenty of people who are working full-time and putting themselves through college. Probably do better being a little older anyway. So drop out of college. Two. You have shoes and back pack. Find somewhere else to go and live, a grand mother, an uncle and aunte. At a friend's house. I shared a bedroom with my best friend for like 8 months before and i have had a friend move in with me before, twice actually . For now transitioning is not on the table. Hard to accept i know. But it's not out of the question. If nothing else. You are 18 and can legally join the army. Its a way out of this situation at the very least. And they will pay for college and may help with the whole transition and get you out of that very strange situation. If that is out of the question i can bet there is a crisis center you can go to. Walk into any ER and say you are suicidal and have a plan. They will call someone to talk to you and evaluate the situation. This is where you can at the very least get information, even of they don't believe you you can tell them this story and will give you a direction to look into. Even if they call your parents in. You have the right to not let them in and the hospital has a legal responsibility and the security to make that happen. Walk into any police station and ask them. They will give you information. Any homeless shelter will give you information.   

Either way. If i take what you said at face value. You are 18 and your parents have that much control over you? Something is not right at all. If you said you 14 or 15 maybe But 18. Basically when exactly are you going to live your life?
They see transgenderism as a corruption that has come from outside influences when in fact it's something innate that comes from within.

I know you want to keep your family happy, but you can't do that and also transition. And you'll never be happy until you transition. I have lots of friends who have been in similar situations and the answer is always always cutting off the family.

They can either accept you as you are or they can't have you, and it's their loss. 

Get out of there. You have a car, you're an adult, you can make your own choices. You don't even have to tell them where you've gone.
Know that I‚Äôve got that off my chest. Here is my more helpful advice.

Primary: Get out of your parents house as soon as you can. 

If you are a legal adult, you can do whatever you want that is Legal in the eyes of the law. You may still be financially dependent on your parents but that does not change the fact that you are legally an adult and you get to make up your own mind. Your parents may think anything you are going to do it a ‚Äúmistake‚Äù but they can‚Äôt stop you from doing what you want.

While military life is not for everyone, in this case I highly recommend trying to join the military as a Male and as more guidance comes out you could have an opportunity to transition in the military to female. (I have 14 years in the Navy and I just realized I‚Äôm a Transwoman; I‚Äôm slowly going to start engaging the correct people to look into transitioning). 

Why do I still recommend the military option? For a few reasons, #1 it will get you out of your parents house with in the next six to twelve months. #2 the military will give you the basic necessities of life; food and shelter and a steady paycheck. #3 can get you as far away from your hometown as you want. And finally #4 which is the icing on top (and isn‚Äôt the only reason to join the military) but after about four years you will have served enough time to get 100% funding under the 9/11 GI Bill which you can use to either fully fund or partially fund your dream educational program for Graphic Design. There are other reasons I can give you why this is an least an option to seriously consider but I don‚Äôt want to forget the fact the the military will give you Free Health Care and it covers just about everything (minus things like non-medical plastic surgery or any type of Gender Reassignment Surgery); but does cover Hormone Replacement Therapy when you are able to transition. 

As I said I‚Äôm in the US Navy, and if I were to choose a branch to go into I‚Äôd lean towards the Navy or the Air Force. There are many different career fields in the military but since you like graphic design I‚Äôd talk with a recruiter about going into the Mass Communication Specialist (MC) rate in the Navy or a similar Public Affairs job specialist rating in the Air Force. 

If I were you, I‚Äôd honestly ask your parents for the car to go to the ‚ÄúLibrary‚Äù and then make a stop at your local recruitment offices in your town for the Navy and Air Force and talk with them and get more information. Then after you make a stop, go to the Library and use the Library to research more about the military (look up the Physical Fitness requirements and start to workout so that you can pass them); look at some of the other links provided in this thread and look at other avenues to get out of your parents house.

If you want to talk more about life in the military and other benefits, please let me know. 

I wish you the best. And remember this that your true family isn‚Äôt always the ones we are related to by blood but the ones who we choose to be part of our own lives and love us and care for us just the way we are.
i agree it‚Äôs not a university it‚Äôs a cult and i‚Äôm terrified of going but i‚Äôm gonna stay strong to my morals and not be influenced by them. they think that these thoughts will just go away after i go there but they won‚Äôt. and i‚Äôll tell them that there still there and i‚Äôm there daughter not their son and i hope they accept it. thank you i wish i could give you a hug cause i need one
i have no communication with any friends they all love 30 miles away and my entire family is like this sadly

Starting Testosterone	"With a tiny bit of luck and a lot of patience i might be lucky enough to go on T soon. 

  
Now, i was hoping to find: some advice, someone to bombard with a shitton of questions, or fellow trans folks who take the same (or a similar) journey to befriend with.   
If you care to share, i'd appreciate it a lot. After all: Some steps of transitioning can feel very kafkaesque; thus some caring comrades would make everything a little less scrary :)

I feel like I‚Äôm dying all the time	I‚Äôve had dysphoria since I was at least 13. When I went into college five years ago I really started to play around with my gender and was on the brink of starting hrt, but I basically accepted that I couldn‚Äôt handle the social pressure and paranoia I experienced as a result of transitioning. At this point I‚Äôve just kinda turned myself off and try to enjoy just staying physically healthy and trying to improve myself as a person, but every time I see myself in the mirror or a reflection I want to break down and cry or just disappear. Dating is a nightmare, nobody wants a gentle caring ‚Äúman‚Äù and the idea of me filling my prescribed gender roll makes me not want a future. Most nights I just put pictures of myself into the face swap app and put the gender flip filter on which is objectively pretty fucking sad. Im not gonna transition, I don‚Äôt have that strength in me, but I just needed to vent.	"If you don't think you can transition, that's fine. However, I still feel as though you should at least try HRT and see how it makes you feel. No real harm in doing so as everything is reversible for a while, too.
I was in a very similar place to you until a few months ago.  Knew I was trans since highschool but gave up on transitioning out of fear.  Eventually something just kind of clicked and I suddenly felt like I was ready to give it another go.  Do you see a psychologist about your anxiety or dysphoria?  That might be a good first step towards a happier future, whether or not that includes transitioning.
You're stronger than you think, I suspect. Regardless, good luck girl!
honestly, I would and I‚Äôd probably be happy at the start, but once any visible changes occurred I‚Äôd just be a constant mess of anxiety thinking about how others perceive me. I don‚Äôt want to give myself something nice just to have to take it away
I had more doubts before I started HRT but honestly as soon as the visible changes kicked in the remaining doubts went away and instead I just get increasing happiness at my own sight the further I transition. It's way less scary and more rewarding than I imagined.

Obviously I can't tell you what you should do, all I can do is share my experience."	tstp4t	trans	20	1.0	2022-03-31 06:36:44
Had top surgery last Wednesday and now I feel conflicted	"I've been transitioning for 4 years, on HRT for almost 2. I have actively wanted top surgery since the beginning of my transition. I finally got it with Dr. Wapnir of the Stanford Women's Cancer Clinic (I didn't name the place), who performed the double mastectomy, and Dr. Nguyen, a plastic surgeon.

I haven't looked at my own body under the binder once since. My girlfriend has done all of my bandage changes. Every time she touches me to care for my chest I cry.

I knew both surgeons aren't hugely experienced with trans patients, so it might not have turned out well. They both, plus their teams, plus my girlfriend and a friend of mine who is in town to help me have said my chest looks fantastic (and this makes me feel really pressured to feel the same, and I know I don't do well with others expecting me to feel a certain way). 10 people have assured me I look great, and I haven't even seen myself yet.

I knew I likely wouldn't retain skin sensation, even though we took precautions to retain as much as possible. As a diabetic, not being able to feel a part of my body is the scariest thing I can imagine. I thought I was prepared for how I would feel post-op.

I know I will be okay after I adjust and the feeling of being in an alien body fades, but I am just not handling it well right now.

ETA: I'm FtM, though sometimes I lean closer to agender, I am very firmly masculine."	"Just give it a little time and don't look until you're ready, it's part of your body that has been there for so long and is now gone, you're bound to feel strange. It's also such a major stage in ftm transition so you're fine to be worried about how it turns out. You should be fine, just give yourself some time to recuperate and relax. I hope you love your new chest once you're ready to.
i had top surgery 4+ months ago.  it's scary. the not knowing the end result is terrifying.  it's normal.  i also did NOT have the ""omg i'm free"" crying emotional response everyone expects. some people thought i was unhappy with my surgery because i didn't gush.

you do you. only YOU can dictate how you should feel. all this is normal. just think about how no matter what, you don't have to bind anymore. no more sweaty sausage in summer. just a flat chest under that tank and shirt.  

give it time, if nothing else, you may feel different in a few months.
There are always a rush of emotions after something big like this - especially when full healing is still down the road a ways. Wishing you safety and comfort in this hard time. 
Change is difficult.   It takes time to adjust.   PS.  If Dr. Nguyen-if he's the same one who was trained by Toby Meltzer, he's been around for awhile."	4xsher	trans	20	0.92	2016-08-15 07:29:53
I CAME OUT TO MY MOM!!!IT WENT WELL!!!!	She was (somewhat) understanding!  Apparently she was mad she hadn't been born a boy for a long time and basically talked like she might've transition out had our family been more accepting and I hadn't been born and she also said she might be bisexual?My uncle apparently also dealt with this and said he felt like a woman in a man's body for years. ( I think that goes a far way to show trans is genetic and natural but that's besides the point).Basically she said she dealt with the same stuff but doesn't understand why I would choose to go through the pain and discrimination.  I am disappointed about that and the fact she doesn't want me doing estrogen or anything permanent.She told me she's more upset with me being an atheist than trans and pansexual (lol). Anyways big stuff today! Now I'm just going to work with my supportive mom to get to my end goal. She's the only family member I think will support me but she's the only one I really care about, so nothing lost!!!	Good for you. I also have trans family members, mostly 1st and 2nd cousins but I think there is something to there being a family correlation.	qae1kr	trans	18	0.92	2021-10-18 03:07:23
happiest day of my life	"&#x200B;

I got top surgery today and it was the happiest day of my life. I could share my whole story and how it's been an eleven year internal and external battle with myself, my family, and addiction to get here but basically - I just had the happiest day of my life. 

  
My surgery day started with a video call from my best friend/chosen sib's parents who have adopted me since I lost fam.of.origin relationships a year ago. Surgery went well. My chosen family took care of me, after all getting covid test results back. I was fed and nurtured and given meds. My sponsees reached out to tell me they loved me. (I'm about to celebrate 2.5 years sober in 11 days.) My sponsor and her wife danced a happy dance for me when I let them know how I was. My phone and email were blown up by friends all over the US, old coworkers, old ladies from AA. One of my best friends did my t shot while my cousin took a kink questionnaire online and my sibling made themself a snack. They fed me homemade chicken soup, and tea, and oreos. We talked for a few hours about our lives, and skyped our chosen fam from far away. Everyone offered me a blessing for my new body - joy; congruence and clarity; enjoying being helped and loved; pride in how far I've come and sustainability in how I move into the future.  

  
Being taken care of is the part of surgery I've been the most afraid of, but today was the happiest day of my life. I have waited my whole life to be treated like this, and to give over control and be supported well.

For all my trans siblings who keep telling yourselves it is impossible or it won't happen or you'll die first or you don't deserve it or you should wait til your parents die, or any of the other 2,000 terrible things I told myself since I first learned what medical + social transition was, just take it easy and focus on being the same person in every room. My advice is to just focus on developing your character, your values, and your community. Because if you aren't ready to come out or transition, that's fine. Put the work in now so that you can live in line with your values and be intentional about handling and releasing internalized transphobia and homophobia. Later, no matter what you choose, you'll be grateful that you did. Your relationships will benefit and your soul will be lighter even if you're living with dysphoria or doubt or gender-fear. 

  
Whether you take hormones or have procedures done or change your name or not, you're a living human being who needs love and care and who is so much more than just your gender or just your secrets. Maybe I wasn't ready for top surgery or hormones 11 years ago. But I've done a lot of work, emotionally, physically, spiritually, and relationally to get to the place where I walked into surgery sober, calm, and smiling, and walked out free. 

Thank you for reading this and celebrating with me. Love to all.

Question from a Mom!	"Hello! This may be a weird request and I hope it‚Äôs okay I post this here, but is there a way to find someone to pay to alter baby photos? My soon-to-be 17 year old sons is trans, and while he has spoken to how easy his transition has been, both socially and medically, and thus is at a place where he has never felt uncomfortable sharing his story, I still respect his autonomy and journey and never ‚Äúout‚Äù him. If he wants to share, that‚Äôs amazing. If he doesn‚Äôt want to share, which I‚Äôve never encountered, that‚Äôs also amazing. My sweet boy will be graduating soon, and I‚Äôd love to do the cliche collection of his baby (anything under‚Ä¶ 10 is what I mean by babyüòÇ) pictures to share. Now while I was never one for colors=gender, so there are plenty of him in the stereotypical ‚Äúboy‚Äù colors, and all babies tend to look the same until puberty, I‚Äôm lucky to have a lot to work with. But there are still some photos that if I could have minor color changing to his outfits, it would mean the world to me. Like I just started crying thinking about it. Most of his younger photos are physical prints, camera phones that did anything with the pictures you took didn‚Äôt quite exist in his youth. I would still love to retain the originals, but would be happy to upload them. Again I‚Äôm sure my son would honestly not care if I shared the ones where he does look more stereotypically female, but I want him to have the choice. 

Thanks for your time!"	"That's really sweet of you to do : ) I don't know of anyone who does that sort of thing but I'm sure you could probably find someone who can. If its just colours you need changing someone with an okay knowledge of photo editing could do that. I would double check with your son that he wants the altered ones to be shared though because he might not.
I'm sorry I don't know how to find someone to work with photographs like that, but I would like to say that it's so sweet of you to do that. It's so wonderful to hear about a parent who embraces their child's identity so readily. I bet you make him very happy!

Whether you find someone or not, thank you so much for asking here. You can post here anytime.
Thank you so much for your lovely comment! Yes, I would never share anything without explicit permission from my son, promise (:
Aw thank you! I appreciate that so much!"	kvnxq9	trans	19	1.0	2021-01-12 08:45:24
I'm coming out today. (Online at least)	"I'm tired of hiding myself behind this facade I've had on Reddit. It's time for me to do something about that. I've stayed closeted on my main Reddit account because my mother knows it. I don't care anymore. I'm not ready to tell her in person yet, but if she stalks my post history and sees this I don't care anymore. 

Everything was confusing for me. I thought about being a girl throughout most of my life. I thought it was normal, and that everyone did it, so I pushed it into the back corner of my mind. In middle school I started growing my hair out. At the time I thought it looked cool. Now I realize that I liked how it made me feel feminine. I have had a hard time with relationships because I didn't know who I was. I realize now how transphobic and homophobic I was back in the day, because I secretly hated myself. I would like to apologise for every attack helicopter and mental illness joke I have made. Now that I realized who I was, my depression makes sense. I'd like to give an exceptional thank you to my friend Dom, who stuck with me in the confusing times and has genuinely kept me from ending it all. Were it not for him incubating me as an egg and showing me that it was possible to change, I'd still be the bitter and depressed dude I used to be. 

It's going to be a while before I'm able to transition, but damn did writing and getting this all out make me feel immensely better."	"I'm so happy for you! Being totally honest with yourself about who you are is definitely not easy but once you finally make it there it feels so good. You go, girl! <3
Yeah. For a while nothing really made sense to me. Theatre definitely helped me figure out who I was too. My director wanted me to be Dr. Frank N Furter for our rendition of Time Warp, but it got shut down by the school, but watching the movie to get an idea of the role really made something click in my head. I'm only out to a couple of my good friends though. Baby steps. "	75uayb	trans	19	1.0	2017-10-12 03:12:27
my parent said they are part of the LGBT+ community	"possible trigger: past unsupportive parent who is now supportive 

this is more of a celebration for my parent.

I came out as a trans guy when I was 10, eleven years ago. My parent was really against it‚Äî worried for me‚Äî and confused for so long because they didn‚Äôt understand why gender mattered so much to me. They didn‚Äôt understand ‚Äúwhat feeling like a man‚Äù or ‚Äúfeeling like a woman‚Äù was, and felt that being trans was impractical. 

It took the both of us several years of some very severe arguing to come to the healthy place we are now at. They began to just accept my gender and bite their tongue, and then eventually began to understand a bit when they started to see how relieved testosterone has made me.

About three years ago, my parent started openly questioning their gender and wondering if they are nonbinary. They realized that their experience of gender is not universal, and they are actually really uncomfortable with being referred to as any gender at all.

They realized that they are agender; that‚Äôs the label that they feel comfortable describing themself as. For a while, they felt invalid as a nonbinary person because they do not want any medical transition. I‚Äôve had to be super careful not to push them in any direction while also still telling them that they could use the label nonbinary if they wanted to, and that would definitely be okay.

A few days ago, they referred to themself as being part of the LGBT community. I am immensely proud of them. We‚Äôve both come a long way to realize who we are. I wish they had known earlier. I selfishly wish that for both of us, because I think it would have saved a lot of confusion and strife. I‚Äôm just really proud of them and happy for them right now."	"I'm happy for you and your parent! Seeing family come around always gives me a bit of hope

I have a parent who has said some very not cis things before, and not the subtle stuff either- obviously i can't assume, but sometimes I wonder if this is what's in store for my future
I'm so happy for them! It takes a lot of time to understand yourself. A lot of LGBTQ+ people are homophobic as a defence mechanism or because of confusion. I'm glad that they finally understood themselves :)
It‚Äôs tricky. Because on one hand, I‚Äôve wanted to say for years, ‚ÄúYou realize you‚Äôre trans, right? Just say you‚Äôre trans.‚Äù But I also get that this is something they have to explore themself, that I cannot speed up the process nor should I, and that they do not have to call it any one label. But god, it has still been frustrating nonetheless.

I wonder if a lot of genuinely loving cis people‚Äôs confusion and frustration with their trans relatives might come from a place of having a gender experience that is subtler and less powerful than a lot of other people. It‚Äôs hard to imagine how intense the feelings of living as another sex would be if they don‚Äôt particularly identify THAT strongly with their own sex to begin with."	104ouc0	trans	18	0.96	2023-01-06 08:21:59
I came out to my parents	"It hurts to write about, think about, just trying to think about it hurts like getting up right now from my cozy depression den and running 20 laps. I‚Äôm shocked, sometimes hurt, sometimes apathetic and free, sometimes feel like disappearing and then sometimes grounded. I feel so fractured about it. 

I write this post in hopes it give me a little therapy sharing my story and ironing out the details of my existence. 

My parents had been questioning me, in recent FB pictures I looked too good, too feminine. It was drawing eyes and and questions, my parents began to approach me jokingly saying that I have to be a man. That I have to be strong and manly, nagging me persistently that I can‚Äôt just be a girl. They say it lightheartedly but firmly, they can‚Äôt imagine that I their 21 year old could ever be that. Could ever do something as ‚Äúcrazy‚Äù as transitioning. Something that was only spoken of on media and television to an Asian conservative family like mine.

But one thing about me is that I‚Äôm a piss poor liar, and especially when questioned about one of the cornerstones of my existence. I caved and I could not get myself to agree to be manly, to not be a girl, saying yes would deny me. Hurt myself in a way that I can‚Äôt wait to heal, make painful memories I would regret in the present and future. Every fiber of my being would not let me hide myself, shut myself off when I‚Äôd been backing my true self into a corner all my life. I felt rejection from every infinitesimals corner of my heart, and so I told her. I told my mother that I am trans, a girl and I am happy this way, that this is all I‚Äôve ever wanted and more. I told her all of this under the condition that she didn‚Äôt tell my father.

People are liars and thats the only thing thats truth. My mother watched me, confess spill and cry while vehemently denying that I am a girl. That she birthed a boy with large strong bones. That I am her boy, that I am influenced, and mentally ill. She says she loves me and says out of concern that I should‚Äôve told her when I first had thoughts ages ago. She would have sent me to conversion therapy and still wants me to go. She thinks that I‚Äôm sick and can be cured, she doesn‚Äôt believe my doctors are good since they enforce my behavior and are okay with me getting on hormones soon. 

The worst part is, that she promised she wouldn‚Äôt tell my father and then she told him while on the phone with me‚Ä¶

She told me its okay because he was already questioning me anyway, that he wouldn‚Äôt tell anyone else

*spoilers* he did and he didnt even wait 20 minutes. 

He began yelling at me telling me he‚Äôs disappointed in me, that ive disappointed him. I‚Äôm crying screaming I don‚Äôt care what he thinks, he is stressed and goes to his brothers to vent. He goes to my grandmothers the next day and does the same thing. My entire conservative family thinks I‚Äôm selfish and horrible, because my dad is bipolar and I can‚Äôt be happy or myself because of the effect it would have on his mental health. And they also no doubt imagine i‚Äôm mentally ill from being related to him and brainwashed by privilege. 

They are so quick to blame people around me, blame the fact that they helped me move out to a condo while in school and being independent ruined me.  

The story isnt even over, not by a long shot but to wrap. My dad came back from my uncles, and I had come home because I wanted to see my mom in the flesh, I saw him and he yelled at my girlfriend saying that he would pull out of the lease, that he wanted me home at his house. Then he backpedaled saying that its my life and that he doesnt want to see me and doesnt want a girl in the house. He also thinks she brainwashed me and is mad that she didnt tell him when I first transitioned. 

Its been a heartache the past few days, I went to a concert to drown it out, but it always comes back. The sadness, the shame, being misunderstood, feeling wrong and wronged, like ai shouldn‚Äôt exist and its my job to fight for my own existence to explain to every hardhead who wants to change and confront me that I am organic and natural and it is simply who I am. I‚Äôm just a beat girl though who can barely force herself to eat meals on time, to lift the heavy blankets that cover my depression. The fight is dim in me y‚Äôall. Please give me strength. I just want to scream that I exist and am more than an accident. 

My heart oozes just to write this so I certainly won‚Äôt reread it, sorry for spelling errors."	"I know it hurts love, I'm not gonna bullshit and say I understand because I don't. My parents went to shit long before I had the chance to come out. You aren't alone in this though, you have a community of people that feel and think the same way, so if that's wrong to them then let it be wrong to them cause it's right to you and yours
You know who you are, you know what you want, and anyone who wants to drag you down is just an obstacle. Don't feel shameful for who you are, don't concern yourself with your family's petty concerns about image, and dont feel guilty about their selfish feelings. I know when you're still in a situation where you have to be around them it's hard to avoid these things, but don't lose hope that soon enough you won't have to deal with this nonsense anymore and you will be able to live your life as you see fit without their negativity. And it's great to hear that it seems you have a supportive partner to help you get through this."	x143bh	trans	18	0.89	2022-08-30 00:04:54
If all goes according to plan I should be able to come out to my family soon, which is terrifying...	"I'm 23 (mtf) and I have actually come out to my family before. Multiple times. It has never gone well.

Some background: as mentioned i am 23 (mtf). I am pre everything though that should be changing fairly soon. I didnt know transitioning or trans people even existed until 2014. When I found out I was like ""oh my god, that explains everything."" I had literally been praying to god every night for the past year to change me into a woman while I slept (spoiler: he didnt and now I'm buddhist). I came out to my three best friends in high school (all three were incredibly supportive) and shortly after my mom. When I told her I was trans she said "" No you're not."" I insisted I was and she said ""cant you just be gay?"" üòê

She then signed me up for therapy with a lady who was very mean. 

Eventually I went to college in 2016 and decided I'd come out publicly, and start a social transition. I got bullied by my parents, attempted suicide (luckily I was scared going through with it and my attempt failed), was taken out of college and put in a mental hospital with another mean doctor and staff that threatened me if I tried to file a complaint. It was hell. So when I got out I was afraid to come out again. Except I did a year later. The next year 2018 I went to planned parenthood and got hormones. I was living with my grandparents and when they found out they threw them away and sent me to live with my family overseas for several months. When I came back to america I moved into an apartment. Even though I presented super masc, and still kinda do, I knew it wasn't who I was. But I didnt dare say anything.

Anyway fast forward to now, 2021. I have my own place, I have a drivers license and a car, have a job where i am one of the primary people in my position, my coworkers and bosses are amazing people who care a lot about me, I have a super loving and supportive girlfriend who knows I'm trans, my girlfriend and I are moving into a new apartment together, I have a best friend who has also knows I'm trans and has gone full mama bear mode about it,  I have been growing my savings and proving my responsibility, my therapist has been giving me plenty of good feedback, and I have been preparing to transition for a year. On tuesday I go to see my therapist/psychiatrist to primarily make sure he's made fully aware of my intentions, my goals, and my feelings, but also so we can go over possible med interactions with hormones (there arent any if my research is correct) and make plans. If that goes well I could be going to my HRT consultation as soon as that Thursday.  

I plan on coming out to my parents after my therapist appointment but before my HRT appointment.  Luckily they live in a different state and my grandparents are visiting them so even though they have no right to interfere, they physically cant. I do want to give them the courtesy of coming out before I start hormones so it isnt ""surprise! I'm taking estrogen now.""

And while I have high hopes they will come around eventually I am scared. We FaceTime daily, and I know I'm about to be ignored for a while. My mom gets mean whenever the topic comes up and my dad, who is a big stoic marine, will start tearing up and getting emotional (as has happened in the past when I have come out). Maybe I'm just psyching myself up and maybe they will have grown and will recognize I am an adult, but I cant help but be nervous. 

Somehow even though my grandma's sister got pregnant from premarital sex; one of my cousins became a druggie, ran off with her druggie boyfriend, and has broken into and stolen from her mom's house; and another cousin is known for having more traffic incidents than anyone in our family combined, is incredibly reckless, and stays out all night drinking and partying whenever he is home from college; somehow I'm the black sheep.

Anyway thanks to anyone who made it this far. I'm just incredibly nervous and had to rant.

TL;DR I'm coming out to my family soon, I've done so before to disastrous results, and I'm scared (even though I'm also incredibly excited to be the true me)."	"Well good luck with your family. by the sounds of it they arnt the best people so I would have a backup plan. Remember your valid no matter what happens. They dont need to dictate your life any more. Be your own woman
Hey, I'm Chloe. My thoughts are with you, girl. Keep fightin for what you believe in and for yourself and your best friends. I wish you the best!!
Your story is precisely why I was terrified to ever come out to my family.
Yeah, my family is weird. They are incredibly caring as long as you follow their ideals and they act like they are supportive of LGBT people but only when it isnt in their family. 

I'm probably making them seem like monsters but I feel like they are more good intentions but with horrible actions. It could honestly go either way in the long term but I just know that initially I'll have to deal with the fallout.

Thanks for the kind words and motivation.
Thanks üòä
You're welcome, honey."	mn67i1	trans	21	0.97	2021-04-09 01:09:54
I would give anything to have not come out and just go back two months.	"This is a follow up from my last post here:

[https://www.reddit.com/r/trans/comments/vj9ax9/i\_came\_out\_in\_the\_worst\_possible\_way\_and\_time\_and/](https://www.reddit.com/r/trans/comments/vj9ax9/i_came_out_in_the_worst_possible_way_and_time_and/)

It‚Äôs been about four weeks since I came out and told my friends I‚Äôm trans and I regret everything. I thought outside of losing my best friend and one other that coming out went well, but now over half of those people are hard ghosting me as well. I ended up trying to take the advice in the last thread and owning up to my mistake with my best friend / ex-girlfriend and calling her to try to explain.

It went worse than the worst-case scenarios I tried to predict to ease the blow if it went south.

She told me everything she‚Äôs known about me for 6-7 years is a lie. Nothing about our friendship was real. The two years we tried dating disgusts her now that she slept with someone who didn‚Äôt find her attractive. That after everything I‚Äôm a stranger to her. It shattered me. The closest relationship I‚Äôve ever manage to make completely and utterly rejected to its core.

I‚Äôve been trying to shamble forward the past couple weeks. But as I mentioned in my last post everything has been so much more real since coming out. I‚Äôve thrown up multiple times since then just seeing my reflection. Wishing I did something years ago before I really let my body go. Little details everywhere I go setting off my dysphoria like it never did before.

On one hand I‚Äôm actively considering I have nothing left to lose, might as well start down a path to transition, weight loss before hrt be damned. On the other I feel everyone I considered close to me considers me a freak already and I just wish I could turn back the clock so I can keep pretending I‚Äôm not who I am.

I have an appointment with Planned Parenthood on the 14th to at least start talks and ask some more questions I‚Äôve been struggling to find answers for, or conflicting answers. That and staying active trying to focus on weight loss as been the only things keeping me going.

However, after a few days ago I‚Äôm worried I might not even make it to the 14th. In my attempt to stay active I managed to reinjure my knee which I had surgery on last year. That knee injury was initially 2 years of suffering and lack of mobility. I tried to stay off it for a couple days to see if it got better and it wasn‚Äôt. I tried some mobility movements to see if I can feel what is wrong and it feels deep, just like it did pre-surgery.

It feels like the only path forward I had was taking from me. I‚Äôve been bed ridden and can‚Äôt stop replaying everything about my life. From what if I told people sooner? What if I didn‚Äôt move to a deep red state and settle down here before being financially ruined? Did my best friend honestly mean that when she said everything about our friendship was a lie and meant nothing anymore? Why do I still care about her when she obviously doesn‚Äôt care at all about me?

My mental state has been the worst it‚Äôs ever been, and I don‚Äôt even know what to do anymore. I was so close to just giving up last night."	"I am really sorry you're going through this. I wish I could do something to help but yeah we're just strangers on the internet. Have you tried therapy ? You seem like talking things out without the fear of judgement would do you some good. I would recommend doing that. Especially if you feel like your life is threatened by your mental state. Don't give up on the possibility for happiness, becausr you deserve it. You deserve to feel comfortable, you deserve to feel loved. And you owe it  to yourself to give you the means to do so. I want you to know that at least here you are seen, loved and accepted for who you want to be, without judgement. Much love to you and I wish you the best <3
Thanks for the replies. I tried to focus on work today but broke down and things just spiraled from there. I always thought if I wanted to transition I would lose this job, but I think at this rate ill lose it long before.
Dammit! I wrote a bunch of crap, but it was all bitterly sarcastic. And I just did it a third time. I'm just fucking it all up. Suicide hotline, for real. Call it. They can't do any worse than I am. And the girl, forget her. If she comes to her senses and wants to talk, sure, but when you needed her, she didn't hear a word you said, assumed you were gay to spite her, and stormed off. I'm so sorry. You deserve way better, for everything, sister.
As someone who has done this twice, came out lost everything, rebooted life with new job new place new career‚Ä¶.. Just to do it again I feel your suffering but‚Ä¶.. Keep your head up stay chipper and to hell with anyone that says,thinks,acts like you don‚Äôt deserve to be who you are!!!! Stay fierce and live your true life‚Ä¶‚Ä¶. There will be others, there will be more heartache, it‚Äôs a long nasty hard road, good luck!
My experience with Therapists is less then fruitful. The one therapist I ever found that gave the impression of remotely caring moved away 2 years ago and I gave up after a couple bad experiences replacing them. I never even told her about this aspect of me either. Trying to find another one in South Dakota of all places is not going to be easy.
I almost wish the conversation went like that. We spoke for about half an hour. She let me say what I needed to say to try and explain it. She specifically pointed out a Trans couple we knew from work years ago and how she had no issue with them at all. The issue was with me lying to her for all these years. ""Did you ever really care about me? Or did you want to be me?"" still haunts me. The whole conversation she was cold and almost emotionless. Her accusations that I never actually cared about her sting me to my core.
I honestly have no idea how people do it. I have extreme difficulty forming bonds with anyone. And that's why this one stings so much. I felt closer to her the past couple years then when we actually dated because there wasn't an over arching threat of a romantic relationship over us anymore.
Are there no trans friendly associations in South Dakota? 'Cause that's where I went first when I needed support, associations are full of good-willed people and you might find some friends there ?
Sorry. My mistake. It was the insecurities that got her, I suppose. Their my wife's big weakness. It took a lot of work to help her keep them under control. They destroy relationships, and not just romantic ones. They twist the words we hear into what we fear the most.
So I left out some things, one I was married both times. First wife really didn‚Äôt know I guess, divorce she got everything, met another wonderful woman and was totally honest about who I am same shit, after hrt done divorce etc, my father disowned me, my mother says I disrespect her gender, only one person currently was with me on this and that‚Äôs the damndest thing a straight 6 foot 7 inch Caucasian male who is my direct supervisor. Lost everything basically the second time around as well and it taught me‚Äî- that I am the one doing it to myself and the people around me, I always default to what society says I should act, look, sound etc and then those people form a relationship with this person that does not exist and they feel hurt. I never fudge or fake shit these days it skips the painful stuff cuz if they meet me as a fairy and they are not down I know right then and there. You are meant to survive, don‚Äôt do anything stupid and you will survive. Eventually you will find meaning in survival and that‚Äôs what happiness is. Be yourself fuck the rest of them. As I have come to learn we are Everywhere like legion. The day may never come when people leave me alone cuz let‚Äôs face it, no matter the effort I will never pass, but I will never lie about who I am or change for someone or thing ever again. It‚Äôs gets better girl.  Smile.
And yes I don‚Äôt trust anyone anymore because the people I loved most turned away from me. Doesn‚Äôt matter when you learn to love your self. I am still working at that, my dysphoria is extreme totally understand but I also know through experience that life even with this curse is still worth living cuz damn, heels makeup and minis bitch lol!!!!
I'm not sure. I'm going to try to find something, but SD is often overlooked as the republican stronghold it that is actually is. I was almost assaulted multiple times at the start of the pandemic just for wearing a mask. I can't imagine what would happen now.
Which would explain a lot on her end, sadly. Which makes it all the harder for me to stop caring cause now I feel even more guilty about telling her instead of just letting our friendship fade into nothingness.
I can't even begin to imagine how to restart after that. I always wanted her to be the core of my support group. My family has already basically disowned me and I haven't even come out to them yet. I just feel completely alone and worthless right now.
Oh boy... That is indeed bad... That said, look it up anyway, I live in a pretty biggoted and backwards area in France and I did find an association and they helped quite a lot actually...look it up, worth a shot !
Definitely don't feel guilty. Just keep the good times with you. It's what makes it all worth it.
I went through the same, a lot of anger, guilt like I‚Äôm still in therapy for the suicidal amount of guilt, I often feel very selfish, it is very hard work to love myself. That‚Äôs why I say it‚Äôs worth it, cuz I know. Something to be said about being poor, looked at, harassed etc, being who you are. Back then shoulders and put yo head up. It‚Äôs going to sting a bit, and I‚Äôll tell you what no one else will. It never goes away, like really goes away. As I‚Äôm typing this and thinking about what that felt like I am remembering us. Jesus fucking Christ I had the most beautiful wife, we shared boyfriends everything for 15 years I presented almost full time with her the entire time‚Ä¶. Then, everything, changed.
Defiantly been trying. When we broke up and went no contact for a year I was able to do that. Now, I can't. I just can't stop thinking how everything we have been through she denies there was even a friendship there. Amazing how losing her as a friend hurts worse.
It makes sense, with the floor being dropped out from under you and all. This is something you need to talk about. All of this, really. This stuff will drive you crazy if it just cycles around in your head. I'm not great at it, but I'll listen if you don't have someone better."	vsp16o	trans	17	0.96	2022-07-06 12:37:11
Your sexuality seems so mundane once you start questioning your gender.	"Has this happened to anyone else, because when I was in 5th grade when I got my first crush and was beggining to decipher my sexuality it seemed kind of a big deal, I went to catholic school, and there was a bunch of homophobia floating around. I felt like I couldn't let anyone know, like I was the odd one, and I was confused. ""Am a bisexual?"" ""maybe a lesbian I don't remember liking a boy as much as this girl"" ""Pansexuality is a thing"" ""tf does asexuality means, they don't like people""  You know, just diving into the queer rabbit hole, learning knew terms, shaping my moral, it all seemed overwealming and confusing.   I remember that the moment my egg started to crack was a youtube video; a TedTalk by a non-binary kid my age at that  time. It was my first time learnig that term but it felt right, and I started to see the past signs about me being trans about the same time puberty hit me. Btw, dysphoria can go fuck itself. Skirts, dresses gender roles, voice, hair, waist, figure, periods; dysphoria fucked all of them.  I remember I became more and more introverted and negative. All the usual questions you know. ""Am I NB or trans?"" ""Myabe I'm cis"" ""i'm faking it for attention"" ""I don't feel enought dysphoria to be clasified as trans"".   Suddently, being gay didn't seem so bad. You know, you come out as gay and you have to 1- Become accepted and that's it, sure you deal with homophobia and you can't get married and I get that it isn't as simple, but it all boils down to all your problems solved if you are accepted.  Trans people need to get accepted, wich mind you is much more dificult than with gay people, deal with dysphoria, transition, not being able to find a partner 'cause of your genitalia (I know, bisexual people exist, but you get me), and more transitioning.    I started to think how ungratefull I was to think it was overwealming when I tought I was a lesbian, heck, I didn't know if I was a lesbian or straight anymore.  Being gay seemed so simple, I simple started to not give a fuck, who gives a fuck what genitals you like, it's nothing when you don't even know what genitals you want in yourself. People around me came out of the closet, ""I'm gay"" ""I'm pansexual"" Who. fricking. cares. I mean, that wasn't my reaction. I tryed to act as supportive as possible. In the back of my head I knew they where going through a tough time, but I coudn't really piece it toguether, What's the problem? Do you wake up to curse the weight of your beasts? Do you propously not look down while showering so you don't see your bottom? Do you train your voice to make it sound like your opposite genders? Do you actibly avoid mirrors? Do you stuff freaking socks in your pants?

I know I'm being selfish and a hypocrite. But I can't help it. Sexuality simply feels so mundane, and I know it's important, I know the world is full of homophobia still. At the end you can always change who you like, you just ""love"" someone and that's it, If you where wrong about your sexuality change your flair! Big deal big drama. At least they don't grow envius of people with freaking testicular/breast cancer.

I'm ready to get downvoted, Reddit, but I had to let this off my chest."	"I feel the exact same way. When I was younger I was obsessed with figuring out my sexuality, but when I started questioning my gender, the sexuality thing went out the window and now I don‚Äôt care to label myself at all. I‚Äôm attracted to who I‚Äôm attracted to and if I figure it out later, great! If I don‚Äôt, great! All I want to do is figure out my gender identity and I‚Äôm set!
I wish you the best of luck in your journey :)
I don't a reason to downvote. I'm just wondering where all those Catholic girl schools are I read about since I've never even heard of one around here. ^^

Jokes aside, one thing that I'm somewhat struggling with is that my sex drive just vanished and I'm becoming incapable of parenting a biological child.
.... Except that's just it. Both of these things, I don't give a shit about, however it bugs me that I'm so ambivalent about these things since The used to mean something to me. Mtf btw.
Sexuality is still mostly in a box I haven‚Äôt figured out yet
First, my school is catholic but mixted. 

Second, So what if sex used to be important to you? Many members of the lgbt comunity where homo/transphobic in the past but have changed their ways.

If you used to have a high libido that's past you. You are in the precent know, don't force yourself into things just because you used to like them. Do whatever makes you happy, at the end, that's the goal in life isn't it?

As a side note, have you heard of Asexuality? Late bloomers are always welcome in the lgbt community to start with :)
 I kinda hope I won't stay asexual :o no offense to those who are but... I think I'd be missing something if My libido didn't came back at some point. ^^ and yeah I get what you're saying, though I think the pursuit of happiness is only one option of suitable life goals."	m0iqju	trans	19	0.95	2021-03-08 15:57:26
Making a care package/ trans essentials.	"Hi there, 

My boyfriend‚Äôs child (17) recently told him that they want to start transitioning FtoM . While I haven‚Äôt met them yet, I really want to send them a care package of items they may need/want but are not comfortable asking their dad. I‚Äôm honestly thinking of sending anonymously. Above all I just want them to feel loved and supported.  I‚Äôve browsed some subreddits looking for information on STPs, products to encourage hair growth etc. I‚Äôm
here to ask this loving community for transitioning essentials or any items you would have loved to receive. Any tips/ tricks and specific brands of items would be much appreciated. Or even a business I could purchase a giftcard from. Thank you! ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è"	"There's actually someone on etsy who makes ftm care packages, might check it out. Other than that for me personally, buying mens deodorant and soap was probably the scariest thing. 
I would avoid buying them anything so personal as an stp or hair growth products, might come across wrong and stps can be a pain. A lot of people don't even mess with them. Even if they do its a very much person to person thing on what he might want. 
I would stick with basics, maybe even think college care package for a guy if you want to build your own
Hi! Trans man here. This is very sweet.

I would avoid hair growth stuff for someone so young just because 1) most of it is junk and 2) it might enhance the idea that they must have facial hair to pass or be valid which at 17 isn‚Äôt something they need to worry about. 

STPs and/or packers could be cool depending on their wants and needs but for some men this is also a really personal and potentially embarrassing process. 

Binders or trans tape would probably be a much more exciting gift.

Beyond that I think general dude stuff feels so good and affirming when you first come out‚Äîboxers, masculine clothes, cologne, mens deodorant/shower gel/etc, razors and all that kind of stuff.

Would also be really nice to get them some books by transmasc authors that are geared towards kids. Man Alive by Thomas Page McBee is really good but not sure how age appropriate it is.
I'll let the ftm members of the community weigh in on your more specific questions, but I just wanted to say thank you for willing to be there for this youth. Trans people need allies.
I‚Äôm so glad your being supportive and want to do this!! I‚Äôm a ftm teen so if I was getting a package like that I‚Äôd probably appreciate things like mens soap and deodorant, cologne, maybe mens underwear like boxers, maybe a trans flag or lgbt flag. If they like reading maybe a book about other trans guys. Hopefully that helps and they like it :))
Aww, this is so sweet! If you know their size, a binder or two might be a good idea. I was happy with Underworks. GC2B isn‚Äôt as good as it used to be (it doesn‚Äôt have the same flexibility and the lifetime is much shorter). 

In terms of packer, that sounds like a very personal thing to get but at the same time, probably expensive for a kid to get, I would have been happy to receive that ü§∑I don‚Äôt personally use STPs because I don‚Äôt feel the need to stand to pee (I‚Äôm happy to lazily sit down lol), but for some it can be an affirming thing. I use an Archer packer, the small model (it‚Äôs already big enough imo, some of those packers can get really big!) They comme in 4 different colors, including a dark chocolate one, so even if it‚Äôs not spot on to match the skin tone, you might have a good chance to come close to the range. I like to use it with a Cake Bandit jock strap with a pouch. It does a really good job at keeping the packer in place and it‚Äôs an affirming type of underwear for me (although I usually pair it with boxers since I still have my ‚Äúwet‚Äù native setup). I definitely wish I had several of them so I could change them daily. If you‚Äôre looking to get them underwear too, I hear Natural Feeling makes good boxers with long legs that don‚Äôt ride up, I‚Äôve been meaning to try them!

I think some bathroom essentials can be a nice touch too if they don‚Äôt already have those. I really like the Old Spice Pure Sport deodorant, but there are a lot of different scents, so you might want to consult with them first to know what they like. A razor might also be appreciated. Even before being on T, for some of us shaving the peach fuzz can be affirming and I think it helps towards passing to look cleanly shaved instead of keeping a type of facial hair that only females have. 

Hope this helps! ‚ù§Ô∏è

Edit: I saw someone suggest to add a book. I recommend Hung Jury by Tristan T. Cotten! It‚Äôs a collection of bottom surgery stories that mostly debunk the whole myth of male genitoplasty not being good, and the book is already 20 years old, so the science nowadays is even better! Definitely a classic in the community imo. My favorite trans youtuber also published one called Top to Bottom that I believe covers his whole transition process. His name is Finlay Games. I haven‚Äôt read it, but the guy is my hero. I also really enjoyed reading [this book by trans gay legend Lou Sullivan](https://www.digitaltransgenderarchive.net/downloads/g158bh442). It was very meaningful to me. It‚Äôs essentially a collection of advice sprinkled with very short stories of trans men throughout history in the margins. There‚Äôs no printed version of it that you can buy but I was able to print the document for a few bucks. That being said, Lou Sullivan also has an extensive collection of journals that I believe are still being published. He‚Äôs a major ftm historical figure!
Hi!!! When I first came out I knew I big thing I needed was a binder that I could use safely. For me my go to has always been the brand gc2b and I know they have gift cards last time I checked. I would say for things like stp‚Äôs it may be better to help fund something like that but for me it was quite literally picking out my own penis haha so maybe something he should do as I felt it was a big step for me and how I wanted to look/feel Binders too are important to make sure they‚Äôre the right size so it‚Äôs safe!!! When I was first coming out though the biggest thing for me was love and support. And sounds like he‚Äôs got a lot of that in his corner so congrats on that!
Thank you so much for your thoughtful response. I definitely don‚Äôt want to communicate  that they have to do anything to ‚Äúpass or be valid.‚Äù I want them to feel embraced as they are, exactly as they are and through all the changes. I really appreciate the book suggestion too!
Oh thank you so much for this thorough reply with company names. So so so helpful! 

I was thinking about getting a giftcard somewhere so they can choose their own packer and/ or necessary accessories. I saw items on etsy, but not sure if that‚Äôs too general. 

I also will look into those books for my own personal learning! 

THANK YOU THANK YOU THANK YOU!
You‚Äôre absolutely welcome! If Etsy does gift cards, it could be a really good gift too. Personally that‚Äôs where I get my pride merch, from fellow queer people, as opposed to corporations doing rainbow capitalism in June. There‚Äôs all kinds of jewelry and pins and flags and overall really cool pride items on there! Also don‚Äôt know if they do gift cards, but [this website](https://transguysupply.com/) is a good resource for necessities !"	vctmja	trans	20	0.95	2022-06-15 12:41:38
My grandmother told me to wait till she dies to transition. What should i do? (FTM)	"TW for transphobia

A year ago i came out to my grandmother. I had socially transitioned before that (I've been out for about 5 years). She immediately went on a rant about how ""she doesn't care if I'm as gay as a 2 dollar bill."" Because her daughter (my aunt) is gay.

(she also sent her to conversion therapy in the 80's, but that's a different story.) She then sat me down. looked me dead in the eyes and told me ""You have to wait till i die to transition, because grandpa cant take it, and i cant lose my little daughter"" At the time i said it was fine and ill honor her wishes. But as im seeing her for thanksgiving today i am immediately fueled with rage. How could she say that to me?

Would she rather have a dead grandkid or one that's so unhappy in his body that he suffers 24/7 just to make her comfortable.

How do i tell her my name and pronouns inset optional? Please help me.

Thank you all :)

tldr : Grandma told me to wait till she dies to transition, i see her today and im now realizing how messed up that is. what do?

&#x200B;

edit : Thank you all for the supportive comments :D i am taking your advice <3"	"do it anyway. they can't stop you. 

i mean the other option is a little too morbid...
Implore her to die faster or simply not follow her vile requests.
Her generation fucked so much up for us, the least they can do is treat us like humans as we are. 

Fuck their feelings, they don't give a shit about ours.

Live your life, if it makes others uncomfortable, that's their problem to deal with.
This is basically how I put it when a relative told me the same thing years ago; I need to be able to look forward to this to have hope for my future, and if I have to wait until you die, I can't look forward to it without thinking about you dying. Please don't put me in a position where it's either have no hope for my future or have to have that hope tied up in your death because I can't handle that. 

I was also able to put some distance for a few years until the relative I mentioned decided she wanted me in her life more than she wanted to get her way. I don't know if you're in a position to do that and it's a gamble whether the other person will come around. 

(It's not fair and it's cruel for her to have told you that and you shouldn't have to do the heavy lifting here, but if you need to play nice/ keep some kind of relationship going I wish you luck. Coming from a place of love might get through but it might not, either way her behavior is reflective of her, and you absolutely deserve better.)
Your mental and physical well being is worth more than her feelings and outdated, bigoted views. ü§îü§∑üôÑ
That is SOO selfish. I'm sorry. f that live your life
lmao fuck your grandma and make her life miserable what a bitch
My grandma told me the same thing. It hurt a lot, and I almost even considered halting my transition until she wouldn‚Äôt be able to see it. I felt too much guilt. 
But, I soon realized that I do not need to pause my life for anyone. This is my life, not hers. She has no control of me or my choices. I know what will make me happy and I know what is best for me. So, I followed through with that mindset, and yesterday I took my first dose of testosterone. 

So, basically what I‚Äôm trying to get at is exactly what other commenters are saying as well. Live your life. Live it to the fullest and live it as your true self. Don‚Äôt let anyone stop you.
Transition, family means nothing if they don't accept you as you. You'll be much happier in the long run, trust me.
I don't think a woman who sent her daughter to conversion therapy has any right ti tell you how to love your life. Tell her this is how you're going to live your life and if she insists that you can't do it till she's dead you tell her she better hurry up then cause you're not waiting.

I feel stuck	"I have a job and im old enough to get hrt by myself 

But the endocrinologist i need to see is too far away; i need to take the train to get there

I dont know how ill be able to go that far without my transphobic mother objecting to it

I dont know if i can leave home and live elsewhere so i can transition in peace. I dont know if i can afford it, and i dont even know where to look.

Even if i do manage to get a hold of the prescription, what do i do when my mother notices the changes? I cant hide it forever. How will she react? 

I dont care if my mum will always see me as her daughter, i dont care if she'll never understand. I just want my face and body to look the way its supposed to

i dont know how long it'll be until i can actually do anything. I dont want to be stuck in the body of a little girl for the rest of my life. I dont want to feel horrible every time i look in the mirror because i havent done anything to fix myself yet

I wish i could somehow change her mind. I wish i can convince her that transitioning is what's best for me, and that it's the right thing to do.

I wish i could trust my own mother"	"I am kinda in the same boat in my own circumstance. My mum has made it perfectly clear she doesn't approve of me being a woman instead of her little boy (i'm 28 so thats dumb already)  
and will likely interfere when i get to the medication stage and such as she considers trans individuals as freaks :I I am already looking at moving away when i can.  
The point i guess is that... you deserve to be happy in who you are and such. It'll be harder to do with her, but for your happiness you should do what ever you need to get there.  Don't let her get in the way this. I wish i could offer some actual good advice instead of dumbness :(
Are you in the US?  Most states will allow telehealth for hormones, and there are several online options specifically for trans health if you are over 18.

Doing my best with my father (not cute)	"Vent: So my father is far right. Like many people this presidency he‚Äôs been radicalized and I suppose I always knew he‚Äôd be particularly susceptible to it. He‚Äôs always certain he‚Äôs right, he‚Äôs pro status quo, he says common sense a lot, that sort of thing. Even when I was young I knew he simply did not see things complexly and I never understood how he could stand being so steadfast in his beliefs without considering that there‚Äôs something he doesnt know or is wrong. This goes into a particular thing about me, which is that I don‚Äôt like to be wrong, so much so that I don‚Äôt commit to being certain about anything, but seeing him just see things as black and white knowing that there is no such thing as a black and white truth always made me uncomfortable. So he was probably always on the conspiracy theory path and his tendency to reject things that he doesnt understand made his transition to being transphobic an easy one with recent talking points in republican media. 


I had taken a shot at dismantling one of his antivax posts a few days ago, due to concerns for his health, by very calmly and methodically pointing out a lie his listed source told. His source was telling him that the world was lying to him so I figured it was appropriate to point out a clear, unmistakable lie. The conversation was civil and while i don‚Äôt know if it convinced him of anything, I spent a lot of time writing out everything in great detail and expressing that this is a matter of concern. In the end when I explained that i don‚Äôt get my data from a news network or journal site, but scientific journals, public record government files, and history he said that he wishes that everyone could think like me. That the country is split too heavily right now. Not much elaboration on that but I took it as a sign that there was some kind of respect there.


So I‚Äôm not out to my parents. It still feels fairly new to me and I‚Äôd like to have figured out my identity a little better before i tell them. But my father had posted some anti trans sentiments on Facebook. Mostly parroting recent conservative talking points. I knew what kind of person my father is already. I grew up with him and he hasn‚Äôt left that small dead end town we lived in since he moved there in 2000. I knew he had no knowledge of trans issues aside from what his figureheads have spoon fed him. But his recent admission had given me some hope that maybe there was more to him than I thought. I left when I was 19 so maybe I didn‚Äôt have the perspective to see him complexly or maybe he had grown in some way in the last 10 years. I thought maybe there was some capacity to look at something objectively when given actual data from someone he cares about. Especially because this isn‚Äôt even something that effects him (that he knows of.)


So I wrote him something. I spent a long time on it and I made it as respectful and understanding as I could. I talked about how I knew where he was getting his information from because I keep up with this stuff too, and that I have a very clear set of examples of how they clearly and undeniably misrepresented known data and how it was manipulative. As respectfully as I could I told him that I had a special interest in this topic for a long time and that in this case I know for a fact that he cannot know as much about the topic as I do. I had demonstrated thorough and unbiased research methods to him before so I thought that might hold a little weight. I started by saying that this was very important to me and that I hoped he would try to work with me on this, and that this could be something that could improve our relationship significantly. After hours of writing this he responded with basic baby science, telling me what x and Y chromosomes are. 


My father and I are not close. I was never very close with my family really. So since coming out to them will take a certain level of empathy and intimacy for our relationship to continue to exist, I thought i would put in real effort to give them the tools to deal with it when I do come out. It‚Äôs honestly such a stupid reason to lose family over. I‚Äôm not actually worried that they‚Äôll disown me or anything, I‚Äôm sure they‚Äôll say they love me no matter what, but not understand or respect my change of identity. So if that happens I‚Äôll be the one to pull the trigger. 


But knowing that I wanted to give them a fighting chance to understand me. I wanted them to know that I gave them every opportunity to learn. And that if I have to disown them, that it was their own fault that they put their own unresearched opinions over identity politics over their own child. I kind of hate it. That when the time comes and they think I‚Äôm being unfair, that I‚Äôll have to tell them to grow up and do the damn research. I don‚Äôt like having to be prepared to treat them like children. But as of right now it is how it is."	"[deleted]
I can relate to so much of what you wrote here, I came out of the closet on October 30th of 2020 and since them a lot of my family didn't even care a little bit about using the correct pronouns with me or with calling me by my actual name, and when I ask them to do so, they say that I should stop complaining, I wish this won't be the case for you,  it's really the worst thing in the world and I can't really avoid having contact with them, best wishes, I hope everything goes well

Thanks. It really helps that I haven‚Äôt been close to my parents since I was little, so I don‚Äôt have a lot of emotional hurdles to doing this. I want their approval of course, but I don‚Äôt need it. I‚Äôll need to tell them eventually and I‚Äôm too old to lie to my parents, so I thought I‚Äôd try to prepare them first. I hope your situation stays sane and supportive
I expect this, though it‚Äôs easier that my parents are on the other side of the country (US). I learned that with family it‚Äôs healthy to expect about a 6 month adjustment period, because something like this really can be hard for them. What would bother me is unwillingness to try to even begin, which is what it sounds like youre going through. Because of this I planned on telling them explicitly that they have 6 months to adjust. Not to try or to take the first step. I expect understanding and respect for who I am by time those 6 months are up, pronouns and everything. If they cant manage that, I will no longer be their child. By setting this boundary hopefully they can take it seriously knowing what‚Äôs at stake. Creating a boundary and enforcing it is the only way I know how to respect myself and still accommodate them. I don‚Äôt have to deal with anyone else I love refusing to understand me or gender me correctly, so I don‚Äôt want something as unnecessary as that weighing down on me for years
I have no idea why he thought 6th grade simplified biology was going to prove anything. It‚Äôs basic knowledge made easy for children not a fundamental rule
Oh i realized my title was accurate, but could have come off as possibly a nice story and I didn‚Äôt want to stress someone out that didn‚Äôt want to read something heavier.

My First Swedish Gender Clinic Visit	"So I just went for my first gender clinic visit in Sweden. I want to share my thoughts and experiences because this has been deeply emotional for me. Putting it out here is like a bit of therapy, but perhaps some of you are interested.

I started receiving both medical and psychological treatment for my gender dysphoria in South Africa before moving to Sweden in August. I started HRT on the second of March this year, and had seen my psychologist roughly nine times before moving.

I arrived at Lundstr√∂mottagningin in Alings√•s, a good 45-60 minutes travel by public transport from G√∂teborg where I live, 91 Swedish crowns poorer. Just the previous week I had been at a hangout for young trans people arranged by RFSL as part of West Pride. Of the 25-ish trans youth there I might have been the only one who was actually getting treatment. The rest were too young or had been waiting in the queue (which I was able to skip due to my prior treatment), some for two or three years. When I saw the inside of the clinic for the first time, I couldn't help but think of them. There was complete silence, a very far cry from the hustle and bustle of the family practice where my mother works in Pretoria, or the peaceful but deliberate atmosphere of the mental health clinic where she spends her mornings. Nobody in the hallway, no-one at the reception desk, no-one in the eleven consultation rooms, no-one in the waiting room. Apparently this was the gender clinic meant to service the entire region of V√§stra G√∂taland. The queue is at least three years long. Why is it so empty?

Beyond a double door further down the hallway, I saw a couple of people talking in the distance but couldn't go in. So I waited. The silence was eventually broken when a woman opened the doors and disappeared into one of the consultation rooms, shut the door and marked it ""occupied."" Was there a patient waiting in there that I didn't notice before? The silence broke again when a man opened the doors and approached me - the psychologist I was meant to see.

The consultation lasted almost two hours. The psychologist was pleasant; reserved and thoughtful. His mischievous smile reminded me of my high school mathematics teacher. We spoke at length about my gender identity, my dysphoria and my transition. I am open about those things, but they are nonetheless painful to talk about. As I am a foreigner, he explained that Sweden works differently from many other countries. You need approval to get gender affirming care, and to get any of that, you need a diagnosis. Worse still is that a diagnosis requires a 1-2 year evaluation period. This means that if I want to get any gender-affirming treatment from Sweden anytime soon, I have to hope that a group of complete strangers is convinced that I am sufficiently certain of my gender identity. I expressed to my psychologist the anxiety that I had to convince him of my gender identity. He chuckled, saying ""I suppose so,"" before reiterating why it was so important to be sure.

Afterward, I felt as though someone had been scraping at the tender parts of my heart. Drained, sad and a little in pain. I had just exposed an intimate part of myself, a part which has in some ways caused me a lot of pain. The psychologist had remarked that I seemed honest and that my case seemed clear, but it hurts to think that someone might look at all that and not take it seriously; to not believe that I had thought it all through. So. Many. Times. And to find a reason to doubt me when I said that I had no doubts whatsoever, and then refuse to treat me because of it.

Maybe I'm overthinking it. Maybe I'm worrying too much. The psychologist said that he would discuss my case with the staff at one of the hospitals in G√∂teborg, and that I should expect a reply this week. We'll see.

EDIT: Typo."	"Thank you for sharing this. I don't know what your native language is, but your English writing is first rate.
Prepare to go DIY if they deny you, thats what most people do in Sweden until they get a diagnosis
I've been thinking about sweden, it seems like a cool place
This is part of why Sweden is ""trans-friendly"". After all, it's a lot easier to be friendly to people who are transitioning when the government gets to decide who is even allowed to transition!
That‚Äôs very kind, thank yoooooo! My first language is English ‚ò∫Ô∏è
Sweden has been lovely! Compared to South Africa it‚Äôs expensive, but it‚Äôs beautiful, nature is everywhere, the politics are stable and things actually work.

A friend who lived in Spain for a while made the same remark. :D  That there's always someone to call, and they respond, here in Sweden."	q689mk	trans	17	0.91	2021-10-11 23:05:43
Not sure what I want anymore. :( (Vent)	"When I first came out to my parents I was 100% sure I wanted to identify as a woman and have a feminine gender expression. I had those feeling for as long as I can remember. However, now that some time has passed and now having the ability to finally do something about it, almost all those feelings have vanished. 

The thing is, it fucking pisses me off. Like I really want a reason to transition medically (hormones only). The reason I say medically is that I love everything that it does. I want all the effects except one. I do not want boobs. I'm sorry but I have had a bad interaction when it comes to breasts. Being a fat AMAB has caused me to not like having boobs.

Okay, maybe I lied in the title. I do know what I somewhat want but I can't shake the feeling of having to be valid. Well basically my dream self is someone who has a flat but feminine silhouette and I want a feminine face. I really don't see any appeal towards socially transitioning for me. I don't really care for it. Like if I take hormones for years and I look completely female, I would not mind at all. Though I still wouldn't care about socially transitioning. To me, it's all whatever. If I get called a lady it's fine. If I get called a man it's fine. Now if I get harassed that is a different thing.

 I know I can't just pick and chose what I will come out as if I were to take hormones. I know the choice is up to me when it comes to the hormones but really I am making this post to see if anyone can kinda relate to me.

Also, another thing I really hate is the fact that all the things I'm dysphoric for are things that even hormones can't change. Like my giga hands, or my enormous feet. My broad build. My caveman of a face."	"I mean, transition goals aren't the same for everyone and it's okay to not want boobs!

It sounds to me like you might actually be nonbinary, genderfluid, or agender, or something of the like. There's a lot of different ways to identify, and I recommend doing a bit of research and hearing stories from other people in these communities to figure out what you really want to identify as. And you don't have to figure it out right away, just take your time and figure it out on your own. It can be stressful trying to find yourself, but you've got this!!
To add (forgot this part), you can get surgeries to fix things that hormones can't. Maybe you can't fix *everything,* but at least fixing some of it can help lessen dysphoria a lot! I understand not everyone can afford these surgeries, and I can't help much with that but I wish you the best!"	uhcjvf	trans	15	0.82	2022-05-03 09:52:07
what can i do to feel more feminine/myself?	"hi! i'm a 21yo transfemme and i've been looking for more ways to feel better about my presentation. i'm trying to shop for more undergarments and more fem clothing, i recently got a small batch of makeup supplies with help from my partner, growing out my hair, and i'm making an effort to keep up on body grooming and care but i can't help but feel overly masculine all the time. i'm also pre-HRT and from the looks of it pretty far off from that too unfortunately.
what are some things that helped you if/when you were in the same early stage of transition?"	"I think the big things that helped me pre-HRT were clothing, growing out my hair, and practicing female body language/natural female movements. The hair took like 18 months to feel good, and I had to learn how to actually take care of it before it really helped. Not looking like a slob/box helped too - I started wearing more fitted male clothing, tried out new necklines, worried more about outfits as a whole. And maybe it's silly, but just the gesture of tucking one's hair behind an ear and sitting with my legs crossed by default did wonders for my self-image.
I heard painting nails works
thank you so much for your reply! thankfully i already have a few effeminate mannerisms so i have a head start, i do usually dress in very baggy/oversized shirts so maybe i should look into more flattering/form-fitting clothes or feminine accessories to work with my current style
Just be cautious when starting with more fitted clothing. While it did great things for me, it can really play into dysphoric emotions. For example, a bulge being a bit more evident, male-pattern fat made more obvious, lack of mass in the chest being highlighted. Just take your time and know going into it that this styling might not be what works for you. Best of luck ‚ô•Ô∏è
What I started with when I couldn‚Äôt bring myself to wear femme stuff openly was to wear excessively femme undergarments. It helped the acceptance of myself. I also found that silly, slightly femme, very obvious accessories made a huge difference. For me it was cat ears. I bought them as a test to see how people would react since I‚Äôd just moved to new state. The reaction was overall super positive. To the point I still wear them and they‚Äôve become a basic part of who I am. It helped me not take myself so seriously and just have fun with what I wore. Which is a big hang up with being a guy and probably the hardest habit to shake in my opinion."	rtled2	trans	18	1.0	2022-01-01 15:21:27
Honest Question: How do I combat jealousy and pain when hearing about people who transition early / have supportive families like that?	"I absolutely would never tell them to their face that they‚Äôve done anything wrong, because they haven‚Äôt. It‚Äôs a *good thing* they were able to transition early, to get help and support from their family, community, and doctors.

It just‚Ä¶hurts. Hurts to the point of tears.

I want their life, their family, and their support *so badly*. Every single time I see someone saying they transitioned in teenage years / childhood and they‚Äôre fully done by 16 or 18? It‚Äôs fucking agony. I‚Äôm happy for them, and I fight every day to make sure other young people have access to trans care and trans affirmation. Still hurts.

Feels like being left behind. I‚Äôm already alone, had to fight tooth and fucking nail for what I have.

They got it handed to them. That‚Äôs *good* but it fucking hurts it hurts so bad because their parents paid for everything and got everything done and supported them through it all. And I was alone. I had to fucking fight for every cent I had, saving pennies to get top surgery‚Äî

I was alone when my body gave up processing testosterone correctly, and I was alone when I had to stop. Alone when I fought the court system to try and get my name and gender changed. Alone when my top surgery got fucked up.

They‚Äôre not alone. Medically transitioning at a young age almost guarantees support from parents and the community and doctors‚Ä¶

That‚Äôs fantastic. Truly. I‚Äôm so, so, so relieved that there are others out there getting that.

I just‚Ä¶wish it was me too, that‚Äôs all.

How the *fuck* do I get over it? Fucking get over it and move on because I didn‚Äôt have support, I was alone, and it doesn‚Äôt matter because the past is the past and it‚Äôs done, now.

Please help me.

I hate being hurt and on the edge of hurting others. Inevitably making this post outs me as an asshole, hurting early transitioners anyways. For that, I‚Äôm sorry, if you‚Äôre reading this."	"Redirect your anger towards people who are transphobic and who stopped you from achieving your goals. Politicians who are passing transphobic laws, the healthcare system that didn't cover your top surgery and people who abandoned you. They are to blame.

See people who transitioned earlier as your siblings. No need to be jealous of them. We are all in this together.

Sadly jealousy can't just be stopped like that. A bit of jealousy is understandable. I get it too. I usually catch myself when I realise my jealousy and remind myself that others deserve to be happy. 

Hope that helps. I understand why you would be jealous. Being trans especially without support is hard.
my dear friend. I hope I can help and get the correct message across. I am not amazing at getting my taught across in written form so please know this is coming from a place of love and wanting to help. I am more than happy to DM more if you want. 

&#x200B;

First I would like to say part of the issue you are having is from assumptions. Just because someone transitioned early does not mean there was no hardship. tears shed. maybe it's more on the parents than the child but this is not easy for anyone. Possibly the parents worked two or three jobs to help their child. I guess to sum it up we dont know anyone story excpet our own. we only see the cover sheet 

&#x200B;

We all have a rough road to walk. I know your pain. I am 37 and started my journey a year ago even though I would have loved to start as a child it never would have happened for several reasons. 1 my parents are hardcore religious,2 they have no money so even if the support would have been there (it would not have been) they would not have paid for anything. 

&#x200B;

This is not an easy journey for any of us. sometimes it's about making it better for the future better. That is what I focus on.
I think I understand how you feel, in one of my classes at school I got lucky enough to have a transwoman is my class (I say lucky because I rarely see trans people irl). She is around my age 18-20 and she is pretty much fully transitioned, I didn't even know she was trans until a few weeks before the end of the semester and she is absolutely beautiful and it just made me feel so jealous, I thought about her life and so the good thighs that she has and then I look at mine and it just breaks my heart that I can't have any of that, at least not in the best future. And also, we are in an art class together and for the final project she decided to use some of the estrogen prescription bottles and when I saw that it was like looking at the remnants of a treasure that I could never find, there were so many bottles meaning that she had been in hrt for years now. It makes me feel bad that I feel so much jealousy but it becomes very difficult to be positive about the future knowing that my body will keep destroying itself if I don't do something about it.
There was something on Andor along the lines of: ""We're fighting for a sunrise we'll never see."" and for some reason your comment reminded me of that. I'm not saying there's no hope, just your line about making it better for the future really hit home.
It does hurt some days more then others. Myself I find if I build other up my mental game is very high. Focus on the negative and I get really low. I love this quote even with the sad undertone it gives me hope."	zmmv61	trans	18	1.0	2022-12-15 14:48:26
Parents denied transition, feeling hopeless and awful [TW]	"My parents came to me (15 MtF) this morning to tell me they would not allow me to medically transition. I have been making progress with them for 1 year now, and I thought I was finally getting through to them, but they have now taken a huge step backwards. My ‚Äúegg‚Äù cracked almost 2 years ago, and came out to my parents a year ago, and I thought they were supportive, but it turns out they will not support my medical transition. They are mostly positive when it comes to social transition, it took 7 months for them to agree to use my name and pronouns, but they are doing so mostly consistently now, and are letting me buy clothes and come out to more people, but refuse to allow me to start my journey with medical transition. They want me to socially transition fully and live as myself for an arbitrary amount of time of their choosing, which of course they will not tell me, and get a full diagnosis from a qualified expert gender therapist before they even think about it. I have been seeing a regular therapist for 9 months now, who is very supportive of me, but her opinion is not good enough for my parents. Knowing how parents often are, after I do what they want me to, they will likely extend the wait time.

Male puberty is wrecking me emotionally, and rapidly eroding my mental health, and it is continuing to get worse and worse every day. My parents are forcing me through male puberty, and I am afraid that by the time I can get access to medication, puberty will have irreversibly damaged my body, and will worsen my results from HRT down the line, and this is very distressing for me, as I am at a time in my life that I can start medication before all the damage is done, and I will almost certainly regret not starting now, and mourn the years of my childhood I am losing now. 

My country (UK) does not have a functional healthcare system, it has wait times of 4 to well over 10 years for trans patients. There is only one private service that allows patients under 18, which my parents despise and distrust, as some pharmacies do not agree with how easy it is to get hormones from them, and it‚Äôs founder is no longer qualified to practice, as our government and healthcare system did not agree with how she prescribed hormones to under 18s, and didn‚Äôt always provide adequate follow up care.

My mental health is getting worse and worse very quickly and I fear that I will end up dead by my own hand in coming months and years, as my last hope for medical transition has gone, and dealing with increasingly severe gender dysphoria for another three years is not something I can manage. I feel like I no longer have a future, and it really hurts. 

My current school is a brutal and barbaric hellhole, and I have faced extreme bullying for the four years I‚Äôve been here, it is not safe to come out to them, as I would likely be in danger doing so. My classmates are incredibly bigoted, and would make my life into even more of a hell than it already is. My school separates boys and girls, and I would continue to be in boys-only classes after coming out, even if the school wanted to, they couldn‚Äôt put me in girls classes due to timetable issues, and the way exams work in the UK. I have to spend another year here, then I can either move to another school, and risk more extreme bullying (with no medical help I will be a long way from passing), or apply for an apprenticeship position somewhere, and try my luck at getting a job, which would be difficult as a 16 year old, especially after having to deal with workplace transphobia at such a young age, although the money would be very useful to pay for private care and to move away at 18, and I could make up for the rest of my education by taking evening classes at 19 or in my 20s post-transition, which seems like a very risky option. It would also be harder to leave the country (which I plan to do) because getting a student VISA without many education qualifications would be very hard to do as far as I know. So I cannot access medical care, and I cannot move out, and am left to the will of my parents.

I told my parents how upset I was that they were trying to control my body, and my dad said ‚Äúwe are not controlling your body, we‚Äôre resisting you from controlling your OWN body‚Äù

I am very upset, and feel hopeless and depressed, to any of those still reading, thank you, what should I do next?"	"Prevention you from controling you body is literally the same thing as then controling your body. They are just forcing the option inaction gives on you. (By this same logic making abortion illegal is also not controling people‚Äôs bodies)

Sorry that I don‚Äôt have a lot of advice though. Maybe look for a school that does not segregate classes by gender? That might help a little bit, but I have no real experience with this (in my country schools don‚Äôt segregate classes by gender. It just seems the absolute worst that would have made my life so much harder back then even though I still saw myself as a girl back then)
Have you tried talking to your parents about puberty blockers?  It might be a middle ground they could agree on so at least your body doesn't continue to develop in a way you don't want.

This article does a good job of covering the pros and cons of puberty blockers.  Maybe you and your parents could read something like this together and have an honest conversation about your concerns with their proposed plan.

https://health.clevelandclinic.org/what-are-puberty-blockers/
You're still young and have so much of your life ahead of you, the one thing I'd implore you to take on as a fellow UK citizen is to be patient, your parents will be skeptical, especially if you are an only child as, chances are they've never experienced something like this before. They're uneducated, which is not always their fault. They're likely as confused as you are, which is not to say they are in the same situation, us trans folk struggle day to day with our identity and so on, but you need to understand that they likely want what's best for you, as evident by their supportive yet hesitant nature.

Try and think optimistically about these things, you've came out to your parents at SUCH an early age, that's fantastic. From my experience, going through puberty is not a huge deal and will not affect your hormone treatment much at all later down the line. The best thing you can do right now is keep your options open. Contact your GP if you're comfortable and certain and get a referral ASAP, then you're already on the waiting lists and can be on your way to transitioning. When you're 18 it's not really up to your parents what you do with your body, until then try and enjoy your teens. Relax and continue to make progress with your social transition.

As for school, I honestly can't say as much as I wasn't even dreaming about coming out at that point of my life. Was way too scary a concept for me. But thinking back, I'm certain if I'd told a head of year or my personal tutor about things they could perhaps understand and give advice or make you feel more comfortable in your situation. Preferably someone you trust. The way I see it there's different bubbles within your social transition. For me it was my various friend groups, family, and work. Coming out to one group might be harder than another. But you start with one person, one you trust the most in that group/bubble of people and gain some confidence. At least then you have some ground to build from, you get what I mean?

I know this is all hard trust me I've been through it all and I wish I had the courage to come out when I was 15. I also understand the frustration behind the waiting game after you've come out and want to start moving forward with your transition but you need to understand these things take time, but you have to think of the end goal here and think of how much happier you will be at the end of it all. That's how I and many others got through it, so stay strong for me and please feel free to reach out if you need to talk, love you and don't ever let anyone tell you you're not beautiful üíñ
Yeah, most schools in my country don‚Äôt do that either, my school is just weird
The only way I could get access to blockers would be through GenderGP, which my parents don‚Äôt like
Ah.  I'm sorry to hear that. ‚òπÔ∏è

It might still be worth having the conversation though?  I think your parents really care about you, they just can't understand what you're feeling right now.  It's so far outside of their experiences in life that it makes no sense to them.

I'm not saying that to make you feel like your experience is invalid, it's definitely not!  I've just been surprised at the conversations I continue to have with my family members because they just can't make sense of it.  So you might just need to keep talking to them about it in a calm and logical way."	w74pk8	trans	17	0.85	2022-07-24 20:12:47
I need to talk about a thing...	"Hey, 

So, I'm gender fluid. I've decided this is a fact, thank you all for your help in previous posts. 

I've been in therapy for a couple years and I've been medicated for depression anxiety and adhd for over a year now as well. I am doing MUCH better. The problem is... well, you know how when you clean the dirtiest spot on the floor, suddenly it's so clean you notice the rest of the floor is dirty too? Yeah... with the big trio out of the way I'm discovering tons of little traumas and things that I've been holding onto and not addressing. One of them, involves me being trans. 

So I've been with my partner for almost 3 years. Our anniversary is actually in a couple weeks now. He is unbelievable. He is patient and kind and supportive, sweet and caring, and just so so so amazing and I am horrendously and pathetically in love with him. And he's in love with me too. Trust me, he makes it pretty obvious <3

This is all going to connect in a minute.

There wasn't a whole lot of info available about gender and sexuality when I was a kid. I don't think I even heard the term transgender until I was in high-school. I'm hindsight there were a lot of instances where, with even the most basic information, I could have connected the dots. 

The fact is, in a perfect world, I would love to transition physically. I would be amazingly happy to have a man's body instead of my own. I have so many moments over the course of each day where I notice the little things that would feel more right if my body was different. And it took me a long time to recognize those moments for what they were. So long, that I've moved past my choice to change. 

Now I know that it's never too late to transition, and there's always a choice... However, my partner loves me and I love him, but he wouldn't be attracted to me if I transitioned. He would probably still love me, I know he would support me... but we're both sexual and monogamous and we couldn't live like that. He wouldn't be happy, and neither would I. So when I say I've moved past my choice, I mean I made that choice. It was either my body, or the love of my life. And I chose the love of my life. 

I'm not unhappy, I'm still fluid and there are many days where my body feels fine the way it is, most of them, in fact. But I still sacrificed a lot to have this. It's worth it, I'm positive it is. A piece of my puzzle is always going to be missing though. I'm in mourning. I gave up something huge, and even though I know it was the right decision for me, I still need to take the time to be sad about it. I'd talk to my partner, but I know he would feel like it was all his fault and he'd carry that guilt forever. It would kill me to put that on his shoulders.

I guess I just wanted to share how sad I was, that things turned out this way. That I didn't figure myself out when I was younger and transition before I met my partner. That we fell in love and created this space together that I could never give up, not even for something as important as myself. That my ideal self and his aren't compatible. That this was a choice that I had to make. I need to be sad for a while. I needed someone to know how sad I'm going to be for a while. I'll pick myself up later and brush myself off because at the end of the day I love my life, I love my partner and for the most part, I love myself. 

But for now I am going to be sad."	"Your feelings have been noted.
If you‚Äôre sure about every part of this, then mourning that part of your life not being optimal is entirely understandable. Perhaps one day, things will change

To make a long story short because this post just isn‚Äôt about me, I‚Äôve recently started... exploring my sexuality a bit, going from straight to... mostly straight (not sure what the phrasing would be exactly as I haven‚Äôt given it much practical thought) and now, I‚Äôm a bit more open to (as a certain princess Jasmine might say) a whole new wooooorld

I‚Äôm saying this because it‚Äôs a possibility that things might change for your partner as well. Very few things in life are permanent and when people grow, they sometimes grow out of old ‚Äúnormals‚Äù so don‚Äôt let go of your decision to transition just yet. Things might work out for you ~
Hey, as long as your happiness equation is still coming out in a positive way for you, honestly, then you're making the right moves. I'm non binary but AMAB and my body and appearance is pretty masc. Not much i can do about being shaped like a lumberjack, and most people will default to he him regardless, so I just functionally exist as a man and it's more bothersome some days than others. I feel you! Take the time you need to be sad and process. Honestly dabble in some masc presentation elements that could help you feel more at home in your body! I just got my ears pierced, my nails are usually painted, sometimes I'll wear eye makeup, and having those signifiers of femininity really helps my gender feel more expressed? Idk Just something to think about.
wow, thank you for your rawness and vulnerability. I felt the pain in your words. I love you, you are not alone. thank you for you, you are perfect just the way you are
Just try and talk to him, when your ready.üôÇ
It might not be as bad as you think
Thank you, I'm definitely sure. I hope you're having fun exploring your new fantastic point of vieeeew! xD 

You're right, there's always a possibility for change, thanks for reminding me. I'd hate to get my hopes up, but I can acknowledge that nothing is set in stone and be open to change should the opportunity present itself. It's funny, I use that on my friends all the time, but appareny I haven't taken my own advice. Good thing you were here to tell me!
Thank you. Honestly just getting it out there has made me feel a whole lot better. 

That sounds awesome, I'm glad you have some things that help you feel feminine sometimes! I've gotten kind of lucky, I got that birth control where they shove a stick in your arm and that caused my periods to stop completely which is huge in making me feel more masculine. I keep wanting to get into some kind of upper body exercises so build shoulder, chest, and arm muscle, but I'm not good at it, and being sweaty makes me hyperaware of my skin, which isn't so fun. But maybe if I try some other masc things I could feel more comfortable in my skin and try again. Thanks for the suggestions and the support!
Thanks, I love you too! I feel a lot better getting it all out. It's going to be a process, but I've felt a lot of love and support from the community and I know I'm going to be okay <3
I have talked to him about most of this, actually. I didn't tell him how deep it goes, or how sad it makes me, but he knows the surface and it's already so much better than I had thought. He's been so sweet and supportive and he's never had a single negative thing to say except that he was sorry if I felt like he was holding me back from anything (which he isn't because I made the choice not him). 

Maybe I will bring it up with him again one day down the road if things change. It's nice to know I have so much support if I do make a different decision later in life. Thank you for your advice, I'll make sure to be open with him if I ever need to.
I also HATE working out but I'm learning. Keep it up!! Im glad the BC helps too. Being comfy in your genderqueer identity is a marathon!
I/m so glad you did, we are here for you. your courage is outstanding and your truth is always there, no matter what shape it takes <3
A marathon is right, it's too long, exhausting, and I wanna give up every time I trip! xD lol. Good luck working out!"	nc3c3s	trans	17	0.92	2021-05-14 08:06:01
I just need a little encouragement, if that's okay.	"Hey y'all. First off, thanks for being beautiful. You've already helped me figure out a lot.

Maybe a little too much, too fast. Start to finish I've certainly taken my time considering this - my first inkling that I may be trans was winter '16/17 but my dumb ass never thought to look for trans subreddits until a month or two ago, and all doubt was removed from my mind VERY quickly. I'm also a very vocal proponent of being a very vocal proponent, and am fortunate enough to live in a liberal state with leftist friends, so I came out the moment I was certain. Even at work, they're calling me by my name despite being (almost) pre-everything. I haven't gotten anything but support from the people I know irl and it's been amazing seeing the outpouring of love, but that makes me feel so much weaker for crying away the weekend while browsing reddit and facebook looking for anyone to talk to long enough to distract me from my perpetual breakdown.

I feel like I've been working through 30 years worth of unbearable emotions in a single month. All the doubt, the fear, the torture I put myself through trying to live like this. All the hatred for my own younger self for putting this aside, for failing to see what's now so obvious, for not taking the opportunity when I had a better job with better insurance and more free time and was still living with my family, all of whom would have supported me just as strongly as they are now but from down the hall, not across the city. When I was young enough for more to happen, and faster, and better. When I was young enough to take advantage of the clarity and serenity that I've only ever been able to grasp for brief moments of drug-fueled dissociation before this past month. I know regretting it isn't going to change it, and I know there's an astonishing number of wonderful people who only figured it out when they were twice my age, but I can't help feeling awful and I don't know how to move on.

I'm terrified of what's to come. Even putting aside the risk of social ostracization (my job is very community-oriented, at that), the risk of hateful people destroying my body (which has happened to a family friend, even here in liberal country), the risk of medical complications, the risk of financial disaster (I was scraping by before I started looking into treatment), nothing in life has ever demanded so much sheer effort or commitment. I've never cared about anything like this transition, and the idea of actually having to work for something for the first time makes me wonder whether I even have the fortitude to do so. I care enough to put in the work...I think? I care enough that not knowing whether I do is crushing.

Feeling anything at all is terrifying me. None of my self-abuse ever felt wrong or worth changing because I couldn't imagine a life worth living, but now that the door is open I'm actually hearing the insults I hurl at myself, and they actually hurt. I'm looking at my yellow-ass teeth that were never worth taking care of, and my bones that are creaking before their time. I'm looking at my empty savings, and looking back at the years of drugs and alcohol that burned through the money I could have put toward school or surgery or fucking anything that would have lasted. I can't stand what I've let myself become for the ignorance of what I could become, and it feels like the mistakes I've already made have ruined my potential.

Even now that I'm finally doing electrolysis and vocal training and going to see a doctor about some skittles later this week, I'm just crushed by the injustice of being born this way. Life shouldn't have to be so goddamn hard, and as sure as I am that things are gonna get better and easier, and as patient as I know I need to be, and even though I know I'm doing everything right and I have everything going for me, I just want to hit the ground at mach 4 and be done ten years ago like I fucking could have. My first job paid as much as my current one does, god damn it. 

I'm so fucking tired of crying."	"I can't offer much encouragement since I'm in a similar place myself, but you're definitely not alone.  We'll get through this!
I hear you. Better than I wish I did in fact! My life wasn't amazing but what I had all fell right apart and I don't resent that, or regret anything about that in itself (Mainly because the things that TRULY matter to me outside myself, i.e. my relationships with others, are mostly intact), but I do sure as hell beat myself up for being so oblivious for so long. If I had realized this ten, fifteen years ago I could have saved myself a hell of a lot of trouble in the long run.

And I definitely understand what it's like to not even know how to handle the idea of working to better yourself, or thinking of yourself as worth improving, worth liking and loving. Why bother with exercise, I thought, I could get as ripped as Arnie and I know I'd still be just as unhappy?

BUT!! Here's the important thing: It's not too late. People like you and me may not have everything squared away how we want, and we can always look back with hindsight and say ""I sure wish I had done [X] instead of [Y]"", but we also need to keep an eye on tomorrow. Because maybe it's not going to be perfect, but as long as we keep working towards our goals, it promises to be a hell of a lot better than the past.

You're not alone, but we are going to be okay <3
I‚Äôm in a pretty shitty situation too. And all I can say is you have to imagine a future in which you‚Äôre happy. And in which you are genuinely and authenticity yourself. You‚Äôre never alone in these thoughts. And the future can always shine bright. Keep taking all of this day by day and allow yourself to learn, heal, and once again, be yourself. 

Stay hydrated 
Trust me, it gets better... Today was the best day of my life, and I was at work. So many great days to come!

Do I cry a lot still? Yes. But that's the hormones. Life is so great once you find yourself x

Having someone else understand is as encouraging as anything. Besides, when it's someone else the mom in me comes out, so...I guess I'll read this back to myself tomorrow, haha.

Darling, you've already suffered through the most difficult part: Living until now. Holding on despite death calling to you. Maybe you haven't had the depression I suffered myself, not everyone does, but as far as I'm concerned if you're not living your authentic self then you're dying, and you're DONE WITH THAT. Just by getting here and admitting to yourself that this is going to be worth it, you have already demonstrated that you ABSOLUTELY have that insightfulness, self-love, and strength of character that's going to pull you through. You have already demonstrated that you know you won't go it alone, and you can let yourself be weak sometimes, and you're not any less perfect for relying on people for help. You have already found the support systems that you know you're going to need through these trying times; you're using them right now!

Look, maybe it took you a little while to find out who you are, but you still have so much life left in you. You still have so much left to give, and as tired as you're going to feel working through all the new experiences that this is going to bring, that light within you that's finally shining through is going to get brighter and brighter until no one who sees you walk in the room can help but gawk at your brilliance. Don't you think for a second that flame was ever out, though. You've always had a beautiful soul that you couldn't hide from people if you tried (and you probably have been), and that's why your loved ones, your liked ones, and even your tolerated ones are all proud to see you letting it blossom.

You already know there's nothing you can do about the time you already spent. There's nothing you can do about the youth that's gone. And there's no way you wasted nearly as much of it as you think you did. Every lesson you learned, every bit of pain that built up that empathy, every scrap of happiness that made you think there could be more out there; If they've turned you into a virtuous person who you can be proud of, even through the hell that's surrounded you, there's a good life in there. You've also made plenty of other mistakes that could have brought you down plenty of other paths in your life, but how many of those do you still regret? No matter how many years it's taken you to come to peace with them, you did come to peace. There is always a way forward, and as hard as it is to finally care, it's that caring that's gonna get you making the right decisions to turn your life into the best it's ever been.

Maybe you will struggle financially or medically or socially, but who's to say you wouldn't have? My finances were already in dire straits because of the life I had to cope with. My body is already neglected because of the life I had to cope with. Trying to maintain a social life was already like a nightmare carnival because of the life I had to cope with. At least now you'll be struggling to hold on to something you want, instead of just struggling to hold off from finally ending it. When you struggle, it will be with conviction. When you struggle, it will be with purpose. When you struggle, you will be Alive, and for all the pain you will feel, you will be rewarded with the serenity and love that you have always deserved but which struggling has never brought you before.

Take your time to mourn the past, my love, but don't let it drag down your future. You've suffered more than enough already. The future is ready for you.

PS Don't you dare think a single word of this is a platitude. You've got this, girl.

Want vs Need when speaking about transitions	"When cis people talk about transitions I find they tend to say that the word want when discussing somone undergoing transition. In a coming out convo with a nurse today she said, that she ""doesnt care if a man wants to be a woman or vica versa..."" . I found the same thing with my wife when I was first talking to her after I hatched. Does this ever bother anyone else the way it apparently bothers me? I corrected my wife and said it's not something I want, it's something I need. If I wanted something it would have been not to feel discomfort in my body to begin with for 37 years. It almost makes me feel like it's seen as no different than material things like pants.

Anyone else see it this way or am I being overly sensitive about it, maybe just splitting hairs? Am I partially stuck in a odd state of acceptance?

What do y'all think?"	"I honestly hadn‚Äôt thought about it before, but yes, it bothers me too. It‚Äôs kind of how I feel about ‚Äúpreferred pronouns‚Äù - I don‚Äôt *prefer* them, they *are* my pronouns.
I think it‚Äôs because the vast majority of Cis people are ignorant to what being trans is, and they see it as a choice. Hence the use of ‚Äòwant‚Äô. 

It bothers me too.
I think you're spot on.  There's a great deal of misinformation and lack of information about transgender identities and such, so I think cis people are more likely to be ignorant of what being trans is and that transitioning is a treatment for gender dysphoria.  

Like all treatments, not everyone **needs** the same thing, but people generally speaking need to transition just like someone with a headache needs to relieve that pain.  So, all in all, yep it bothers me too, because it indicates a lack of understanding.
Yeah I dont want to be a man. I am unfortunately a man stuck in a female body. My procedures are medically necessary and if I dont have access to trans healthcare, it could prove fatal. 
Cancer patients dont chose to have chemo. Why is it any different for us? 
I hate people
Well I guess I gave you one and then you handed another right back. Lol. Damn right though, it's not a preference to be called by the gender or nonbinary pronouns that we are. I get why people ask, and appreciate they care enough to ask but just drop the ""preferred"". We should run a PSA I think."	tsa420	trans	17	0.95	2022-03-30 16:18:41
Don't know how to approach an employee about a peculiar situation.	"I manage a gentlemen who has decided to start cross-dressing (maybe transitioning, who knows, who cares) for work.  I have zero issue with this.  I support him 100 percent and have made it clear to him that if he ever feel slighted or some type of reaction he's not comfortable with that I am here to address that with whomever.  My team has accepted this and it is of zero issue as far as I am concerned, accept...

The problem that I find myself facing is the provocativeness of some of the clothing choices he's making.   Some of his skirts are exceptionally short.  shorter than a  mini skirt.  Also, far too often his undergarments are showing (bras, camisoles etc.). 

How can I approach the topic of some of his clothing choices are work appropriate, with out alluding or it being inferred that its because he's not dressing in traditional male clothing. 
"	"There are standards, depending of what your workplace requires: business professional, business casual, etc. And so I would either forward those workplace standards, or have a woman from HR explain it in more detail if needed. 

But, if your workplace is street casual, and woman at the your place dress the same, then there's not much you can do.
This is unfortunately why HR departments and written policies are a thing.  But as long as you're sure it's also inappropriate for a woman, you should be able to tell him pretty much the same thing you said here.  If he makes a fuss, do something more formal like write a gender-neutral policy that applies to everyone. 
Weeeeeeeeell... If you don't want to offend, best thing you can do is have a team meeting to go over the dress code again. And refer to each item of clothing in general, don't separate male and female dress codes. ""If you wear shorts, they must be this length, skirts they must be this length."" A good way to make sure they don't feel personally attacked, but it also may come off as passive aggressive.

Alternatively, just be forward. ""The outfits you're wearing would be inappropriate for work regardless of gender or gender expression.""

That's all I have.
This is why dress codes should be written, in clear language, and gender neutral. You'd be able to explain that skirts need to be a certain length, for example. 

I've been on the receiving end of this type of situation, and it was incredibly awkward because the manager couldn't just point to a dress code. I wasn't a crossdresser though, just trans. It was night shift, not working with customers, and I always wore shorts to the mid-thigh to stay cool in the physically demanding job. My direct supervisor had obviously been told by someone above her to get me to stop wearing them. 

I recommend seeking the advice of HR. Assuming there's a dress code there, you can point to it. If it's not gender neutral, then tell the man that he has to follow the parts related to the articles of clothing he's wearing. 
[deleted]
This is good advice.  Most teenagers go through an awkward dressing phase as they work out their own style.  A lot of trans people do the same thing, but in a later life phase when people are far less accepting. 
> ""The outfits you're wearing would be inappropriate for work regardless of gender or gender expression.""

Actually, I still think that could be interpreted to mean ""Don't wear skirts or dresses whatever you say your gender expression is.""

I would re-word that to ""Although it's fine that you've been making different clothing choices recently please do make sure that your choices are work-appropriate. Please do avoid things like skirts shorter than your fingertips and visible undergarments.""
But we don't how they feel about being called gentlemen. OP only referenced examples of gender expression and stated that they don't know how this person identifies. There doesn't seem to be any reason to avoid calling them gentlemen, except to be safe rather than sorry.
I don't mean to just leave it at that. Obviously an overview of what outfits would be considered work appropriate would be necessary."	6nco8t	trans	17	1.0	2017-07-14 23:26:20
Psychedelics + Trans	"Has anyone been on intense plant medicine psychedelic  journeys, pre or post transition,  and have some interesting  insights to share regarding being trans? 


I see there are many posts here  regarding acid and shrooms and people having great experiences. What about Ayahuasca,  San Pedro, Iboga, DMT....?

Was it gender affirming? Did Ayahuasca 'feel okay' about the medical processes that are a part of transitioning? Did DMT help you not care what others thought? 

My motivation  for asking.... I'm interested  in supporting the trans community and I find psychedelics a super useful tool."	"Psychedelics definitely show this physical form is only temporary. If that helps or not I don‚Äôt know.
 Or to crazy but do a bunch of shrooms a while ago and definitely had lots of euphoria and deep thoughts on my journey while on my trip. Plan on doing more soon to see if it helps again. Probably right before I talk to my doctor next.
Acid always let me just let me have fun and let go of shit I carry around. Helps me speak my truest thoughts and be my truest self.

Shrooms is always 10 years of therapy packed into 8 hours. It's rough, but when I feel the call it's worth it.

DMT wasn't super mind opening tbh. It's fun and the after glow is great. Can't say I took anything away from it though.
Psychedelics would always cause me dysphoria. I tried so hard for 35 years to keep myself repressed, but anytime I did shrooms I would get lost in thought loops about my gender and self hatred for a couple hours and then get depressed when I sobered up. I stopped doing them for about 10 years. I did a single hit of acid on new years eve of 2020 and while I didn't get much visually, I spent almost 10 hours lost in a downward spiral of thought loops about how much I hate myself. I came out to my wife and began my transition in September of 2021. Now that I have accepted myself I'd be curious to see how my trips might change.
Sorry for another shrooms take but I haven‚Äôt gotten to share this yet!  

I did 2gs golden teachers, which I learned quickly was way too much for me.  At the end of the trip, I had stopped dissociating - which is something I had slowly been doing more and more without my knowing since around puberty.  No dissociation meant I was in tune with my emotions, and suddenly I was WITH myself again.  

I no longer felt trans.  I just felt like me.  I got up to go to the bathroom, and my posture no longer needed to be corrected.  It just was.  My self view no longer needed to be stabilized.  It just was.  I realized that a lot of those things are leftover from the masks I put on and without my dissociation, there were no masks.  I was just me, beautiful and human.  I realized that the reason I wanted to engage with certain behaviors was because of how we socially code gender, and that without this social coding, I didn‚Äôt have to adhere to anything.  I just was.

It was a wonderful moment that taught me a lot, and gave me a new relationship with being trans.  I AM a woman, I do code my existence that way, but only because that‚Äôs where I sit in this little intuitive binary we‚Äôve made for ourselves.  If we had a third gender that stood for ‚Äúacts like a woman but becomes more of a goblin past 5pm EST‚Äù, that would be where I sit instead of ‚Äúwoman‚Äù, as an example of how our definitions box us in.  I‚Äôm perfectly happy with our binary and where I identify within it, but psychs helped me realize I am me and the binary is the binary and maybe I don‚Äôt have to perfectly fit it and maybe it doesn‚Äôt have to perfectly fit me for me to be perfectly okay with being on one end of it, whereas I am very much the opposite of comfortable when on the other end.
I created a community called r/transtrips to delve deeper into this topic! Some members of the community might be able to provide you with answers!

Side note‚Äîwould love to see rigorous polls/research done on gender identity and psychedelics, considering the plethora of accounts that exist on it. Possibly something r/transtrips could help organize someday.
Completely off topic I'm sorry, but I had to laugh, my MDMA addled brain turned the title of this post to ""Psytrance"".

Somebody shoot me please xD
Mushrooms severely reduce my dysphoria, Acid helped me find my identity. Acid told me that I am who I am no matter what and nobody can take that away from me, labels don‚Äôt matter. It‚Äôs hard to really put into words exactly how it helped but it freed me from a lot of societal expectations and standards and now I‚Äôm content with being me. Also acid for me was extremely gender affirming, since I just entered a state of pure existence without my ego holding me back. Really dismantled my entire perception of gender.
Just give me a little bit of all of that and stand back and watch the magic happen buhahaha
12 years ago I took Salvia and realized ""I'm not real, I don't exist, my family is going to be so mad when I tell them I don't exist."" Turns out that was my brain going, ""Hey dumb dumb, you're trans."" But I was too dumb to realize it. ü§£ü§£
First and only time I did psychedelics was when I massively overdosed on shrooms in 2019, only realising I was trans last year and only beginning transition this year.

I'm of the belief now that Shrooms only enhance and reveal emotions and ideas that were already present, but back then I became convinced that I was God and that my consciousness was the only one that existed. Solipsism, basically. I had lots of touch based hallucinations rather than visual ones, textures changing, feeling things that weren't there, etc. I was disorientated even though I was laying in bed whilst everyone else was asleep the whole trip.

I think a lot of what I felt in retrospect highlighted my extreme loneliness and desire for connection with another. I literally felt so alone that I guess I didn't believe others existed, and I felt like I was more of a spectator in my own life, merely distracting myself. Back then and to this day I'm a virgin who had never been in a relationship, and this fact hit me harder back then because I still didn't understand or like myself. That's why a drug trip can feel more like seeing a hidden truth of the universe rather than understanding it as a reflection of yourself.

I'm glad I had the trip, but I definitely had too much, it was definitely rough, (I had to force vomit the shrooms out of me because the trip started going bad and I couldn't sleep) and I think I would have figured myself out without it. I don't think it directly contributed to my trans realisation, but it's still something I like to refer back to and think about every now and then as a reference to my overall emotional state.
Thanks for sharing! Sure does. If you're up for sharing more, do you think it makes you stand stronger in your trans identity / pursuit to transition or, in want of a better phrase, care less about the physical manifestations of your body and more about your internal identity?
Was going to write my own but i like yours, this is a good basic summary in my opinion. I'll add, DONT TRIP IF YOU ARE IN A HORIBBLE MOOD.
Oh wow. Thank you so much for sharing. It sounds like the trips were always a negative experience, which is definitely  not what you want. Do you think there was any causation  between that 10 hours of downward  spiralling / such a negative experience and you coming out to your wife?  As in, did you think ""ok I really need to do something about this?""

I too am super curious if your trips would change going forward. Perhaps your mind would be like ""Thank  you for finally listening too me!""
Amazing!!! I look forward to watching transtrips evolve! I'm glad to see other people are super interested  in the space too.

Half of me thinks facilitated psychedelic plant medicine  journeys could play a massive role in helping trans people seeking gender affirmation.  The other half of me thinks it could be labelled as an attempt at conversion  therapy, which is not what we want!
It's possible. I'm 9 months hrt and still in the closet to most of the world so I still have a bit of mental baggage and stress to sort though. Maybe once I'm out and living as my true self I'll give it another try."	x8qqxx	trans	19	0.94	2022-09-08 04:44:04

I don't deserve to be trans	"Being trans is, at least for me, a way of finding happiness. A getaway to finally be me and show a version of myself that I actually care about and am proud of.

That's why I fell I shouldn't transition and just get into the closet forever. I don't deserve to be happy. Im a horrible person who hurts people. I do EVERYTHING wrong, not once in my entire life i've done anything correctly.
Im a failure, in every way. I should just get into the closet and die horribly. I should be punished for even thinking of being happy when i've done nothing to deserve it.

I hate myself with every fcking atom of my body. I hate me."	"Get therapy bae. Self hatred is dangerous and contagious
I mean, yeah it does kind of suck to not be happy with yourself. It would be more effective of a statement to just say that though. Might be a monkey's paw scenario. Ask for what you actually want; you want to be happy with your body and identity.
If you really believed this you wouldn‚Äôt tell people, some part of you knows that you want happiness and that the pain isn‚Äôt helping you but you haven‚Äôt been given permission by yourself to seek it overtly, and culture teaches shame as a virtue.

No one can fix it all in one go but I‚Äôll say this for now

Life doesn‚Äôt have an accountant, every act of good stands alone and does its own work in the world, so do the bad acts but you may see them apart from one another with your experiences.

Doing good means doing good by people and you count as people, if there are people you love you count amongst the number of a kind of creature you have already demonstrated love for, it will take time and some brain tricks but you may one day fall into the arms of your own kindness

Self improvement is difficult and long and painful but it is worth it always and finally

The amount of pain you‚Äôre in proves beyond a shadow of a doubt that you have a strong heart, it is about time to work on turning that immense power from self hatred to gentler things, for yourself and others.

Good luck, hero, I believe in you because I believe in me. We can both move out of the shadow of guilt and find contentment for ourselves.
Sad to read your depression.
I can relate, at least, few years ago.

Nodody deserves to be trans.
Everybody deserves happiness.
If that means, your have to transition, so be it.

But
It all starts with good portions of self esteem.
Get some pro help to take care of your current mindset, so you will feel happy as trans.

Take care üåπ
I used to have a ton of self hatred pre transition, it gets better hun, all those thing you hate about yourself now don‚Äôt have to be you after transition, during transition you give yourself a second chance at life, learn to breathe for the second time and be who you truly are on the inside, the things we done in the past, are forgivable because past you is not present you, every fuck up you learned from, every hard lesson you gave yourself, can mold the true future you as you desire to be. Don‚Äôt think you don‚Äôt deserve a second chance at breathing before you even started, it may take baby steps, but any step towards self love is progress in the grand scheme of your lifetime. Your mind sounds as plagued as mine was all the way up to my first day of Hrt, I have these thoughts plague me much less now then it used to(maybe a few days out of the month), help is out there, new chances exist to be taken. Don‚Äôt kick yourself down, lift yourself up and give yourself the happiness you deserve, because anyone can have a change of heart, and deserves another chance when they learn from their past. Sending hugs your way, hopefully you find the path to self love, sounds like you really deserve it. ü´Ç
same
Maybe finding your own happiness is the route to making others happy and being a better person.
Use your transition as a new start, because it is.  You were pretending before, trying to live by what society said you were based on superficial criteria.  The you inside is deeper and more complex than anyone else will understand, give the real you a chance to shine through and be better going forward.
Finding yourself might be the only true path to genuine happiness. I have thought back to how horrible of a person I have been and how I have hurt people. It‚Äôs not my fault, it‚Äôs not your fault. Your real, valid, and an incredible human being for just exhausting. All of the failure, disappointment, and crunching things of the past don‚Äôt make up who you are on the inside. They are a result of a person slashing out for love, acceptance, and understanding. Every single human deserves this. We deserve the right and purist of happiness Trans or not. Your past is your past, it doesn‚Äôt have to be your future. If you choose to walk down the path of being right and one with yourself, then everything else will fall into place. People will make their own decisions and we can‚Äôt control others. The only thing we can do is focus on what we can control. Take one small step forward and then breath. Then another and another until your walking down the path toward who you truly are. Fuck every thing else and everyone else, choose you, choose happiness, choose a life worth living‚Ä¶As impossible as that may seem from your current vantage point.  The world will not understand when you go against the ‚Äúnorm.‚Äù Isolation and emptiness are the unfortunate part of doing something great. Every inventor, and pioneer in the past/present have been told that what they are doing is impossible, never going to work, and that they are wasting their time and efforts to try and change or make better something that ‚Äújust is what it is‚Äù if they listened to the voices inside and out telling them they were invalid, mentally ill, and sun human we would still believe that the sun revolves around the earth. There would be no electricity, cars, Planes, medicine, internet, ect ect. My point is, this is our calling. Invent yourself. No one cares until you‚Äôve already made it, done something great. Doing something great starts with taking one small step, looking around to see that you‚Äôre still okay and taking a breath. Then don‚Äôt stop taking steps. Giving up on who you are may seem like the only thing you deserve but that is the furthest thing from the truth. The truth is you are who you are and nothing will change that. The truth is you can only be something for someone else if your true to yourself. The truth is that no matter how you feel (which is very real and valid) you have the potential to be and do something great. If you ever need to talk reach out.

I know what it feels like to have thoughts similar to these and it comes from a place of depression.  There are resources out there for you and people who care.  Please take care of yourself, friend.  I wish you the best
\>  I do EVERYTHING wrong, not once in my entire life i've done anything correctly.

Oh, yeah. I know that feeling.

The thing is, if you're trans, that feeling is practically inevitable.

Follow me here: I don't know if you're MtF or FtM, so I'll use myself as an example and you can make any necessary conversions for your situation.

I was AMAB, right? And like a perfectly ordinary kid who had literally no way to know differently, I *believed* them when they told me I was a boy. And they told me I was supposed to do boy stuff, like the other boys.

But of course I'm not a boy. I'm a girl. My brain is wired for girl stuff. Boy stuff was like trying to do everything behind you while looking in a mirror and wearing oven mitts: awkward, completely unnatural, and hard as hell. Definitely the hardest possible way to do anything.

So of course I did everything wrong. All the time. I just couldn't ever get the hang of boy stuff! I tried, though. Wow, did I try! I just couldn't do it. Other boys made it look *so easy*, and I just couldn't understand why I couldn't seem to do it. Like, *at all*. (Both the doing and the understanding, there).

No matter how hard I tried, I couldn't fit in with boys, I couldn't successfully date girls, and I pretty much just always felt like I was six steps behind everybody else. Like somehow everybody else had always been given the critical information about what to do in literally *any* situation, and I'd been left out. Nobody gave me the memo.

Which was basically hell on my self-esteem, because there seemed to be no reason for these problems. I'm not dumb. I'm not disabled. My parents didn't move me to a foreign country or anything. And yet... I still got everything wrong. There seemed to be no explanation for it except to conclude ""well, I guess I just suck."" Nothing to conclude except that I was a super weirdo loser freak.

Then 45 years into this torture, I figure out I'm trans. And suddenly it makes sense: the reason I can't do the boy stuff is because *I'm not a boy*. Of course it's hard! I'm not wired for it! Somehow, when I was born fate put my arms on backwards, hung a mirror in front of my face, and slapped oven mitts over my hands. Of bloody effin' course it's hard! Jesus.

And because it was this way from the moment I was born, I thought it was normal. I didn't even realize other people have it differently.

Now I know. Wasn't my fault it was all so hard. Wasn't my fault I couldn't ever do it right. I never had a chance to the girl things that would have been right for me!

I feel a lot better about myself, now that I understand why so many things were so very hard for so very, very long. And it's the same for you. Now that you know you're trans, you know *why* it has been so hard. You know *why* you've made so many mistakes along the way. It's because life wasn't playing fair with you.

The question then is, do you deserve to suffer as punishment for failing to win a rigged game?

Or do you deserve to take your *fair* shot at happiness, like cis people get?

Transitioning is the only way you un-rig the game. Life has been dealing you cards out of a stacked deck for long enough.

As for happiness, well, no matter what you do there's no guarantees in life, right? Nobody, cis or trans, simply *deserves* happiness. What we all deserve is a fair chance to *pursue* happiness. It's that fair chance at the pursuit of happiness that has been denied to you. Whether you actually get the happiness is kind of up to you and what you do with your fair chance.

But so long as you're still trying to live life in the mirror while wearing oven mitts, your chance will never be a fair one.

I, for one, fully intend to ditch the mitts and start living life forwards, just as soon as I can possibly arrange it.
There was a time I felt the same, generally, not just about this topic. You might not see it, but you worth a lot, not any less than anyone else you know. I hope you feel better soon, or one day in the future

I just wanna go back to your post and point something out to you- ‚Äúnot once in my entire life I‚Äôve done anything correctly‚Äù - well, what about the decision you don‚Äôt deserve to be trans? If you think you are right about this, then that isn‚Äôt true. And I know you probably think I‚Äôm pointing out something very little, but it‚Äôs actually the whole point. Don‚Äôt belittle yourself. Everyone can be and is wrong sometimes, many times. But like anyone, you can and are very right sometimes. In case you think you‚Äôre wrong again, well- I got some good news for you:), if you think you‚Äôre wrong, you are right that you‚Äôre wrong ;)"	w1evs4	trans	18	0.83	2022-07-17 19:11:09
FFS with Zukowski Dec 2020	"Hey! I just wanted to post this because I know how helpful it was to see posts on Reddit about ffs dr.‚Äòs and other people‚Äôs experiences that helped me decide on a surgeon that was right for me. Overall Dr.Z is know for his aggressive approach and that was important to me because I feel that I need a lot done to help with dysphoria/passing. I‚Äôm only 19, and this was my first surgery so going through with this was scary, but overall I had a good experience. I had almost everything the dr. Offers done during my procedure, hairline advancement, forehead contouring, brow bone shave, rhinoplasty, cheek implants, fat grafting (temples, cheeks and lips) chin and jaw contouring. To be totally honest with you Dr. Z is a great surgeon, he‚Äôs really.. like REALLY to the point about everything and his personality is strong, but respectful. I got to Chicago on 12/15, the person I went with who would be taking care of me for the week and I got settled into our Air bnb then in Skokie, IL. Which was about 1,000 for a 10 day stay + 150 in food so plan for that. Met with cole the night we got in to sign & initial the huge intake packet which took about an hour, I‚Äôm the 17th at 5am I went in for surgery... yikes I was super excited because I knew this was a huge step in my transition but also a little nervous. The Anesthesiologist and nurses were all SUPER sweet and made me feel so comfortable so huge shout out to them! Once the iv went in, it was lights out for me. I could tell some time passed by (I think like 6-7 hours) but it felt like minutes and I remember being lifted off the operation table on the recovery bed, even though I couldn‚Äôt see anything I felt this, then feel back asleep and re awoke in the recovery room. And Ngl to y‚Äôall this part was BRUTAL! Not being able to breathe was so scary, and not being able to swallow for a hour or two was painful. The compression was tight and I was in a lot of pain and on a lot of drugs. My pain tolerance is high but I was almost in tears until day 2. Tbh I don‚Äôt remember much from the first 2 days other than waiting for the dr to come to where I was staying and remove the tight compression fabric around my face. Showering was easy but way wayyy more exhausting than I thought it would be, because I slept the whole day after. As the days went on the swelling went down and by the 5th day I was able to eat a full smash burger and fries (took a while but doable). Here‚Äôs a link to how I‚Äôm looking on day 13. If you have any questions don‚Äôt be shy to comment or pm me :)

Today I shaved off my denial beard	"And I feel great! This hatchling has cracked the egg and is ready to take steps toward transition.

I never considered that I might be trans until very recently (30mtf), I was raised mormon and was believing up until 4 years ago which left very little room to consider anything about my gender or sexuality until recent years, I married young as good mormon boys do but after my beliefs crumbled away I started to get a handle of my sexuality my marriage was unable to weather the storm.

I've never really been able to feel happy despite my life being pretty damn awesome on paper, I've always had this dark passanger weighing me down and a deep dissatisfaction for life even at the best of times, up until last week I had just been hoping I would die so it could all just be over with... but then I stumbled upon someone elses experience that sounded strikingly similar to my own, I would have never considered the darkness inside me could be caused by gender dysphoria but then it all started to make sense as I reflected on my life and provided me some much needed peace to the internal shit storm that has been going on inside of me for the entirety of my life.

I feel surprisingly calm and happy right now, I feel excited at the prospect of becoming more feminine despite the reality I will get little support or understanding from my mormon family (I care very little about this btw), I will probably lose a handful of friends eventually but probably not ones worth keeping anyway, my wife (seperated) who is still easily my best friend knows how I feel and is supportive, she really does just want me to be happy and has seen how I struggled during the 8 years we were together, she is going to help me buy a few things tomorrow.

Its early days I know but I just wana say a big thank you to this community for being such a wholesome place, all the support I have already recieved vicariously through shared experiences and the support I will get going forward from you beautiful people."	"I'm 17 and in a Mormon family as well. I'm sorry to say that I know how toxic it is. I'm sorry you had to go through that but I'm excited for you that you're starting to find yourself and be happy. Your emotions are valid and I hope that you find some very supportive and loving people to help you
Congrats! enjoy your new skin.

I have denial long hair I don't know what to do with. 
I am lucky enough to have pretty much disconnected Mormonism completely from my life and moved on, I was in enough denial that it didn't effect me so badly during mormonism and looking forward to death honestly fits mormon beliefs perfectly fine so I just accepted how I felt as normal or as a ""trial"", my only connection back now is through my parents whom I live a very long way away from so its only present when my mum tells me about all the stuff going on in her life.

I will probably move soon to a more trans supportive country, the country I am in right now is very everythingphobic and would probably be dangerous to stay in and is absent of any community or support. My wife with whom I sperated from post mormon mainly due to my sexuality has been really supportive and even helped me buy makeup basics and some clothes yesterday, she will always be in my life because we have kids together and I know she loves ME not my gender, this sub is great and full of support :D

If you ever wana talk a out trans exmormon stuff lmk :)
Sure you do, thats why its called denial :D

I consider myself a lesbian, my partner is ftm trans and wants to start HRT	"I love my partner so SO much. They are the best partner I could ask for; very loving, caring, and uplifting. I want to be with them, and nobody else, we are committed to each other and are planning our lives together. 

They want to start HRT, and I am so anxious about it. I want them desperately to be happy and their best self. I am nervous that once they begin their transition, I will be less attracted to them. I don‚Äôt think of them as a woman at all, because they are not. They are very androgynous looking. But it took me a long time to recognize I am a gay woman, and I just don‚Äôt think/know if I am attracted to masculine features. I‚Äôm so afraid, because they are my love, my favorite person in the world, but what if I no longer recognize them as the person I fell in love with?

I have a history of catastrophizing things, so I‚Äôm thinking I might just be psyching myself out. But, has anybody else been through this? How did you get through it?"	"r/mypartneristrans might be a better place to pose that question. I know my wife probably went through the same thing as you she said it was a good resource
its ok to be worried but know he is just as worried about this as you. if i were in your shoes i would let him transition and find out if you are still attracted to him. there is nothing to say you can‚Äôt continue to be friends after that. but the only way to find out is to let it happen
Be careful, everything depends only on Your thoughts and wishes. I haven't got trough, but all my life is falling appart because I am MtF and my beautiful and wonderful wife can't take it anymore :(
I am goi g through that right now. Let me know if you want to connect.

Came out to my boss, and he was surprisingly nice!	"31yo trans woman, work by myself for a small company managing a retail store, with other stores in town. The business owner came by this morning to drop off some stock, and I could tell he noticed I was dressed very differently than what he's used to seeing. So I decided I'd just tell him I'm transitioning, and he was a little shocked at first, but then was immediately being nice and supportive! He's calling me by my preferred name, asking about government support for transitioning, wondering if there's anything covered in the health care package he has for his staff. Super nice.

*Trigger warning on being outed for this next bit* (but it ends well!)

He had to head out a bit quick, so I didn't get a chance to mention anything about talking to staff at other locations. A friend working at the biggest store in town texted me to say that he went in and kinda blurted out that I'm trans to the staff, and (after a moment) I was actually happy he did! I'm far enough into my social transition that everyone I'm close with knows who I am, and now I don't have to awkwardly tell a bunch of newer employees I don't know ü§£

I'm still going to tell him that he should not to tell other people without consent. üòÖ"		t1ax8u	trans	16	0.87	2022-02-25 18:30:33
Came out to my mom, she was angry I didn't tell her sooner	"I (20 ftm) finally found the courage to tell my mom I'm trans. She was expecting me to come out as a lesbian and not as a man, but she didn't care. She was more upset that I didn't tell her sooner lol. I was expecting her to maybe be upset that I've scheduled my first T shot without telling her, but she didn't care about that either. 
It feels like everything's finally coming together after so many years of deliberating transitioning or not. None of it feels real, but it does feel right. 
Life is looking good. I'm happy to be trans. üè≥Ô∏è‚Äç‚ößÔ∏è"	"Congratulations dude! I think as she seems really supportive she just wanted to be with you. And support you however she will now be able too as you continue your journey
Happy to hear it! I‚Äôm sure you‚Äôll find the whole process gets much easier as time goes on. For me, I went from being scared to wear feminine clothes out in public, to having my name legally changed and known to all as a woman. The nerves go away as you begin to just embrace your changes!

FOR YOUR CONSIDERATION: Skin Care	"The skin is the largest organ in the body and is one that‚Äôs overlooked at times. Some of the transitioning men and women might not know what to do. I‚Äôm here to help.

Some background. I‚Äôm a cisgender heterosexual male who‚Äôs dated their fair share of trans women. Grew up with multiple sisters, but had to teach myself about skin care. Going to drop some information for the men and women of this subreddit.

**TL;DR**

* Drink water -throughout- the day. 1/2 your bodyweight (lbs) in ounces at -minimum- but up to 1-2 gallons.
* Use SPF lotion every day including ones with an overcast.
* Gut health is important so mind what you eat and consider (key word) pre/probiotics and/or fermented food.
* Research your skin type.
* Can be dry, oily, combined, or combined with leanings towards dry or oily.
* Build a routine and keep it simple.
* Not including makeup.
* Check the water hardness of your area and use a filter on your shower head if necessary.
* Replace cotton sheets and/or pillow case with polyester, silk, or copper.

Look up YouTube channel ‚ÄúDoctorly‚Äù that‚Äôs run by dermatologists for your own research. Personal skin care routine is as follows. Keep in mind this should be referenced for guidance and not a strict step-by-step.

**SKIN TYPE:** Combined

**RACE/ETHNICITY:** Caucasian

&#x200B;

**AM**

* Purity Oil-Based Cleanser
* Witch Hazel w. Cotten Pad
* Vit C Serum
* COOLA SPF 30

**PM**

* Purity Oil-Based Cleanser
* Witch Hazel w. Cotton Pad
* The Original Retinol (0.5%) in Squalane. Let dry for 20m. Use only x5 /week.
* BHA and/or AHA (chemical) exfoliator. Use on the other x2 days /week.
* The Original Hydrating Lotion

**ADDITIONAL NOTES**

Getting prescription Trentinoin soon to add to my skin care protocol. Neutrogena is a simple, possibly low-tier, but decent (BHA) salicylic acid. I also use this x2 /week on the rest of my body as opposed to a buff puff or mechanical exfoliator. A bentonite clay mask with turmeric, water, and apple cider vinegar (ACV) for 30-45m. Specifically 4:1:1:5 of clay, to turmeric, to ACV, to water, to ensure the acidity level is appropriate for the skin‚Äôs acid mantle. Measured in tablespoon for all ingredients. A water filter is used with my shower head that needs frequent replacement with how hard the water is in Texas. My normal cotton pillowcase has been exchanged for a polyester one as it ‚Äúcatches‚Äù the skin and hair less. This will be replaced with a silk or copper one at some point in the future."	"Exactly!!

Unsupportive partner	"So I‚Äôm just curious if anyone has had a similar experience to me and could offer any insight. 

I am AMAB and in my late 30s. Been married for about 5 years. After moving out of the South (southern United States; very conservative and transphobic culturally) and into a big city, I‚Äôve started to question my gender. Haven‚Äôt really landed anywhere yet, feeling sort of non-binary, but still sort of feel like a man, but also I get gender envy from women on the regular. It‚Äôs a mess. üòÇ 

Anyway, my wife has historically been a good ally for queer people. we have a decent number of LGBTQ+ friends and acquaintances and she is very supportive of them and careful to gender everyone correctly even when they‚Äôre not around. But she is just not accepting me. Keeps telling me that I‚Äôm making a mistake, and that she ‚Äúknows me better than anyone‚Äù and so her opinion on that should bear some wait. We‚Äôve also been having other marriage problems for awhile and she says she could have the emotional space to be more accepting if we could fix those problems. 

I haven‚Äôt even done any sort of transitioning other than grow my hair out (which she loves and has been trying to get me to do so I could have a ‚Äúman bun‚Äù for years) and shave the beard I‚Äôve had most of my adult life (which she absolutely hates.) 

it‚Äôs been about six months and she‚Äôs still showing me old pictures of myself with a beard and telling me how much she ‚Äúmisses that guy.‚Äù And the only other conversation she‚Äôll really have with me is to double check and make sure that she‚Äôs still ok to use gendered terms (and it is still), which would be sweet and thoughtful, except when I say yes, she always says something along the lines of ‚Äúgood, because ‚Äòhusband‚Äô is really special to me.‚Äù

Anyway, we just started seeing a therapist and I‚Äôm hoping that will help, but I‚Äôm just curious if anyone has had similar experiences and if so, did they eventually come around? 

Thanks for reading my rambling!"	"That's really hard, I'm sorry you're going through that. I can't say I have experience in this particular area, but in my experience, communication is very important in relationships. Have you sat her down and explained to her how hurt her actions are making you? It sounds like this behavior is already driving a wedge between the two of you, perhaps the best thing you can do is sit her down and tell her exactly how her behavior effects you?

I won't lie. From an outside perspective it really seems like she's more in love with the idea of having a spouse than the actual person she's married to. 

It's important to know what you want too. If your end goal is for example, getting bottom surgery, your wife *needs* to be okay with the idea of that outcome or it will inevitably drive you two apart. (It will likely drive you apart if you just don't transition too. After all, part of your brain will correlate her with your continued negative gender feelings.
[removed]
I wrestled with my gender identity quite a bit a while back, and there was a point where my mood got really low. My ex, trying to be supportive and objective, wrote me a note, part of which read ""I don't think you're trans, I think you just don't know who you are yet.""  


And for a while, I took that to be true. I was depressed, I am still depressed, and I still have anxiety about a million and one things. And, even though I only came out a couple of weeks ago and I'm still wondering if i made the right call, the fact that telling people I'm trans feels right and the fact that I'm wearing a skirt, gaff, and tights while i write this feels right, and the fact that being called she/her feels right is a pretty big indicator that i made the right call.

You know yourself. You know you're trans. Your wife may just need some time to catch up with you. I hope that she does, and that therapy helps you both.
Honestly at this point in my life if anyone says a phrase like, ‚ÄòI know you better than anyone‚Äô in regards of using that to tell me I‚Äôm wrong to transition, I immediately soak them in metaphorical gasoline and light a match. It‚Äôs toxic, it‚Äôs gaslighting, I‚Äôm sorry you‚Äôre dealing with this. It‚Äôs normal for a partner to have some reservations about their loved one transitioning, mine of at the time 15 years together did, but you know what she never did? She never told me ‚ÄòI know you‚Äôre story better than you do, here let me tell it to you‚Äô She told me she was scared for me and for us, but she never doubted me, she doubted the world we live in. It‚Äôs good your in therapy, just know your not there for you, you‚Äôre there for her. Sure maybe there is some stuff you can talk about that does relate to you, there‚Äôs bound to be, you‚Äôre human, so be open to change. But not this. She doesn‚Äôt get to tell you who you are, because she ‚Äòknows‚Äô and ‚Äòloves‚Äô you best. If she knew and loved you at all she‚Äôd listen to you. I hope you can get there with her. But honestly, don‚Äôt let her say that to you anymore, it‚Äôs gaslighting her too, this idea that she can love someone by knowing them best, that‚Äôs not how love works, love is not known, it‚Äôs continuously learned. Best of luck to you.
She is technically both supportive and unsupportive.

Let me explain:

She doesn't support your decision because she feels like she will lose you in the process of transitioning. But she definitely doesn't want you not to be happy so she is being supportive to an extent.

I only know this because I'm in the exact same situation you are. Most unsupported people will usually take things to the extreme which can be hurtful.

The following example is strictly for this scenario:
A couple who gets married, got marry because they have attraction to the opposite gender. When one of the two discovers their gender identity, usually one will object because that isn't the gender they fell in love with.

This is where the complication happens.

Going back to my scenario.

I have only done things like paint my nails, shave, put make up on and wear the clothing that fits my gender. I want to transition with HRT as a next step but my spouse is against it because she does not want to be with a woman she wants to be with a man.

They have gone through so much already that I don't want to abandon them or send them off with some other man. I have my morals and will always be a trans woman but to them I am their man. So for the time being, I will be putting my transition on hold till either she no longer needs my support or accepts being married to me with my new body.

Only time will tell.
Thanks so much for the thoughts. I‚Äôve tried to some, hoping to get into that more with the therapist there to referee a bit.
Thanks! I may take you up on that! You‚Äôre certainly welcome to DM me for the same!
God, thank you for that. brb, storing that last sentence in my heart forever."	ytbddv	trans	15	0.81	2022-11-12 16:16:47
Coming out to my girlfriend *gay panic* (FtNB)	"I've been waiting for many months to talk to her because she's been thru so many medical issues in the past year (needing an emergency spinal fusion and...a slew of other baggage), so I didn't want to add my problems onto hers until she was better off.
 I think tonight is finally the time. I'm so fucking anxious, and excited. We've been best friends since we were pre-teens, so I'm fairly confident that she already knows I'm nonbinary and won't be shocked, but I think the surprise will be me wanting to pursue medically transitioning to be transmasc. 
So...here goes nothin, guys. ü§ûü§û

UPDATE: 
I was having a lot of trouble blurting it out, because words are hard (I have scrambled egg brain). I asked her to guess and she said, ""Are you trans?"" 
I froze, then explained what I want to do. She wasn't shocked, which I was kinda expecting or at least hoping for - but like I'd guessed, the starting T part was the surprise. Long story short, she said that she has no problem with it, supports me, wants for me to be happy, confident, and feeling better as soon as possible.  She was already pulling out her computer to help me find doctors/where to start.
We didn't have nearly enough time for me to go over everything (there's a lot...I've been holding this in for a very long time), so I'll be having a more in-depth conversation in a little bit (excited!!). She supports me changing my pronouns and name as well (thank god!). But we have to keep it hidden from her family as well as mine, because it'd just make our lives even worse (her family is ridiculously toxic). But that's cool, all I care about is what she thinks of me and I'm happy. She's gonna ride by my side thru this journey and I can't wait to start it. ;_;"	"Hi friend!! You got this!! If you ever wanna chat, my dms are always open ü•∞ keep us updated! ü•∫
You‚Äôve got this . I came out to my girlfriend a few months back . Then starting both medically transitioning and socially. It‚Äôll be a challenge. But if she loves you she will accept and take take this journey with you . You got this .

Wow. Awesome. Just like my story with my fianc√©. She was so excited to help. When I told her she said ‚ÄúI fell in love with you. Not your gender.‚Äù My heart leaped and has bin racing for her ever since.

Aww.. :'l  I didn't think anyone would genuinely care. So that makes me feel good. I don't have any support from family (obv) or even close friends, so your kind words mean a lot to me. Thank you so much. <3
Thank you. I appreciate that
That is too precious. Agh. I'm so so happy for you. <3 ‚ú®  that's what we dream of. Idk where you are in your journey but I wish the best to you guys.
And thank you so much. That makes me really happy. I don't have any family support, or even friends lol, so every little bit means a lot. <3
I‚Äôm at the end of my journey. Only thing left is to make it true on paper. My girl was also my basically only support. And shockingly enough my coworkers. And even more shocking my Republican coworkers. They have bin my biggest support. I know that sounds weird. 

The journey was hard. And at times had to be walked alone. But damn at the end do you come out stronger, more confident, and completely sure of yourself. I for the first time in my life know myself and am present in every moment of every day. So thank you for your kind words. If you ever need any advice you can call on me. Or anyone on here really.
That's so nice to hear. X) I'm really glad you found support in coworkers, because having to be around people that make you uncomfortable every day can really take a toll on your mental health and all. 
That also gives me hope that I will come out later feeling more sure of myself. I always feel so indecisive, about basically everything, it's terrible. I just want to know how I truly am, and to like you said, feel present! I have hope. 
Also thank you for the kind offer. Knowing I can reach out if I need to is comforting. I'm still unsure of many things, but I won't figure it out until I try"	s9sdue	trans	16	0.94	2022-01-22 02:58:12
Am I overreacting by feeling hurt over what my friend told me?	"I was talking to my best friend yesterday about my dysphoria and stuff and she told me that she would probably only get used to calling me by my name next year. As in, at least 5 months from now.

I know it's hard for other people to get used a friend's transition but her comment hurt me a lot and I don't know if I'm just overreacting? We see each other every single day at school and she constantly messes up my name and pronouns. I came out to her 2 months ago.

Again, I know it's hard for others to get used to calling their friends a different name and such, and I know that after just 2 months it's still very early to expect her to be 100% onboard with the new name and pronouns, but next year??? I don't know, it just makes me feel like she doesn't really care that much about getting it right, or considers how much it hurts me everytime she misgenders me. She also made the passing comment, after I told her about my anxiety around passing next year when I enter college, that ""those physical changes don't matter, you have to worry about coming out to others first"" (I'm only out to two irl friends). Like, I get it, she's right but also, those physical changes are quite important to me? Dysphoria is quite literally ruining my life right now? I just feel like she refuses to see how fucking shit everything is to me or how much I need comfort right now because being trans isn't this funny thing I decided to do overnight but a constant fucking burden that's debilitating in every sense of the word. I really thought she'd understand me better because she's queer, and she does in some aspects, but the whole ""crippling self-hate"" thing seems to fly over her head.

She also told me, after I had a mental breakdown over my dysphoria and feeling like I'm missing out on important life events by not being able to participate in them as myself, that I'm just causing myself problems and that I shouldn't complain if I refuse to come out so I can do all of that stuff that I want. And again, I know she's right! It just sucks because I came out to her after months of feeling super depressed and lonely dealing with my dysphoria all alone. I just want comfort you know? Instead, I was told to stop moping. 

Gosh, perhaps I am being too dramatic? I don't know, this week has been shitty."	"Though she may be right, it doesn‚Äôt seem like she understands that starting out your trans life can be like being stuck between a rock and a hard place. That being said, I totally understand your frustration w / r / t her giving a long estimate for when she‚Äôll finally accommodate your name and pronouns. When I first switched to he/they, I was very excitedly talking to my roommate about what it meant to me. He said ‚ÄúHonestly I‚Äôm just going to keep calling you ‚Äòhe‚Äô bc it‚Äôs easier for me.‚Äù It was rough and I still haven‚Äôt forgiven him for that even though we‚Äôre still friends. I learned that I was going to have to sympathize w myself and love myself if I was going to get anywhere, something I‚Äôm still trying to internalize. I hope your journey becomes a bit more bearable soon‚ù§Ô∏è
I shouldn't read too much into your friend's character bc there's only so much that can be told from your post, but she comes off a bit thick.  Two fucking months?  Five fucking more?  Come on.  I can see why you feel like she doesn't care.

 It definitely sounds like you're stuck in your head about all of this, and don't have many if any around you that you can confide it.  That fucking sucks.  Expanding your circle so you're not just leaning on one deadbeat will do wonders but how easy that is depends on your disposition and location.

You're in a shit place right now, that's clear.  The bad news is that digging yourself out is on you, even if that means reaching out for additional help.   The good news is that, at least as it seems to me, you have a real valuable opportunity.  You figured it out young, and are primed to be completely out by college.  You'll get to be your whole self with your entire adult life ahead of you.  That's just...really fucking cool.

Apologies if this isn't helpful, and good luck with everything in any case.
Did it take your friend a year to memorise their own phone number or postcode? Step back and realise all that you are asking for is to be called your correct name, that's it."	wxw4p0	trans	16	1.0	2022-08-26 01:50:33
I‚Äôm not at risk of losing my HRT, am I?	"Recently had my second ever appointment for gender affirming care and it alarmed me. I'd spent the time between appointments focused on general life stuff (moving and settling in, namely) and had not progressed with social transition. But, as is clear from the way the doctor grilled me about it, he was expecting me to make major progress since the last time he saw me.

To be honest, I didn't think I'd have to justify the level of progress I'd made in my personal life to him. I just thought he'd ask how the HRT was working out for me and if I had any further questions about it and the appointment would stay focused on the medical side of transition. 

To be clear, he never said he'd take my HRT away if I didn't progress to his satisfaction. But, as he is the one holding the gate to my HRT meds, there was the underlying implication. I was put in a position of making excuses for why I hadn't made more progress- and I don't think those excuses were unreasonable, but, yes, I could have made more progress if I'd really committed to it. 

It's just scary, okay?! Everything about this is scary. Joining and LGBT club or support group is the next step and to a social recluse like me that's the most intimidating step so far. (Since the appointment I have entered a submission to a Stonewall trans support group but have yet to hear back.) 

He also said if I wanted to present as my correct gender then a safe and welcome time for me to do so was at future appointments with him. Which is great, except that, in the context of the rest of the appointment, he's made me feel, however unintentionally, that I *have* to come to my next appointment presenting as a woman lest he think I‚Äôm unserious about this. I'm not nearly ready for that!

Is losing my HRT something that might happen if I don‚Äôt satisfy him with my rate of progress in social transition?"	"Sorry you have to deal with what seems to be a gatekeeper - no one should have a say about your priorities, presentation or whatever, it's \_your\_ journey not their. If ever possible you may want to find a better therapist - one who doesn't try and forcefit you into their view of who you should be.
You can start to look for a new doctor.  That bedside manner sucks.

A doctor should treat you like an adult.
I have a friend who didn‚Äôt socially transition at all until she had been on E for a year, everyone moves at different speeds
How is that not sexual harassment? A doctor insisting that you dress more femininely when you come to see him?
I would sure hope not. Regardless, you shouldn‚Äôt have to fear that your HRT is being dangled over you like a carrot that can be taken away if you don‚Äôt act the way that physician wants you to. You deserve to feel not only safe, but respected. 
Go at what ever pace makes you feel most comfortable especially as you make the changes that make you feel like you. I‚Äôd recommend finding another provider who can provide you with the care you are looking for so that you don‚Äôt even have to remotely stress about losing your HRT. ‚ù§Ô∏è
Depends on where you are and who you see,
Its not impossible for it to happen, but its unlikely, and it shouldn't. It would be extra bizzare for there to be requirements (which only happen in super outdated and regressive places) and for you to not know about them, far more bizzare than what has happened.

It does sound a bit inappropriate/full on and that sucks, I'm sorry. But from the distance view over here, it does sound like there's a lot of anxiety over this without anything definite. I'm definitely not trying to bypass that, and its not my job to make up your mind, but there could be possibilities like him just having bad ideas about what transition should be and caring (again inappropriately) about it actually going well and being a well matched process for you? 

Like that's actually something respectable medical practitioners do (but is hard to do right) and I support that (\*in general, not this specific case\*). Its kinda of a thing that should be there but is also slippery ground. Here I am thinking about what Dr Powers said on this: ultimatly it is informed consent, but duty of care demands they try and help you to be making good decisions. 

Could this be a case of that gone wrong?

Ultimately this could be something to consider actually talking about if you don't think its going to blow up in conservative rage. Cause that opens up the doors to things like easing your anxiety, him gaining more perspective, understanding, etc. Of course it depends on where he is coming from and if he is listening which we can't judge for you. But for most reasonable peopel there's a good chance that could improve the situation rather than just being under this (unverified) thumb which you don't quite know exists, forever.

You could simply mention that you were confused/concerned/X by 'our conversation last time' and would like to know where that is coming from and if there are any particular expectations?
Gross. I had an endocrinologist suggest I dress more femininely next time I came to see her and this was back in the 90s. Even back then my psychologist, an intensely mild mannered guy, got pissed and said she needed to fuck off with her gatekeeping.
I don‚Äôt know that he is threatening to gate-keep me. I do know that I walked into the appointment unconcerned and walked out afraid and feeling like shit. Was it necessary for him to press me that hard on my plans for social transition? Or to describe joining a LGBT support group as my ‚Äúhomework‚Äù? And is the social side of this really any of his business? Apparently, he feels that it is.
Get a new doctor.... then complain.
He did not insist on it. He said I could. Which is something I otherwise would appreciate. The problem is that, given how the rest of the appointment went, there‚Äôs now an *underlying implication*, which he *probably* did not intend, that I‚Äôd be putting my HRT at risk if I don‚Äôt.
I mean, I know it‚Äôs anxiety over nothing definite. The point of the thread is to try to get a sense of whether anxiety is warranted. Not really, it seems. The advice you give is good. He wouldn‚Äôt blow up in conservative rage; I‚Äôm not worried about that. 

I think it will just require a course correction on my part, now that I know what to expect. I could go in and explain that I‚Äôll go at my own pace and don‚Äôt want to be pressured, and I think, having been reassured by your comment, that would probably work. 

But, a kick in the butt isn‚Äôt such a bad thing. Like I said, this appointment was what got me to go through with putting in a submission to that trans support group. (Though, I still haven‚Äôt heard back. Need to call the Stonewall Center and ask about it.)

I‚Äôll challenge myself to have new progress to report to him every appointment. Still, while I can chalk it up to the ‚Äúduty of care‚Äù you mentioned the way he seemed to take on the role of a therapist (such as by giving me the homework of joining an LGBT club/group), I resent that he left me too intimidated to ask him other questions I had come in intending to ask (about progesterone, namely).

Edit: Should probably not forget to mention; this is a doctor that prescribed me HRT without delay or hesitation. As alarmed as I felt, it would make little sense for him to start gatekeeping now.
Even still? Someone in a loose position of power hinting that you can dress more femininely when you come see them next is pretty gross

Like, imagine that in any other situation. Imagine it's a cis woman teacher and the male principal tells the teacher that she should feel safe to dress prettier around him"	10ti2un	trans	15	0.84	2023-02-04 14:48:02
Florida is about to deal a major blow to trans healthcare	"[A few hrs ago](https://twitter.com/ZJemptv/status/1553572825847533574) the florida dept of health published their trans healthcare ban, set to be voted on next week on [August 5](https://twitter.com/ZJemptv/status/1553573565601136642). This includes:

\- No puberty blockers for anyone under 18.

\- Mandatory 24-hour waiting periods for treatment, along with filling out new informed consent forms for HRT and sex reassignment surgery, which are littered with misinformation.

\- Forcing providers to give patients state-mandated misinformation.

WTF is this? All of the data here is so extremely cherry-picked my eyes are rolling backwards by 50 miles. If they can threaten the licenses of doctors who provide this care, does that mean transitioning in general will be outlawed? This is politicizing medicine and will harm thousands of trans Floridians.  
Christ, I (ftm 22) was planning to start with FOLX or Plume in august. Does this mean i won't be able to now because of this?"	"These policies seem to be specific to anyone under 18.  Although I wouldn't put it past ol' Ron to push for a total ban regardless of age.

Side note:  ""Florida Fact Checked"" is possibly one of the most useless stamps anyone could put on a document.
ugh im in FL and been using plume and queerdoc. its hard enough to find local healthcare.
These are guidelines. They are not law. They are also based on lies put forward by a special interest group not actual doctors that work in this field. It is made out of ignorance and fear."	wcnzde	trans	15	0.86	2022-07-31 12:50:07
If you're prone to Depression: Be Careful of the Synarel Nasal Spray	"Hello! Just throwing out a quick note for anyone hoping to start transition or adjust their medication. I'm reporting something I wish I knew when I started.

*This will be different for everyone, so take it with a grain of salt.*

I am very susceptible to depression genetically and chemically. If you are similar, take note.

Synarel Nasal Spray is known for it's dramatic effect to mood, but I wasn't savvy enough to catch it before I started. It affects more than 1 in 10 people and even has a warning in some documents due to its infamous habit of causing low mood.

In my personal experience, I took it twice a day, evening and morning, like clockwork I get depressed when I wake up, and in the afternoon. If you have experienced similar responses, this could be why.

I have switched to spironolactone. It is reported to have depressive responses in less than the 1% of people that take it.

I hope this is helpful to someone, and informs anyone about the potential danger of mood impacting medication. Stay safe out there, take the time to carefully read the effects of the medication you will be taking, and assess if you're at risk. Best wishes to you all. Take care."		o27q5a	trans	14	0.9	2021-06-17 21:00:00
My Transiversary! A year in review	"My egg cracked about a year ago, and I've arbitrarily chosen the 12th as the anniversary date, because you know, 12 = a dozen, like eggs.  Get it? I figure I'd celebrate by reflecting on everything that transpired over the past year because it's been a wild ride.  It's been a year marked by firsts, blossoming as a human being, celebrating new and old friendships, and of course, a fair share of hardships.  I apologize in advance for the length of this post.

About a year ago, I finally gathered the courage to punch into Google a burning question that had been slowly making its way to the forefront of my mind:  Am I transgender? There was a mountain of evidence, but I refused to acknowledge it for my most of my life, instead figuring I could just ignore the issue and hope it would go away -- you know, like a totally healthy, productive way of dealing with any problem, right?

So, everyone here knows that doesn't work. At least, not forever.  That feeling of wrongness grew and grew, and while I didn't exactly know what to call it, I had a pretty good idea, despite not wanting to admit it to myself.  When I finally mustered the courage to ask the question, putting what had hitherto only been an abstract thought, my greatest fear, and darkest secret into the physical world, it wasn't so scary.  I found a community of people who had those same fears, secrets, and thoughts which make absolutely no sense to the rest of world.  And you welcomed me warmly.  I finally had a community which made sense.

The first person I came out to was my best friend from high school.  She's the only person I've consistently maintained contact with after graduation, some 17 years ago now.  I called her in the dead of the night, sort of in a bit of a panic.  I had said the words out loud to myself, but I needed to say them to someone else, and I knew that no matter what, she'd be accepting.  So, I just blurted them out, ""I think I'm transgender."" After a small pause, she replied with, ""Really?"" in an inquisitive tone.  I described to her the journey that led me to that conclusion, and she added, ""Honestly, that makes sense,"" and went on to detail some things she remembers throughout our friendship that weren't exactly cis.  My spirits were lifted.  Sharing that burden with her was one of the best feelings of my life.

The next person I had to tell wasn't going to be supportive.  I knew she wasn't going to be supportive in advance, but there was no escaping it, and there was no moving forward until she knew, because she's my wife and the mother of my two children.  It took me almost a month to gather the courage to come out to her, and it resulted immediate destruction of our romantic relationship, and the near death of our platonic relationship as well, though I'm pleased to report we're on much better footing now, though we're currently separated and heading towards divorce (an amicable one, at least).  When I told her, she cried for a week straight.  I felt horrible.  She confessed that she knew there was *something* wrong, but she didn't know what, and she never would have guessed it was this.  I felt a lot of the guilt and shame that I had feared for so long.  I didn't want to hurt her, but I was hurting too, and how else was I going to make it stop?

She convinced me to get into therapy, which was a godsend.  Having someone who was completely unbiased with whom I could discuss anything and everything was really empowering.  I had an outlet for my fears, secrets, and anxieties in a judgment-free space.  She helped bring into focus this person I was becoming and gave me the tools I needed to take care of that person emotionally and mentally. She reaffirmed that the things that I was feeling are legitimate, not just some depraved fantasy, not just a mid-life crisis, not just a fetish.  She taught me how to advocate for myself and my needs and not put up with other people's attempts to bully me into being who they want me to be.

Around the same time, I reconnected with another best friend from my childhood.  We'd been best friends from about 3rd grade through high school, but we'd lost touch during our early twenties.  Amazingly, she had also come out as transgender about a year and a half prior, and she's been extremely helpful as a sort of big sister to me (despite being six months younger), offering beauty tips, tips on transition, and tons of moral support.  Our friendship picked up exactly where it left off 15 years ago, and we're closer than ever now, despite living quite far apart.

July and August wound up being a really difficult.  At the time, we'd been living overseas in the UK for the past 3 years, and I learned at the tail end of June that my company was sending me back to America in mid-to-late August, which gave me just under two months to get my affairs in order for a huge trans-Atlantic move.  My wife wound up taking the kids and leaving early, partly to go house hunting and help out with elderly family, but mostly to put some distance between us.  We were at a low point in our relationship, and she left me in a big empty house filled with years of memories both happy and sad, children's toys, and deafening silence.  I cannot adequately describe the sorrow of going home everyday from work to an empty house that has been furnished to provide a loving, safe environment to raise two children, knowing that neither of them will ever set foot in that house again. I cried just about every day for a month and a half.  Worse still, because of the global shipping slowdown and bureaucracy, by the beginning of August, the original date for my return to America was looking more and more tenuous.  I had no clue when I would be reunited with my kids.

One benefit to having the house all to myself though was I got to really explore myself in a way that I had never been able to before, and haven't been able to since.  I bought an entire wardrobe of women's clothing, got to practice my makeup, and removed all my body hair.  I was surprised at the transformation, even without HRT.  The person in the mirror was an actual-factual woman, and even FaceApp saw me as a woman.  Maybe there was hope for me yet!

I also spent that time coming out to the friends I'd made in England, knowing that if they reacted poorly, it didn't matter because I was leaving soon.  I knew at least one of them would be very supportive because she was openly non-binary (she/they), though she mostly just presented as female, so I assumed she was just using she/they for woke points, which I'm fine with.  Instead, I got the shock of my life when I came out to her -- after she congratulated me for recognizing my authentic self, she told me she was AMAB, which had me in disbelief.  She sent me some ""before"" photos and we stayed up late that night just discussing trans things, such as weird thoughts and habits in our pre-realization lives, and again, there were remarkable parallels.  Among all of my UK friends, she became my best friend literally over night, and we've remained in contact ever since.  Most of the others immediately accepted me, and switched over to female pronouns with my even asking, and the holy moly, the first time I got gendered correctly, *I was not prepared*.  The euphoria sent a tingly warmth radiating from my chest out to the tips of my fingers and toes.

By August, I'd gathered the courage to start wearing nail polish out of the house.  As I was saying my final goodbyes to former colleagues, I met up with one person in particular, with whom I'd worked in London.  He was a gay man, but wasn't super out about it.  We had bonded over RuPaul's Drag Race when we worked together.  I showed up in bright blue nail polish, and while I wound up not coming out to him, he definitely noticed, though he was too polite to say anything.  He had previously said I didn't ""seem like the type"" to be such a fan of the show, and when I asked why, he said because I was such a clean-cut, cishet man, not really the demographic of the show.  It'd always been a bit of a guilty pleasure for me, and admittedly, I wasn't sure why I was so enamoured by it either.  I guess it makes a lot more sense now, although since my egg cracked, it's become a lot less appealing, because RuPaul is just such a problematic person, and because I've definitely seen how drag queens have an inadvertently negative effect on trans women.

I came out to my mom in August, who thought I was joking at first.  She kind of freaked out when she realized I was dead serious. I video chatted with her while fully presenting female, and after the initial shock wore off, she proceeded to tear into my makeup technique, my choice of colors, my choice of attire, etc., under the pretense of being helpful, but really it felt more like uninvited criticism for the sake of making it difficult for me.  A few days later, she had some questions for me ""out of concern,"" and interrogated me on matters about which no mother has any business inquiring. She did, however, respect my wishes and kept the information to herself, for a while anyway.  She has cried on the phone just about every time we've spoken since then, describing grief over ""the death of her son,"" how the ""little boy"" she loved is going away, being replaced by a stranger.  Lay it on thick, mom. Since then, she has also offered plenty of unsolicited opinions on HRT, statistics on detransitioning and suicide, and, of course, The Surgery\^TM, most of which are well-meaning but misguided, and ultimately unwanted.  It's clear she's still trying to talk me out of being transgender.

I wound up flying back home to the US on September 1st, and reuniting with my kids will forever be one of the happiest moments of my life.  I sobbed tears of joy at the airport, which really confused my 4 year old, who didn't understand how I could be crying if I was so happy.  We basically wound up being homeless for the several months, as the housing market was insane and there was no inventory in our price range, and even limited inventory at around double our price range.  We owned a home here in the US which we rented out while we were overseas, and we were ultimately forced to evict the tenants, which was probably one of the hardest ethical dilemmas I've ever been forced into, especially due to the fact that the tenant is a genuinely wonderful person, who's well-known in my area as a leading advocate for transgender youth.  Yeah, I still feel like shit about it.

Due to my housing situation, September through November was a long period of stagnation for my transition.  We were living intermittently with various friends and family, so privacy was at a minimum.  My wife and I still weren't doing great as a couple, but we had mended fences enough that we could stand to be in the same room together, and were doing an excellent job co-parenting, especially under the difficult circumstances.  Our 6th anniversary was in October, and it wound up being pleasant, but awkward, as it was the first time the two of us had been alone together with no kids, certainly since I blew up our marriage with ""my big reveal"" as she had once cruelly called it, but probably since 2019.  There was an elephant in the room that took us half of dinner to finally address.  We addressed it, and there were apologies from both sides about how things were handled, acknowledgments about how things could have been handled differently, and a resolution to work together as a team to raise our children, regardless of what happens between us.

I came out to my dad on Thanksgiving day.  I was really terrified because I had no clue how he was going to react, but my mom basically said, ""if you don't tell him, I will.""  My mom had pretty much reacted exactly how I anticipated -- she didn't disown me or express hatred or anything like that, but she also overreacted and has behaved in a way that's really counterproductive.  She was a known quantity, which is why I had come out to her first.  My dad was a complete unknown.  I had no clue about his thoughts on trans people, other than I know that he tends to vote Republican, though he can't stand Donald Trump or his ilk, and thinks both parties suck equally. He's also fairly conformist.  I was really into the whole goth counterculture when I was a teen and he refused to be seen in public with me at the height of it. He also tends to make light of race/sexuality/gender/religious minority issues, so I was really expecting an uphill battle.  I had sort of pre-emptively stopped talking to him for a few months, because I was not expecting it to go well.  I was pleasantly surprised. He took me seriously, and told me that he didn't know how to help, other than to give me his support and love.  And that was that. I've actually found out that in private conversations between my mom and him, he's actually shut her down several times for overstepping and not showing the support I need.

In December, things had settled down.  We were back in our old house, and we were establishing our new normal.  We took a trip down to Texas to visit my family for the holidays.  One of my close family friends was having a wedding while we were down there, and we were invited.  It was quite a ways away though, so my wife and I had another protracted period of alone time with no children.  It was excruciating.  There were some issues that had remained unresolved for her, and she took the opportunity to address them while we were driving up, during which time she said some really hateful things.  I honestly don't remember what she said, just how she made me feel, and she made me feel like shit.  It was just such an unprovoked, vitriolic rage -- who was this person I was trapped in the car with? The wedding wound up being a miserable experience because of it.  She initially intended to sit in the car for the entire thing, which was ridiculous, so I insisted she come inside.  She was standoffish the entire time, and as soon as the last of the traditions was completed during the reception, she bailed, and I left shortly thereafter.  I texted afterwards to apologized to my friend for my wife's brusk behavior during her big day, and she left me on read.  I haven't heard from her since.

I came out to my three siblings while I was down there as well.  The reactions were two shrugs and a whole-hearted embrace of who I am.  My sister (she/they) is delighted to finally have a sister.  She's accepted me from the get-go and has only ever referred to me as Cassie or Cassandra since learning.  She also frequently corrects my mom when she stubbornly refuses to get it right, something that I've not even been bold enough to do.

I have another friend down in Texas I always make a point to visit whenever I'm in town.  We had worked together a long time ago, and we really hit it off back then, and have remained friends ever since.  The last time I was in town, we went out for drinks, and he had taken the opportunity to come out to me as bisexual. I was honored to be entrusted with this secret, and this time around, I intended to repay him with a secret of my of own.  I symbolically chose the same place he came out to me previously, but unfortunately, he B-lined for the bar, and between the bartender and the other patrons, there was little privacy.  After a couple of drinks, I suggested we go grab a booth, as the bar stools weren't all the comfortable, I lied.  Mercifully, he agreed.  After a couple minutes of conversation, I waited for a natural pause, and then I reminded him how a couple years prior he had entrusted me with a secret, at this very location.  I told him it was my turn to entrust him with a secret, and I came out to him as transgender.  ""Me too,"" she said, grinning ear to ear.

We spent some time trading notes, stories, etc. As it turns out, she wanted to tell me, but got cold feet, unsure of how I'd respond.  So, she strategically chose a location where it wouldn't be feasible to do so in order to take her mind off the idea of doing it. She was glad that I had taken the initiative, as obviously, it made it super easy for her.  We had a couple more drinks and then left in her car to drop me off at my hotel, excitedly swapping stories the entire way back.

In late January, early February, we travelled down to Florida to visit my best friend from high school (the one who was the first person I came out to).  She's got two kids the same age as my two kids, so it made trying to keep everyone entertained super easy.  She and I stayed up late one night to give each other mani/pedis and it was fabulous.  It was such an affirming activity, staying up late with my bestie doing each other's nails. I'm not out to my kids or to hers, but she slipped up once or twice and called me by my chosen name in front of her kids, who didn't take notice, but those were also really euphoric moments for me.  Her older daughter also saw me presenting female back in August when I had drunkenly video called.  She introduced me to her daughter as Cassie, and she didn't even question it.  She didn't care about my deep voice, or the fact that I was clearly wearing a wig.  She just immediately accepted that I was a woman, and a very good friend of her mom's.  She even met be before, as a man.  She didn't make the connection at all.  Kids are frickin' awesome.  I'm convinced that bigotry is a taught behavior.

In March, I started HRT.  It was a ridiculously simple process (YMMV, I live in a progressive area).  I just called up my local Planned Parenthood, explained the situation, and had an appointment scheduled a week after that 5 minute phone call.  I had pills in hand a day after the appointment.  Why did I wait so long?  So far, it's been a slow process, but I've got some small but noticeable breast growth.  My sense of smell has improved, and my body odor has decreased.  Every now and again, I catch a glimpse of myself in the mirror and think, wow, my face has slimmed down and femmed up! But it's only been just under 3 months, so I figure it might just be my imagination.

March was also marked by probably the most transphobic reaction I've gotten so far.  My wife accidentally let it slip to her step-mother that I was transgender back in February.  Her step-mom is a dear, sweet lady who loves everyone, without regard to superficial details such as race, gender, sexuality, etc. She measures you based on who you are on the inside, which makes it quite surprising that she's married to my father-in-law, the worlds biggest asshole.  He's your typical man's man Fox News junky, who acknowledges only two points of view in this world:  his point of view, and wrong points of view.  He has been criticizing my wife for every decision she's made since she was legally old enough to make decisions on her own.  He's always felt that she married down, and he's not shy about voicing his backwards opinions on everything, no matter how insignificant.  We knew that it would be a shitshow when he learned my secret.  

Well, he happened to learn the same day I started HRT.  My step-mother-in-law, thinking that my wife had let her know in order to break the news to my father-in-law, did just that.  He promptly called up my wife, berated her yet again for marrying a loser (the worst thing you can be in his book, and ironic given that we've successfully been living on only my income for the past 4 years), and told her not to bring me around anymore. That's all fine and dandy, as I have never had any love for the man, but my son's birthday party was scheduled for literally the next week.  I'm not invited to his house, but he sees nothing wrong showing up to mine to spend time with his grandson and just pretending like I don't exist.  It was hella awkward.  It was also hilarious, because like, clearly the only person having a miserable time was him.  Somehow, he thinks he's hurting me by refusing to share with me his hot takes on the Russian invasion of Ukraine. How ever shall I carry on?

So, that whole ordeal sort of forced my hand, resulting in me coming out to much larger group than I would have been otherwise ready for, but in light of his knowledge of my being transgender, I was worried that he might cause a scene in front of a bunch of people who didn't know.  So, to get ahead of the story, I pretty much just came out to my entire friend group. They were all supportive.

Last month, my wife and I had an earnest talk about the future of our relationship, and while we've been heading down this path for a long time, we spelled it out officially -- we're getting a divorce.  It was mutual, and it's what's best for our kids and for us.  We each need things the other can't provide, and staying together for the sake of the kids will only result in anger and resentment.  We discussed what that looks like, everything from timelines to living arrangements to custody, and we have a verbal agreement that neither of us will try to make it difficult on the other, to prevent deepening of wounds.  That conversation wound up being a huge weight off both our shoulders, and the uncertainty around it was actually the source of a lot of the hurt that we'd caused each other over the past year.  Now that it's out in the open, things are great between us, at least platonically.  We can joke and laugh and have fun over our children and the things that brought us together again.  We're living life as roommates who just happen to have two children together.

So that's been the first year of my transition.  It's been a lot of ups and downs, but I feel like I'm on the right path.  Thanks to everyone who read this whole thing.  I know it's a lot, and probably not terribly interesting or important to anyone other than me.  But as Treebeard once said, ""Why say anything at all, if you can't take a very long time to say it?"""	"Thank you for sharing your story, warts and all. It's not often you get a ground level view of a long bit of time like this.
I couldn‚Äôt stop reading. I also read your initial coming out post and OMG you described my life so accurately.  I am so happy for you finding yourself after so long. My own experience has been a little bumpy and just due to being born in the wrong decade I had to suffer a little longer before coming out. But I am at least grateful that the world has finally become welcoming enough for me to live in it and that eventually I was able to find online information and support that allowed me to begin my life.

Thank you for taking the time to write this. Seeing other peoples experiences and how similar and different they can be is sometimes so helpful.
I'm glad you enjoyed the read! I wrote this about 5 months ago, and my life has continued to improve. I'm definitely on the right track (baby I was born this way). It's always great to hear from people who felt that I've left a positive impact on them, even in such a small way. Thanks for commenting!"	uo85rk	trans	15	0.89	2022-05-12 18:51:26
Coming out as a (almost) fully transitioned teacher	Hi guys, I am a high school teacher at a small public school. It is VERY open to LGBTQ+ people but there isn‚Äôt any teachers or staff who are in the community except me but I am currently stealth. I was thinking since I am almost fully transitioned (all I need is meta for what I need to feel complete, me saying fully transitioned isn‚Äôt saying that you need all of the stuff) I would come out to the school. Only a few of the staff know and none of the students know. I would have loved to know that there was someone safe to talk to about trans/other lgbtq stuff as a kid. I am out to the GSA and whoever has heard and nobody cares at all (which I run) as pan. Should I do it and if so	"It‚Äôs the best thing I ever did. I came out this summer and started presenting at the start of the new year. The kids are actually really cool overall with it (High School), and though I expected parents to come out of everywhere and complain, there‚Äôs been only silence at board meetings about it. If anyone‚Äôs been complaining to admin, they‚Äôre shielding me from it, but they say there hasn‚Äôt been. 

Feel free to dm me if you have any questions. 

Good luck!"	qb0hwf	trans	14	0.9	2021-10-19 01:06:31
My wife is wonderful	"I‚Äôm sitting here, at work, surrounded by people who don‚Äôt know who I am. 

When they find out, I don‚Äôt know what their reactions will be but I‚Äôm excited to find out.

I told my wife, one year into our relationship, and while shocked, quickly warmed up to the idea. 

The love and support (and insistence!) she has shown me over the last five years gave me the confidence to transition. Our relationship isn‚Äôt unaffected by my transition. It‚Äôs enhanced by it. It‚Äôs been three years since I started HRT and we haven‚Äôt looked back

This is all on top how great she is naturally. She‚Äôs worked incredibly hard to overcome many of the struggles she had when we met. I have never met a more caring and compassionate person. 

I am so lucky to have her."	"This sounds great, heartwarming to hear such a wholesome story! Savor such a person; it's not the norm.   ü•∞ü•∞

Just got dead named 10 times in 5 minutes...	"So this happened about an hour ago and I'm still trying to wrap my brain around it. So I'm just going to drop this little nonsensical rant here for the wandering minds of thr internet and call it a damn night. 

So...I have an aunt who hasn't really talked to me since transition (I'm ftm btw). We were really close before. Like she had a big role in raising me, but she's also super religious so...there's that. I have talked to her exactly 3 times in the last 7 years....since I told her about transitioning. 

So...she has been dealing with a lot of health issues of late and my cousin has been doing everything in his power to take care of her. Moved back in, quit his job, cares for her night and day. Whatever is going on with her (doctors think it's med induced) is causing mass confusion for the past 2 weeks. Borderline dementia type behavior, but it was immediate and has only been going on for 2 weeks. Example:  my father, her brother, has been dead for 12 years. She told my cousin that he was coming over for a visit just before this call happened.

In trying to get him a glorious few minutes of reprive from the insanity, I offered to speak with her. First of all, that was the most insane 5 minutes of my life. I have adhd. I can switch topics at the drop of a dime and know exactly what I'm talking about. She gave me a run for my damn money. First she's making people cry and feels bad, then the lord won at...something, then she made my uncle sleep outside and it is too cold (it's June...and like 80F degrees outside), then she's talking about how she wants her funeral and we are all going to only have bad stories to tell, then my cousin won't take her to dinner, then a decent rant about how much she loves roku because it has all of the episodes of I Love Lucy....then she's gotta go cuz she's tired. And...my old name was said at least 10 times in 5 minutes. I cringe every time it's said. Doesn't even have to be about me and I cringe (fairly common name)...but I also feel like I need to do something to help her...I'm very conflicted. She had a large part in raising me and I know she loves me...but she will never accept me either. It's messed up... Why do I want to help someone who refuses to acknowledge who I am? Why can't I just stop caring here? It's not my job to make this better. And yet....ugh. Sometimes I hate how much I care about people 

I just needed to get these thoughts out. Thank you for reading."	"Hang in there‚Ä¶ dementia‚Äôs hard to deal with for family and caregivers. While she may not be all there anymore YOU are still valid! Stay strong!
Thank you. We are hoping that it isn't dementia and that it is just medication induced confusion. That's at least the doctors running theory. Fingers crossed. 

The good news is I don't feel invalidated or insecure about the dead naming. It sucks. I hate to hear the name. The cringe is very real lol. But I know who I am and nobody will ever take that away from me. I might just be used to it because my asshole step-dad (alcoholic...possible brain damage from it and overall right wing idiot who thinks Trump walks on water) has dead named me for a solid 7 years. In fact, I believe he used my real name for the first time like 3 months ago. But thank you for the kind words. I truly appreciate them in this weird and uncontrollable time in my life."	o1nlw2	trans	15	1.0	2021-06-17 03:43:19
My father is a chaser	"So long story short, 
In sep. 2019 i came out as trans (mtf, 20yrs back then)
To my father, the only parent i have (mom died after givin birth). He asked me if im nuts straight away and since then just passively interacted with me ever since.  He kept sending me few dimes for living and didnt cut me off completely, tho our relationship went worse.
we couldnt keep a normal eyecontact ever since then. That winter on xmas, he and his friends went to vacation as an attemp to help his mentally devastated friend after a divorce, which was nice of them. Tho, they wento Pattaya, Thailand, a city thats famous for trans prostitution and all of the visitors come there mostly to f**k. After he came back, he was super excited told me a lot about their whole trip, mentioning a sketchy detail that they have been renting separate apartments (3 males around 50yrs). They friend of theirs who convinced them for this option had been there like 7 times before. Also sketchy. But back then, i didnt really connected the dots, nor even cared that much.
Ever since as my transition continued and eventually i started dating, ive bumped to A LOT of men who always pointed out their experience with trans women and how they realized they are into it after visiting Pattaya, how theyve been there multiple times and so on. Ive heard of this narrative so much that it just made me disgusted.
Aaand.. so im in transition for 2yrs now, my dad is acting like he is trying to be supportive, yet he totally isnt, at least nowhere near id expect him to. He still struggles or idk if just refuses to call me my preffered pronouns, which is super annoying, since our language is pretty much gendered in every way. 
Like 3 weeks ago ive been told by my auntie, his sister, after talking about my winter holiday plans, that my father and his are planning to go to Pattaya for christmas AGAIN this year. That moment ive felt like my blood is boiling. The fact that he didnt mentioned it himself to me, even tho i assume everything had been planned already, also the fact that ill be alone again in xmass felt so dissappointing...
After that, like two weeks after ive gotten in an argument with my father about something really stupid and he pissed me off so much that i just couldnt help myself and told him something like Him and his f@ggy friends go to Pattaya just to b@ng tr@nsvestite pr*stitutes. After that, he called my brother, telling him about how agressive i am towards him and how sad it makes him feel, also told the same thing to my grandma (his mom) and my auntie. Basically pictured me as some sort of abuser or aggressor or whatever, just some br*tty @sshole. 
Since then, i expected that our relationship is over and i wont hear from him anymore, wont get any financial support or anything, yet, for my surprise, he just out of nowhere suddenly managed to pick up my meds from pharma, which i was ranting i couldnt get back then cuz of some issues, sent me 300e as a ""holiday bonus"", when usually he sends me like 50 +50 during the month, which is almost unpossible to survive on, also sending me extra data for mobile, which previously ive had to ask him for and it took him a while always... he just started to try smh to make it up, just as if he felt guilty or something. These last occasions just made me feel bad, either because 1) i feel like an @sshole for being so rude to him, 2) i sense that his actions are motivated by feeling of guilt, which could mean I WAS RIGHT, and that destroys me and never wanna see him again.
I feel so bad, cuz hes the only parent i have and i really cant tell if i should try to work it out between us two, or just burn the bridges and try to move on, give up on grudges and never look back... pls tell me your insight on my situation.

EDIT: Him pursuing sex with trans women is clearly just my speculation, but considering the details - them renting separate apartments, his friend visitng pattaya like 7 times already before, and from all the beautiful countries and places in Asia you could visit, you choose AGAIN this literal ghetto full of trash, pollution and prostitution. Like what??

TLDR: My dad is absolutely unsupportive, mysoginic, homophobic and transphobic . He went to vacation to Pattaya, the most famous town in thailand for transgender prostitutes, apparently plans to go there again in christmas, without even telling me - sketchy af."	"I‚Äôve been to Pattaya and there‚Äôs all kinds of prostitutes.   Not just trans. A lot of westerners go there because it is more of a girlfriend experience than straight prostitution. You meet a girl and if you hit it off you are basically a couple for as long as you like. You do pay a little daily, but you also take her out to meals and dancing and shopping or whatever you‚Äôre into.  Not that any of that really matters, but your assumption that they are definitely for trans girls might be off the mark. Secondly, it‚Äôs kind of hard to hear you complain about his homophobia when you are lashing out at ‚Äúhim and his faggy friends.‚Äù  Just my two cents.
Yeah, ive heard from a girl friend of mine kind of detailed description of hows it in there, and that many richer german/british men come and do this girlfriend fantasy, tho assuming I come from way poorer country, being middle class - my father couldnt afford this kind of ""luxury"". Also ive heard that if you would stand in the main street with a ball and kicked in it, youd prolly hit approximately 50 trans prostitutes. But yeah, its not just that all of them street workers are trans, but the thing is, theres not many places like this with so high concentration of girls like us. You know what i mean..
Also, using those ugly words is the same principle as with N-word pass in my case
I hope you realize the ""N-word pass"" is just a meme, and not real.
i meant it as an example of why is it tolerable for afro people to use the n-word and absolutely not allowed for white folks. Same goes with us - with decades of public humiliation, we have every right to own these words for us.
I'd really prefer the term queer. F@ggot makes me extremely uncomfortable, *especially* when the person is a stranger.
If you didnt get it, i was trying to insult him, im not talking about you"	r4cith	trans	15	1.0	2021-11-28 19:43:08
Trans (MtF), child lost to SIDs, divorcing, and spiraling	"I came out as trans (MtF) in early January. I was married with a son. When I told my wife I thought I might be trans she was beside herself. She told me she felt like she was mourning her husband. I told her I wasn't sure if I was going to transition or just present more feminine.

In retrospect, it was to soften the blow. A week later I changed my name on Facebook from Kyle to Kaylee and knew that it was the most sure I've ever been about anything in my life.

I had thoughts even when I was as young as 12 that I wished I could be a girl. But I thought that was just normal, a fantasy. And even through college I just thought it was a sexual thing. I'm an artist and I constantly looked up reference that involved feminine form; I thought I was just a pervert. Really I was jealous, now that I reflect. I was taught growing up in our society that gender and sex were the same.

And being ""straight"" confused me, too. I was attracted to girls. So I thought I couldn't be a girl. But obviously now I know I'm just a lesbian woman.

I also knew as young as 12 that I wanted to have kids, and that I wanted a girl. In retrospect, I think I wanted to live vicariously through a daughter experiencing living a female life. But I DID want a child, someone to serve as a role model for. I wanted to be a guardian to her. And an accepting figure.

My wife and I took a year to do it but we finally got pregnant, with a boy. My wife and I have an amazing bond. We met in college and I truly feel we are soulmates, even now.

He was born in late September and he was perfect. The first 3 months of his life we struggled in our relationship. It's hard to raise a child. We clashed more than ever before and I hated what we had become.

Me coming out in December just made things harder.

And then, in January, we woke up to our son dead in his crib. It feels like a made-up story, remembering it. I was in such shock. He died in his sleep. Since then, we've struggled more. We had already had discussions about whether we should stay together because she wouldn't be attracted to me after my transition. And now I wasn't sure I could have another child because I ONLY wanted our son that died, and because of what our relationship became while we cared for him.

We have now decided to separate.

I am dealing with reconstructing my entire identity as a person, as a husband, as a father, and it's very hard. I know all trans people need to deconstruct themselves and rebuild, but I feel like I'm spiraling in a black void. Everything that tethered me to reality has been dissolved. The entire trajectory for my life has been torn apart.

I always thought I would be a husband, have a child. Now I'm divorcing the love of my life and becoming a different person.

There are things to be excited about. I'm excited to become my authentic self. But beyond that is black uncertainty.

I'm not asking any question here, or looking for anything in particular. I'm just spiraling and need to reach out to this community."	"That is just so much my friend. [This](https://www.healthline.com/health/box-breathing) helps me on bad days. I hope you have irl support.
I'm sorry for your loss. Life will get better though, and don't feel like you have to rush. Take everything at your own pace.
Please message me to talk if you need to. My heart aches for you. I have also had gone through the death of a child, very unexpectedly. It is literally the worst thing possible. The relationship between my wife and I has never been the same since our child passed and with COVID and my trying to understand my own gender we have very much been on the rocks for the last year. Everything you are feeling is valid. Our brains are wired to go to extreme lengths to help us not feel pain, fear, and sadness. Sometimes the feelings are so strong that we fall into complete hopelessness. I have been there. Please make sure you are going to or getting a counselor/therapist if you don't have one already. Maybe check in with your GP if you are needing medications as well. It is not a weakness to ask for help, I struggled for a really long time asking for help and finally broke through my own internalized stigma around mental health and it is has been extremely beneficial for me. I know that everything seems insurmountable at this moment and truthfully it is ok to feel that. My therapist has said that sometimes we need to be in the uncomfortable moments in order to process and learn from them. Yet, it is not easy to do. You have gone through several life changing events that most people would never have to experience. Please and I can not stress this enough, continue to reach out. You do not have to be alone in this, there are people who love and care about you, an you have value no matter the circumstances. Sorry if this is long winded but it is an emotional topic for me as well. Please be safe and love yourself."	mmjc5e	trans	17	0.91	2021-04-08 03:47:29
I‚Äôm trans but I will never tell anyone	"Obligatory sorry for any formatting issues from my phone. This is not my regular account but it‚Äôs also my first post ever so please be patient with me.

Today I became nearly certain that I was trans while researching how to tell if you were, which I‚Äôve done numerous times before (go figure lol). There was a hypothetical posed in a video which could indicate some gender dysphoria tendencies: https://youtu.be/UciZPXfLAa0 . The question was ‚Äúif you could press a button to become the other gender (including all primary and secondary sex characteristics) but it would be impossible to transition back, would you?‚Äù. After hearing this I broke down crying because I knew I would if I was given the opportunity one hundred percent of the time. But I was crying not just because I came to this key realization about myself but I cried because I realized I never will transition or even publicly tell people I‚Äôm trans.

For further context I‚Äôm a 22 year old college student who was assigned male at birth who grew up and is currently residing in the conservative southwest of the United States. Frankly I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôm very brave, I don‚Äôt think I have what it takes to realistically lose every friend I‚Äôve ever made, become disowned by my family, and risk the perception of anyone who will be in a position of authority over me (boss/professor). I don‚Äôt know what to do, I‚Äôm grateful for finally addressing this aspect of myself but I also mourn the fact that I don‚Äôt think I can bring myself to do anything about it aside from telling maybe two people, my therapist and my girlfriend. In fact, I feel as though although my girlfriend will validate me completely, she also won‚Äôt really know how to handle it (which is completely understandable). I‚Äôm not looking for a guarantee that our relationship will work but I have a hard time with the concept of losing such a wonderful partner and possibly my friend. I feel like my parents and sister are a completely lost cause as well because they are all very conservative Christians. I also believe that most, if not all, of my friends that I made in my hometown or at the university I go to (it‚Äôs a private, christian university) won‚Äôt talk to me anymore. If anybody has any advice as to how to navigate this without losing everyone and everything I care about that would be great, because that feels like a non-starter for me.

TL,DR: almost certain I‚Äôm trans, but I don‚Äôt think I can ever publicly transition or come out because I‚Äôll lose everyone and almost everything. Advice is welcomed.

Edit: I‚Äôm so sorry, I posted the wrong link."	You don't need to be brave right now you just need to survive until you get to a place mentally and physically where you can be brave. It doesn't sound like you're physically in a place where you can safely come out and I'm of the mindset that you should always prioritize your safety and comfort. The only real advice I can give you about your current situation is to try and move somewhere where it would be safer for you to come out. Family can come around over time, not always, but they can. Especially if they care about you enough to not want to lose you. Move to a place where you feel safer coming out when you get the chance and be firm about it with your family from the start. They either accept you or fuck off. And yes, some or all of them may not talk to you for a few years it took nearly 5 for quite a few members of my family to start coming around. The very conservative side specifically. But people can be very surprising. My extremely religious grandma was and still is one of my biggest supporters.	jinenn	trans	16	0.92	2020-10-26 21:12:14
I hatched (20MTF)	"CORRECTION! I was fired out of my egg so fast my velocity has to be measured in large fractions of **C**. Watch out people down range you have 240 lbs of explosive energy **INCOMING!!!!**

&#x200B;

Anyways i am most definitely trans, MTF if your wondering. Know how I know? Putting on a cheap Walmart set of tights left me in euphoric bliss for the entirety of my work shift. All **twelve hours** of it! BTW overtime is wonderful.

&#x200B;

I was mentally singing: I'm traaaaans!!!! I'm gonna be a giiiirl!!!! I'm gonna be so pretty!!!!!!! my entire shift. I went to sleep mentally exhausted but feeling happier than I think I've ever felt. All that from a bargain set of nylons.

&#x200B;

Realizing i""m trans also cleared up my sexuality doubts. I'm Pan!!!! I am proud to say hot is hot regardless of your gender. Health and empathy will always be sexy as fuck. Though honestly I might just be a sucker for muscles. I mean have you seen some of the athletes on Reddit? Wowsa!

&#x200B;

It is amazing how easy it is to separate jealousy from attraction from general horneyness when you know what feelings are in play. It also really helps when I can label my general self loathing as dysphoria and be done with it.

&#x200B;

I'm out to my mom and only her cause she's the only one I know that will be both understanding and keep her mouth shut on the subject. I'm still amazed that coming out to her was so easy, she just accepted it right away.

&#x200B;

The rest of my family will probably never accept me. My Dad is a toxic (if cowardly) narc, both of my grandma's are dysfunctional and implicitly emphasize ""normalcy."" And my extended family are the type of conservative that mindlessly repost memes that end something like ""SHARE TO SPREAD THE NAME OF THE LORD"" or ""COMMENT AN AMEN IF YOU AGREE,"" I am not religious or conservative in any sense of ether of those words.

&#x200B;

I'm thinking of coming out to them in after a coupe of years of no contact and transitioning by going to the yearly reunion while passing (and with a boyfriend, girlfriend, and/or joyfriend) and doing a dramatic reveal in the style of a Hamilton musical number, confusing the hell out of them. My aunt will be furious, but I don't care because my tits are going to be better than the ones she got bolted on after ruining her old ones with smoking and being fat.

&#x200B;

O by the way: I'M GONNA HAVE BOOBS, I'M GONNA HAVE BOOBS, JOY, JOY, I'M GONNA HAVE BOOBS!!!! don't care how big just BOOBS

&#x200B;

Alright goals time. I wanna be the fusion of the korrasami relationship if that makes sense. Ruthlessly intelligent, compassionate, fashionable, but will destroy you politically with but a few words combined with optimism, enthusiasm, and martial prowess that equates to a god walking on the mortal plane.

&#x200B;

Also with Korra's body because I'm rather broad at the shoulders and good god she is beautiful.

&#x200B;

Luckily for me I wont have a terrible time trying to pass. My face is not strongly masculine due to my mom (THANKS MOM!) so once I lose some weight and learn some makeup I should be fine. I cant wait till i'm financially sable enough to transition.

&#x200B;

Also that meme format that is floating around on r/traaaaaaannnnnnnnnns. The one showing the lady with pride flag stripes in her hair. I want those colors. My hair is a little curly and will keep the colors separate so I would rock that look! I might look into getting custom contacts made matching her eyes as well cause those are cool too.

&#x200B;

So to summarize: I am a pansexual, panromantic, polyamory curious, anti-theist, apsitivist, transgender girl, with an interest in everything from biology to biographies, that wants to become the first **DARK EMPRESS OF THE INTERGALACTIC NEGA REALM**, unite the world and to find a way to shoot the first and second laws of thermodynamics with a shotgun."	"Amazing, love your energy. You are totally wonderful
Holy shit, you're exhausting! And I mean that in the best possible way! Your enthusiasm for what's to come is refreshing and exactly what I needed today, but damn did it wear me out.

Kick some ass out there! I'm rooting for you.
Working on it!!! Thus far I am working on losing weight and improving my self care. Now that I know what I need I can work to fight the self loathing that comes with dysphoria.

&#x200B;

Im not gonna lie though lots of the energy you see is simply anxiety. I am jittery by nature and living like i have has left me with a lot of coping problems. In real life I am not exactly mellow but I don't quite move at hyper speed like the post implies.

&#x200B;

I have a lot of work ahead, one does not become a amazon Queen by slacking after all, but i look forward to slowly shaping the creative effort that is me."	i7hrzy	trans	15	0.9	2020-08-11 00:53:17
Years old picture, when I was also a lot thinner/taking better care of myself, but what Faceapp shows me, gives me hope, though I'm still super nervous/scared/anxious about transitioning.

I am transgender, but I don't think I'll ever transition. And no, that's not okay.	"I've been struggling with my identity for years.  I could even argue over a decade.  Pretty much as soon as I hit puberty, I've been fascinated with the idea of being biologically, socially, and sexually female.  I don't recall a day in recent (or distant, for that matter) memory where I *haven't* thought about it.  Not even when I realized that I had messed up my college education so badly that I would have to drop, not when I lost my job that I enjoyed, and not even when my mother died.  Each of those days, I still had very ""eggy"" thoughts about how I wished I was a girl.  For the record, I'm AMAB, and more than likely mtf transgender.

I don't think this is going to gain any traction, truly. I'm more writing this for my own catharsis for what's probably a pretty horrible realization.  As much as I want to be a girl, I don't think I ever will be.

I'm one of the lucky ones.  I don't experience a lot of dysphoria.  Sometimes I feel like I want to chop my shoulders off for being too broad, and I don't like the hair on my body, but I don't mind having a penis.  I don't grow viscerally disgusted with myself, and I'm sorry that some of you do.  I can't imagine what that's like.

But what I can imagine is the horrible way that this world treats transgender and non-binary individuals. I've been friends with a few in the past that frankly were larger deterrents to mine own coming out than anything.  It wasn't their fault, but the sheer disdain that they received from people in their everyday lives was enough to make me never want to transition.

I want to clarify something.  I don't care what people think of me.  I'm bisexual and in a male x male presenting relationship, and display my affection with my boyfriend openly.  I love him very much, and we occasionally get some side-eye.  But it's come within the public consciousness of our region that to treat someone rudely for being gay is not accepted, and I'm so very thankful for that.  

It just simply doesn't apply to those who don't identify as cisgendered.  And I'm not sure it ever will.  Not within my lifetime, I don't think.  Transgendered people are *treated* differently. Outwardly and openly.  And to be treated like scum on a daily basis isn't in the cards for me.

You can say as much as you want to surround myself with people who care, but the fact of the matter is that it's not yet my time.  Call me weak, if you'd like.  

I apologize if this isn't the sort of content we'd like to facilitate here, on the off-chance this does pick up any amount of steam.  But again, I'm writing this for my own catharsis.  

If ever a time comes in the world where I think I could be a woman, and even most people wouldn't treat me like the grime you'd find underneath a toilet seat, I might just try and do it.  I'm just not optimistic.  And it makes me wonder how many more of me there are out there."	"I had the same concerns but no one bullies me or is rude. I don‚Äôt allow them too. Transition is a b****. But I‚Äôm a bigger one. It‚Äôs also the best decision I‚Äôve ever made. I wish you peace in your journey
Coming from an egg, I don't think that makes you weak at all. It's a constant worry of mine that I'll be alienated by most people i know and aggressively hated by strangers, if I were to transition. This world is not welcoming at all of things that are different.
I think I get something you're saying

I can't transition medically even if I wanted to (for multiple reasons). And it's even hard for me to do it socially; after all, without medical transitioning, people see me as a guy. I can't hide it and most women's clothes look just stupid on me. I can pull an androgynous look, but that's where it ends. Wish I could do more, but no.

And yeah, I don't either want to end up being harassed or bullied. Or end up as a victim of transphobic violence. Women, especially transwomen, are in worse situation than men. Where I live, it's kinda safe, but outside that little bubble... It's a cruel world out there. The threat of violence is always there. And often it's completely legal. In most countries, nobody cares if a transperson is raped or murdered. We are ""degenerate"" to most. And I am pretty sure that won't change any time soon. 

But what bugs me perhaps in my own situation, is the fact that if I live as a feminine man, I'll probably never get a relationship I want. Sex and loving is something that I miss. I'm horny as fuck and just can't get laid. I'm mostly not into guys and usually women want a masculine man. I look like a twink. A part of me wants to be a gay woman. And I'm jealous of the way women look. I fucking hate this hairy body I have to deal with. It disgusts me. Anybody who doesn't feel that, should be at least sometimes thankful!

But yeah, it sucks.
I was pretty well on the same mental line except I do have dysphoria, it was mostly my sets of parental units outlook that held me back. It took a long time apart to realize that it wasn't an ideal situation that I grew up in. out of all of that, I don't really have to adhere to their opinions. My life has slowly improved since then, and the best thing I can do for myself is to be me. MtF here, it's hard not gonna lie. Imma do the thing and transition anyway, because dysphoria is a bitch, and I'm going to get over it. I do hope that you're happy regardless of your decision. Being happy should be the biggest thing to work towards for everyone. Screw anyone who says otherwise.
It's understandable to never want to transition socially or otherwise. It is rough. There's no sugar coating it. And its ok if you never do, you're still trans. It's a personal decision on how one proceeds. It is dangerous for folks like us particularly trans women, more particularly trans women of color. 

I'm sorry you're not in a place where you can be yourself. That's incredibly tough to have on your shoulders.
I felt really unsure about transitioning for a long time. I was talking about this to another trans friend of mine who had transitioned years earlier and this is what she told me:

'The first time I went to get my first dose of hormones, on the way back I took an Uber. We started talking, and he revealed to me that he was trans (MtF) but had never transitioned. He had a wife and kids and a house, and felt that it would just never be within reach for him to transition. Although he said he was okay with that, it was impossible not to notice the despair in his eyes and how empty he really was inside. So which are you going to choose?'"	fntgvi	trans	14	0.9	2020-03-23 22:30:50
The Egg Has Cracked	Time to scream into the void. I recently realized I'm a trans girl, and recognized my dysphoria, and it goes back alot further than I thought it did initially.  Like, hindsight has been screaming at me and it hit me all at once. I've been incredibly lucky this far, with supportive friends and family that is helping me work my issues out. Mostly by myself, but with help from friends, I realized the cause of my depression, and realized who I was always meant to be. I'm Chloe now, and where I still need to let some people know, and I'm still worried I'll lose someone, all the most important people know, and are genuinely trying their best. My friends helped me work through my feelings, and helped me determine that yes, I am a girl. My Mom has offered to help with getting hrt, my little sisters are in awe at it, and my older sisters have offered up enough of their old clothing to build a wardrobe. The only people who don't know are my teachers, my boss, and my good-for-nothing step dad, the latter of all I know will throw a fit over, as he has given me far more than enough proof he is a pos terf. I've never been remotely close to him, since he refused to be a father figure for 9 years and was only just starting to recognize me as his kid. But I don't care about him, never have, and likely never will. I'm just glad I realized now, while I can still effectively transition	So glad you've found the real you! You've got a path yet ahead of you, but it sounds like you've got a good start on it already!	n49hc2	trans	14	0.9	2021-05-03 22:39:57
My mom is reading a book that includes a ‚ÄúChristian perspective‚Äù on gender dysphoria	So I recently revealed to my religious parents that I want to transition. My dad has been pretty supportive and even promised to see what our insurance covers for gender affirming care. My mom is a bit of a different story. I previously made a post talking about how my mom said she‚Äôs ‚Äúgrieving the loss of her son‚Äù, and I got some really good advice on how to approach her in a empathetic but firm way. I was able to communicate my feelings about her words really well, and for awhile I really thought we were making progress. Then I was cleaning the house the other day and stumbled upon a new book my mom is reading. It‚Äôs basically about how to deal with your newly adult kid, and how to pretty much gaslight them back into Christianity. Normally I wouldn‚Äôt pry into my parent‚Äôs business, but I figured since it concerned me, I would check it out. A certain chapter caught my eye. It‚Äôs called ‚Äúwhen your adult child violates your values‚Äù. There‚Äôs a certain passage in the chapter where the author claims that leaving the faith can cause ‚Äúgender confusion‚Äù, and that the only way to avoid this is to bring your child back into faith. I‚Äôm really scared that my mom will take that advice to heart and double down on everything. Any advice on how to approach this situation?	"Burn the book, she didn't lose a son, she never had one, you just had the wrong genitals when you were born.

I'm of the mind that religion requires a closed mind, it's inherently selfish to want to force a view on someone else that goes against proven science, not to mention harmful. 

She may very well take a decent amount of convincing to see the truth, but I'm sure you're upto it.
I don't remember the Bible having anything close to usable to argue over gender. This is purely based on the selfishness of babyboomers and their delicate sensibilities.
Throw it in the woods somewhere. I did see a book in my library called ‚Äútransgender children and youth‚Äù by elijah nealy and after several days reading through it it seemed to be a pretty decent book on the subject, Maybe replace it with that?
Sheesh, I'm not religions and I know very little about it.

But it sounds like your mom is confused and looking for help where she is most comfortable finding it.

Hell my mom keeps talking about sit coms when I bring up my gender, and I hate it. But where else are they gonna learn? From thier children? I honestly wish parents would just accept thier children know more about some things.

Anyway, if your mom needs a religions perspective on it, I don't know, but you could try to talk to anpriest or another religions figure who is accepting and hear what thier perspective is, if you don't know one i real life, try some of the religious sub reddit.

While it can be a horrible place, there are people who support trangeder people and do the god worship.
Oh my, this boils my blood.
What part of losing faith causes confusion?
I know what caused me to be confused about my gender. Being told boys aren't supposed to like girly games. Because I did, so what does that make me?
If losing faith makes you stop pretending to be comfortable in your skin, maybe there is something wrong with the faith.
As an ex transphobe I can firmly say that transphobes are really confused themselves about what gender identity even is, so them calling trans people confused is ironic.


All right, let me calm down for a second.
I recommend throwing random facts of biology at her whenever she brings out the subject.

""Did you know it's possible to tell a man from a woman based on the scan of their brain""

""Well, obviously God made men and women different""

""Studies show that typically brains of trans people look like those of their changed identity?""

""What are you talking about?""

""My brain most likely looks female, meaning I was never really a boy, I just had boy's body.""

This revelation will confuse her.

From that it can go two ways. Either she doubles down in her ignorance, or she'll start looking at whether it's true. I doubt she will order you to get an MRI to prove you're trans, she loves you, so if she doesn't reject the science, she will give you the benefit of the doubt and start mending her prejudice. Emphasis on the word: start.
I think your best bet is to find some trans-positive Christian resources and share those with your mother. It's clear her faith is very important to her. If there's a way that she can support you while also feeling that she's remaining true to her faith, she's much more likely to come around. That might also help your dad, too. 

&#x200B;

I also wouldn't necessarily panic. The fact that she's reading this book doesn't necessarily mean she agrees with what it says.
Burn the book and make up some bullshit that sounds religious and ""logical"" as a way to explain your dysphoria.
Thanks for the suggestion!"	qfnf95	trans	13	0.9	2021-10-25 18:44:24
Living your life to please others	"Are you reluctant to transition, or live more authentically, because you‚Äôre worried what other people think? 

Here‚Äôs the reality: Most people want you to be happy. Even if that means being trans. So if you are influenced by what people think, know that most people don‚Äôt care if you‚Äôre trans. Many of them are super supportive allies. MOST of the world is on our side. 

Don‚Äôt let a small handful of developmentally stunted bullies discourage you. They would find something to hate about you whether you transitioned or not. They don‚Äôt deserve any respect."	"This made my day better thank you
Thanks, I appreciate this. I heard another trans girl say something related in that that you can‚Äôt light yourself on fire to keep others warm. You have a responsibility to yourself.
Yeah. 

End of the day, some people will hate you no matter what. So don‚Äôt give them any of your happiness. They don‚Äôt deserve it. 

Are you thinking of transitioning?
I am considering it. I stopped therapy a few months ago and haven‚Äôt been able to find a new therapist that I get in sync with. The mental health system here in the US is totally broken from my experience.  I think I need to in order ti become mentally well long term. I know i will be alone as my wife said she won‚Äôt travel this road with me very far.  I will essentially be on my own and that is very scary to me. I‚Äôm 58 and not getting younger and would probably have to change careers. The company I work for is small and not very accepting, despite the laws. 

How has your transitioning been going?  I would like to chat sometime if you are open to it.
Feel free to DM me anytime.

The good news is you know where there will be resistance. You won‚Äôt be surprised it. You can plan ahead for it.

How do I help a young trans boarder?	"I'll call him 'T'.  He's a trans boy, just turned 18, a son of very dear family friends.  We've known T's family since before he was born, and helped raise him...but his father is ex-military and very strict, and there's only so much we could do to cushion that.  His parents allowed him to start transitioning but it's obvious they weren't happy about it.  I think he's taking anti-depressants but no hormones that I know of.

T has just moved in with my wife and I.  He and his parents mutually agreed that he should get out of their house as soon as he graduated from high school.  He's in our guest room now, and he'll be looking for a job, and we've promised his father that we'll make him pay rent as soon as he's able.

My worry is that T is just...I dunno, beaten down.  He rarely makes eye contact.  He apologizes for everything.  He's submissive to the point of cringey.  The poor kid has zero self-esteem.  He has no aspirations or wants that I can tell, aside from someday getting top surgery.  (He doesn't want bottom surgery, claiming it never turns out well.)  I worry that he's suicidal, but he speaks so rarely, who could tell?

I do not care one bit what gender T chooses.  I loved him when he was an outspoken little girl, and I love him now that he's a trembling, terrified boy.  I don't like that he's grown up this way, but I had little opportunity to help before.  Now that he's in our house, I have a little more influence.

How can I help this young trans boy regain their self-esteem and find some joy in his life?"	"Wow, that‚Äôs one hell of a responsibility you are taking on. I am MTF, my partner is FTM and my 17 year old son is FTM. I understand what it‚Äôs like to be brow beaten. It put me into a deep depression, I got lost in food and ended up 400lbs. 

He probably has been caged so long, he may not know how to trust just yet. The best thing you can do is respect him. Let him know you respect his feelings as valid. Encourage him to join a transgender youth group (if there is one your area), but never force it. There is probably a whole shot load of emotional baggage he needs to unpack. Be patient with him and re earn his trust. 

I should add, sounds like he is leaving a very abusive household. If he asks you not to tell anything to his parents, do not break that trust. I am 42, and I can‚Äôt be in the same county as my mother without having a panic attack.
It may help to validate his identity, and emotions, to let him know that he has people who support and love him. Maybe T will feel better if you accompany him in the transition process, and help build his confidence and his hope that things will get better and that he can do more than just survive. Also encouraging him to go to terapy could help him a lot, it will help him to better understand his emotions and how to deal with negative thoughts, it is always good to have a professional guide. I hope this helps you and I hope T feels better soon.
Yo, make a list for therapists that treat depression in your area and get him to them. 

A therapist provides much that a close friend or relative can't. A 3rd party that is not involved with the patient's life, a professional voice that has already heard many horrors of life. Tons of medical knowledge.

It is expensive but once he finds the right one, he can finally be vulnerable enough to open up for the better.
Your best bet is getting him into therapy without forcing him. It only works if he wants to go himself. Apart from that, try helping him out with transitioning as much as you can. Given your username I take it you're male yourself, so you can help him learn how to shave when he starts growing a beard, teach him about bathroom etiquette (always leaving a stall in between two occupied ones free and the likes), go with him to buy some male clothes if he doesn't have any yet and all those other things. Just remember that in the end of the day he needs to be alright with all of this.

Also, about the self-esteem thing, I know what it's like to have zero self-esteem myself. I used to think I was worthless and that even the things I was good at were useless. Luckily I'm better now. What helped for me was reading through a notebook I wrote full of poems a couple of years before because I was shocked at how good some of them were. It helped because I love writing so being impressed at the quality of the things I, iyashikay, wrote gave me a good start towards healing. Is there something he likes that he is good at? Maybe you could try that out.

Also, before I end this, I just wanted to say you are an amazing person for wanting to help him like this and letting him live with you. Not many people would go the lengths you've already gone. I wish you all the things you could ever wish for.
I feel like maybe he doesn't feel like he has autonomy, or maybe isn't even sure what autonomy even is.  Others suggested therapy, and I do too.  I also think you will need to make sure he feels like he has freedom. You may have to make it explicitly clear to him that he has freedom.

Also have be sure to do things (and not do other things) to enforce the idea that he now has autonomy. Not an easy task since it's possible to do or say things that may seem benign to you but might trigger feelings of being restricted. Especially difficult if he happens to be neurodivergent .
Adding in to the therapist comments from others: make sure the therapist is at the very least trauma informed if not a trauma specialist. CPTSD seems likely growing up in that type of  environment and you've listed symptoms that are associated with abuse, though not exclusively so.
Be vulnerable first. This my advice for anytime u need someone to be feel safe. Being vulnerable with them usually makes people feel a lot safer being vulnerable with u.
It sounds like his family wasn‚Äôt the best at that and may have been the opposite of the safe space someone like that needed.
I'll keep his trust, but I can't speak for my wife.  She's a mom, through-and-through, and she tends to team up with other moms to help mother each others' children.  These ladies raise their children as part of a village.  (I married into the mix after my wife's children were grown.)

I'll have to talk to my wife about that.
I doubt that his parents hit him; they're good people, just very strict.  But they had odd types of discipline, such as telling him to drop and give them 20 pushups in public when he mouthed off once.  I'm sure that leaves its own kind of emotional scars.
You don't have to hit a child to make them live in fear of you. Living somewhere you don't feel safe or feel like you can turn to anyone, especially as a child, has life damaging consequences. Humiliating your kid in public can be damaging, especially if it done repeatedly. I would highly advise posting over on r/CPTSD for advice as well. This is likely going to be a very long and difficult road for him, even without the additional stress being trans brings."	vpjjed	trans	14	1.0	2022-07-02 04:32:29
Transgender Literature- Her Story	" 

**Her Story**

I first started asking my mother to call me Samantha at the age of 8. It was brushed off as confusion, ‚ÄúYour name is Sam. You are a boy and only girls are called Samantha‚Äù. She didn‚Äôt understand how each correction she made stung like a slap on a fresh wound that would never heal. She didn‚Äôt know that every time she wrote me off as ‚Äúgoing through a phase,‚Äù a part of my identity would stir in confusion. Most importantly, she didn‚Äôt know that I was her daughter, just waiting to be acknowledged for who I truly am.

My first love was a kid named Jeremy. He sat two rows ahead of me and one seat to the right. The angle was perfect for me to see him smile when his friends said something funny, leading me to never get any work done. 

I first confessed my love to him one day at recess. It was by the picnic bench and 3 minutes before our next class was supposed to start. It was a precise timing; I wanted to tell him and then be able to run and hide from a safe distance. The safe distance being the space between his desk and mine. The fact that my plan had an escape route should have been the first sign to abort the mission. I completely ignored any conflicting thoughts running through my head as I continued towards him. My mind quickly ran over the worst-case scenario, and the only thing I could come up with was him saying no and me moving on with his funnier best friend, Mason.

My heart was pounding so fast that I could barely hear the crunch of the gravel with every step I took. No thoughts ran through my head at this point, only a picture of him and me on our wedding day, him in a dark suit and me in a white dress. Yes, I am aware I was just thinking about moving on with his best friend, but what can I say? I am a hopeless romantic. As the daydream came to an end, we were finally face to face. He was looking at me as if I had been standing in front of him for hours without saying a word.

‚ÄúWill you be my boyfriend?‚Äù It came out much louder and more demanding than I was expecting. His face scrunched up immediately; I could only see only the blacks of his eyes. 

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs Adam and Eve, not Adam and Steve, gay boy!‚Äù His words sent daggers through my heart, and I immediately looked around to make sure no one heard. With every word that came out of his mouth, it was like a drop of acid pooling and distorting the picture of us I had in my head. *Gay? I am not gay.* 

The sound of the final warning bell caused everyone to run toward the school doors, even him. I slowly followed the other students, not taking my eyes off Jeremy for a moment. On the way back into the classroom, there was a constant whisper going back and forth between him and his friends. 

*I am not gay*, was the only thought rushing through my head as I closed my eyes and hid my face down on my desk. This was the first time I‚Äôd purposely looked anywhere other than towards the direction of my beloved. I did not have to question his whereabouts due to the snickering coming from his side of the room.

It seemed that the laughing would never come to an end, and the only thing I knew for sure was I needed to be out of this room. Without raising my hand or asking for permission, I bolted out of the classroom. I did not hear the teacher call for me, so she must have not noticed. 

As I walked down the hall, I went towards the bathroom. It was the only place where I wouldn‚Äôt be questioned about why I wasn‚Äôt in class. Once I reached my destination, I realized there was another hurdle coming my way. I stood between two doors, one labeled male and the other labeled female and all I could do was pause. 

I whispered, ‚Äúscrew it,‚Äù as I grabbed the door to the right of me, marked with a girl icon, and went inside. At this moment, I broke down my walls and let me be me, let me be Samantha. The girl who had just gotten her heart broken, not ‚Äúgay boy Sam.‚Äù  The moment I walked in and saw the cream-colored stalls wide open and no one inside I felt as if I could relax. I quickly locked myself in the first stall I walked past and sat down on the closed toilet seat. 

‚ÄúYou are allowed to feel. You are allowed to have a moment,‚Äù I whispered to myself as tears ran down my cheeks. I chanted these words over and over again until I finally let my mind drift away. If only I looked the way I feel, would things have gone differently? 

I reran through everything that had happened, only this time as Samantha. I would have walked up to him with my long hair blowing in the wind. My uniform would have been a khaki skirt instead of slacks. When I approached him he would be imagining me in my wedding dress as I imagined him in his suit. He would have greeted me by saying, ‚ÄúHello Ms. Samantha, you are looking beautiful as always.‚Äù  I would have blushed and curtsied in response. Before I would be able to say a word he would have stopped me and grabbed my hand, ‚ÄúWould you be my girlfriend?‚Äù he would ask.

‚ÄúOf course,‚Äù I would exclaim with joy. He would march me right up to his friends with pride and tell them how lucky he was to have a girl like me. 

***A girl like me.*** These words replayed on a neverending loop as my tears dried up and I was once again in the real world. I knew it would only be moments before a teacher would come looking for me, so I quickly composed myself as I opened the stall door. I took one loop around the bathroom and took everything in before I landed on the mirror standing parallel to me. It felt, once again, as if the world was crushing me as I looked into the mirror at *him*. Sam, the boy that never matched the way I felt. Every step I took I felt farther away from her, me, Samantha, or whatever the hell anyone wanted to call it. Every step closer I lost myself.

Darkness was all I saw and felt as I blacked out. It was as if a black fog was consuming me, and I had to fight it off before it took me for good. Before I knew it the floor was covered in glass, and the mirror and Sam were once again gone. My knuckles were bleeding from the hit they just took, destroying the vision of what others see. Something in me felt free, but at the same time, I was still locked away. A loud gasp brought me back to reality. Standing behind me was my teacher, and I knew I was going to be in trouble. Bracing for the yelling, I held my breath, but nothing came.

‚ÄúSam, are you okay?‚Äù She spoke in barely a whisper. I was expecting her first question to be, ‚Äúwhy are you in the girl‚Äôs bathroom‚Äù but I guess the shattered glass and blood dripping over my hands took top priority. 

I couldn‚Äôt respond as I focused on my breathing. How do I even begin to explain what actions have brought me here? She quickly whispered into the walkie on her hip for someone to get a first aid kit and leave it at the front of the bathroom door. After she received a response that it was on the way, she slowly started to make her way towards me. It felt as if we had been standing together for hours when in reality it had only been about 60 seconds. 

As I let the tears roll down my cheeks she finally spoke again, ‚ÄúWould you like it if I called you Samantha?‚Äù this was the first time I made eye contact with her since she entered the bathroom. 

All the teachers were aware of what my mom called a *mental condition*. She was sure to bring it up and let everyone know it is not acceptable. If I were to request to be called Samantha it needed to be shut down immediately. If this rule wasn‚Äôt followed they would be hearing from her, and it wouldn‚Äôt be pretty. She was afraid of anyone encouraging it.

A bunch of sounds ran out of my mouth before any actual words would formulate. ‚ÄúPlease,‚Äù was all that I could muster. I wanted to scream *thank you* and wrap her in a hug in the hope that she would never let go. 

I quickly analyzed myself for any glass as I moved over to a clean sink. I washed away the blood and patted it dry. I heard the door open, and I knew she was grabbing the first aid kit left outside. I didn‚Äôt know if I would be able to look at her out of embarrassment, so I made sure all my concentration was on my hands. I counted every cut, found every bruise, and picked at every hangnail. Soon I felt her cool hands on mine fixing all of the damage I had caused. 

‚ÄúYou have the right to be who you want to be, Samantha,‚Äù I didn‚Äôt respond, causing her to continue, ‚ÄúThere is support right here in this school, and I know the local high schools have it too. They have LGBTQ+ meetings, counselors, and other mental health tools. They can also help you find any of the support you may need outside of school. I know it is a big step, but just know I am here to support you in any way that you need.‚Äù I could feel the urgency in every word, and I knew that she meant it. 

The tears that trickled down turned into pools, but this time it was from relief. I had never realized my small frame was about to break from the pressure of living in this world in a body that did not feel like mine. As she finished caring for my wounds, she told me stories of what it was like being part of the LGBTQ+ community. For the first time I felt understood and welcomed. I am normal, these feelings are normal, and I am valid. There were no longer mean and angry words running through my head; only her kind words played like my favorite song. I go back to this moment and relish in the feeling of care and acceptance when things get hard. I will forever hold her close to my heart as I live out my newly transitioned life as a Transgender **woman**."	Ngl, made me tear up a little. Sweet	n3zjpk	trans	14	1.0	2021-05-03 15:52:26

I saw a fishy post promoting some sort of magical cure for dysphoria	"Spoiler: there isn't a cure for dysphoria, and if there were it wouldn't take a day to make dysphoria go away.

So I was just scrolling on reddit when I saw a promoted post titled something like ""permanent solution for dysphoria"" (I'm sorry, I don't have screenshots and I'm trying to remember). This post was a link to a web called dysphoriasolutions.com which contained a text detailing how to get rid of dysphoria in just a day using only a pill (I think it was called propanol?) and exposure therapy (usually used for treating trauma and fears). This wouldn't work. I'm not an expert on gender dysphoria or neurobiology, but dysphoria is not caused by traumas, its something that you're born with, your body just doesnt fit with your brain and the only way of making dysphoria less painful is by transitioning.

And look, I'm not a scientist but I can assure you, there's no magical cure for anything. Please always be careful about these kinds of stuff that promise a magical cure in only 24 hours or something like that. It's not real. Don't be fooled.

After reading this web, I was dumbfounded, I couldn't believe misinformation like this was being spread around reddit, so i went into the used who posted this promoted post. They went by u/dysphoriasolutions and √±osted this ln a subreddit they made named r/dysphoriasolutions. In one of the posts on this account, someone was trying to debunk this supposed ""cure"" with some solid arguments, arguing with u/dysphoriasolutions. However, this used left the argument suddently and deleted all their comments arguing with this redditor trying to debunk the ""cure"".

So I decided to comment myself. I asked mostly where were the studies that proved this ""cure"", if there was empirical poof, if any experiments were done to test the ""cure"", if they were a scientist or doctor... They didn't link any studies, and, when I asked for them again, they went silent.

A fw minutes later i look into this weird reddic sccount and found out that it had been deleted. This was really weird. Please everyone, don't be fooled by this kind of stuff. 

Has anyone else encountered this before? Would love to have if someone has seen this too."	">using only a pill (I think it was called propanol?)

_propranolol????_ buddy I take that every day for my heart lol and I'm still very trans lol. I don't have a ton of dysphoria because I'm relatively far along in my transition and acceptance of myself but what dysphoria I do have sure as hell isn't being cured by [checks notes] medication I take to make my heart rate chill the fuck out. Like they're not even trying to make up their own drug it's just like... A regular old beta blocker? That just slows down your heart rate? 

Breaking news, dysphoria caused by Heart Go Too Fast and nothing else. Gender dysphoria now conveniently diagnosed through a simple heart rate monitor. /joke /sarcasm

Anyway yeah I've heard of them before or heard others mention them they're a total scam. Didn't know they were trying to peddle propranolol as a dysphoria cure tho lol.
Sounds like a conversion therapy scam. What utter trash.
Transphobe attempt to convert everyone back into the closet, best to just report it
yea it sounds like they want trans hearts to stop beating. Not Cash Money at all
""pop blood pressure medication until your dysphoria vanishes"" = kill yourself by lowering your blood pressure to lethal levels
Their argument was that this medication controlled uhm the reception of adenalin and other hormones activated during a flight or fly situation? And this pill had to be combined with a few hours of exposure therapy to work.

It was so weird, with this post I hope to bring awareness because this ""cure"" was being promoted to me, a trans person. I'm worried that, if someone were really desperate, they would try something like this without consulting a real doctor.
They're essentially doing that thing where you take a tiny grain of truth and twist and stretch it into whatever you want. Is propranolol sometimes used in the treatment of anxiety? Sure. And it is related to adrenaline, because adrenaline is a part of how your body controls heart rate. But it's still primarily treating the heart. Fast heart rate is a part of fight or flight, so when you're freaking out your heart does too, and there's an association that builds. Your brain can be ""tricked"" into thinking it's in fight or flight mode if your heart rate is high (like if you have tachycardia), leading to more anxiety, or your brain can sometimes be ""tricked"" into feeling less scared if your heart rate doesn't get as elevated. In simplified terms, a beta blocker puts a rate limiter on your heart rate so it doesn't get too high, and this can also lessen anxiety. Especially considering, speaking from experience, having a heart rate of 100-150 bpm on a regular basis can be rather concerning and stressful. (also side note but especially amoungst people who were AFAB there is also a history of tachycardia symptoms being dismissed and ignored and being misdiagnosed with anxiety instead, so that's also a complicating factor but that's not 100% relevant to this specifically). But it's still not a psychiatric medication. It is still, primarily, a heart rate med. And it's ability to sometimes help with anxiety doesn't mean it magically works for all other emotional woes or forms of stress. And it certainly doesn't ""relieve you of all of your negative emotions connected to your triggers"" like their website claims. It doesn't do that. Sure would be great if my heart medication also happened to cure my anxiety or depression or trauma or dysphoria, but it doesn't. I don't even totally get what's like, in it for these folks? They're not the ones selling the propranolol as far as I can tell. I guess they're maybe just transphobes making a fake website so other transphobes can point and say ""look theres a cure for dysohoria so you should do that instead of transition :)"" even tho the website pretends to be trans friendly. This whole thing is weird and fishy.
Thank you for explaining how this medication really works! Yeah, fishy af, I'm glad they deleted their account."	try61j	trans	14	0.86	2022-03-30 04:22:21
(MTF) At a loss	"I've come to find myself without friends recently, well that is if I ever had friends to begin with. Back in high-school I remember my best friend calling me a friend of convenience, at the time I thought it was a joke but now years later it hurts me. For my little friend group I jumped through hoops for everybody and everything just to hang out and sometimes play video games with them. Now it's like I'm just a nuisance. 

Ofcourse it all leads me back to one thing and that was me coming out last year to them as transgender. It felt like it killed me for a day, but in the end they accepted me and we all moved on. Except no one actually used my new name or pronouns, I was terrified to try and correct them. So eventually and slowly we just drifted apart. I found out one day that they were doing things behind my back and without me. 

Part of me is so over all of this and part of me is still trying to repair it. I left quietly for a week to see of anyone cared,  and nobody said anything to me. And I came crawling back because thats what I've always done. 

Like I know I'm hormonal and just an emotional mess right now. I spent my childhood, teenage and some adult years with these people. And all I am is just for convenience? Like I'm terrible with new people cause I'm still early in my transition so I'm just at a loss right now.

Thanks for reading this whoever is out there."	"Thats terrible. Friends have always been a hard thing for me too make and the reason I have any is bc im too trusting. I hope you find people who care about you and accept you.
I'm kind of in the same boat, I had nerdy friends, we used to play games and just have fun but as I started becoming more openly queer and left leaning they all hardcore mocked me constantly under the guise of ""just friends shit talking"" and being annoyed that I was becoming ""too political"" even though they were always the ones to try and debate me but no one else got dragged in the group chat for their fb posts being too whiny or attention seeking so it started with me leaving the chat, then moving away and so slowly we just drifted apart and I'm trying to build a new friend group but I know I will, COVID just made that really tough for the last few years"	wn72t7	trans	14	0.94	2022-08-13 06:04:24
Rant of a dad with a transitioning daughter	"I'm not even sure where to begin. I guess the basics - this is a throwaway as my ex-wife knows my primary reddit account and I don't want to include her in this. 

I'm a recently divorced 36 y/o cis male with two beautiful girls who we will call J (5) and E (3). J was born biologically male, but during the course of the divorce began referring to herself as ""her"" and asked us to do the same. 

Initially I thought it was just play (or a phase) because I thought 4/5 was pretty early to be self identifying, but as time passed I couldn't deny the evidence before my eyes, my wonderful girl was blossoming and it was beautiful to watch. I sat her down to talk about it and asked her what she wanted to be called, what she felt like, some pretty surface level questions I just wanted to know. After she answered my questions, she asked me ""Is that okay, Daddy?"" and all I could ask her back was ""Are you still my child?"" to which she replied ""yes, of course!"" There wasn't much else to say other than ""As long as you're my child, you can be whoever or whatever you want. I only care that you're still my baby, it doesn't matter if your my baby girl or baby boy."" My only goal has been to support her and her sister to be the best versions of themselves, and to help them pursue that discovery. I hope I'm doing that right. Tonight has filled me with a sense of doubt and dread.

Though the journey truly began long before the kids were born, it feels like we've graduated to a new chapter. The divorce was rough for me, and I'm ashamed to say the children weren't spared as much as they could have been. I made some mistakes along the way that cost us a lot, and I did some things that cost us the ability to be with each other. Nothing nefarious, nothing that isn't forgivable (if you ask, I'll tell), but enough to keep us from having a normal family setting. We probably won't have a true ""normal"" (what is that, even?) family setting for some time, but we will have the ability to share a home for a third of the month every month, and for me that will be sublime. 

Following the divorce I became room mates with a family friend. It's his home, and he rents me some space (one room). I knew he was conservative, and I knew he went to church, but I also knew him as a fair, decent man. I sat him down tonight to discuss having my children in the house, which he had been open to and had invited when he had heard about the possibility months ago. All was set, logistically - now one room became two! 

Politically, I'm probably considered liberal because I believe in social equality and what that means for the responsibility of government, but in truth I find that on most non-social issues I lean toward the middle. Socially, I guess you could say I am very liberal. I don't subscribe to hate, bigotry, or misogyny. Gender roles in my marriage didn't exist - we were a team through and through, we just hated each other, unfortunately. Roe v. Wade being overturned is a dark turn for the nation. All lives really do matter, but the marginalized ones need our help the most and I believe it's the duty of those who are not marginalized to step up and defend those who are. I have gay friends, I grew up in a liberal city with lots of color and I grew up very integrated. I've been fortunate enough to travel the world and meet amazing people from all walks. Racists and bigots confused me more than anything until I was in my early adulthood. I just..didn't understand. I had found so much love in my diverse group of friends. Who could hate my lovely band of misfits? I have to ask myself that question about my child now. Who could hate this wonderful, brilliant, beautiful creature? Well I found out tonight - someone who hasn't even met her. 

After coming to an agreement about having my children here, I felt that I had to broach the topic of my (trans? transitioning?) daughter. I knew, deep down that if it were a surprise that it would be a problem and I wanted to attempt to avoid future conflict. When I mentioned that J is presenting as female and that her mother believes this as the beginning of her social transition, he said ""That's just sick."" I immediately stopped him, and myself, and told him that this is the reason we were having this conversation. I expressed to him that my children, regardless of his political or religious views, will never, ever hear that kind of statement from someone I live with, or I simply cannot live with them. It's a big house, and the chances of us interacting together are minimal, but I had to make it clear: your hate will not be tolerated. The conversation progressed into light but pointed debates about religion, ""gods view,"" and so on. I made it clear that my children will be loved for whomever they are as long as they are not doing harm to themselves or others and he stressed to me that allowing J to believe that she was a girl was doing harm to her. When I asked him why he cared what gender my children, or anyone else is, matters to him he could not provide an answer. When he argued that it was not natural in gods eyes, I asked him ""Why would god make my child this way only to demand that she change and be something that she isn't or doesn't want to be? Is your god truly that cruel?"" and again no real good answer, though he did answer with ""That is His plan.""

I want to stress that, while this might sound like bad conversation, it was actually well taken all around, no arguing, no shouting, it wasn't heated. It was a remarkably calm conversation with two very different and opposing view points. At one point, we started talking about the community in the area and all of the other kids who live nearby who they could play with, and he suggested I bring the kids to his church. At that point, I had to be blunt and completely open and honest with him. I told him ""Honestly, and I mean this with as much compassion for those in your church as I can muster - I won't ever take them there. They would not be accepted or loved there and your church would only try to tell them the reasons they are bad and wrong instead of loving them as they are. My children are not bad or wrong, and they won't be convinced otherwise"" He replied with ""Well, I love the person."" This one got me, and I got a bit snarky, and replied ""Apparently only if that person is what you want them to be as defined by your book or god, right? Not for who that person really is?"" Again he was silent, and I broke the ice by saying that ""Just please keep the hateful rhetoric to yourself while me or my children are around. I know this is partially a business decision (I pay a big chunk of his mortgage), but I enjoy living here and I enjoy you as a friend. I appreciate that we can discuss this stuff civilly and not be screaming or freaking out like so many others are tempted to do."" 

So, that was a long story to share to say, simply, that I am filled with anxiety and some dread in this moment. My living situation is convenient and affordable, in a good neighborhood - all of this in an area of the country that has seen insane levels of cost of living increases. That living situation, over the course of a 20 minute conversation, developed a clock. I don't fear for my children here, but the end is neigh, as they say? Maybe I will be pleasantly surprised. Maybe I will help to change someone's point of view. Doubt it, but I guess it doesn't hurt to try. 

I think what got me the most is that someone who has never met my child, who knows nothing about her but this detail, could feel anything negative about her in any way. I now realize what lay ahead for my baby girl and that realization brought me to tears. This world is filled with shit for those of us who don't fit into one of the many often disparaged and marginalized minority groups. Shit some of you readers may have had to shovel yourself. Shit I can't even imagine, and frankly don't want to. I've cried enough tonight.

I guess the whole point of my post is really simple - I guess I'm scared. I'm scared for my baby, and I need some hope. I'm not scared to have to move, that was always going to happen, the clock is just accelerated now. I'm not scared to lose a friend, while I have some other conservative friends, I can live without the ones who feel negatively toward my children. I'm not scared to defend my child to the bigots and assholes in the world - that's a pleasure that I will gladly take on for my child. I'm scared that I won't do a good enough job preparing them to deal with it themselves. I'm scared that there's no real preparation for what's to come. 

Anyway, if you made it this far, thanks for listening to my rant."	You're a brave dad and I wish I had been so lucky. By the sounds of things you're doing great and as long as you stand behind her and support her then you will do well. It's such a lovely thing to see that there are parents in this world who can be unquestionably supportive. I wish the best for you and your family and I hope you find the balance of teaching your daughters how to deal with the insane standards put upon people in every walk of life and protecting them from the bad things that befall many. Best of luck, Dad!	11dyxkp	trans	15	0.94	2023-02-28 06:24:43
"""I love you, but I can‚Äôt keep thinking I‚Äôm damned for being happy."" - An Open Letter in the Spirit of Pride"	"(TW - Transphobia) 

*When I was 16 years old, I came out at transgender. I first came out to my parents, who were ambivalent, but supportive nonetheless.* 

*A while later, when I was just under 17 years old, I came out to my*

*extremely conservative grandparents. I wrote a 2 or 3 page letter to them, complete with resources to help them understand who I was, what to do, etc. I was insanely proud of the letter, as it was very well-written and I took days to write it. They were only five minutes away from my house, but I gave the letter to them and went back home.*

*Shortly after, I received a response. I was given a ‚Äúletter‚Äù consisting of blue ink scrawled on several sheets of notebook paper. It was full of religious rambling, saying that God created me the way I was and that I could never be a woman. I expected it, but needless to say, I was crushed.* 

*The letter was met with backlash from my family for about a month, until it all blew over and everything was ‚Äúok‚Äù again. From that point on, if I ever brought up the fact that my grandparents would never say my name or gender me correctly, my family would get furious with me. I was just instigating and bringing it up to cause trouble, they would say.*

*About a year after that, I wrote this letter to my grandparents.*

\-

Dear Nana and Pop, 

I love you both so much. You‚Äôre more than family to me. I mean, you gave us a roof over our heads and a shoulder to cry on and Pop acted as a surrogate father to me when everything was going to hell. You both have helped Taydan, Mom, and I financially, psychologically, and emotionally and I will be forever grateful for that. 

That being said, I‚Äôm finding it hard to be around you both without my head going to dark places. I keep thinking back to how you responded to my letter last year. Since that time, I‚Äôve changed a lot. I‚Äôve worked very hard to get myself to the point that I am at right now and I consider this to be the best I‚Äôve ever been in my life. Even with these changes, your response to my letter still hurts me just as much as when I read it over a year ago. 

It‚Äôs obvious neither of us are going to change any time soon, so this is my final attempt to try and help you understand me, to help you understand why I have to transition and why I have to make these changes to my life in order to live an existence that I can be proud of. 

I‚Äôm going to be blunt with this letter. I refuse to dance around issues with fancy words and elaborate metaphors this time around, so I will be as blunt as possible in an effort to make it clear to you what I am saying. 

\-

I want you to know I didn‚Äôt ‚Äúchoose‚Äù to transition. I didn‚Äôt start transitioning because it was fun or trendy or some kind of modern novelty like a tattoo or a piercing. I transitioned because I saw my life come to a halt at a crossroads. I stood at a fork in a road that I walked for 16 years, one that ended with two paths. One path was transitioning. The other was not, and it was a path that ended in my death. I could finally kill my seemingly eternal demons or they would kill me. I had a decision to make, and my only choice was that I *had no choice.* Since I‚Äôve come out and started transitioning, I‚Äôve progressed in my health and as a human being more than I ever have before. I‚Äôm slowly getting more and more comfortable with my body. I can actually have meaningful relationships with people because I am learning to accept myself for once in my life. I‚Äôm legitimately happy with where my life is going for the first time ever! This was a necessary step I needed to take and one that I needed to take to accomplish these goals.

Even if, by some absolute miracle, it was a choice, why the hell would I take it? Why would I *want* to be ostracized by people I thought I could call friends? Why would I want to be ineligible for certain jobs and be constantly terrified that I may not get a job solely for who I am? Why would I want to receive violence, harassment, and death threats for doing nothing more than establishing my identity? I never asked to live in fear of doing simple things like going to a public bathroom or swimming with other people. This was not a choice at all. This is out of my control, so my ‚Äúchoice‚Äù is to continue living and refusing to die.

\-

I say that I have a hard time being around you because everything feels so disingenuous, on my behalf and yours. You said these horrible things to me in that letter, there was silence for a month because everyone was angry, and then we all forgot about it and everything was fine. And I played along! I pretended everything was done and over with and I lied  because I was too afraid to do anything. I was too afraid to be the troublemaker in the family again, too afraid to stir up uncomfortable conversations. I just wanted to say ‚Äúscrew it‚Äù, cut my losses, and forget about it.

As much as I wanted to do just that, to forget about it and move on, 

I couldn‚Äôt, no matter how hard I tried. I was always thinking and trying to figure out just how you see me and who you think I am. Do you see me as the heathen you wrote about in that letter? Maybe you have since changed your viewpoint and I‚Äôm wrong? Either way, I don‚Äôt care anymore. It doesn‚Äôt matter to me. I refuse to keep myself up at night thinking about this and I refuse to waste anymore energy on it. I will not change and I will not relent, regardless of what you think about me or how you see me. 

I wish I could be the grandson you wanted. I wish I could grow up to be a father with kids and a wife in a house at the top of the hill. I wish I could go be the man you wanted; one that can relate to Pop, one that could be the tough, blue collar, christian man you wanted. But that‚Äôs all it is. *A wish*. I can‚Äôt be that, no matter how hard I try. I could sacrifice my health, my happiness, and my sanity and become that person, but I refuse to live a thoughtless and joyless existence just to satisfy others. I‚Äôm not that person and I won‚Äôt be caught dead trying to become him. I‚Äôm going to keep transitioning. I‚Äôm going to continue becoming the young woman I was always meant to be. I‚Äôm going to keep being the person I‚Äôve worked hard to become and I‚Äôm happier than I‚Äôve ever been before because of that work. 

This transition is very important to me, and I would be overjoyed to have your support so you can see all the great things I will accomplish and all the people I will reach with my endeavors. I would love more than anything to know that you do not see me as this sick heretic, but as a person who has finally overcome the hardest hell she was forced to go through. I love you, and I always will, but if you cannot support my journey to happiness, I‚Äôm not stopping for you. You can be along for the ride, or you cannot. I love you, but I can‚Äôt keep thinking I‚Äôm damned for being happy.

I‚Äôm sorry that I‚Äôve been avoiding and ignoring you out of fear of the unknown. I want you to know that I am willing to talk to you both about anything you want to know. You are both probably very confused or have no idea about transgender people besides Caitlyn Jenner (who does not represent who I am, by the way!), so I seem like a foreign concept. Please, ask questions! All I ask in return is your understanding.

Lastly, I do not want a response to this letter. I don‚Äôt want to start an argument or a grudge, I want peace and unity. I don‚Äôt want a response, because as you both have probably heard or said before: ‚Äúactions speak louder than words.‚Äù. I will see your response through your actions, and I‚Äôm hoping I can get my peace and you can get your understanding. 

Love,

Skylar Rose"	"This is powerful. I see why you made that line, ‚ÄúI love you, but I can‚Äôt keep thinking I‚Äôm damned for being happy‚Äù, the title; It‚Äôs very strong and I wish you the best in your journey. üëç

My coming out story!	"Hi all. My name is Aaron(Arynne) wanted to say that I have recently told my parents about my desire to transition MtF. My dad I was scared of the most because I was the first ""son"" he had out of my seven siblings, so naturally I was brought up to take care of my brothers and sisters in a paternal role. I knew as I was growing up, I would always want to engage with beautiful and pretty things. I loved drawing princesses and female heroines like Cardcaptors Sakura and sailor moon. My dad had several relationships because it didn't work out with my mom. Each girlfriend he had ended up dating, they had a daughter I would hang out with and play with dolls. (I even stole some LOL)

One of these particular relationships my father had was a woman with a recently transitioned MtF ex, something that I had never thought was possible in my 9yr old brain. A man could be a woman? I had never gave it a second thought until I had reached adulthood. I had questions but every one made it sound like a big deal,  so I never bothered again.

I found my role models in my three aunts, each time that things were bad with my parents, I would visit them for a place to stay, or advice.¬† Their views on feminism and treating people as they were people and not seeing things at face value really helped shaped my way thinking. The youngest of my three aunts would always visit me on my birthday, something I would look forward to eagerly. They really didn't care what anyone thought about them, and I really appreciated their influence on my life.


I had always felt comfortable around a female presence. They made me feel at ease. I truly felt uneasy when it I was being questioned by my fellow cismales about my sexuality (apparently it's a crime to skin your Xbox360 in cute images of Hatsune Miku). Because of this stigma I had hidden alot of my ""feminine"" interests behind a veil, usually only expressing myself through video games and internet spaces where I could be fine with being myself(Gaia Online helped me a ton in high-school). I've often thought myself as female, how I would experience things in social situations differently. I've thought about myself being a mother and how I would feel so jealous of the bonds that mothers have with their children, even before birth. I would often have fantasies about being a princess and dreamt about the experiences of becoming female in a world where noone knew me. I wanted to ""feel pretty"". I wanted someone to realize I was beautiful. I wanted to be a girl, but never knew back then how to vocalize it.

Fast forward 15 years and I'm a 29 year old `cis male` at a crossroads with my life. I had come out of a second failed relationship and I was staying at a friend's house while I was struggling to keep up with my bills. In my relationship I had experienced my partners dissatisfaction with my lack of interest in sex, eventually resulting into coming out as asexual. I had joined a lgbtq group and had done my research about my gender and sexual preference, and if I had to say what I had experienced when I had realized I was a trans girl masquerading as a cis male, it was like waking up and realizing you were underwater, and all of a sudden trying desperately to swim to the surface. 

--- CW: MILD HOMOPHOBIC AND TRANSPHOBIC CONTENT AHEAD ---

After my realization, I initially tried to tell my gf(now my ex) , and her first reaction was misogynistic ridicule. We have a 3 year old son together and she would tell me that he said ""he was turning gay""and accused me of watching videos of gay men around him. This initially set me off, but we eventually broke up after she started showing me pictures of my son in skirts, while telling me that he was going to ""follow in my footsteps"". I ended the relationship, and moved out. I couldn't handle the stress of an environment where I did not feel safe. When I got out, I felt liberated, FINALLY I could be myself. I scheduled an appointment with my therapist so I can talk about starting HRT, and I have been on a ketogenic diet since January 6th. I've lost 27 pounds, and I have never felt better about myself. 

I came out as trans to my Aunt first, as she works as a hairdresser and talks to people for a living. I was really scared because this is the first time I have even heard of someone in our family going through this before me. She had told me that I shouldn't have to apologize for being myself, and that she had my back even if noone else would. (I cried the entire phonecall after that) I then came out to my dad, who was surprisingly immediately supportive, and had my  younger sister contact me, she offered to teach me how to do my makeup(which I'm totally down for and can't wait).

 In the end I am excited to meet the woman I was yearning to be. If I could do one thing in the past. I wish I could give my younger self a big hug, and tell them that it's ok to be trans. I wish I knew sooner, but life has a funny way of forcing change when it's necessary. I hope to show you guys my goal outfit when it gets here! :3"	"You go girl!
Wow!!!! Thats great, you go girl. I wish my parents/ aunts and uncles were supportive.but my allies are my wife and sister-in-law. I wouldn‚Äôt trade their support for anything.

How to be trans and proud?	i‚Äôm officially starting my transition but i feel like my family really doesn‚Äôt care. and every time i mention my transition and how i want to get my name changed when i turn 18 but it seems like they don‚Äôt care and get awkward. i bought a tran flag and been watching trans videos to make me feel better and talk to my partner. but it eats me up because i‚Äôm starting to not feel proud of being trans. i want to hide away and just wish i wasn‚Äôt. i love speaking about being trans but my family just makes it so awkward. how can i still feel good and be proud of being trans?	"I think it really is hard. I think it comes down to how happy you are with yourself and your identity. If you can act proud, even if you are not yet, those feelings and behaviours might stick. Good luck though!
So, here's the thing:

Be proud of who you are.  Be proud of the courage you showed in becoming your actual self.  Be proud of your willingness to declare that your happiness was important and take steps that many around you were putting pressure on you not to do.  Those are things to be proud of.

Being Trans?  That isn't something you need to be proud of.  Now, that doesn't mean to be ashamed of it either, it isn't a false dichotomy, but being trans is something you -are- not something you chose to be.

To put it another way:  Pretty much every Trans person out there would have preferred to be born in a body that matched their actual gender.  We aren't proud that we were born trans.  People with severe dysphoria sometimes -hate- being identified as trans, they just want to pass and to get on with life.

So... yeah.  It isn't unusual to not want to wear trans colors and shout that you're trans from the rooftops, its fine to just want to be yourself.  Being trans is a condition that you had no say in, be proud of how well you are handling it <3
thank you so much for this! üß°"	moieun	trans	14	1.0	2021-04-11 02:25:03
I came out and I feel rejected.	"First post on here or Reddit ever. Don't know if this is allowed but it's the middle of the night and I don't have anyone to talk to. 

I came out tonight to my wife of 16 years and she took it very poorly. It's been about 6 months of open gender questioning following a lifetime of repressing my feelings, but I've been transparent with her throughout this period. 

Tonight I told her all about how much I loved her, and how I would always fight to keep her and take care of her. How I'd loved every step of the thousands of miles we've walked hand in hand. How we'd grown together and made two beautiful children. How the three of them were my entire world. And I said I'd like to propose all over again. Because I didn't think I could be her husband much longer, but I'd so, so love to be her wife. 

After being so close and intimate with me initially she jumped up from me immediately after that and just kept saying that she didn't want this. She must have said it 8 times. And she said she couldn't be attracted to me in a transitioned body. That she just wanted me to be a man.

I listened and tried so hard to not react. To just take in her pain and support her. To answer her pointed questions with love and calm. I was calm and brave and loving. We talked for hours and I held it together. I'm really proud of myself.

I get it. None of this is easy, and I know I'm a huge disappointment. She didn't ask for any of this and neither did I. I want to be understanding and support her. I'm causing so much pain. 

But I'm also just crushed. I've been rejected by the love of my life. 

I'm in tears and can't sleep. I could really just use some love. Please no bashing as you're only hearing my side."	"Just keep the talk going, but don't push... In time she may calm and realise she is okay with it and then you'll need to work past her initial reaction. 

Don't give up yet.
My heart breaks for you babe. I am so sorry you‚Äôre dealing with this. I can absolutely relate to your story. It‚Äôs not your fault at all. You can only hide who you truly are for so long. I agree with the above comment you sound extremely loving and caring. I didn‚Äôt come out to my ex of 10 1/2 years. She found out by looking through my phone. If anyone here is a huge disappointment here it‚Äôs me. I caused her to leave. She called me a bunch of transphobic names as well. It sounds like your conversation went a lot better! I commend you on your bravery for telling her that is a huge step!! I know she will respect you for being honest with her. Feel free to message me if you need someone to talk to I love helping others! ‚ù§Ô∏è
Oh, sis, it's gonna be okay. Everything will work out. I believe in you and your family and your ability to stay together, and I believe in you to be an amazing woman; with or without your wife. You sound like anything but a disappointment! You couldn't have been more loving and understanding for your wife, you're clearly a wonderful spouse regardless of your gender. No matter what this will change things for your relationship together, but how it changes is up to the two of you.

I think you responded much better than I did! My wife also didn't react like I might have liked; I had made an off hand joke about not being a man, prompting my wife to ask ""so then where're you at with that, anyway?"" in regard to my recent gender questioning. Days before this I had finally had a realization, and accepted that I am a woman. With the courage I had been slowly mustering to tell them, bolstered by repeatedly telling myself that they are my wife and that everything would be okay, I clumsily blurted out ""I'm a woman""

To my horror, my wife was silent. As I sat there waiting for their response, the seconds felt like hours. Silence. It wasn't until I had steadily progressed from heavy breathing to hyperventilating to screaming at the top of my lungs that they replied; and only to stop my screaming before the neighbors called the police. The way I was screaming, I'm sure it wouldn't have taken much longer.

I know now that they were far more drunk than I had realized, and overwhelmed in the moment; thinking of how different our lives would now be. I'm lucky enough that they accept me, but in that moment I felt so rejected and alone. We are still repairing the damage from that day, but we carry on, and we're still very much in love. I hope very much that you and your wife can do the same - but it's okay for you to be hurt by this. It's okay for her to be upset too, but you both now have to work through your feelings together and decide how to move on.
That‚Äôs an awful situation to be in and don‚Äôt feel like this reaction is your fault. You are not a disappointment and it sounds like you are in fact incredibly loving and thoughtful! Coming out is  a huge step to take in this journey and your bravery to have an open conversation like that is amazing. Remember that you are cared for and loved.
I'm just behind you in the same boat. I know it hurts, but I believe we'll all find our way. Like you mentioned, repressing it isn't going to help, but always try your best to be calm and loving. Sending love.
I did this a little over a week ago and I feel your pain. It‚Äôs really really hard to lose someone you absolutely love as your partner. The best I have been able to come up with is at least it was done in a way that will, hopefully, allow us to be friends moving forward. You deserve to be you. She also deserves her own choices, and unfortunately it sounds like she doesn‚Äôt want to be with a woman. I believe you can survive this and become yourself, your sisters will be here for you if you need to talk.
Hang in there girlfriend! This is going to take time. I just recently came out to my wife of almost 20 years. It was one of the most freeing things I have ever done. But what I came to find out was all this weight that I had in my shoulders I had taken off and put on my wife‚Äôs. Only through growing together will you be able to help lift this back off of your partners shoulder. 

This is something, that with time counseling and a lot of love and understanding that you may make it through this as you would wish for. 
My counselor told me the moment I shared my truth my ‚Äúwants and demands of the relationship are gone‚Äù you must turn them into hopes, dreams, and wishes. Your wife needs to be in the driver‚Äôs seat until she is ready to allow you back as a partner. It‚Äôs not going to be easy but when has being trans ever been easy. 

My wife and I had a safety word. Early on all I wanted to do is talk. All she wanted to do was process. Have a safe word that means pin this for now. This isn‚Äôt over. It just needs to be for today. Wait for her to bring up something. It may be totally off the wall. My wife asked me at a Starbucks drive through. ‚ÄúSo have you ever tucked.?‚Äù Yup those kind of questions. 

She needs time. She has a lot in front of her. She has to grieve for the old you. She gets to meet and help grow the woman you will become. She needs to fall in love with YOU all over again! 

So my words are never stop loving her. Never stop talking (unless she need a time to process). Both of you need counseling. You need someone from the outside to see what is really going on.  Give her time. Keep this between you two and medical professionals for now. The kids don‚Äôt need to know   right now. Wait until you and your wife are in step with whatever she decides to do. Ultimately this is her choice. Your wish. Her choice 

Hugs sis. And hang in there. Yes you can do this. The first week is the hardest.
Thank you. I won't ever give up on keeping my family together. But I can also give space and show that I'm still the parent and spouse I always was.
Thank you!
Thank you so much for sharing your story. I totally understand your reaction. It's so scary. Feeling rejected is the heart of dysphoria i think. At least for me.
Thank you. I'm trying so hard.
I appreciate that. I just don't know how I weigh being myself against holding my family together. As a man in my culture I was taught that to do something like that is remarkably selfish. You protect your family above all, even if it kills you. 

What if I'm just failing my family so completely? What could be worth that. Maybe I should just live sad instead. 

Sorry, just venting emotions.
Your note is giving me those lovely ""being seen"" vibes. It is so amazing hearing from someone approximately my age and life experience. Your advice is sage and you're helping me feel hopeful.

I hope you have the best possible day, lady.
I don‚Äôt have kids, but I know part of my choice was feeling like the negativity from the dysphoria was going to drag my wife down with me. That‚Äôs what helped me get over the feeling like I failed her.
you are not failing your family. you are a part of your family too, remember. you can‚Äôt support your family if you yourself are suffering. just give it time, and be patient. your wife will come around eventually, your family will be okay.
You too. It will get better. You‚Äôre all in at this point. Your wife will take time. I wish you the best of luck and feel free to PM me. You have some rough times ahead but you are going to have some pretty incredible times too. Cherish the time. Take your time. This is a lifetime journey not a week or month. This is not race. 
And don‚Äôt be surprised if my wife offers some advice on this thread as well.
I hear that. I had a dad that never could be emotionally open with us. And I don't want to be him for my girls.
Thank you for the reminder. I forget a lot that I have any space that matters. Like I forget I exist outside of my impact to others.
even then, you need to take care of yourself before you can take care of others. that‚Äôs how i trick myself into being nice to myself lol so i hope it helps you too
I think that's good advice. I could really use a nap.
it is nap time then, so it has been decreed"	uxbai2	trans	16	0.9	2022-05-25 06:35:49
Feeling Guilty	"I‚Äôm 22 AFAB, non-binary. 
I‚Äôve known forever that something was off about my gender. Identified as enby 2 years now, changed name about 5 weeks ago, and started seeking medical transition care 2 weeks ago. 
I‚Äôm cleared to start testosterone this coming Monday and I am so incredibly happy! I also have too surgery consult scheduled for the end of Summer. 
I feel incredibly lucky that I have such easy access to gender confirming care. I feel like I don‚Äôt deserve for it to be this easy, or maybe I just wasn‚Äôt ready for it to be easy. I expected to wait years before I could start any hormones or get a surgery consult. 
But I feel like since I haven‚Äôt been waiting for as long as others I don‚Äôt deserve to start hormones or get surgery in a way. 
Like I‚Äôm going to do it bc that‚Äôs what I want but. It feels unfair. Maybe it‚Äôs just being so sad that it‚Äôs not like this everywhere. 

This is by no means meant to rub anything in anyone‚Äôs face or ask for pity. Just wanting to share my feelings, see if anyone else has also felt this way."	"I think it's great! It's exactly what the community is fighting for, and you just happen to enjoy it earlier than most. It means that you have more well adjusted, compassionate people making some good decisions around you. You aren't taking away anything from anyone else, and your happiness will only be a net positive to us all. You don't have to feel an a single milliliter of guilt. Consider replacing that with pride. I know I'm proud of you for going after your ideal identity like this. One day, we'll bring more of this to the world.
Don't feel guilty, feel grateful. The kind of care you're experiencing is what trans activitists have been fighting for. Care should be easy to access, low cost, comprehensive, and compassionate. It's a matter of celebration that, in this case, it is!
Maybe this is an internal feeling of not yet being ready for such a huge biological change. Maybe your subconcious is telling you to slow down. It's only been a few weeks. Make sure this is actually what you want in life.
Thank you ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è
I‚Äôve been wanting a different body for 20 years. I‚Äôm sure this is what I want because it makes me happy thinking about the changes that are to come."	y7z5ql	trans	15	1.0	2022-10-19 10:33:59
I‚Äôm too scared to be my authentic self, and I‚Äôm miserable.	"I‚Äôm 22, born, raised and currently live/identify as female. I‚Äôve never felt 100% female. All through my childhood I was a massive tomboy, I dressed in boys clothes and I wished I was a boy. I grew self conscious in high school once puberty hit and I stopped being a tomboy and acted more girly, wore makeup, cared about my hair and nails etc., because I wanted to fit in more than anything. I‚Äôve backed away from that now as the self consciousness and pressure of teenager-hood has subsided. 

As I‚Äôve discovered more and more about the trans community, I‚Äôm starting to thing that this fits me more. But I‚Äôm also conflicted. Maybe I have a level of gender dysphoria; maybe I hate my body because I am overweight and not inherently feminine and pretty; maybe I think that being a male will solve my problems? I don‚Äôt feel comfortable being either gender if I‚Äôm honest; not comfortable being female because I‚Äôm really not feminine and I hate my female body; not comfortable being male because it is painstakingly obviously I am female. I‚Äôm too self conscious to dress in male clothing. I‚Äôm too self conscious to even think about transitioning because I don‚Äôt want to have to deal with the explanations and questions that my family, friends and colleagues will want answered. So, I‚Äôm stuck. I keep thinking if I exercise and eat right and lose weight, maybe I will start to love myself and my body for what it is? But then I find myself looking at men and admiring their features in an almost jealous way and, in a sense, wishing I was one of them. I‚Äôm worried that no matter what choice I make, it will be the wrong one and I‚Äôll regret it. I‚Äôm also worried that I won‚Äôt have the support of my family, or that they will laugh at me, or that they will think it‚Äôs a phase. 

Any advice?"	"that's a difficult situation you're in and i hope you will find a way to feel comfortable. for me it was realising that i don't have to be either male or female. i'd say take your time & explore yourself, try to find a supportive close friend & remember that your feelings are valid
Being honest I identify with quite a few things in this ... at least I am not the only one

Unfortunately I do not know what to advise you, but I am happy that I am not the only one and that you understand me in some way
Hey i literally feel the exact same way, can I message you?
That‚Äôs a really good point, maybe I identify with both genders in a sense, but lean more towards being masculine? Idk yet. I‚Äôm doing a lot of exploring and I am very lucky to have a lot of supportive friends who have sent me resources ü•∞‚ù§Ô∏è
It‚Äôs a hard place to be in because everything is so conflicting. I think I‚Äôm going to look at some sort of therapy so I can talk to a professional and see where they can point me. Good luck on your journey too ‚ù§Ô∏è

My boyfriend came out as transgender - love knows no gender	"Hello everyone! Normally I wouldn't do this, but i need support and advise and I have the feeling that I can get this here. I need to be mentally stable to support my better half as good as I can, because it's time for me to be supportive.
 
Just recently, my boyfriend has come out as transgender. The last year has been a mess.. He was constantly angry with me and had mood flashs all the time with no proper explanation. He wasn't treating me nicely and I was always kind with him and did everything for him. I thought, that I was constantly annoying him and doing everything wrong. I spent hours crying and eating, not showing him my true emotions. This may sound naive, but I always subconsciously knew, that there was something else bugging him. Hence, I accepted his behavior.

I am very much in love with him and one day I would like to have a family with him. The first words I told him were: I am proud of you. I truly was! There was so much pressure off me. From this day on, there were no more fights and we were talking endlessly and there was a much closer bound between the two of us. It also turned out as something exciting and beautiful for me to discover his female side together with him. Today, I organised his first consultation meeting with a doctor for him, because he was afraid about the phone call. The only thing that is taking over me is: FEAR. I have no problem with him transitioning to a woman, (it may sounds stupid but I listened to my heart) but i have concerns:

How did you guys tell everyone about your transition? Is it true, that you can lose your sex drive? I am very concerned about this :( It makes a lot of sense to me, since the testosteron is diminishing. What about becoming parents one day? Is it true, that after a while you will be infertile? What about testicular atrophy? To which extent will his penis shrink? Artificial insemination seems so unnatural to me. I have always dreamed about being a mom, conceiving naturally. However, what in life really does occur in the way you imagined it?

I would appreciate your stories that would show me, that there is no need to be afraid. I never cared what people thought about me, as long as I was happy. Being in a relationship with a woman is something that I can imagine, since I am sexually attracted to them, but never had a relationship with one.

So dearest reddit community, please help me. I really appreciate it!
"	"Another subreddit to look at is /r/mypartneristrans

And there may not clear answers to all your questions, because it can depend on your partner and their family.

As for coming out, we all deal with it differently. I told my close friends and then my brother, and then worked on the rest of the family.

As for sex drive, generally the sex drive diminishes, that can vary. I will say that finding the proper dose of testosterone blocker may be key. I suggest that before taking hormones, sperm be frozen just in case. Generally after HRT, there's at least a 6 month period off hormones until checking the sperm count. 

Testicle and penis shrinking is not drastic, but can add up over time. Having traditional intercourse may just become more difficult, some need Viagra or similar to stay functional.
Definitely get some sperm frozen if she wants to have children in the future, and for sex has she considered buying a hollow strap-on? In my case I had a lot of anxiety and dysphoria that made sex with my penis somewhat distressing, and eventually it became physically painful to use. The strap is my favourite thing when it comes to penetrative sex. 

The sex drive itself, maybe. Mine changed so much as diminished, on testosterone it was like a pressing need that would grow quickly over time until I *had* to have sex, now it's much more subtle. If someone initiates sex with me it's easy for me to get in the mood, but I am not generally horny unless there's a reason to be. This may mean she'll be more reluctant to initiate sex in the future but if she's like me she won't mind if it's happening. 
It would be a great idea for one to stop referring to her as a man also, ask her about that in person too.
Thank you very much! This does help a lot!
Thank you very much for your support! I have heard about some cases now in which the sex only gets a problem, if anxiety or dislike for the genitalia is prevalent. He hates his appearance and wished he was born woman, but has no problem with his genitalia. However, if it should be the case, a strap on could definitely of help. He never was that much of a ""typical"" man with a pressing need for sex, now that he has revealed his true self, his sex drive has changed completely. 
Of course, one of the first things I asked was whether I should refer to him as her now or not but for now he wants to be referred to with him. It's only me who knows about it so far. But THANKS for your advise :) This is an important point as well for me to consider!
I was thinking the same thing about pronouns. Seriously made me cringe.

It's so nice to see an SO actually stick by their partner. :)

Just a heads up, people may start asking you if you're a lesbian now (be prepared to answer that however you need to).  They are also going to ask how you two have sex. (Prepare a response for this, one you are both comfortable with).

My girlfriend and I just tell people ""We have sex like lesbians do."" Also, penis in Vagina  (PiV) isn't the only kind of sex one can have. :P 
I have showed my partner the comments by now and  she asked me to go by him but i will go with her for now.

People ask you how the two of you have sex? It is shocking how curious and inappropriate people are  üòè just none of their business, as long as they are not close friends. 

You are right, of course one has to consider all options  üòÅ

I am doing my utmost, on Monday is her birthday and I organised a surprise party with her friends yesterday. Ten of them showed up and we had loads of fun. I wanted to let her know, how much she is loved by everyone for exactly what she is and she was overwhelmed with joy.

Thank you for sharing your experiences :) 
Yeah, lol, it's kinda funny sometimes.

The only question that really bothers me, though, is being asked if I'm going to date guys now. Ummm... no. Lol

Btw, if you two need anyone to talk to, feel free to DM me. :)

Also, as a reference for what HRT can do: [before and after 5 months](http://i.imgur.com/i2WRmhO.jpg), and [6-7 months :)](http://i.imgur.com/sKewZ94.jpg)"	6alvu1	trans	14	0.81	2017-05-11 18:09:30
Do muslim trans people exist??	this is sort of a vent and a cry for help at the same time. I'm a 16 year old trans guy with turkish background, raised in a muslim family, living in Germany. life's very emotionally draining. i have so much internalized transphobia. i really just wanna know that people like me, muslim trans people in unsupportive families exist. i feel so damn lonely. its like god made a mistake with me. i never see other turkish and muslim trans guys anywhere. i hope people like me exist.. i really just wanna hear that other muslim people were able to transition. i feel like I'll never be able to transition and it really sucks. at the same time i try not to care too much and adapt to being a girl in order to not disappoint my parents and in order not to go to hell.. my mom already expects me to wear the hijab. i mean the hijab is BEAUTIFUL but its just not what i want. im a man. this whole situation has resulted in me questioning my faith and wishing i was born in a typical german atheist family :(( i really wish i was never born. basically im a whole mentally unstable mess and i just wanna know if people like me exist. i really don't know how to feel anymore. part of me still hopes I'll end up living as a woman, cause that's the safest option for me.. but the thought of that makes me quite unhappy. ugh.. so yea, are there any other muslim trans people or other trans people who struggle with religion, who could share their stories to give me some hope??

I‚Äôm non-binary, Muslim, and I‚Äôm not heterosexual. Not all of us are the typical Muslim lol
Hi there I‚Äôm an Iranian trans guy. In My country ‚Äúislamic republic of iran‚Äù , our leader allows trans people to have surgery but it‚Äôs weird country:D Here is complete thing to understand better . https://www.dw.com/en/iran-how-transgender-people-survive-ultraconservative-rule/a-57480850

 also i know a Turkish trans guy ‚Äúruzgar erkoclar‚Äù and there are too many others And it‚Äôs ok for muslims to have surgery. Hope it helps;)
Also you can message me if there is anything you want to know.

P.s: I‚Äôv visited your country , love thereüëçüèº
thanks a lot for your reply!! its nice knowing there are other people in somewhat similiar situations out there :]
Yeah we are too many and our way to transition could be harder than others:( but there were so many that completed this road and achieved their goals so we can do it too why not! 
I always think about the worst aspect of the things i.e it could be end up by losing our family? I hope that doesn‚Äôt happen but if it happens I‚Äôm not gonna be that much sad cause i prefer someone that loves me and believes me , not the ones I‚Äôm weirdo to them. 
My opinions :
I‚Äôm 18 and an over thinker guy who always wants to know the reason of what is going on in our shitty life . I don‚Äôt want to be in this world like a sheep , just eating and sleeping and dies in somewhere corner of this world. I believe that there is a lot more in this world that I don‚Äôt know or understand. But these are my thoughts of this period of my life ,not a person from last year or 3 years ago . Sadly since childhood i had somehow depression but about 14 to 17 it became worse cause i was teenager, there was too pressure from my family and school, my girlfriend (the person i rely on too much those days) left me, the transphobic psychologist said I‚Äôm not trans and if i was trans i should change my mind and see myself as a girl and these shit transphobic things... after that my mother thought that i was lying that I‚Äôm trans... 
I know I‚Äôm not the only one who has these problems everyone has their own problems the thing i want to say is it‚Äôs gonna be all fine dude . Now I‚Äôm here with some how none of those problems my only goal for now is studying and after that making money for my surgery. As an older brother i want to suggest you that don‚Äôt be the young me. Don‚Äôt double the pressure on yourself with asking yourself why I‚Äôm in this world? Why god creates me like this? Why I‚Äôm not cis like others? Why me ! ? For all of these questions i got myself answered as : we all came to this world for something, we are all equal beautiful creatures and if we are different we aren‚Äôt unnatural or weird ! We are just different because we are humans ! We are are valid . The people who can‚Äôt count us as a valid human , they are just unable to approve peoples differences even the basics ones! like nationality, skin color, religion so we can‚Äôt expect that they understands our differences! And always know that being trans is just a little tiny part of us ! We have so much to say to others. Don‚Äôt give up on yourself for being trans i know you have more to defines you . These were some of my thoughts I ,hope it makes you or others to see this aspect of being trans in this world :) 

P.s: also I apologize if there is any mistake ,as English is not my first language ,I tried hard to making it understandable:)
omg thank you so much for this dude!! Hearing this really makes me feel nice. im really sorry for all the transphobic shit you had to go through tho :( im not out to anyone yet,, well my friends know a tiny bit but i could never come out ever. my parents would probably try to beat me up or disown me. its just so scary. hopefully one day I'll be able to talk to someone about these things.
i really hope your journey will go well also!! i appreciate this so much, thanks again :]
I‚Äôm happy that you feel a little better now üíô and yeah i was so scared of telling my family specially men like my father , grandfathers and uncle i think they‚Äôre going yo laugh at me in their heads :( . But i came out to my mom officially( she finds out herself) 6 months ago but i told her everything and my really true feelings with messages cause I couldn‚Äôt tell her eye to eye idk why it was like shy or shame or i was so nervous what is she going to think about me or maybe I would end up by crying so i texted her and It was much more better . after that we talked a little eye to eye it wasn‚Äôt that bad as I thought, i cried a little but i told her what was on my mind truthfully . I hope someday I could reach that point to be brave and confident talking about myself to my father and relatives. I hope it for you too:D but I believe that we can reach that point as the time passes and after that we would say it wasn‚Äôt as bad as we imagined ;D
true!! im glad it went okay with ur mom :] and yea the fear is very big, i can totally relate. hopefully you'll be able to do that! but if you know its not safe, if you know they might try to hurt you, please be very careful, okay? i really don't want u to get into a bad situation because of this. i might never come out to anyone cause idk, i don't think its safe. my parents all the time tell me that i should behave more like a girl and they ask me ""you know god has created you a girl, right?"". and I haven't yet come out to them or anything. but yea we got this! we'll figure everything out eventually :]"	r8tb02	trans	14	0.95	2021-12-04 16:32:24

And you're not stuck. There are options. They may not be ideal, but they exist. I... typed out a bit of my own story, but you really don't want to do what I did. It's not a happy story and doesn't have a happy ending. There are resources out there, though, even for us.
I would get out as soon as possible, find a friend that will help.
Me and my brother got a 30 pack of beers and were shooting the shit together, it's making me feel a lot better. I know I have someone in my corner, so im better off than a lot of people. I guess in the moment  I was extremely overwhelmed and sad. Im still sad, but I think I can deal with it. What's crazy to me is how progressive my mom claims to be while acting like this. She literally has painted progressive pride flags as decoration for the house, but I'm starting to see that's all they are, decoration.
I don't really have any friends. In general that doesn't make me sad or anything, I think having no friends is ok as long as you enjoy your own company and have personal hobbies to indulge in. In this situation though, I really wish I knew someone in real life who I could see. My closest friend lives in New Hampshire and I'm in Alabama, I can't really see them at short notice. I'm probably going to throw myself hard into my art tomorrow and try and work through my feelings that way. All I can say is that I'm glad I love myself. For the first time in my life, I don't hate the idea of being by myself with my own thoughts. If my mother and grandmother could just understand how content and at peace with myself I am now, they might be able not only accept me as being trans, but also actually enjoy being around me. I've been a pretty difficult child to deal with because of all the struggles I've gone through because of my body issues and dysphoria, but in these last few months since I've started socially and medically transitioning have literally been the only time in my life where I have felt actual joy and known what it felt like to be happy to be alive.
I'm trying. I'm 26, old enough and strong enough to be on my own, but I am overburdened with medical and school debt. I have 2 degrees, but I am a brittle type 1 diabetic. My diabetes is at a really good place right now with my current management strategy (also, coming out as trans really helped my depression, which in turn helped manage my diabetes better) but I have almost 200k in medical debt on top of about 60kbin school debt. I have to rely on my mother to help me buy insulin because I'm working as a freelancer right now and only making about 500 bucks a month with art commissions.
From your original post, I get the sense that they don't care if you're happy or not. Well, I'm sure they do, as long as you're happy the way they want.

I don't want to be a Debbie Downer, and I don't know your family. I'm 34 myself and just came to terms with the idea that family is what you make it. Mine (father, mother, sister) treated me terribly as a child and as a young adult, to the point that I left home at 17 with nothing. The worst thing, honestly, is they've only started to accept me in the last couple of years, and they think that erases everything that happened. Literally, my father (who I live with now) has said to me, ""You gotta forget all that stuff back then. We accept you NOW so it's okay, right?"" And for a long time I convinced myself he was right. Until I realized he wasn't. Its a step, yes, and I'm grateful for it, but it does not erase everything that happened. The only one who has ever apologized for any of it is my sister."	r1k9zd	trans	11	0.84	2021-11-25 01:15:11
I am beginning the process of getting HRT tomorrow, and I am terrified to my core. Here's my vent.	"To preface: I am 24, AMAB, and live with my family. My parents are good natured but have radical right-wing beliefs about pretty much everything.
I plan to have been on HRT for awhile before coming out, but I'm getting a head start on what I would like to say to them. Maybe some of you will relate with my experience, let me know if you do.

The day before tonight was... anxious. I began writing my coming out letter. At first there was passion, and excitement to finally be putting everything I've been working through into a succinct page meant for the one audience that I once hoped never to have to tell.
When I put it aside for the morning, I kept it on my mind through the day. What sort of things I might want to say, how I could present this part of me in a way that makes it easiest for them to understand. What excitement there was turned to anxiety, then to fear, then to doubts.

I pushed myself through an important lesson that I needed to learn. That not all doubts need to be considered. There are rational doubts, ones that come up in light of new information, when it's time for you to rethink what you've been believing. In fact these kinds of doubts may often look like a sudden realization, as your mind processes the points that run for or against a thought. Then there are the doubts that come as a reaction to fear, opposition and anxiety. They appear without any argument to be made, trying to shake up your whole world to make the current path seem unreasonable, so you don't confront the perceived danger. Doubts like this will say, ""Do I really want this? Is this really the way I should go? Have I properly thought this through?"" These questions don't arise in search of real answers. They are rhetorical in nature, a defensive reaction to fear disguised as rationality. In truth, I do want this. This is the best way to go. I have properly thought this through. I've made all the calculations based on my best understanding of myself and the processes involved. But in these terrifying moments where a change like this seems like it could turn my world upside down in every conceivable way, my mind doesn't recognize the weeks, months or years that I've spent contemplating this. It only sees the fear, anxiety, all the things that could possibly go wrong, how my life as I know it could end.
This lesson taught me to discern a rational doubt from a reflexive one.

The rest of the day I felt off. I felt wrong, like maybe this a bad way to do it. It doesn't feel right to say, ""Mom, dad, I'm going to become a woman."" How can I explain the idea of gender fluidity to people who think gender = sex and there are only two? It would be easier to just tell them I'm transitioning into a female, and leave the more ""advanced"" gender fluid part out of it. But then I'm still lying, hiding a bit of myself from them just for convenience. Chances are they reject everything about what being transgender means and recoil into their own misinterpretation of everything I tell them, so I may as well put everything out as accurately as I should.

I'm still ready to transition regardless of how this draft feels to write. I know this because of what I see in the mirror. Looking back into my reflection I see the ideal self that hides behind my eyes, and in the shapes of my face. I see the femininity in my expression looking back at me. The potential is there, and only after being this ready and set upon this goal, can I see the hope in my eyes for this thing that I've been so desperate for. I can imagine that face after months of hormones, with that same hope and joy and pride shining through with the subtle differences. I can see her.

Or them, or whoever I end up being. Truth is, I don't know what identity it should be called in the coming out letter. In reality all the gender does is give an explanation of myself to others in a way they can relate to. I don't need to call myself a woman or a man. I don't need to make sure others see me as a female, just as I don't care if people find me attractive. What matters is that I have the body that I am comfortable to live with, and that I can express myself in a way that lets me find myself attractive, regardless of others' opinion. If this means they see my bald head and see a man, okay. If this means they see my breasts and see a woman, okay. If this means they see everything put together and see a weird, unfashionable mix of a Mx, okay.

The point is that I can see that person and the hope in her eyes when she sees just how ready she is to stop worrying about what her life is like when her secret is exposed to her family. The point is that I feel my life open up to everything else I've been wanting to do when I think of finally being on hormone treatment.

On Monday I'm going to call my doctor to make an appointment, then jump through all the hoops they need for me to get this done.

I'll never be sure of the future, because the future is never a sure thing. Yes, so many things could go wrong. I could, and most likely will be rejected to varying degrees by my loved ones. I could somehow lose eligiblity for hormones and not get be able to continue. Maybe I'm outright denied the care I seek.
But so many things could go right. My brain will finally begin to match my body. Being out will mean I don't have to pretend to be who everyone thinks I am. I can finally begin experimenting with all the social aspects I've been curious about. I know exactly who I am. The person I am is not a man, and certainly not in the way everyone expects me to be. I know most of the little bits that form the mosaic of my identity. In that big picture, there is a sure disconnect between me and my sex. I desire a feminine body more than anything; all goals and ideals of success ultimately lead back around to wanting a safe, welcoming, graceful transition into a body that I can live with. Does that mean I feel comfortable calling myself a woman? A female? I'm not certain that's the label, or gender that I want. I don't really want the gender known as ""woman"" any more than ""man."" I just want to cure the dysphoria in my body that makes me wake up every day feeling uncomfortable with the sex characteristics I was born with. I don't know exactly who I'll become, but I'm ready and excited to find out as I begin this journey away from who I've been dishonestly trying to be."	"I also live with my family and am seeking hormones, having only reached out to a doctor recently. My family tends to be more center left, but since they made their money theyve started buying into some culture war bullshit, so i suppose its important for me to be here. They believe jk rowling did nothing wrong; not that she wasnt transphobic, that she didnt do it (big potterheads, working on it).

I understand the fear, and especially the doubt. Not all doubt is reasonable, not all doubt is honest, not all doubt has your best interest in mind. Listen to it still, but recognize the difference between real and fake doubt. Even the fake doubt can give you insight to how youre feeling though. Insight to your fear that you may have otherwise lacked had you simply not listened at all.

Its like a part of our minds has been colonized to participate in our own eradication. Cishet society finds us inconvenient and makes it as difficult to exist as possible, and the weight of overcoming that and existing honestly is something we carry forever. To quote my favorite show, ‚Äúyoure gonna carry that weight.‚Äù The choice to live with it and learn from it instead of collapse and let it crush you is a victory in and of itself. It is nothing to be scoffed at, and represents our resilience in the face of overwhelming odds

I know for a fact youll do great, regardless of them. From your words i can tell youre bright and brave and strong, more so than myself in many ways. I hope to be as strong as you in coming months and years <3
Maybe you just need leave parent house and  living alone with pretty girl?
Thank you for the kind words, friend.

""It's like a part of our minds has been colonized to participate in our own eradication."" Strikes me in just the right way. In some way these feelings seem like reality is pulling itself apart, trying to figure out what's internal and external. I am so sure of what I want and why, right up until it comes to making the steps to obtain it. It has me questioning if I'm even trans; if I feel strongly enough about it to want to make this change. The closer I come to having what I want - what I need - the more my mind resists taking it. When I break these feelings down, I know that a bodily transition is all that I really want, the social stuff and presentation stuff could be left alone completely for all I care. But all that stuff tends to come naturally with the new body, because of the gender society has created around it. It's this that I'm going to have the hardest time adjusting to, and where I'll meet the most resistance and insecurity.

What's getting me through is that this is only one step, and none of these changes are instant. More things will become knowable when I begin, and my feelings will change as I learn. Cowboy bebop is amazing.

I don't feel brave, or strong, or bright. I suppose no one does in these situations, though. Thank you for the encouragement nevertheless, and I wish you the same success and courage as well.

How to I explain to my parents that how I am referred to matters?	"About 4 days ago I (MTF, 21) came out to my dad as trans to an overall much better response than I had expected. He says ""What choices you make in your life are up to you but you'll always be my **son**"" 

He has gone on to constantly refer to me as his son, and introduce me to people as such, as well as say things like ""one day you'll have a wife"" or ""when you're a father"" or call my brother and I ""the boys"" or ""sons"" etc. Everything is still very gendered language. My mom has the other problem which is using ambiguously gendered language like ""when you're a parent"" or saying ""my child/kid"" instead of daughter. TBH this is honestly preferable to what my dad says, but I would still much prefer being called their daughter, and all the terminology that goes along with that. 

Both of them are coming from a fundamentally good place; they both still love me and want me to have a good life, and say they won't do anything to stand in the way of my transition or future choice in life partner (whatever gender they may be). I know that they still care but I would feel so much more respected if they would use proper pronouns and such. My mother has been much more responsive to my requests and insisted that she would be happy to change once I had told my dad (they are separated and I told her months ago). I haven't been back to see her since telling my dad so we'll see what happens there. My main concern is my dad, who today hit me with everybody's favorite one ""I just don't think you'll ever make a very convincing woman""

When dealing with one of these Trump loving belives-everything-they-read-on-Facebook boomer parents what are you even supposed to say to get them to understand?? Another note that may be of interest in my situation is that I have not yet changed my wardrobe, as I started my transition around 340 lbs and have since lost nearly 50 lbs, well on track with my diet and exercise (as well as decreased need for comfort/stress eating since coming out) to completely reinvent myself. I'm just a cheapskate who is willing to boymode for a few more months before buying new clothes. Maybe they'll just start referring to me as female when I start looking the part a bit more? Idk. I'm starting to look a bit more androgynous overall but apparently its not enough yet. 

Any help or advice is appreciated, or just feel free to share how you navigated some sort of similar situation!"	"I think he should be educated on how harmful it is to say things like that. I know his response was relatively good but what's supportive about not getting in your way while also not respecting your wishes? It's less support and more so he just won't be obstructing your path. He says he loves you but he's not showing it as he should. 

If it's hard to talk about I suggest writing him a text or a letter explaining how these things make you feel, be gentle because it does sound like he's coming from a good place just uneducated on these things. Sometimes people don't consider all the ways their words can be interpreted and internalized. 

Tell him your name and pronouns, let him know you are his daughter. Let him know how harmful it can be to you and other trans people to not have gender affirmation. Try and be pretty detailed so you can really express how important these things are. 

I hope things get easier! Congrats on the weight lossüíï keep going girl üòä
No offense intended here but it's a generational thing IMO. My parent's generation were getting upset about the way their parents referred to people as well. Their parents didn't change those words. I was upset by my parent's use of certain words as well. I never did get them to use other words, they would just get weird when I would point it out. Your parents are probably about the same. It's ingrained in their minds to refer to someone a certain way, I don't think they do it intentionally to hurt anyone. Just be honest about how it makes you feel and ask that they use those words. It doesn't mean that they will, it also doesn't make them bad or mean if they won't, either they will or they won't and you'll have to decide if it's good enough for you or not. Good luck
I was in a similar situation with my parents. I‚Äôm about 20 years older.  I told my parents if they could not respect me and refer to me with the proper name and pronouns. If they could not recognize me as their daughter.  I would cut off communication until such time as they could.  Well for me the escalated and basically have written them out of my life. It hurt but I‚Äôm happier.    The point is stand up for yourself. It is not your job to make them feel better or comfortable. They are your parents and should love and respect you unconditionally.  I‚Äôm a parent myself and have and would put my own feelings aside/ deal with them for the benefit of my children.
All you can do is give it time and remember to explain everything you can to them, tell them how you feel, what upsets you. Most importantly be the person you want to be ‚ù§Ô∏è
The biggest thing you need to evaluate is just how much your dad hurts you. In my experience It's not likely if it's even possible to change the mind of someone like that through your own efforts. It very well may be that he will not stop misgendering you even once you pass better. I would suggest giving him exactly 1 chance to get it right and make it very clear to him that if his behaviour doesn't change he could lose you from his life. Make it clear just how much it hurts you. 

When people maliciously misgender you it's really tough to turn them around and may be best to cut that negativity from your life. Transition is hard enough as it is.

I hope this helps a little
Uh tbh this one ain't it chief. In my situation having my dad no longer in my life is way worse for me than it is for him. And even so, the whole 1 chance thing comes off like you're giving them very little leeway to actually learn and get accustomed rather than being under threat.
I guess I'll never know lol
You do you girl! I can only speak from my own experience and 10, 20, 100 chances has not proven enough when they are purposefully misgendering with malice.
Just be who you are, the right people will love you for it, and the wrong ones don't really matter.

Im a bit scared going to a new school because Im not medically fully transitioned...	I live in the U.S, and things arn't terrible.....yet.......but they're trying to bad gender-affirming surgery and medical care for transgender youth hear. I want to transition so bad, but not only will my family not accept me but I won't be able to because our world is trying to take away basic human rights from us.
