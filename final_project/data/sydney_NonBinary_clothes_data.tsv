I let my grandma dress me in her clothes as her idea of “a proper young lady” and u know what....I’m not mad.		"i had a flannel & leggings on prior...but I feel like she somehow made me look even gayer idk
[deleted]
you look groovy as hell
those pants are rockin and I love your hair!
Wow. How many unicorns did it take to make those leggings? 😁
Fuuuuuuuck, your grandma knows fashion.
That’s awesome haha
Definitely a gay look, love it
Now I wanna see how your grandma dresses 😂
Your grandma is queer AF. Please ask her where those pants came from.
Your hair is EPIC I love it
I -
You look so cool!! Those pants are trippy
I love those pants!
Despite her best efforts, you look gay
Grannycore!
👀 Where are those pants from? I love this look
You look similar to the girl from that netflix show ‘end of the fucking world’ ! Love your look and hair!
So, grandmas are enby fashion icons? nice.
Honestly? Maybe let grandma dress you more often, she killed it.
Ya look amazing... Uh... Monarch? (Can you tell I dont have many NB friends?)
Paisley is not binary...I can write a 33 page thesis on this...  


...I won't...but I could do it
how u look even gayer tho

is""proper young lady"" slang for ""intensely pretty enby?""
This is an incredibly non-binary outfit tbh
Seriously, post this fantabolous look on r/redditgetsdrawn 

People are going to love it over there
Those pants are epic.
would wear tbh
Very 70s chic. Looks amazing!
I'd absolutely wear those pants
The trousers are A Look! And I love the colour on your hair, it’s so pretty!
You look great dude!
That's a fucking LOOK
swanky
It´s that 1960´s style that looks so great - leisure, colorful, a little crazy and yet chicque - maybe you should incorporate it in your closet - as without the hippies Idea of free love none of our modern ideas of sexuality could have ever come to bloom. :D xoxo!
Your grandma obviously has some swag, those trousers are a whole party on their own! Love it!
It’s like a colourful audrey hepburn look. Chic cuts, fun colours. I like how the pattern of the pants has the colour of the top in it.
Straight from the 70s
Wow 😍
She got TASTE
The outfit looks cute on you
I'm in love with your grandma...!
This is an absolute LOOK. I feel like you should be playing bingo with a bunch of elderly ladies all like ""Goddamn it Ruth they said B SEVEN, TURN UP YOUR HEARING AID!"" and ""Madge, what are you doing? No, uh uh, I see you trying to cheat! You made a deal, I won so you have to give me your coffee cake recipe. Pay up!""
Your grandma is kinda awesome.
Yaaassss work it!
That's amazing 😍
That's unironically a really rad outfit and no joke I would wear those pants/leggings whatever they are.
That's some great color coordination from your grandma. You look nice!
I love those pants! TJ Maxx lookout lol.
I think I’m team grandma..
Omg this is working so hard it’s giving me bangs inspiration
I beg your pardon. Thanks for your response. Either way, I like you. Sincerely, Tommy
Funky and hip are my thoughts when I saw your beautiful outfit. Did you keep the clothes? You look really pretty.
I'm a goth and even I'm jealous
I want to raid your grandma's closet!
If you don't mind me asking, are you out to her?
Run lola run?
Dig it
You're grandma has great fashion sense. I love the paisley pants. You are a beautiful girl.
You look amazing in anything
You should invite your grandma to post with you!
Need these pants!
Definitely snazed up!
She made you look like that elderly totally gay lady who lives in a little house at the forest with her ""special friend"" named Becky.
Together with Becky she makes very delicious cakes and smokes a ton of weed while offering goods to the forest spirits.

But in young!

Man I hope I will be like that when I'm old.
Wait, I would wear thos.... oh.
they be giving me art teacher vibes
what about a gay art teacher grandma ?
hehe thank u
Thank you!!!
Idk, all the paisley patterns remind me of bandanas and cattle. Is there a unicow?
Looks only!
Those pants are killer!
She got them in the 80’s 😭
Hehe thank u
They love u!
At least mine is!
Fr!!!
My friend or captain works
She’s the coolest
I am not, I figured she wouldn’t understand. She is very loving and accepting as a person & respects me being bisexual! But I think gender nonconforming identities might blow her 80 yr old brain :,)
Not a girl
Same. I would totally rock those.

1st time trying clothes on after top surgery 💕		"posts that make me want top surgery:
i dunno if this is the right adjective to use here, but very pretty !! (bc everyone can be described as pretty, y'know?)
You are radiant ❤️
You look so amazing! I’m inspired to wear tighter/ more revealing tops after (hopefully) top surgery because then I won’t be drowned by top dysphoria.
This bangs so mf’n hard my human, I am grateful for your existence
You look so mf cool, dude, I’m nearly jealous. I love clothes with bright, obnoxious patterns, especially when you mix it in with emo vibes, no better combo. Those cowboys are simply iconic. And congrats on the surgery! You’re lookin fly (:
Me having gender envy right now you look amazing and so happy I love it
You look great and all but please don't freeze that looks very cold
♥️♥️♥️
This photo seems like a collection of what would normally be thought of as opposites in perfect harmony; the colorful full skirt paired with the black mesh top, the summery clothing in the snow and of course your unbelievably beautiful androgynous features, OP. This whole scene is nonbinary perfection 💕💕
Oh my god transition goals right there
This is exactly the feeling of pure happiness I’m looking forward to after I get top surgery (whenever that is)
Perfect.
Wow you look so luminous and incredible. Very inspiring!!!
what an outfit!! i’m so inspired and in awe!!!!
What a glamorous free spirit look!
I love the blue hair!
ok WHERE did you get that bodice thing?
Absolutely gorgeous 😍
This is fr such a beautiful picture
Yay! Congrats, you look great ☺️
Gorgeous!!
You look great! I love this outfit
i want to do top surgery/chest binding but i'm very scared to do so because it seems painful and sometimes i like my breasts. i feel like that sounds super silly 

btw: congrats! you seem very happy in this picture. <3
You look absolutely stunning!!! I'm loving the fit
That top is KILLER!!! I love it and the skirt so bad 😩💙✨
Fkn beautiful
You look great! And you look happy! And being happy is important. 💛🤍💜🖤
Everything about this photo is amazing. Your vibrant hair colour, your beautiful (and perfect to twirl) skirt, your top that I NEED btw, and your tattoos!!! 

Specifically that top/skirt combo looks so good on you. I love the contrast in patterns. You look quite stunning. :)
OH MY GOD YOU ARE SO PERFECT I WANT TO BE YOU
Aaaaahh!! I love this so much!! Everything about this from the confidence, to the outfit to the flat chest. If I could like this post a million times I would.
You are so beautiful! 😭
I must know where you got that top from.. And the skirt... The whole outfit looks fantastic, really
Yesssssss love to see it
You look amazing💛
So happy for you
Omg I love this so much
Elegant. Wistful. Swank.
So many adjectives I can't think of.

Love it ☺️
omGGGGGGG
you look so powerful, im happy for you! c:
Oh my gosh you look euphoric, I'm so happy for you!! ♡♡♡
I loooove your skirt and t-shirt!! you look just 1000% awesome!!
Absolutely stunning! Thank you so much for sharing this moment with us.
YOUR EARRING IS A CHAIN LINK

Plus everything else!!! 

I love it😍
blown away wow
And this is exactly why I want top surgery! To wear whatever I want without feeling that dysphoria. Congrats dude!! You look fantastic!
You look absolutely breathtaking!
Looking great!! ✨✨ absolutely magical!
You look stunning!! I love everything about this style - the mesh, the bold colors, the blue hair. And that shirt is just gorgeous
I love seeing other nonbinary afab people that get too surgery and dress femme (to any extent) after! I have still not decided if I will get surgery but this is the kinda shit I would love to wear if I did!
i want a reduction 🥺🥺
Oh man, you don't know how much I needed to see this. I even created an account just to post. I'm getting top surgery in April and my parents are convinced it will not be to my expectations. I want to show them this...that I can switch to fem without a chest. You look amazing.
I want top surgery so bad, you look so good
is that snow?? excuse me mx. but how are you not freezing???
Wow
damn. your making me want top surgery.
Wow that looks amazing on you!
This reminds me I love my body too, and I don't miss the biddies. And I still look stunning, even more so now!
Wow I kinda forgot I posted this, so logging on and seeing this was surprising!! Thank you for your love, my Instagram is @prettyboydyke666 if you wanna see more about my top surgery journey. 

If you considering getting top surgery, DOOO ITTTTT. I promise there's a way. Its so worth it. ❤
You haven’t worn clothes since you got top surgery?

I’m sorry the joke was right there
Where is the top/body suite and skirt from?? I wanna buy them
You look stunning 💛🤍💜🖤
Right?! Or at least downsized. I hate boobs
I’m AMAB and hated actually being flat-chested but this post almost makes *me* want top surgery.
Thank you so much!!Femme/masc compliments welcome 💘
I'm so excited for you!! I am amazed about how much better I feel, thank you 💜
Seconded, pleaaaase it's AMAZING
My partner found it at this store called ragstock!! There's a few around the US if I remember right. Theres no tag sadly 😭
Thank you!!❤
Its not silly, it is uncomfortable BUT it wasn't unbearable for me to wear a binder. I wore it  everyday and never left the house without it.  I had a gc2b one, it was a good in-between before I was able to be honest about myself about wanting top surgery so I suggest looking into it if you're able :)
Best of luck on that journey my friend, don't give up 💜 thank you so much!!
I've lived in Wisconsin my whole life, felt good to stand in the crisp air for a moment 💙
i’m actually considering getting a breast reduction - i’m gender fluid and if i had smaller boobs i could dress them up or down depending on how i feel. also my family would probably be against the idea of top surgery but if it was just a reduction they might not mind so much
I love that for you!! I'm really happy for you as well. I would just freeze my ass off lmao
You and me both. I’m currently in the “am I NB or am I faking this shit” 🙃 but I really hate my boobs and want them down to a A cup or nothing at all. It sucks here :(
I'm working on the same thing myself. Hopefully an extreme reduction over here.
I used to have an a cup until last year.
Then it suddently jumped to something between b and c and now I want to end the chesticles.
It's so annoying.
I have B cups and I hate to admit how nice they are. If I want to wear a pushup bra in girlmode I can do that, if I want them to mostly go away in masc mode I slap on a compression sports bra and they get pretty flat (although certainly not binder flat). For once having a small chest kinda owns.
I really want kids soon and to be able to breastfeed, but after that... yeah I’d love a major downsize. It’s so hard to look androgynous, let alone masc, with 34F tiddies 😔
i have an a cup but i want a no cup :(
Omg samme tooooo. Happy to know I'm not alone
I feel that. Im a 36H/38G and its obnoxious. Shirts dont fit the way i want them to when I'm trying to go for andro vibes
Part of me thinks the whole issue needs to be reframed. Like, I need a busty masculine role model! I shouldn’t *have* to modify my body to be androgynous, androgynous should include figures like mine.
have you heard of rain dove? they are a model and non-binary activist. they are very masc but still have big breasts. they are personally a huge inspiration to me, you should look them up!
Exactly. Curves shouldn’t be seen as feminine!
I love rain dove
That’s so funny, I literally just stumbled onto them while googling! Exactly the look I was hoping to find.

i made a pair of pants! now i don’t have to deal with gendered clothing nonsense		"You’re telling me people can just *make* their own pants?
Damn that's good! Well done 

And fck gendered clothing. For me men's sizes are too large and women's clothing has built-in hips and boobs which I don't have. So I just randomly go around buying both of them but actually why can't we just measure sizes in cm or inch instead of gender because ughhghg
Holy hell what incredible pants. I’m actually obsessed. This is the right move, stores don’t sell the shit we want, might as well make it!!!
these are such good pants
What pattern did you use?
That outfit looks 🔥🔥🔥 wow!
So much power in one picture
They look so fire ‎️‍🔥 ‎️‍🔥 can we peep the pattern you used?
Those are great! 😲🖤🖤🖤
[deleted]
Oohhh, those look neat. Did you use a pattern?
They look amazing 🔥
YOU LOOK SO COOL AAAH <3
Cool!
Those pants are awesome!!!!
This outfit is amazing, I'd love to wear it
They look amazing! What pattern did you use?
I want the same pants tbh
Those are amazing! The fit is so good. I've been looking into making my own clothes myself but my sewing machine broke down a while ago and having to buy a new one is so daunting because there are SO MANY to choose from. This is giving me serious inspiration through... might just have to for it! Great job!
Bro you are my goals in so many ways... Your entire vibe but also the fact that you make your own clothes. I just got a sewing machine and I've been looking into how to do it so I can make long sleeved crop tops for flat, way too tall me. And pants. And shirts. And everything else. Your pants look AMAZING and I hope I will someday become as good as you <3
They look so cool. One question though, how big are the pockets?
Goddamn I want this whole outfit
They are so good! Your look is amazing also!!! Super cute,,,🥺🥺
These are amazing
They look amazing! Maybe I should try that!
Omg those are so cute and honestly are my *goals* for making clothing 🥰
These are rad!!
Oh god you are totally goals. I'm going to have to try my hand at those pants of yours. High waisted pants are the one aspect of femme fashion I'm loathe to give up, and these are perfect--high waisted but not immediately gendered!
That's our plan as well! You look fabulous. Well done!
Omg this is so fire. I will literally buy a pair if you were making more.
Aaaaaa 🔥🔥🔥🔥🥺
They look so good! You did such a wonderful job!
Those are the most non binary pants I’ve ever seen and I need a pair
They look incredible and so do you!!
What a fab fit well done you :D
Wow outstanding job, they look fantastic, your very talented... I totally agree in clothing not being gendered..
Bro you look so fucking slick :3
Omg plaid pants twin
Wow amazing job!! They look great on you
Yay, it got pockets! That's some grade A stuff you got right there!
damn you did an awesome job at those :D everytime i make some they turn out to be a lot too wide aroung my waist XD
also really cool pattern :)
Literal goals.
[deleted]
Remind me of 1920s Oxford trousers
You've reached the genderless peak.
i wish i was you
Outfit is looking pretty sweet
Oh my god these pants are glorious and I want 5 pairs 💛🥺✨
Everything about this is splendid.
Fuck yeah. I've hear pants are hard you must be talented af
omg can you share the pattern please!?
And they have POCKETS! You are living the dream.
how deep are the pockets, could they fit a family-sized bag of takis, or even a nintendo switch?
They fit so great!!! I love them on you
Looks fantastic.
Amazing! Did you use a pattern? I love them!
Out of curiosity what fabric did you use (weight and material)?
i wouldnt believe it if i hadnt done it myself, still blows my mind.
can't agree more. mens clothes are often too big on me, or my hips are too large. since top surgery womens tops arent fitted for me, and are also to big on me. pants have always been ridiculous on both sides. im just gonna make my own and not deal with it anymore !
You'd still have to account for proportions of the underlying body. In yon olden days you could fake proportions with undergarment structure (for women's clothing, at least), but we don't do that anymore.
seriously! i spend so much time window shopping and never buying anything because it doesnt fit or isnt quite what i want. all my shopping money is becoming fabric money and i am remaking my closet

"Stop asking if you ""pass as non-binary"" (Rant)"	"That isn't a *thing*. You can't ""pass"" as non-binary any more than you can ""pass"" as gay. If you're gay you're gay. If you're non-binary, YOU. ARE. NON-BINARY.

**Non-binary** **≠ Androgyny.**

If you are asking if your clothing or makeup helps to make you look more androgynous because that's how *you* would like to look, that is a perfectly fine question. But carrying the mindset that non-binary people should look more androgynous as a way of more fully stepping into their enby identity is harmful to both you (believing you need to do *X* in order to ""pass"") and the non-binary community more broadly, where it can invalidate identity by setting irrelevant expectations based on looks, and can trigger dysphoria for others.

Thank you for listening to my TEDTalk.

EDIT: This also applies to seemingly positive posts saying, ""Look how enby I look today!"" -- because you can't ""look enby"", you *are* enby. You're just dressing in a way that further validates that for **you**, just as any other type of dress can be validating for another enby. ""I love how this clothing makes me feel like myself!"" = perfect."	"Thank you for saying this! Agreed! I’m so sick of seeing posts like those. It’s so invalidating for so many in our community. I, as an androgynous enby who loves androgyny for myself, don’t ever want to be seen as “more nonbinary” or more valid in my identity than enbies who aren’t or don’t want to be androgynous. The whole concept of “passing” is so harmful and is a huge step backwards in a community where we’re trying to show the world that anyone of any gender (or lack thereof) can and should express themselves however they want!
Thank you! It's triggering for me whenever people say that so it doesn't create a safe space for me here too. I get told all the time, as an actor, that I don't look non-binary enough, even tho that is bullshit. Considering leaving the group because of that.
Thank you for this post. I’ve been seeing a rise in the past week of these posts and it’s honestly been making me feel like crap. I’m also worried that newer/discovering enbies will think they have to look a certain way to be “truly” be nonbinary when that isn’t the case at all. That’s why I’m so glad that the r/LGBT subreddit made a new rule addressing this issue.
THANK YOU. It feels like this sub is 50% ""do I pass?"" and 50% ""what should my name be?"" and it's starting to become tiresome. Surely there are more interesting and relevant things we could discuss that are less likely to trigger dysphoria for people innocently scrolling.
I also don't really think that it's possible to look androgynous in the sense that many people mean it - I think some people use androgynous to mean having other people not be able to guess your assigned or presenting gender, which is incredibly difficult to achieve and depends entirely on the person looking at you and the cultural context in which you live.

I think it's more achievable to present androgynously in the sense of being read 50/50 by other people, or intentionally presenting mixed gender cues, but of course neither is necessary for being non-binary!
Ppl doesnt understand the difference between gender identity, gender expression and sexual orientation
THANK YOU!!! This trend is suuuuuuper upsetting to me, and I think it ought to be added to the rules, because it makes me feel dysphoric and small. I literally hate the concept of passing. Like, do I pass the acceptance of the cis test?? It’s absurd.
THANK YOUUUUU. Nonbinary is an umbrella term. It does not mean ""genderless"".
A million times yes, queerness is about not fitting a mold and owning your whole self, androgyny is one way to express yourself but relegating non-binary people into an ambiguous “third gender” is so regressive. 

I really wish we could take some kind of action, to stop this constant gender checking. It’s so triggering !
Yes!!! It is so invalidating and harmful to this community to repeatedly see posts defining what classifies as a “non-binary look”. The point is that we are not confined to any look or definition. Gender euphoria is great and we are here to support each other’s self expression, but not to decide what does and doesn’t fit into a stereotypical view of what it means to be non-binary. When one person’s goal becomes recognized as a universal standard for non-binary presentation it can be so invalidating to other people.
Yeah that’s totally true. I just like always saying “yes you do” to those posts no matter what they look like lmao.

That’s basically the main reason I support their existence.
I agree with this. I’m AFAB and sometimes I present extremely feminine. Does that detract from the fact that I am non-binary? Absolutely not. Sometimes I present extremely masculine. Sometimes androgyny is the word of the day. None of these things weigh into the fact that I finally know who I am. That’s where the joy lies for me.
There have been days where I've just wanted to step out of this sub because I'm never going to look androgynous, I don't want to look androgynous, and I feel less valid because of all the pressure to do so.

It's bad enough outside of spaces like this, I don't like that it's coming from INSIDE these spaces, too.
I will never be androgynous. I have huge tits and a fat ass. That don't make me any less enby. 

Thank you for your ted talk.
 I don't believe in any kind of universal nonbinary expression - there's no way to pass as something people don't recognize the existence of in the first place - or even any universal expression of the binary genders. 

The idea of passing-as-goal is just so deeply toxic. At best, ""I must meet these arbitrary benchmarks of physicality and behavior for my own safety"" is symptomatic of a broken society, and at worst we get bullshit like ""if you cannot meet these arbitrary standards, you should just cease to exist"" and it's infuriating. Life is hard enough, don't tear down your sibs, we don't owe androgyny or ambiguity to anyone for any reason
Yeah as a trans masculine nonbinary person it really sucks to see so many younger folks (I'm 25) asking if they pass or not, as well as makes me feel less and less accepted as nonbinary since people view me as a man 90% of the time.

It shouldn't even be a thing for trans men and women honestly, because it still enforces colonialism and pushes western beauty standards and aesthetics onto people who have nothing to do with the person asking.

Our physical features do not have a gender, that's just what society wants us to believe so that we'll change ourselves to fit into cisnormative boxes. Not only is that not accessible to everyone, not everyone wants to change their bodies in ways that would make them ""pass"" and they shouldn't be made to feel wrong for that.

I know most in defense of this phenomenon will claim it's only about the feelings of those asking, but that's not true nor is it realistic. There will always be people who look like you and who don't have the same gender as you. Asking if you pass it's putting scrutiny on those people as well along with anyone else who may share key features with you that contribute to both how you view yourself and how others view you.
Honestly I'd like a ban on selfies as well as the 'do I look [gender]' posts, or at least limiting them to recurring threads on certain days. Inherent problems with seeking validation on one's appearance on the internet aside, they tend to detract from threads with more substantive discussion.
*Thank you.* I've been feeling like shit because I'm a little more femme than a lot of people on this subreddit. I am non-binary, but I present as femme sometimes. Not that I want to, that's just how it is

I appreciate you saying this
When i first came out I tried so hard to look androgynous as a large framed person. 
Eventually I realized I don't owe the world an image to make knowing me easier.
I agree with this so much there is no non-binary “look” hence the point but if people want to be androgynous look wise there is a community for that called r/androgynoushotties there they discuss questions such as do I “look” androgynous
The trend is very annoying, ngl.
Agreed. I’m tired of these posts and the ones asking if their name sounds gendered. I don’t want to focus on gender, I want to think as little about it as possible.
THANK YOU. 

I hate those posts too. I was recently told I can't be enby because I'm too feminine.
Like ok thanks, I just had a baby and I wasn't skinny enough to do physical androgyny in the first place (ever notice how enby fashion only ever seems to have uber skinny white models??) but thanks for erasing me due to factors beyond my control!
Yeah I keep asking myself if I need to find a different sub because I see those so often. They do kinda make me think “oh am I supposed to be aiming for a look?”
I’m so happy that people are addressing this more. I avoided enby spaces for a long time, and it took me a while to even feel comfortable IDing as enby, because of the equation of non-binary identities with androgyny and the expectation that being non-binary had to look a certain way. We’re all just people, and we’re non-binary. That doesn’t come with a certain look because we’re a diverse community and it’s really important to not project our personal experiences onto other people. There is no single valid way to be non-binary.
I DISAGREE.  One CAN look enby.  
They simply must be wearing a froggie hat.  
All jokes aside, I firmly agree.  I'm transmasc but I don't like to bind and a lot of the times the ""do I look enby"" posts are thin and flat chested and... yeah, yeah you do look like what cis people imagine enbys to look like.  But, I don't.  That doesn't make me look less enby.  FeelsBad™️.

Edited because I don't know how Reddit formatting works shhh
I like this. I wore make up once and then some of my friends said something like, “You are finally exptessing yourswlf!” I was like…..since I was assinged male at birth, I guess you assume any male expression is faked, but thst is not true. I love wearing suits. I love tight fitting tshirts (male style). I love being confident while dancing. I have been expressing myself since I was about 16. Granted I do hide some parts of myself, but that does not mean I “finally started expressing” myself when I fo something feminine. Just express myself in a new way.
Louder for the people at the back please. Can we pin this at top of our sub? Can we get sub rules of which this is one? Can we ban the posts that don't understand how counter productive they are being? These posts dominate our sub and push people away
thank you, i needed this.
Thank you for making this post. I am guilty of this mistake myself
THANK YOU
You are 100% correct. None of us owe androgyny. But this knowledge does nothing to take away the pain that I, a large masc-presenting brute, experience at everyday misgendering. No amount of education and no number of pronoun badges has eased my plight. Androgyny is my last resort.
Thank you im glad someone finally said it
Honestly? I needed this today.
THANK YOU! If we are outside of the binary box system, we shouldn't create another box. Fuck the boxes.
Honestly yeah. Some of the validation being sought is validation for the wrong thing.
Thank you 🙏 fr it's toxic
#THANK YOU

And can mods please enforce this?  Remove reported posts that are asking if someone passes/what their AGAB looks like? PLEASE?
110%. Thank you. Somebody enby who is AFAB, uses she pronouns, dresses up in skirts and full makeup every day is JUST AS NONBINARY AS SOMEBODY ANDROGYNOUS. Nonbinary doesn't have a look. You can't 'pass' as nonbinary. Clothes don't have gender. You can't dress more or less nonbinary
Honestly all those posts make me feel unwelcome for whatever reason and invalid. I question if I'm ""enby enough"" because I'm AMAB but identify as agender, but I don't like to wear things to make me look more fem because I'm not fem, I want to be outside of that binary.

I know I don't owe anyone androgyny but coming here and feeling not good enough did drain on my confidence that I am enby.
Thank you.

I've struggled with my enby identity because NOTHING about androgyny sounds appealing to me. I don't want to look androgynous at all. But for years, I believed that meant I wasn't non-binary because I thought ""real"" enby people looked androgynous. It's still something I struggle with. I still spend a lot of time telling myself that I'm not actually enby, because I'm AFAB and like to present as feminine. I doubt that will ever go completely away, but hearing and seeing people talk less about ""looking non-binary"" certainly wouldn't go unappreciated.
This. I don’t want to look more “nonbinary.” I just want to look less feminine.
Peole need to know that r/androgynous exists too
Would “Look how androgynous I look today!” be fine?
This. Yes.
I'm gonna link this post from now on
Agreed! Literally said the same thing yesterday in this same sub. Can we please stop replicating the cissexual idea of looking gendered?
Thank you!! I actually messaged the mods about this yesterday, hopefully they listen soon!!
As high femme nb ty
capital B Based
posts like that do make me sad
This!!!!
Thank you for saying exactly what I feel. I’ve been going to an lgbtq+ support group and saying exactly this every week! How I feel imposter phenomenon because I don’t always look androgynous, but that these feelings are wrong because it doesn’t matter what I look like to others, it matters how I feel about myself. Thank you again!
This post should be pinned
It gives ""you don't look trans"" /  ""you're pretty for a trans person"" / ""you're pretty for a black girl"" / ""you don't look autistic"" vibes.
Thank you! Even with hormones, I can't change my facial structure or body shape, so those posts feel invalidating, especially to a POC.
I agree with saying that an outfit makes someone feel good/pretty/whatever is a better way to phrase it.
You’re looking for r/nonbinaryover30 mi amor. The kids are still working on it.
Agreed
YES. THANK YOU.
So this. I have no non offensive way to describe my physical features.  I am short have a very curvy butt and large breasts.  I am not a woman but I am in that I share a lot of common experiences.  People assume I’m cisgender all the time. It’s frustrating. Because I constantly have to educate people and it takes a lot of energy. 

I am agender.  So under the umbrella trans-gender, not binary. , agender. It’s the closet fitting box. 

I literally had a women in transition berate be in this private group chat because she didn’t believe that non-binary folks being ignored in the sports world in terms of classification. She thought that “female gender based division doesn’t make me feel like I don’t belong because I don’t have a gender.

I had to leave the group and said some hurtful things which I regret. But I was so taken off guard because it was such a safe space. 

The original post was a lovely post that while a lot of the group were woman there where also non-binary folks who were part of and while we support them we don’t want to be erased. I
Everything about this!

I've been considering leaving this sub because all of those post really trigger my dysphoria and make me question if I'm ""really nonbinary enough"" because I am so femme presenting most of the time.
Thank youuuu!! I am not androgynous like at all. I would never be confused for a dude. It honestly sucks so much seeing people asking about this constantly and acting like being androgynous is the only way you can be nonbinary. We're all enby. Idc if you have massive boobs or a beard and chest hair. Idc if you like to wear tight tops and skirts or oversized jeans and hoodies. There's not a certain look you should have for people to respect you and use your pronouns. Honestly this sub makes me feel more insecure in my identity than anything has before. Be androgynous if that's you I'm so happy for you. But it's not me. It's not so many of us. I'm not gonna try fit myself into a tiny box right in between the male-female binary just so people respect me.
The idea of passing is toxic to begin with, even for binary trans people. It comes from a culture of “clocking” trans people and it just sucks. Plain and simple.
It sounds what people might be looking for is a ""vibe check"", which is probably a better way to phrase it than ""do I look androgynous/enby"".
This! Also the posts that are like “would you assume I’m AMAB or AFAB?” I just scroll by because I know they’re looking for affirmations but it really annoys me because your sex assigned at birth has nothing to do with being non-binary.
The purely aesthetic thing with the non-binary world is so fucking irritating. For some people that’s really all it is
That's the thing about passing. Because of the gender binary as a social structure, people will *try* to categorize everyone as one thing or another. Now, one could be in a position where people find it actively harder to categorize, but that is *because* they're *attempting* to do so. And when we talk about passing, that is the dynamic we're talking about. So I agree, it is kind of impossible to *'pass'* as nonbinary.

Slightly separate, but linked; as you say, there is no such thing as 'looking nonbinary', just as there is no such thing as 'looking gay'. If you are, then you are.
Mods sticky this pleeeease
Passing discussion always just ends up uplifting cis-het standards of how people are allowed to appear. Always gives me a bit of ""am I pleasing my oppressors"" vibe even when the question is ""Do I look neither male nor female?""

Not to mention how these kinds of post denigrate folks who can't or don't want to ""pass.""
Absolutely agree, you can identify as non-binary and dress however you like. 

You don't have to ""pass"" as anything other than your own authentic self.
Yes! THANK YOU! I can not upvote this enough.
Thank you for saying this, it was all I was seeing lol. I know for some people it's just something they're not aware of yet and maybe think the terms are interchangable and it's not their fault really, but it was getting very much.
I aim to look androgynous over non binary.  

I’m okay looking either male or female most days- but some days I want to look like neither and both at the same time. I enjoy diverse fashion and I want to look masculine sometimes and feminine others. It’s different for everyone. I consider myself non binary but I still prefer the pronoun she. I do get happy when people call me he on mistake though. It means I’m coming across the way I want to.
Thank you for saying that. I’m afab and with my height and figure I’ll always be perceived feminine and if I tried to force an androgynous look, I would at most look like a young boy, which I don’t want. Like, I’d love to look androgynous but the way I want it isn’t achievable for me so I’m just… mostly sticking to very basic clothing and everyone assumes I’m a woman 🤷
Its true that as a Nonbinary person there is no such thing as passing when you can dress as you please. I've also saw someone post a reddit for these kinds of things if people want to ask. 

Other than that as you said if they are asking I think it's a form of feedback especially if you're going for a certain look.
thank you for saying this. 💕

in other non-binary subs, people have - completely unprompted - told me how to change my body to fit their standards. & i do understand why they do that: my body is so lacking in traditional androgyny, it’d drive people absolutely wild to be forced to live in it. *i’m* not having a great time living in it.

but i don’t understand why people push a whole different set of standards instead of realizing that the standards are, in fact, the problem. it’s impossible for my body to obtain traditional androgyny: maybe the definition of traditional androgyny is the problem. maybe being androgynous being the only way to exist as non-binary in this world is the problem. maybe nobody’s body is the fucking problem.
Thank you this is very frustrating for me. I’m afab and I will always have curves but that doesn’t make me ANY less non-binary.
I think the discussion about passing as a binary man or woman is valid cause that can be about safety as much as it is about easing dysphoria. But I fear passing as nonbianary might make it seem like a solid third gender instead of the umbrella term it is. We can celebrate how presentation and even flagging give us gender euphoria but there's as many ways to ""look nonbianary"" as there are nonbianary people.
if i could upvote this 100x i would. it’s so annoying, i’ve considered leaving the forum bcs it’s constant posts like that. you look like a human in clothes, that’s it.
Facts. I’ve been seeing so many of these posts and every time I think 


“Do y’all not get it?”
THIS!!!! I adore the pics of people feeling good or trying out something new and looking for validation, or anyone who just wants to share a selfie :) it’s great seeing people in our community! I love y’all!

But please don’t ask about Passing unless you need help looking like a “cis” person for safety or something.

Always happy to help people asking how to look more masc/fem/androgynous etc. That’s absolutely fine! It’s a great way to find tips on reducing our dysphoria and making us feel happier! I always want you to be happier! (Yes, you reading this!).

If you don’t feel “nonbinary enough” that’s okay. I don’t most days either. It doesn’t mean anything bad. It doesn’t mean you aren’t valid. It means society is pushing us so many directions and we are trying to find out how best to express ourselves, be healthy and safe. Please just say you are feeling unsure or want to know if you are valid (you are! But it’s okay to ask that if you need to hear it!).

TL;DR: you are valid and great just how you are. But if you want specific advice or support, say so xxx
I really like the ""look how enby I look today"" posts because everybody looks so different.
You said it. This is why the term nonbinary exists in the first place. It’s literally a category so you don’t HAVE to fall into a gender category. Nonbinary is like a free space in a bingo game, or a free choice activity for art class. Anything you want. Anything YOU want.

If you are more feminine and want to present feminine features, go for it! You are not less valid or more valid than someone who chooses to present as androgynous.

If you want to present as androgynous, your presentation is not ‘right’ or ‘wrong’ because as nonbinary, you do not fit into binary gender constructs, and therefore don’t fit into one certain appearance to represent all.

My point is that, just do what makes you happy. Dress, act, talk, feel the way you want. You are not right or wrong. Stay safe, all.

- Kíeran, he/him (I still like this sub because identifying as nb for years was a big part of my identity, and I like to honor it. I also like complimenting people lol. And, my partner is nb, even though I’ma trans guy)
But we can still ask if we pass as androgynous, correct? It's really important for some of us.
thx!! the concept of ""passing"" as nonbinary has lowkey hurt me as an afab demigirl, bc it makez me feel like i can NEVER be even remotely fem/be ok with fem language or my identity wont be valid anymore and i wont be TRULY nonbinary, which is just absolute bullcrap. to me, skirts and shorts are just pieces of fabric and pinks and blues are just colors so idc abt fitting my presentation into a box, i just dress how i want and look how i want and ive gotta remind myself that doesnt make me ""less nonbinary"" or whatevr <3
This is right up there with referring to people as they/thems. There's already a gender neutral term for people that is not men or women. It's people/person. There's no need to make up a new word that plays off some non-binary people using they/them pronouns.
For myself it's a huge thing to also look more androgynous/masc-leaning/whatever. 🤷🏻‍♂️ I can't speak for others, but in my daily life I still get 85-95% of the time misgendered and I made a post a few days ago cause I really started to question my looks and efforts.

Some people have a drive to bring inner stuff to the outside. Like I also have some tattoos of the, for me, most important things. Like I have a tattoo for the people I lost in my life, but not everyone could think about getting a tattoo. Not only cause you have to find someone who is really able to do what you like, also some people just can't think of showing important things like that around.

In my native language and location you for example have no kind of ""they/them"". So I, as a patient with multiple chronic diseases, has every time to tell the docs to call me by chosen first name (extremely uncommon to do this, it's only ok if you are really familiar) and the formal use of ""you"".

Even if I do this, I still get all the time misgendered everywhere.

That is something that makes ME very dysphoric.

That's why I asked here, how others here would see me, cause I needed outside opinions.

I think the most others who post similar questions like how good they ""pass"" or what others think, is born out of similar issues.

Maybe that helps understanding a bit more both sides.
This is a very good point, but the same can be said if a trans men was to make a post asking ""do I pass as a man?. That's not invalidating trans men who don't wish or can't ""pass"" as a man. Getting called ""she, miss, young lady"" kills me. I can't reach into people's minds and scream ""I'm fucking nonbinary!!"" So I want something, anything about my outward appearance that can other people see that will get me gendered correctly.
As long as we’re ranting in here … wow I would love it if I could go ONE day without being bombarded with binary affirmations / celebrations / references here in the NONBINARY sub!

“Gender euphoria because I look so masculine today!” I … okay? Great? I’m happy for you, but … is this remotely on topic? “My partner called me her girlfriend and it was amazing!” Again … love it, I celebrate and elevate you, but in what possible way is that nonbinary?!?!

I struggle because gatekeeping is a shitty thing to do, but come on, this feels to me like going into the Skyrim sub and talking about how much you love Elden Ring, and it’s just CONSTANT in this sub!

</rant>, thanks for listening, and feel free to let me know if I’m thinking about this wrong, I’m open to feedback and learning
[deleted]
People want to look distinct from the men and women in their lives and that's valid actually. They're not asking for the one true enby form, and it's actually not very empathetic or nice to project that onto people. It's okay to care about how you're perceived and if you don't suffer from dysphoria, congrats, some people do tho and it's worth contemplating whether ""just look like how you want to"" is actually going to make someone feel better or not.

If you've spent your life only knowing what you're not, someone telling you you're heccin valid just do whatever kinda sucks!
Yeah… I dunno, “dressing in a way that validates you” and “signaling that you are non-binary with style choices” and “passing” are all kinda the same thing. Isn’t “I love how this clothing makes me feel about myself” just the subtext of a phrase like “Look how enby I look today?” Idk, I think for some (not all) playing with the ambiguities of everything is really enjoyable.

Like I pass as enby in the sense that when I meet new ppl out in the world I will sometimes be asked my pronouns (no one else will be asked this question) and when they assume, they go they/them. Ppl see my style and appearance and assume something about me.

That’s just passing no?
Stop gatekeeping and telling people the rules. There aren’t rules. People get to live their lives the way they want and you don’t get a say in it. We’ve been fighting too damn long to get other people to stop telling us how to live into our true selves to just let another group of people start telling us how to live.
I personally view social acceptance of your non-binary identity to be rooted in ""failing"" rather than ""passing"". When people who don't know are no longer reading you as either binary gender I'd consider you to do the non-binary equivalent of passing.
IS EVERY SOCIAL MEDIA CALLING ME OUT TONIGHT WTF?
[deleted]
I think a lot of it just comes from a mix of insecurity and still struggling to re-wire the brain to think of gender differently than how it is treated in the cis world. Ik it can suck to see bc the person clearly isnt really understanding a lot about what gender actually is, but I think it’s important to keep in mind that we’re all in different places of our gender journey and a lot of people are still learning and growing and becoming more comfortable. 
I think we as a community need to be careful how we treat other non-binary people who are still figuring themselves out and de-programming their way of thinking. It should be more of a priority to help our fellows than automatically get mad at them, even if it can be frustrating.
There was a post about this about two weeks ago, and it made me so happy at the time to see that other people had a similar opinion to me on this (it had several thousand upvotes). 

And then... Nothing was really done about it. I thought that maybe it would be added as one of the rules of the sub that you couldn't make those sorts of posts, because so many people were sick of them and commented saying so. But, nothing.

I was actually considering leaving this sub for exactly the reasons you mentioned until your post. I might hang around a little longer and see if things do change. If they don't, I guess I'll leave.

Edit: apologies, it was about 'what gender do I look?', not 'do I look enby?'. Both problematic questions tbh,  and ones it's clear many people here are sick of. https://www.reddit.com/r/NonBinary/comments/z0zyam/the_what_gender_do_you_assume_i_am_posts_need_to/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=android_app&utm_name=androidcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button
Thank you. I know that there is supposedly an authentic look. I hate that there is an unspoken measurement. I'm nonbinary every day. My androgyny is innate. I don't have to wear it I'd perform it. It's not an aesthetic. It's in my spirit.
I agree. It makes me feel like I’m not nonbinary enough because I have long hair and look more feminine. Nonbinary shouldn’t have rules or certain ways to look. It makes no sense.
It is very very wrong but I don’t fault people thinking that they need to pass some kind of test for being non-binary Given that in every other group there seems to be some kind of criteria about how you need to be to do X otherwise you’re not  y enough. it is incorrect But not surprising to imagine that people think that it’s the same for this. What didn’t seem to get is the non-binary by its very definition Abandoned notion of traditional gender roles or even criteria in general. You are what you are because you say you are. You could be the most masculine Scottish highland games type man but not feel like that inside and if he were to Declared that he was non-binary he would be. People need to understand that it’s all about self affirmation and acceptance not the acceptance of people that somehow think it’s necessary to clamp criteria on something that by its very existence is criteria less
YW
Thanks I honestly needed to hear that
I appreciate the positivity of this post. However, I understand where people may be coming from with asking if they ""pass as nb"", because I've literally been asked ""how can you be non-binary with a big chest"" and also nobody at work can get my pronouns right even though I wear a pronoun pin AND we've had work meetings about it AND I correct them, they always want to address me as my AGAB. While how I've learned into my identity is what makes me comfortable, a v small part of it is also so people actually respect and remember and identify that I am nb 😞
Anyone who asks me if the pass from now on is only ever going to get a yes and aggressve support from me when others disagree.
The idea of passing and the standards set for passing are standards set by people who aren't even queer or trans.
Enough is enough. Let's set our own standards 💕
LOUDER FOR THE PEOPLE IN THE BACK
why limit it to enbys? it's less obvious but technically nobody passes as a woman or man either.
And not to mention the privilege that comes with being able to look androgynous in the first place
> is a huge step backwards in a community where we’re trying to show the world that anyone of any gender (or lack thereof) can and should express themselves however they want!

Preach 🙌🏽
Yessss like ik society loves boxes but why does it have to be a hierarchy? I dress more femme but it doesn't change how I feel about my gender.
I completely agree with this my androgyny is from my dysphoria non from me being non binary.
It’s so sad and wrong that you get told that. There is no way to “look nonbinary” so I’m sorry you have to hear such invalidating stuff all the time. I support you! Enbies can and should present in any way that makes them feel the best! And so should binary people for that matter!
100% yes
Cultural context speaks to another awkward aspect of this which is the appeal to the dominant cultural ideas of androgeny. Thin and white, to put it bluntly. It's not intentional, I know. But we should be better than not racist, we should be anti-racist: that means we face down our unconscious biases fearlessly and without getting defensive.

Let's play with gender norms freely, but not create new ones with which to police bodies.

With love to all my enby community!
Yes! Personally people gender me maybe 70% fem 30% masc and I'm sure that almost nobody see me and thinks ""oh an agender one"". We learned to put a gender to everyone so people do that automatically
>intentionally presenting mixed gender cues,

this is what a i personally prefer. realistically i am never going to be 50/50 androgynous so id rather go full genderfuck.
I can't imagine that you mean it's *impossible* to look androgynous in exactly the way you've described: causing great difficulty in guessing your AGAB.
I'd encourage people to ponder the difference between gender expression and gender perception as well. How other people interpret your expression can be at times (frustratingly) more consequential than your expression itself. It's an unpleasant reality that it breaks my heart to see queer people still facing despite how far society has come.
All posts where people are asking how others perceive them should be banned, to be honest because A: our perception is not going to be representative of the rest of the mostly cishet world and B: it's all grounded in stereotypes

It's not useful and is potentially quite upsetting. There should be a separate subreddit for it if people want feedback on their gender presentation
I second the idea about adding it to the rules !
I can relate! I was thinking this too!
Really well said
I really love the sub r/NonBinaryTalk for this reason ❤️
I agree about the “do I look [gender]” posts, but not selfies in general. There’s nothing wrong with wanting to share your look with people you should be able to expect to not judge you based on gender conformance. 

Yes, it’s validation-seeking, but some of us need a little bit of that from the online community because we don’t have access to any IRL support. 

I don’t begrudge anyone the need for validation. I think we *do* need to redirect what people are looking to have validated.
Yea no, with the amount of queerphobia in the world, we shouldn't be banning trans people from posting selfies. And there's nothing wrong with I th seeking validation if it's something you can't get easily irl
This 👆🏽 for me too ❤️
This 🙌🏽
I feel like its more for advice when asking though. If you want a certain look I think its fine to ask and give advice.

Then there are subreddits for that if asking.
Post on r/transpassing for posts like the person is describing
Yes because androgynous is a word that can be used as a descriptor of physical appearance, nonbinary cannot be used in that same way.
Also, stop asking people to name you!

A name should be personal, not the result of a Reddit thread.
Thank you for this.
Yes this! I honestly hate seeing any AMAB v AFAB discussions and tend to leave or mute a group when I see them. We’re all nonbinary, right? Why the focus on what’s in our pants when we know that it feels gross when the outside world is already so caught up about it.
Well said 🙌🏽
That would be fine.
I feel this. I'm not ok with fem language for myself it makes me feel squicky but 100% same for me otherwise
Im sure its more for advice. I think it's fine if people ask if certain clothing styles or whatever look they are going for would help.
Then make a post saying “do I look androgynous/masc” not “do I look non-binary”, that’s all the post was saying.
day 284829 of people mistaking gender identity for expression
You are in fact thinking about this the wrong way. Nonbinary doesn’t mean genderless. Nonbinary is an umbrella term that encompasses anyone who does not feel 100% man or 100% woman. Enbies can have no gender, multiple genders, etc. There’s no right way to be nonbinary. Nonbinary people can get euphoria from gendered terms. There are trans masculine enbies and trans feminine enbies, there are enbies who are both men and women (me), and sometimes it makes us euphoric to hear ourselves referred to in binary terms. I love being called boyfriend but that doesn’t make me less nonbinary. Your comment does come across as gatekeepy because, again, there is no right or wrong way to be nonbinary. Being nonbinary means something different to every enby.
I mean, there are nonbinary men and nonbinary women. Nonbinary doesn't just mean ""genderless"". So, posts about how happy someone is that were able to express their nonbinary gender are not out of place here.

Edit: actually, fuck it, I *hate* how hostile this place can be to literally anyone who is not 100% androgynous all the time. I'm nonbinary. I'm a dude. I like being masculine. I like being called ""husband"" and ""brother"". That makes me feel good, *because i am a nonbinary guy*. And it really, really feels like this place, which is supposed to be *for all nonbinary people* count me as a traitor to be kept out of this space. 

Which, fine. I don't have the fucking energy for this anymore. If you think I, a NONBINARY person, should be gatekept out of NONBINARY spaces I'll show myself out.
You really misread the post huh. OP isn’t trying to dictate how people look or stop them from looking androgynous, what they’re saying is that people saying “Do I look nonbinary” when they mean “do I look androgynous” can be harmful, as it implies that nonbinary=androgyny, when nonbinary people can actually look however they want and not just androgynous.
That’s not what OP is saying. This is about people using nonbinary when they mean androgynous. When someone is looking for validation in how they look they can say something like “do i look androgynous?” or any other descriptor. The issue here is that nonbinary is not an adjective that can describe physical appearance and when you use it like it is one, it’s very invalidating to nonbinary people who don’t fit that mold. 

OP isn’t saying “you’re valid, do whatever” they’re saying “you’re valid, do what feels right for YOU” they’re saying that there shouldn’t be any sort of expectation for how an enby “should” look because we can look any sort of way, same with binary people. 


It’s sort of like how a woman who is trying to look feminine shouldn’t say “do i look like a woman?” Because women can look any sort of way, masculine, feminine, androgynous, etc. What she should ask is “do i look feminine?” Because that’s not invalidating to the women who don’t look feminine.
Of course it’s valid, that’s not what I’m saying here
""look how enby I look today"" implies that *a specific look is nonbinary* and that *everyone who doesn't look like that doesn't look nonbinary*. ""This clothing makes my gender feel good"" doesn't do that.
Read the other comments in this thread to see why you’re looking at this the wrong way. I don’t feel like typing out a bunch of stuff again.
You can't really 'pass' as enby since there is no single way to present among all enbys. Some enbys are agender, some are multigenger, some are fluid, some are closer to one side of the binary than the other. All of those are very different. And even among the same gender identity people might want to present differently
I agree, but this is missing the point…
The entire concept of “passing” is based in binary gender norms.
saying 'not all non binary people present the same way and implying so is invalidating and bigoted' is not saying 'non binary people don't experience dysphoria'
Did you just try to pit people who dress androgynous and people who don't against each other?  We are all here because we identify or are questioning being non-binary. Nobody said androgynous dressing people are bad or have any other sort of ranking within this community.

The FACT of the matter is one's gender identity does not dictate how one should dress or look. Period.  Personally, I think using verbiage that correlates the two is harmful in any way that it's used.  I shouldn't feel like I'm ""doing it wrong"" or that my acquaintances are going to wonder if I'm ""faking it"" because I was AFAB and decided to wear a skirt today.
> there are some non-binary people where androgyny is the only cure for dysphoria

Then they're welcome to ask /r/androgyny how well they're pulling it off. While there's correlation between angrogyny and nonbinary people, it's not inherently linked. And frankly, it's taken me a lot longer to internalise this _precisely because_ of the number of people who post androgynous selfies here — impostor syndrome is a bitch.
A lot of people with that type of insecurity will see posts like this or overly-critical comments on their post and automatically want to hide away and disengage in the community. Which is really sad to me
i’m FINALLY being perceived as more androgynous to people now, but it took over a year of T and mostly my new mullet to make that happen. and i’m still perceived more as a girl than anything else, just an uptick of “are you a boy or a girl” question has happened in the past month
thank you
Yep. I dress almost exclusively in men's clothes but have a very feminine body shape so I read as feminine anyways.
Tbh I disagree with this sentiment. Being seen as androgynous is typically not a privilege, even if it’s gender affirming. Gender non conforming people are generally not treated very well by the general public I’ve found
I wouldn’t consider it a privilege cuz anyone can look androgynous if they try hard enough, just like how anyone can look more femme if they want to
My hero of the day
Right? Like, I'm a fat person. I'm not going to be gendered androgynously pretty much ever because people in the western world largely think it means 'thin white afab person with jaw-length hair'.
Androgyny is culturally relative for sure, because masculinity and femininity are likewise culturally relative. I'd most likely be considered far more androgynous in certain other cultures than in my own. Other cultures would see me as more masculine, because the feminine side of me isn't considered feminine there. Paradoxically this is both incredibly affirming and deeply soul-crushing.
Wait, I don't really get it, can you explain in more detail? 

There are PoC that look feminine, there are PoC that look masculine, why do you say that they can't look andro? /gen
I don't think that it's strictly impossible in the sense that it's never something any individual has been able to do - there are a lot of people in the world and I'm sure that a small percentage of manage it.

However, I feel like aiming for it is like aiming for the edge of a knife; most of the time you're going to end up on one side or the other. Even in situations where someone isn't sure about someone's gender, most cis people in my experience seem to prefer to just assume one or the other and hope for the best, so the end result is that you get read 50/50 rather than being read specifically as androgynous. They might recognize that you're a fairly androgynous person, but they'll still decide that you're an androgynous woman or an androgynous man.

This is because there's less of a social construct for non-binary people and what we look like, and what is there is primarily only for thin white afab people and therefore ends up contributing to the idea that non-binary people are just women-lite.

I point this out because I feel like attempting to fit into that small stereotyped and fairly privileged space to get read as non-binary in a few specific queer friendly cities is going to be a pretty difficult goal for most people, and I think if people are going to aim for that they should have realistic expectations.
honestly yeah this.

as much as i despise the concept of ""passing"" (even the NAME is so degrading), i cant ignore the fact that knowing how others read you can be important for ones safety in some situations/environments.
BUT. i agree that this really isnt the place for it, for exactly the reasons youve stated. all it does in an environment like this is cause harm.
why not here?
I don’t think I’ve ever phrased it that way, but thank you :)
As I said, I can only talk for myself^^

But for me it is very important to not look as my AGAB, cause it's really bothering me.

I have for example more curves than I would like, thanks to stuff like lipoedema. One day I will have to get Liposuction for it, although I know, that it's the second deadliest ""beauty"" surgery after BBL.

So from my point of view it's totally ok if someone needs opinions from others, who can more likely feel the struggle.
If you would have looked into my post, you would have seen, that I asked is I look masc-leaning to others.

Maybe try to read, BEFORE trying to smartass someone 🙄
Yeah, I fucked up. I apologize.
Similarly, ""they"" isn't ***the*** non-binary pronoun. There is no non-binary pronoun.

Any gender or non-gender can self-refer as they. 

And, a non-binary person can go by any pronoun. Even their AGAB. It's valid.
Very sincere thanks for the reply, I appreciate it. That helps a lot, I can see where I was making some big misunderstandings and assumptions. I have some more listening to do.
Yeah, your identity is valid and so is your frustration and anger at my ignorance. You absolutely belong here and now I think I’m the one who doesn’t. I didn’t understand what I was talking about and I apologize.
""you can't look enby"" great good love it very nice upvoteupvoteupvote

like come on. People can have their own understanding of femininity, but the average person is going to be _pretty good_ at estimating whether a stranger will gender a particular person as female or not. And I'm _struggling_ to understand how yalls aren't reducing their struggle to ""actually they should stop caring 🙃"" Doh! Why didn't! They think of that! Of course , we solved gender!

It would be great if gender were cordoned off into your own personal feelings but it isn't, _other people's understanding of gender matters to us_ whether we want it to or not.
My assumption is that you believe ""do i pass as non-binary"" is invalid. Like the understandable knee jerk reaction is that it's encouraging some form of gatekeeping but it feels a lot more complex than that
I feel like “this clothing makes my gender feel good” is a really… weird way of phrasing it tbh. “this clothing gives me gender euphoria” would be a better way of saying that one I think
Does it? Or is that just what you hear?
You know I did and I wasn’t convinced.
I agree, but only to an extent. ""Passing"" is a phenomenon that applies beyond just gender. It is a state of being in which how others perceive you is aligned to how you express yourself, and it's something we perpetually do unless we truly do not care about the perception of others. Few people can sincerely claim not to care about passing in some way or another, be that in regards to gender or something else.
I wish this would happen to me. All anyone sees is a boy and I have to present masc at work (conservative industry).
I feel like its hardly possible to be consistently considered androgynous. Once my face changed enough from T I'm treated as a guy. If I tie my hair back I'm stared at as a girl. People generally just pick one. I think its better to just try to get more people to stop assuming one or the other, and not feel weird if people are cautiously neutral.
I never said they had privilege in the way of being accepted into hegemonic gender norms, I’m saying that generally speaking in order to present androgynously, it requires access to more clothes, makeup, accessories, surgeries, etc etc to be read as “confusing” to most people which is in of itself, a privilege. 

When it comes to the privilege of partaking in hegemony, of course androgynous people don’t have that privilege, but having access to enough capital to present as they see fit, is a privilege many don’t have.
Not everyone can look androgynous. Stop blaming those of us who want to but can't for ""not trying hard enough"".
hard disagree.

i have a very hyper-female body shape, to the point where people ask if i have had plastic surgery or have some sorta estrogen disorder.

i have talked to multiple doctors: if i lost enough weight to be skinny enough to have an “androgynous” body shape (ie, no curves, bc that’s how mainstream society thinks about it), i’d actually die. i’d have to be so underweight that my body would fail.

so no, not everyone can have a “stereotypically androgynous” body - which is why we (in my opinion) need to expand the definition of androgyny to be more inclusive. people that identify with that word shouldn’t be excluded bc of how they look, regardless of gender identity or sex assigned at birth.
Yeah I could easily pass as AMAB in terms of build if I just didn’t have wide hips, which I mostly gave because of my weight (not huge, def not skinny). Because of that and my round (also from weight) face, I’m stuck getting misgendered.
It's not particular to androgeny. For someone to talk about whether they ""look X"" we are defining X and that calls on cultural norms. The dominant culture is white European, so that has a lot of gravity in all gender expressions.

Serena Williams is sometimes described in masculine terms, or be told she was born male. This is racist culture policing a PoC woman's body.

All bodies are policed, all genders of all ethnicities are policed, as a community we have the opportunity to not build up new ideals but celebrate all bodies.

Which I think many people do! Our community is wonderful! It's just something to watch ourselves for because unconscious bias is powerful.
I don't think they meant PoC can't look andro. When people on this sub speak of looking andro, they often have a particular ideal in mind that is informed by cultural, unconscious bias. Just look at the ref names that constantly come up for ""peak androgyny"" (like Bowie and Swinton).
Oh for sure. Most cis-het people probably have two drawers they can sort you into, and they'll only let someone sit on the countertop for so long until they decide where to put you. But even just the initial confusion would mean androgyny had been achieved IMO
no seriously what’s wrong with posting selfies here? Is it bad?
Reread the beginning of your comment and tell me again that I read it wrong.

That’s on you bro.
Yep! Pronouns are a form of gender expression and gender expression is not the same thing as gender! 

I go by they/he but i feel like i’m just as much of a woman as i am a man. They/he just feels better than they/he/she right now for me.
I appreciate you listening! We all have room to grow and learn, that’s what this community is for!
You’re misunderstanding me entirely. I’m not saying that people should ignore their dysphoria or “stop caring” about how they look or are perceived. I’m saying we need to stop conflating a certain look with being nonbinary because it really sucks for the nonbinary people who don’t have THAT look. 

Listen, other people’s understanding of gender *does* tend to matter to us, **and that’s why what I’m saying is so important**. As a community, we should not want society to equate androgyny with being nonbinary because that really really sucks for two major groups of people: non-androgynous enbies, and androgynous binary people. And it also gives people the complete wrong idea about what nonbinary means! Being nonbinary means something different to every single enby. The concept of passing is increasingly harmful to our community. 

No one is saying that people shouldn’t seek to have the presentation that makes them feel good, no one is saying that people can’t come here for validation, we’re saying stop using nonbinary as a physical descriptor when it isn’t one. Use terms that are more accurate so that you don’t alienate a huge portion of this community by making them feel like they’re not “nonbinary enough” just because they aren’t or don’t want to be androgynous!
No, it is of course more complex. My point is only that while I can empathize with the (likely painful) reasons why someone is asking that question, it also demonstrates that they are unaware of the pain that ripples out into a community beyond themselves by asking it. Evidenced by some of the other comments here including one where they feel like they can't be here anymore because those posts hurt too much.
That’s a matter of semantics because both statements you mention are saying the exact same thing if it is the clothing giving a person gender euphoria, the clothing *is* making their gender feel good. We should avoid policing how people express their satisfaction with their gender.
You read all the comments of people being like yeah these types of posts make me feel super excluded and alienated from this community? You don’t think that’s a bad thing? To alienate and exclude other enbies from our community.
If the question is based on appearance and vibes (feminine, masculine, androgynous, punk, cottagecore, or anything descriptive of a vibe) then it’s not based on gender. 

If you’re asking if you look like a man, woman, or non-binary, there are NO descriptors attached to those categories. The only metrics that exist are rooted in gender norms. 

I get that the majority of people assume gender based on appearance, but isn’t the goal to move away from that? Can’t women be masculine and men be feminine without their gender being assumed?
I feel you there completely mate. I have facial hair that particularly gives disphoria for me but it grows so fast that I can’t even bother sometimes.
If I dont know pronouns, i always use ‘they’ until I’m corrected and thats how I’m gonna keep doing it.
I agree with where you’re coming from, but I don’t think I agree that being androgynous requires money or privilege. Some of the most disenfranchised people in the world are poor trans women, who are often read as androgynous or gender ambiguous. 

We may be using different definitions of androgyny here. If you mean “someone who you cannot tell the gender of”, I agree that’s a pretty hard thing to do. Most people “pass” as either male or female, and it does require a lot of effort to be read as totally neutral in your presentation. 

I tend to think of androgyny as a combination of masculinity and femininity, which can be achieved by almost everyone. Tbh “a combination of masculinity and femininity” is the place a lot of “non passing” trans people find themselves, often not by choice. 

Let me know if I’m missing any part of your point here, I’m mostly operating from my own experience as a trans person who is perceived as androgynous most of the time
Woah there relax, I never once said I blame those who want to but “can’t” I’m just saying anyone can be androgynous just like anyone can be feminine. Just because someone doesn’t “pass” doesn’t mean they aren’t androgynous. A lot of people who are androgynous still get misgendered such as myself
Oh my god trying to dress more masc with my giant hips is a nightmare. I don't even necessarily want to be read as masculine but like sometimes I'd like to be read as slightly less feminine.
Well put!
I just talked over the post I did as a standalone. Cause the whole post here is ranting over others and it's just tiring.

Instead of talking to each other and try to reason, WHY someone thinks something excluding or whatever some people (and it seems like not a minority) more love to hate and rant about others, although we are a friggin minority in this world, as far as I know.

And again, it seems like you didn't take a look in a profile, you just tried to invalidate my experience and my kind of speech (hey, I'm not a native English speaker).

So, please go away and hate on others, I have better things to do.

You can come back after maturing and being able to have a proper talk.
>I go by they/he but i feel like i’m just as much of a woman as i am a man. They/he just feels better than they/he/she right now for me.

Yeah, thank goodness there's no need to restrict oneself. Wouldn't it be horrifying to feel uncomfortable with one's pronoun, but because of no alternative, be all ""okay this is my life now ***\*suffers\****""
fair, I feel like I only see posts asking for help and people not getting it but I don't see everything idk.
sure, but I don’t think the former is how anyone would ever refer to it
This. Keeping up with it has pushed me over the edge to when I can’t keep up it starts pushing me into self-harm ideation territory where I’m actually afraid I’m going to do something stupid while shaving, have a meltdown, then do something really incredibly fucking stupid.

Thankfully I’m going to start laser soon cause I’ve had enough of this negative feedback emotional shit.
I do that too. Hoping to normalize to people around me by just doing it alot.
Isn’t that just correct grammar?
We aren’t talking about binary trans people, we are talking about non-binary people. Androgyny as a “passing” goal, or as an aesthetic criterion that non-binary people must conform to or not be considered non-binary is a stance that comes from privilege.
I mean, I'm a very short very curvy AFAB human that rocks long hair I wont cut because it's culturally important to me. I'd love to know this secret way of being androgynous, cause it has literally never been my lived experience - despite flannel shirts, binders, or like...grilling while talking about nascar (lol, for real tho). I have never not been assumed to be my AGAB.

If there's a secret I'm missing someone please let a brother know.
No, you said anyone can ""look androgynous if they try hard enough"", which is simply not true. Pray tell me how am I supposed to look androgynous without the ability to wear binders or make-up, when I'm still automatically assumed to be female even with a buzz cut and wide, baggy clothes?

Yes, it is a privilege.
What the hell are you talking about
Also fair, I agree that helping and looking out for each other in this community is the #1 goal
Same here.
Yes. The other valid option is asking the person their pronouns, but sometimes people dont want to be asked their pronouns. All around, just using they until corrected seems like the appropriate answer.
I guess I don't see a huge distinction between binary and non-binary trans people in this context. There are non-binary people who medically transition (myself being one of them) and there are binary trans people who never medically transition. I think binary and non-binary trans people have more in common between the two groups than within either group, if that makes sense. There is so much diversity in the trans community that I find markers like ""binary"" and ""non-binary"" sort of immaterial. 

I agree with you that it's wrong to hold any trans person to any standards of ""passing."" I've found that in non-binary communities there is a very specific type of androgyny that is rewarded (white, thin, masculine-adjacent afab people) and any other type of androgyny is not really celebrated in the same way. I think this has more to do with white supremacy and transmisogyny than an actual acceptance of androgyny or gender nonconformity.

I think the idea that non-binary people should be expected to fit this standard comes from privilege, but I don't think that even most androgynous people fit this standard. There are a million ways to be androgynous, that's why I brought up ""non-passing"" trans people as an example of androgyny that most people aren't being pressured to emulate.
For me, also a curvy AFAB, it helped throwing out like 70% of my clothing. Skirts, dresses, very femme tops,... I sold it on Vinted.

Instead now I am wearing a more classy male style, what was a solution for me, cause I liked this kind of style before, but I totally get if not everyone feels like that.

But a big thing for me was chopping of my hair, cause it changes the looks of the face. 🤷🏻‍♂️ But I totally get you, when you say you don't want to get rid of it (and I always envied people with really long, nice hair, cause I could only grow it max to half my back 😬 and it didn't suit me...)

I had/have the ""advantage"" that my face is cut more androgynous or how my hubby would say ""German"" 😅😂

But I also have enough stuff there I have a problem with, cause it doesn't look like I want ^^'
There is no “secret” way and I’m sorry you have not had a good experience!
I can imagine how frustrating that is, I’m sorry you have had to deal with that
This just validated my point, thank you, I'm out.
Right, I think the idea that anyone should be pressured to fit an aesthetic goal comes from privilege relating to the things that you described, transmisogyny, white supremacy. 

I know it’s anecdotal but I have been told in my experience that I can’t be enby because I grow facial hair, and yes I too have noticed the masc adjacent androgyny. I suppose what I’m trying to say is that enbies get more comments on how they should be androgynous and are conflated with androgyny, whatever the definition is, should use specific pronouns, etc while binary trans people experience the same oppression but in a different way. 

It’s like how Caitlyn Jenner talks about how trans women who don’t pass are giving her a bad name. She’s saying so from a place of privilege.
I really appreciate the advice! I should totally rock classy menswear... especially when it's too extra for the occasion. I think ascots deserve a comeback!! (I'm like...kinda serious??? Lol).

I'm a member of the Long Hair Clan of the Eastern Band of Cherokee, so...cutting my hair would kinda be giving the middle finger to my heritage. At least to me! I know literally one in my tribe or clan cares, but I care ..even though it makes people misgender me :/ damn...epic flowing locks...

A comic I made about the simple things that keep me going ☀️ What are some of the little things that give you queer joy?		"DOUBLE TROUBLE :DDD

Also if you like trans and enby cartoon characters, watch Owl House and Dead End, Paranormal Park
[deleted]
Seeing cisgender dudes post pictures of themselves wearing tutus and makeup, or young pretty girls with completely shaved heads. Just stuff that helps to weaken the binary <3
All those things honestly! I also really love getting complimented on my hair or makeup by girls that come in where I work. It's so sweet and makes me feel seen to some degree. 🥺
No.1 and No.3 are whole ass moods. Also, Stevonnie? Someone has good taste i see.
Things that bring me queer joy:

- loving and dating other trans people.  We understand each other’s bodies so innately, no matter what crazy thing we’re doing it feels so natural and real.

- i love seeing other trans people in the wild, and seeing each others beauty.

- i love it when kids stare at me in public, and i get to see the wonder in their eyes as they realize that there’s this whole new type of human.  i love it when kids ask me if i’m a boy or a girl, and when i say non-binary they’re *always* like, “okay” like it totally ain’t no thing.

- i love it that i have all of my emotions now!  That i’m _allowed_ to cry when i’m sad, and wear whatever the fuck i want because i feel like it.
This!
is the middle trans character lup from taz or are there more trans elves im unaware of
Najimiiiiiiiiii
seeing other people’s post-op top surgery pics! it gives me hope that I will get there too, one day :))
Yesss I love me some Double Trouble!!


Weirdly enough, stretching and being able to see my own armpit hair gives me complete euphoria. I spent so long shunning it that embracing it has been the single most validating thing I've done with my body so far.
In the most flattering way she looks like Rose Lalonde
I've seen some of your comics posted here and just have to say they always put a smile in my face! I love your art style
Literally me istg (except for the makeup one so far) lmao
I'm a comic book author myself and have been puting a lot of my gender euphoria on my pages. Loved the comic. I so can relate. Gonna start follow your work from now on :)
Comics like this always make me smile, so thank you kind stranger! 

Most recently though, getting complements on my side shave and people saying it really suits me and my personality. That makes me so happy I have to fight back tears sometimes. 

And finally, a smaller thing is wearing pride bracelets that I make. I’m in the closet around the majority of people in my life and know one really knows the pansexual, agender, or non-binary flag colors, so I wear them to bring myself a bit of extra happiness without having to fear being outed to others.
Miniskirts
Queer chicks in shows
Big hoodies that hide my curves
DT DT DT!!! I love them sm (and catra)
Having a day where my long hair is *just right* that I can glance in the mirror and think mmmm are you a hot guy or a hot girl, who tf cares 😎 

Or a nice baggy tshirt/jumper that erases all the dysphoria about my large chest so I can feel like a cool dude without having to bind my whole chest down and feel uncomfortable.

Chilling on the sofa with some beers watching f1 with my partner like ""one of the lads"".

And honestly my partner finding my jokes really funny and taking my opinions seriously as a complete equal. Like...something is wrong with a his PC so he asks me to fix it 😍 or he explains what work he is doing on his motorbike and I can help out.

Oh reminds, motorbike gear. Ahhhh sooo good to have massive shoulders lol
seeing other trans people happy brings me so much queer joy. also, for me, getting called stuff like dude, man, guy, etc or affectionate masculine terms.
Imagine being able to mistake yourself for hot
Literally the opposite of most of these but I'm glad y'all are feelin' it!
Oof I wish!
Finding clothes can be hard but when it clicks it’s a great feeling!!

Does anyone have suggestions on where to find hairbands like the first panel?  Working with a larger head has been giving me a headache!
I love Raine from Owl House!! Still need to see Dead End.
Yes Najimi Osana is their name and they’re great! I gotta check out Bugsnax now, I didn’t know that. Awesome!
Yes!! Love that!
I love that!! So affirming
Love this ❤️❤️❤️ thank you for sharing!
They're double trouble from she-ra (canonically non-binary, using they/them pronouns)
It’s Double Trouble from She Ra! They’re kind of a lizard lol
Awesome!! I’m sure you will :)
That’s so great for you!! Happy to hear that
Thank you :)
Yessss 💚
This made me smile! I’m so glad you have this 🧡
i haven’t seen she-ra and honestly i don’t think i ever will but it’s sick that there’s a canon nb character!
now that you say that, their character design does remind me of a salamander character i once had for a ttrpg campaign
It's the little things because I realised I'm too scared to have top surgery, too large to use binders properly, and get too much dysphoria when using bras etc that I have to use, otherwise, I'd hurt my back.

&#x200B;

So I've been having to find ways that work for me, and I know that means I look more femme than I want to most of the time, but those little things I mentioned help me get through the day.

&#x200B;

It is a little bit funny, to be honest that I often feel my most ""masc"" when I have put on make up and a dress. I think because I tend to go really heavy on the eye make up and a bit OTT with it. It's like I'm masc doing drag."	zcfe2u	NonBinary	2475	1.0	2022-12-04 17:16:28
Finding clothes that aren’t super masc as a 6’ 5” enby is tricky, but these two fits arrived today and I’m feeling a certain way 🧛🏻‍♀️ (they/them)		"May I please ask where you got your dress? I've been looking for something like that to try as my first dress 😅
As a 6'4"" NB, i recommend boiler suits/coveralls, they kill if you have some cute colours/designs and are tall-friendly. Also rompers!
Classic look: boots and a dress!
As a 6' AFAB I also recommend Long Tall Sally!
Those are great outfits! You look great in them 😁
You look awesome friend!
THOSE ARE SO CUTE ON YOU AAA
wow i love your style, you look amazing!!! i especially love that first look with the dress. I've always thought tall people looked super elegant, but I am 5'2 so I'm biased lol! anyway, you are absolutely rocking it, thank you for sharing!
You look amazing :) I love that style
the dress omgggg, you look like you write poetry is cafes and buy too many halloween decorations 🐈‍⬛
You look cool, and happy.. I picked up a cute dress from a charity shop last week and the label was Next ""tall"". Stuff is out there 😉😁
It sure is one huge journey through all the choices and how they look / feel / send messages! I am happy to spend the crest of my days enjoying fab outfits rather than  return to man-drab!  Every now and then I find myself smiling about how I'd much rather get home and put a pretty dress on instead of going crazy over football or something 🤣
you look incredible
You look great! I would recommend ASOS for you. They have a tall section
You look really cool!
i’m just 5’11” but even so finding dresses, especially short dresses, is such a struggle - a good half of the dresses i can find at stores make me feel like if i bend down someone is gonna see my entire butt! 😂🍑 you look wonderful 💕
I'm also 6'5"" and I feel this shit I almost always wear capris to make up for it
You look awesome 😎
You look amazing 😍
you looked so nice and elegant in that dress!
I love those outfits!!! You look super cool!
Didn’t think this would get so much attention - y’all are so sweet! 😭🖤

I like that first one the best. Maybe sandals or flats to tie it in?
Omfg those look soooo good!!
You look cute!!! I love your hair omg, and the dress really suits you!
Wowie you look great!!
You look so lovely. A  2nd slightly longer skirt under as a peekaboo layer would also be cute on you! Or those tights with kitty faces on the knees.
you look so cute! I love those tassel loafers!!
Wow wow wow! You are really speaking straight to my muted colour palette loving heart.
You look so cuuuute
Those pants are right for you. They look so good and I love the shoes.

What are those pants? 👀✨

Six feet tall here, and I highly recommend J. Crew's tall selection for cute dresses. I only really shop their sale section, but I think you'd find *some* good stuff there.
You look so huggable 🥺
You look amazing!
You look super cute!
Both of those fit you perfectly- omg incredible 💖
They look great on you!!! ❤❤❤❤
woaaah that dress is so so pretty!! 👗
I love the dress with the boots!!!
They look so cuute ❤️
UR SO CUTE
I’ve no idea why Reddit thought I wanted to see an activity notice for a guy wearing a dress but here we are. Side note, what is with all the acronyms in the comments? Are people really that desperate to belong  that they divide themselves into the smallest possible identity groups? You do realize that so long as you’re not a crazy person and you’re kind to others that human beings are generally pretty accepting of others? So how about not spending your lives identifying yourselves solely by your sexual preference or identity or whatever and shoving it in other peoples faces; and instead just be a good person, push yourself to succeed at whatever you set your mind to, and the rest will fall into place.
That second one is giving.
Cute!
you look incredible
those pants ARE INCREDIBLE
You look stunning
This looks really cute omg !!
WOW they look incredible on you!!
THE LOOKS!!!!! I love it
You look so adorable in that. I met my partner on [Men Nation](https://instantquote.app/men-nation), and you remind me of him. You share a similar sense of fashion.
ASOS! I believe it was one of the last ones, but they have a ton of similar options!
I’ve been meaning to get into coveralls! I have a pair of dickies, but I had to do a bit of tailoring to get them fitting right. Any brand suggestions?
I was so happy when they came back after their bankruptcy. They’re my go to for cute shoes for my massive feet.

I can’t say I write poetry, but definitely love a good Halloween decoration & I do have a black cat 🐈‍⬛
Thank you! Definitely feeling very happy in these 😌 There are def pieces for talk folk out there for sure! I have several midi skirts/dresses, but have had a harder time with shorter pieces like this. This one is long enough that my whole booty isn’t exposed, but short enough that I don’t feel like I’m speaking at the RNC lol.
That’s where I got both of these pieces from 😎
Yes!! it’s a balance between too long skirt where I look like I’m in a religious cult & too short where everyone sees everything 😅
I thought the same thing. Looks amazing!

I'm not the person you replied to but I HAVE to recommend Duluth Trading Company. Their overalls are amazing
No brands besides Dickies unfortunately, i have a set of short sleeve black Dickies that i roll up the legs into capris because their width and height things are a bit funky. I'm in the process of embroidering a big ghibli piece onto the back since it's got lots of blank slate to play with, which is fun if you're artistically inclined. Once I finish that I'm going to shop around for something that fits a bit better and paint some bones on it or something.
I think Lucy and Yak are really good! They do a bunch of styles and colours and are intentionally made for all genders. They're a bit expensive, but extremely comfortable!
Well then! Great! I don’t have more advice to you so once again looks great!

Oh boy I sure love pushing boundaries of my gender perception by looking at photos of cute enbys wearing gender-nonconforming clothes. Yeah, I hope I will be able to dress the way I want when I gain enough confidence.

Oh god oh fucc I forgot I live in the fucking Russia

P.S. very nice outfit btw. Suits you very well
The red is bold as hell and I'm here for it
The one with the red dress is pretty, elegant, and formal, but the black skirt and striped shirt looks just amazing. You yourself look amazing in both.
Both are super cute!
Omg these outfits are so good!!!! 👏🤗💖
Where do you get your shoes, they're great!
ngl you look fine as frick
Omg so cute!! I would totally wear those outfits, so on point
I looooove all of this. I am inspired to get a striped shirt like that now.

wow u look great in them!!!! they suit u very well
Those boots are awesome! (But my tastes run toward grunge, so thats what I latched on to first)
you look absolutely gorgeous in them. like they were made for you omfg.
OMG!!! You look absolutely AMAZING!
Oh my god you look amazing! Both outfits are amazing, but the red dress is bold as helll.

defo the dress!
You look so amazing in these outfits! Keep doing what you're doing!
Big like for the beard!
HECK YES, out here making 🔥
The one on the right has Daria and Jane vibes. I love all your pictures. I aspire to be a bearded skirted person as well. I was euphoric when I realized my beard had come in red! (I've spent my whole life dying my brown hair red/aubern.)
🍀🍀🍀
the silhouette!! absolutely killing it 💚💚💚
Both are looking great, but I'm with you, the red looks beautiful 0/
Both look fantastic!

It's adorable
Ahh they look excellent on you!!! I love the combo of the beard + the dress + leggings. It looks grand.

The outfit on the right compliments your frame so well!! I love that skirt on you
Omg you have amazing legs. Great fits :)
Agreed, you look really great in that red dress!! And the black skirt looks amazing on you as well!
I lovw that red dress!! Paired with the black it's so viberate!

I really love the striped shirt on the right :) May I ask where you got it?
You look absolutely lovely.
You're so stylish and confident!

I think I found my new favorite genre of clothing		"What is this glorious genre and how do I find it?!
My jaw and the floor are now very intimately acquainted  
  
What is this magic and where can I find it?! You look awesome!  
  
EDIT I see another comment with an answer, bye bye monies 👋🏼👋🏼
I'm so fucking here for this.

I've recently become enamoured with overalls, and dang, rompers and jumpsuits are climbing up the list.

My default 'style' has been ""whatever fits and is comfortable"" for so long, in a kind of standstill while I figured out my gender first. Now I'm figured out, it's expression time. ✨
Loving thisss 💖
absolutely Living for this
Ah you have reinvigorated my obsession with ""romphims"" thank you
Extraordinary style.
You look awesome!!
Mind blowing. Love it. Inspired. Wow!
Those are the best, I love them too
I love absolutely everything about this picture.😍
I love it! I also love your hair too!
OMG YOUR HAIR!!!! IS SO BEAUTIFUL.
Man that outfit is fly! it's such a great look for you!
I HAVE THE SAME ONE! I cut the back off mine and my partner bought one too so we’d match
That outfit is fantastic! Where'd you get it?
Looks fantastic on you!
Your arm tattoo 😍😍
Okay yeah this is too cool I think✨
I know the outfit is the star of this post, but lemme just say your hair is GOALS 🤩🧑🏻‍🦰
Everyone laughed at male rompers when they first came out a few years ago. I think they’re dope. I guarantee you they will make a comeback very soon
ROMPTHEM ROMPTHEM ROMPTHEM
I’m wondering if people with boobs can pull these off?
Aesthetic!
Ah yes. One of the best styles ever: your father trying a cool hip teen 

Mine is your father but goth lol
Excellent.
You look so cool!
You look so good!!
That’s amazing
i need this in my wardrobe.
Oh my god our inner fashionista is like,,,*screaming* right now of happiness: D
Fabulous
I LOVE rompers! I wish I could find ones to fit me!
L O V E I really want one now
I found this gem on romperjack.com, and I've seen some other fun ones like it on Amazon (I think the company is called Zesties?). It's the next step in enby evolution.
Yessss, overalls and jumpsuits and rompers all day! I even legit crocheted myself my own overalls 😂
💜
Me too, never felt so cool 😎
It's my rompthem :)
Thank you, you're too kind.
Thanks 😊
Haha thank you!!
Right??
Thanks! I just recolored so feeling extra fancy :)
Aw!!! Thank you 🥰
Haha thank you!! I'm legitimately in love. My entire wardrobe is about to become jumpsuits and rompers lol
That is so badass!!!!!
Thanks! Got it at romperjack.com they've got a bunch of awesome ones. And it's soooo comfy. I will say though that the legs/bottom run small (I'm AFAB so I don't quite fit the build of what they were going for) so I had to exchange my size As for a size L, but I still love it. 💜
Thanks 😊
Gotta Romp'em All!
I wore my binder with it, but there's definitely room for them- I had to get a size large to fit my hips, so there's plenty of space in the top part.
These are so cute! What’s the fit like?
I've been looking at romper Jack! I think this is the push I need to snag a couple, you look great!
Anyone remember ""RompHim"" https://www.romphim.com/
Oh yeah, I remember seeing those here earlier! How's the fit/comfort? 😊
Thank you for replying.  You look great.
The bottoms aren't meant for AFAB bodies, so I had to order a couple sizes up to be able to zip em closed haha! But it's super comfortable when you're get the size right
For the romper? Small in the butt/legs so definitely order a size or two up haha.
Oooh, good to know.

How's the fit on the crocheted overalls?"	nsdm8o	NonBinary	1989	1.0	2021-06-04 19:42:04

😭🙌🏾🙌🏾🙌🏾. The feeling is indescribable. Pure freeedommmmm.
how hard was the caring for the scars after the surgery?
Yesss!!! Do you have your date already???
Right after the surgery I was in a binder and was only responsible for my drains. A week after surgery I had my bandages removed and following that was when I started nipple care. That was fairly easy and I changed my dressings daily. I started my scar care at about 3 weeks post op which includes massaging bio oil and the gel on daily. The main thing is staying consistent. Hope this helps / answers your question. :)

Feeling the summer :3 (pls don't judge me for wrinkly clothing, all my fem clothes have to hide soooooo deep in my closet or I'd get kicked out of my home in a millisecond)		"Pretty!!
I love it! 

P.s if they ever do find them you might get away with saying they were a past girlfriends?
I think I just fell in love
One day you won’t have to hide anymore ❤️
If you get a steamer they are really easy to use and super helpful and way more ... Idk ""manly"" (house appliances are not gendered but you get it) compared to an iron. Make sure you use it openly on some of your other clothes as cover
I need that dress!
I love your outfit. I'm so sorry you need to hide it. I wish we could go out and enjoy the summer in the clothes you want to wear, you are rocking it!
Your clothes are super cute regardless of the wrinkles. And I’m the queen of wrinkly clothes so who am I to judge?
[deleted]
Love the outfit! It’s super cute 💙
Nah, your wrinkly socks are fine, you good and your look is also good.
you are so pretty!
I'm sorry you cant be your authentic self. I wish you love and light.
Aw you look great!
[deleted]
I love the socks
You look lovely!!

Pro tip for de-wrinkling: sneak the item into the bathroom with you when you shower, hang it up and let the shower fill the room with steam. It'll de-wrinkle at least a bit, then you can fold it and hide it under your towel or clothes to go back to your room!
Outfit is so good! Great laidback summer vibes ❤️
Very nicely coordinated, ready to go exploring in the woods! 😊
so pretty!!
And pockets!
Oh my your so pretty!
so pretty.
You look great :D
Cutie 🥧
You look gorgeous
so pretty aaa
Dresses with buttons and pockets > everything
you look so cute! jealous :)
Tbh wrinkly clothes are an enby mood, my clothes always look like they’ve been in storage for 6 years. You look so cute tho! That dress is absolutely made for you
That is a great style and you fit it very well!
With the wrinkles - it helps to roll the clothes!

That way they don't take up much space and you can still stuff them in the back, but usually rolled clothes don't get as squished.

You look great, and I hope you get to wear all the dresses you want in the future. <3
You look amazing! I wish I could pull something off like that 😭
SO! CUTE!
Wow you look really good! I know it might seem odd but I think the wrinkles add a little.. charming aspect to the outfit! I love it! 💞
You look awesome! Btw if you are worried about the look of your clothes, use  gallon ziplock bags and fold your clothes inside (preferably after being washed) and it may reduce some wrinkling or at least protect your clothing if you have to store it long term in a dark place. You can even put multiple zip lock bags inside a garbage bag or something more opaque.
I’m sorry you have to hide your true self, and I hope you get the opportunity to shine without fear from your family. My gf’s parents are homophobic and transphobic (I’m afab genderqueer) so I can relate.
So lovely !!!
Super cute dress
Omg legs 😍😍😍 you look amazing
I checked your profile and you look so handsome, get it king!!
🥺 thank youu
Oh, that's actually a good idea! I've only ever been in one relationship, but my gf stays over sometimes, so I could pretend it's just stuff she left around our place. Thank you so much! ❤️
Omg, thank you so much ❤️
It's sometimes hard to keep on hoping, but huge thanks for the reassurance :3
Ohhhh damn okay, thank you for the info! I'll look into it!
Also, hanging your clothes in the bathroom while you take a hot shower helps a lot. It's not perfect, but it'll get most of the wrinkles.

Another one my mom taught me, throw it in the dryer with a wet hand towel or similar for a few minutes. This takes longer, though
Me too. That is quite stylish. Oh and I love corduroy.
Thank you kindly! I'd totally be up for going to some chill café on a calm afternoon, I wish everyone in this subreddit could just go hang together lol
Aww, thank you, I'll try not to judge myself as much for it :3
Thaaanks ❤️
Thank you so muuch :3
Thank youu ❤️❤️
Awww, thank you so much!
Thank you! :3 (also your profile picture is cool as heck)
Thaanks, and I totally recommend it :3
That shade of green always feels so pleasant to me :3
Thank you! And I'll totally try that, I hope it works! :3
Thank youu, all of my outfits are put together in secret and with zero experience due to just wearing dysphoria hoodies and baggy jeans normally, this means a lot ❤️
Aww, thank you! I can go visit my witch-core girlfriend who lives in the forest :3
Thank youu <3
Thank you so much :3
Thaaaanks :3
Thank uuu ❤️
Omg, thank youu! I remember your posts here cause I was jealous of your dyed hair, this means a lot! ❤️
Thank you ❤️
Thank youuuu ❤️✨
100%
Haha, thanks :3
Thank you! I feel like it was such a lucky find, I don't usually have as much luck with second-hand shops. I guess wrinkly clothes squad unite :3
Thank you :3
Ohhh, I'll try that! I was usually trying to keep them flat, but in a space way too small to actually keep them flat, so it was just a mess. Thanks for the advice, and the compliment, I hope for that too :3
Aww, thank you! I totally think you could!
Thank youuu 🥰✨
Awww, thank you so much! That's such a cute and positive approach :3
I feel for you, friend. That strategy sounds very smart! And I should have no problem acquiring plastic bags, it's not the weirdest thing to have, thank you for the advice! <3
Thank youuu ❤️
Thank youuu ❤️
Awww, thank you so much! :3
aww, thanks!!
Do be sure to let the gf know about the plan! In case parents ask them.
I'm also a huge fan of buttons!

Edit: and POCKETS
Right! I wish we could all just have a huge hang out and chill and be who we are. Maybe sometime people could coordinate meet ups in places. I need more people I can feel comfortable around.
Seriously!! Just enjoy the euphoria you get from the outfits! ☺️
Aa thanks 💕
Same! It's my favorite color! Also I love the outfit like orange and green together in those shades is just chefs kiss
It's not always perfect, but it's definitely saved me before 😛
Dressed for the occasion! Appropriately, very enchanting 🔥
BEST vibe ever!!
🥺 you remember me?? Wow you just made my year I think
Of course
No problem :3 I used to have a very crammed wardrobe because I kept getting growth spurts until I was 21, and refused to give my stuff away because I loved it too much. I'm glad my hoarder experience is finally useful :'D
I KNOW RIGHT POCKETS ON DRESSES SLAP

Unfortunately, I got it second-hand, so it would be hard to track down the exact dress :((
Yasss, prime ""calm nature"" colour scheme
Haha, I checked your profile to make sure, and yup, you looked freaking awesome both with the green and the blue hair! Your cat is gorgeous too :3
Is this a Lucy&Yak dress?
Thank you!! It's been blonde for a bit I think you've motivated me to dye it again lol 
Darwin is my lil baby boy 😺"	oqu2fp	NonBinary	1610	1.0	2021-07-24 17:11:32
What’s our take on this?		"Yes. I would use makeup, in fact, I’d use MORE makeup because I see it as a form of self-expression and not a requirement for beauty. I hate “natural polite makeup” but that’s what I’m supposed to wear. I want wild facepaints, colors everywhere, bold eyeliner, I want more. 

Leg hair, I’m glad laser exists, but I would definitely stop shaving so often .
on the surface, sure. i agree that the cosmetics industry does prey on insecure people, usually women, and it's important to examine whether we do these things out of enjoyment or just because it feels like we ""should"". however these people are both TERFs -- number one has some cool ass stickers but also refers to trans people as 't words' lmao. number two posted a picture of a trans woman with the caption 'autogynephilia.' the message of *this specific post* is nice, but i don't trust either poster or their views on gender.
My wife and I have found this to be a point of conflict. 

She is a cis woman. She has grown up being *expected* to do these things, and has become tired and resentful of the expectation for many of them. She doesn’t always avoid them, but she hardly finds them empowering. If everyone stopped using them, I expect she’d find it no great loss.

I’m AMAB, transfemme-nonbinary. I grew up being *expected* to avoid these things, and punished socially if I didn’t. I have been empowered by them. If everyone stopped using them, I would be sad that it would make it that much harder for me to continue for myself.

It’s a point of conflict between us in as much as—even though we know this about one another—it’s easy to forget the other person’s perspective. Sometimes it’s hard for her to take sympathy in my joy, and hard for me to take sympathy in her frustration.

We keep that conflict check by remembering that feminism is in part about creating a world where everyone can be freed from the burden of gendered expectations. Both experiences coexist in harmony when such a burden is lifted.
Maybe shaving wouldn’t be as common, but men chose to shave/not shave. As for makeup, it’s absurd to imply that it wouldn’t still be a thing, I like makeup for the same reason I (and most people) like clothes, it’s self expression and it makes me feel nice.
The implicit assumption is that makeup and shaving your legs (?) imply self-hatred, and I think that assumption is super shaky, at best.
Hey, first time commenting! I'm a binary trans woman who just likes lurking and seeing all the cool enbies around! The two OG posters are for sure trans exclusionary radical feminists and I looked at the poster that shared it and they have a comment where they refer to neovaginas as ""surgically created holes"". So...kinda uncomfortable for sure.

Edit: also not a massive fan on how the OOP is fighting with women in the comments who like shaving and doing makeup by essentially saying they're coerced into doing so by society itself. 

I agree on how women are pushed into doing these through a patriarchal society. However, women should be able to choose without being told they're doing it simply for men and society. It removes their agency.
For makeup I probably wouldn't; I wear makeup to participate in something, not for the pure joy of it.

But I actually like the feeling of having hairless skin as an end in itself (if only my skin didn't attack me for it...)
I agree that the pressure on women to wear makeup whenever in public and to shave legs in particular in the summer is not at all a good thing. 

In a million ways, women are told they are not enough. And in order to be enough, they have to look good to other people. 

That is a toxic take. 

The NB take, it seems, would be to take from all genders what feels good. That is a healthier perspective. 

But women in our society are generally not fed that option, nor are they celebrated for making the decision not to shave legs and beautify.
I don’t shave or wear make up, but this message really doesn’t sit right with me. Some people genuinely enjoy shaving and wearing make up. It makes them feel happy. It’s a form of self care and love. It’s true that a lot of these industries prey on people, but it’s wrong to say that they exist purely because people hate themselves.
I don't really shave but I love my makeup. I didn't wear it for a few years but now I really enjoy it.
I actually started getting more into makeup when I came out lol.

Also props to our friend the other commenter for seeing that these were terf messages.
As an AMAB who's really in the bear subculture...

Everyone who finds me attractive thinks I'm hotter with a beard and body hair. It still makes me dysphoric.

Everyone thinks I'm hotter without makeup. I still love wearing it.

I shave my body and wear makeup because it makes me feel good, and for no other reason (amusingly, both my partners love my beard so much that my compromise is to bleach it instead of shaving).
I think the caption on the post is accurate re: how critical and exacting beauty standards are and how that feeds the beauty industry. But as for the questions in the image, I think that will be different by the person!
I hate this kind of messaging.  I've seen hair removal reduced to ""arbitrary beauty standards pushed by capitalists for profit"" in a safe trans space before and it made me uncomfortable.  Regardless of whether it is pushed by profiteering companies, disregarding it as nothing more than that invalidates/dismisses both my dysphoria and euphoria as nothing more than gullible consumerism.

The way I have felt about my body hair since puberty, and the way I feel when I see myself in makeup and nail polish are not up for others to dismiss as nothing more than marketing trickery.
Get shinigami-eyes. Both of these accounts will show up as TERF. The talking points (especially the first one) are also commonly used to be transphobic (trans women being objectified because they shave, but then the goalposts get moved and shaving is considered unfeminine, yada yada).

The point is built on a kernel of truth, which is what makes it sound like it could make sense, but you have to do the legwork yourself to make it make sense. What is implied with the “would you?” What is the actual question? Is it questioning social pressure to follow a status quo (through physical effort to look the same)? Is it asking about insecurity? Is it calling you a sheep for not dropping these habits? It’s very r/im14andthisisdeep to say “what if society was different, would you also be different?” like yeah, duh, to say you are in no way influenced by your surroundings is egotistical and vain at best.

To answer the question: what’s our take on what. They make no point. They ask no question. They vaguely wave at something and end it with a question mark.
I don’t like how people conflate the issues of capitalism and manipulative market tactics with people who just do shit that they like. It’s so black and white. Not every person who wears makeup has been brainwashed by the beauty industry. Not everyone who shaved or wears a bra hates their body. For a lot of transfems, this is GENDER AFFIRMING. 

It’s not feminism if it doesn’t consider ALL intersections and equality of ALL genders.
It's very black and white neolib white feminism. It ignores how many beauty standards are routed in racism and ableism. Like yes, these companies are preying on your insecurities, but where did those insecurities come from? We cannot divorce the ""choice"" to shave and wear makeup from societal pressures, but that doesn't mean people who do those things hate themselves or are bad feminists
Looked them up and the screenshot people are literally virulent TERFs.

This shit is basically dogwhistles aimed at trans women. By implying that gender performance is inherently taking an active role in your own oppression, a take one step removed from “she obviously wanted it in that outfit”, they imply that trans people are attempting to “infiltrate” womanhood.
I technically agree with everything stated, but this kind of messaging might easily lend itself to the false conclusion that makeup and shaving itself are the problem. That people should be shamed for using the one thing that helps them not feel bad in this world.
Gail Dines is a TERF
It ignores men and nbs who enjoy those things and consume those products (and many others, becsuse male beauty standards exist too), and also assumes women do those things because they hate themselves or because they feel they have to. Sure, some do. But many just enjoy it. And that's OK.
I think this is a super complex issue, and it's hard to unpack what we're doing for gender expression, and what we're doing because it's expected of us. Like trying to figure out, am I doing this because I want to or because it's expected of me is hard, and it's a long journey with a lot of misteps. I think for those of us between genders it's particularly challenging, because how do you know what nonbinary is even supposed to look like? It's all so different, because we're all so different. I think it's a long confusing process, and it's OK to be unsure where you sit with all of it.
Sometimes things feel nice tbh,as a trans guy/enby thats been really important with experimenting with makeup and shaving. Makeup is art and its freeing for some folks!!
Yeah the beauty industry is predatory but idk i don't think all of it is inherently bad. I feel like that's black and white thinking and very silly. Makeup has been around forever and its probably going to always exist even if patriarchy totally collapses. 

For me, I'm transmasc nb, I like makeup and i wear it essentially to play with color. Do i think it makes me look pretty? yeah i guess, but its more about expressing myself? A lot of the time i just wear it around the house. And i don't bother shaving at all. I like my body hair. 

Also fuck gail dines.
I think the original post/quote ignores the fact that there are other reasons to do those things besides hating yourself. I’m thinking mostly of makeup which some artists go really wild with in impressive ways.
I think the problem is that there can be a huge social pressure to shave your legs and wear makeup. But the flipped pressure to NOT shave your legs and NOT wear makeup is also fucked up. 

I have personally been made fun of a lot for my hairy legs when I was a child, and for a while that made me shave my legs to fit in. I also did used to wear makeup because I wanted to fit in and was insecure about my appearance.

Now I shave my legs if I want to (I do like how smooth they feel), and I only wear makeup when I feel like it. And I have learned that wearing makeup to cover my acne makes me feel ugly when I take it off, so I don’t do that anymore. 

But that balance of what feels right is a very personal thing. And just because wearing foundation everyday is detrimental to my mental health, doesn’t mean it is to someone else. So I think what’s missing is nuance. Everyone should do what they want. But it’s also good to be mindful of why you wanna do it.
Tbh I very rarely do either of these anymore
Just gonna touch on shaving: YES! 

I HATE hair anywhere on me except the eyebrows and top o' my head. And this isn't because I don't like how it looks, it's because body hair feels TERRIBLE. If I were trapped in a space ship floating through empty space, destined never to see another human again I still wouldn't like how hair feels and would want it GONE.
To me the worst part is implying that fitness is a thing people do because they hate their bodies when actually exercising is one of the most important things you can do for your mental & physical health.
I mean.....

I can answer yes to the shaving question with no hesitation. Body hair is not a pleasant sensory experience for me and I feel better when I'm smooth just about everywhere except my underarms (which is the thing I don't shave).

And as for makeup, I only wear it when I am feeling fun/costumey anyhow, so yes I think my habits would be similar if not quite the same.
I'm sorry the clothing industry? Seriously? Like, seriously? People would still need clothes, even if they loved their bodies. Like seriously WTF?
Not Non-Binary but Transfem, I find both can be validating and euphoric, makeup and the stuff they are talking about can be good or bad it depends. Fat shaming people to go to the gym- bad, someone wanting to go to the gym so they feel better about there bodies/ get buff because they want to be not told that they have to be- good
No one should feel like they have to wear makeup. But we shouldn't condemn those who want to. Personally, I like having the option of a mascara stache. Or covering up my acne for a night out. I don't wear makeup most of the time, but I'd be upset if someone told me I shouldn't for the same reason I'd be upset if someone told me I should. Similar ideas about societal dress codes and controlling what others wear in a different package. Enforcing preferences is what leads to the oppression the image-maker wants to avoid.
The cosmetic industry is the only one they listed that is an overwhelming majority of women, everyone wears clothes, tons of men go to the gym, and what even is a diet industry?
These tired goofy ass TERFs always dropping these “gotcha” takes that completely ignore the history of cosmetics and hair removal that long predate the exploitative capitalist hellscape of false dichotomies we’re all forced to live in. Tell me you’re examining beauty and gender through a white colonial lens without telling me you’re examining beauty and gender through a white colonial lens. Just can’t with these morons.
If gender as a concept was just removed from society that would be pretty swag
people can make the choice to use makeup, shave,
or look a certain way. nobody forces them to. im tired of seeing the same beauty standards but that doesnt mean im gonna change myself to look like that. capitalism is a problem but we also need to take accountability for what we participate in - thats the biggest “fuck you”. ill be myself & thats good enough for me. beauty standards do not affect me
This gives me “not like the other girls” vibe and I really hate that.
I already don't do either one. :P The last time I shaved my legs and put on make up was for a specific photo shoot.
Just saw this elsewhere and thought of it from trans/envy perspective. Which I hadn't before. Used to be vehemently anti-makeup. Understand it more now. Thanks for posting here.
Nah, I like feeling slippery smooth. Plus for some reason it hurts when I don’t. And I just don’t wear makeup anyway except special occasions. Nobody has ever commented except one shitty boss. Do you.
It's complex! I think humans have used all these technologies of altering and adorning our bodies - cosmetics and shaving, movement and clothes - for a really long time, so I believe that yes, we/some of us would still be using them even if there was no cultural or social pressure to do so. Similarly, we would still be caring for our health and fitness and be looking to style our clothes. In a world without corporations dictating these things, I think different forms of norms or conventions would arise in time, likely less facilitated by marketing and corporate interests and more by what people like/pass around in their groups, but they would perhaps be more flexible and amenable to change through our own communities and would likely be less exploitative and more participative.
This is underestimating the people who just genuinely enjoy these things. I hate body hair. It has nothing to do with society telling me what does and doesn't look good (especially as a AFAB.) I wear pants, never wear tank tops, and I'm sure as hell the only one seeing my bikini area. Still shave my legs, underarms and cooch (unless I'm being lazy.)

I go out without makeup probably 360 days of the year, if not more. I still choose to buy it and wear it when I feel like it. 

Of course the industries thrive more because of people's insecurities, but it's not these things would never sell if you got rid of everyone's insecurities.
i think i would still shave because i just don’t like having body hair 🤷but i think i would be a little bit more confortable having body hair if nobody else was doing it..
If nobody wore it, it would be very expensive and so I wouldnt be able to afford make-up lmao
Considering make up and waxing dates back to 6000 bce in Egypt done by both men and women, the first to appease gods and the second to avoid lice: yes. 
I mean I just shave my chin. But yes.
I had this job I hated in Texas before I was out as NB (am AFAB). My mom said I had seemed so happy at that job. How I’d gotten all dressed up and wore makeup. & I had to tell her no I actually hated that job but I had to do that makeup and shit because it was expected in order to look “”presentable”” at that job per my direct superior. Despite it wasn’t customer facing and I was in a tiny cube face to a computer screen. 

I hated it and it made me feel cheap and sleazy to have to do so much. After almost a year I asked for a 25c raise as I was paid under min wage & this would get me there— and was fired on the spot. I was doing the work of four people doing a real estate / ad book, creating all the ads and the layout. 

I’m absolutely still crushed about the things that were left at my desk that I never got to retrieve. But because I had to cake on makeup, my mom thought I was happy. Super gutting, tbh. 

It took me a lot of years to readjust my relationship with makeup in order to enjoy fucking with it.
If no women did it, I would still have sensory sensitivities and not be comfortable wearing pants with unshaved legs.
Honestly I Don't Think I'd Just Suddenly Start Liking My Leg Hair If Nobody Shaved Their Legs. I've No Qualms With Being The Only Person In The World Who Shaves Their Legs I Just Want To Get Rid Of It! (Which Unfortunately I Currently Can't As I Neither Have A Razor Nor Know How To Use One :<)
My leg hair is itchy, I'd probably still shave it. That said, I only started shaving because people started pointing out that it was long and ""gross"" and it made me insecure.
I already don’t shave my legs. I never understood the point because it doesn’t fit my aesthetic. I dress for me. And that includes all body mods and what hair is and is not shaved.
i shave my armpits because i dont like having hair there, and i like to wear glitter makeup because ooo shiny eyelids

but i’m also not the target demographic for those products
I shave due to sensory issues. I use makeup because it’s fun and it helps cultivate the look I actually want to present to the world and myself in my own photos. Compulsory beauty is terrible, yes, but the OPTION for these things is much appreciated.
Like everything, hair removal and makeup should be a choice. 
E.g. since I was a teenager I (afab) have had dark hair on my upper lip and was teased for it a lot in school. The older people in my family encouraged me to remove it because it isn't ""feminine"" but I didn't want some teenage boys to win. 
Now I'm 23 and have been in a stable relationship with a man who makes me feel beautiful every day. I have also decided to get laser hair removal on my upper lip FOR MYSELF. Because I can afford it and I view this as an act of self love. Not because I feel ugly and think I would look better without a ""moustache"" but because I just thought ""why not"". That's the ideal scenario for everything.
I have tried not shaving my legs, and the pain from the hairs catching the inside of my trousers always has me shaving about once a month. Underarms? No pain, no shave, but I do trim occasionally. 

Makeup I wear only when going out for goth night, and I prefer the Floki/Lagertha inspired viking battle look, so I'm certainly not trying to look pretty. ""Fearsome and not to be trifled with"" is my goal, so the makeup industrial complex can operate, or not, and that hardly affects my life. 

I make it sound so breezy but obviously it took a while to get here.
For shaving it's a 50/50 for me personally.

If other people didn't shave I never would have thought to try or realized that I do enjoy having no body hair (for myself). 

When I first started shaving it was because I wanted to fit in since everyone else was, it was my original motivation.

Now though, I don't shave for conformity but because I enjoy it for myself.

I have some sensory things and having hair on my body can be really annoying for me, making it really uncomfortable. When I'm hairless it feels nice for me and the discomfort is gone. 

I don't think body hair is unhygienic, I just don't personally want it. 

When it comes to make up, I usually don't do it.

I don't like it very much and will only do it for special events (not even then all the time). 

I like special effects makeup because it's fun. Besides that, if I do makeup it's just a little bit of eyeliner without the wing, maybe mascara and lip balm (which I wear anyways). 

Shaving and makeup should be left up to the individual to decide whether or not they want to do it and there shouldn't be judgement or pressure either way.

If someone doesn't want to shave? Good for them. 

Someone wants to shave? Also good for them. 

Someone wants to wear a full face of makeup? Lovely. 

Someone wants to wear no makeup? Great. 

We're all individuals with different needs and interests. As long as people are happy doing what they're doing and no one's being harmed, all the power to them ❤️
Because you know, there isn't anyone else who shaves any part of their body, or wears makeup for any reason-

This is just more TERF bs trying to tell women and people in general what they can or can't do. 20 bucks says these same women would look down on anyone with a huge wooly beard or a large port wine birthmark on their face that they chose not to cover with makeup.
Cosmetics should be there for those who want them, but no one should feel pressured into needing them.
Seems like a terf Trojan horse. As if to say that if women had the same attitude towards beauty as men, trans women would somehow not be able to claim womanhood. Maybe I’m overthinking this.
Let people do whatever they want, you want to wear make up wear it, you want to shave body parts do it. Or don't if that makes you happy. The idea that somehow feminists cannot do anything deemed ""girly"", and for that matter that non-binary people have to be androgynous or masc presenting, should have died out in the 80s
I'm pretty sure the poster is a terf. I don't disagree with it though, neoliberal commodification of everything is disgusting.
I like shaving my legs. Not a societal obligation for me. I just like smooth.
I don't shave my legs but I do wear makeup when I feel like it and have the time. I think of it as a tool to express myself. I definitely fell victim to the belief that makeup would make me pretty and feminine and therefore accepted by people but it doesn't matter what other people think if I don't accept myself first.
Literally do whatever the fuck you want as long as you're doing it for you, because it makes you happy, and not because of someone else. (Also as long as it doesn't hurt you or someone else.)
Sexism hurts everyone, not just women, but also men and nonbinary people.
Idk if this fits here, but I’m more on the transmasc side of NB but I frequently shave my legs because I like the texture. I don’t wear make up quite as much, but I’ll accessorize or do other things to make myself feel cute. Fuck capitalism, but I’m not going to stop working out or doing things to make myself feel good to be anti.
feels misogynistic. there's no wrong way to be a woman, regardless of personal relationship with shaving or makeup. same is true for enbies, there's no wrong way to be an enby.

the fact that they're terf shitheads is just icing on the cake
Sexist bullshit. One example of what shit people do in the name of feminism. If you're about  equality you don't think those are used by women only.

People have many reasons why they choose to be in the weight they are.

In what reality only reason to go to gym is look pretty?

I shave around my genitals because I want to see them. I'm way too lazy to shave somewhere else or make up. Others can give ideas but they don't do anything to my decision. I go to gym because you can't be boxer if you're physically unable for it. You can't just read a book and know things in theory. I bulk or cut when my trainer says so. I am naturist so I would love to be naked in summer. In winter that would be deadly.
I think it's describing one part of the truth as tho it is the only truth. Industry does all of these things, but also every human culture has self-decoration in some form, sometimes very strong and intense self-decoration, with no capitalist motive.   


And either way, you might not want to play along, and if you don't wanna, you maybe shouldn't.  


And either way, you might want to play along, and if you wanna, you maybe should!
How would women liking their bodies put the clothing industry out of business? Are they saying we'll all just live the rest of our lives naked? Like even if somehow we all decided we want to do that, that's hella cold in winter and is gonna increase risk of sunburn in the summer.

Also, gym industry? Working out isn't always (just) for looks. Like, I work out so as to prevent my knee from getting any more damaged resulting in me no longer being able to walk. No matter how much I like my body, I'll still need to keep training if I wanna be able to walk.
Cosmetics have become an art form. Just do whatever makes you happy yah know
I don't understand the rules on that sub. 


>Good comment: I still shave because  I struggle with feeling less feminine if I don’t.

>Bad comment: I shave because it makes me feel best.

>This forum expects more than “I am a woman and I chose this therefore it’s feminist/OK/without implications”


Am I stupid or something?
Dude I want steel fangs,  like would the large scale of the industry go down sure but women in prison use Kool-Aid for makeup so like it's honestly a personal thing so like eh
Yeah, I don't think I'm really insecure that my eyelids aren't naturally black with purple glitter. Oh these standards 😩
id probably still use makeup because i like how i look in it, and i love the look of body hair on me but hate the feeling so i *have* to shave (sensory disorders suck ass) a lot of things like diet industries would die but i don’t think makeup would because, for so many, it’s so much more than making yourself look “better” but it’s an art. (and honestly maybe working out would be more targeted at strength? it’s something many girls stray away from because men criticize muscular afab bodies sooo heavily)
I've seen radfems post this if that tells you anything, so my reaction may be a bit muddied by that, but i think it's still safe to say it's not that great of a post. Like, yes, capitalism is insidious and will market in any way it can. That's the real problem, not cis women who want to shave cuz they just like the feeling of it or cis women who want to wear make up for themselves or for fun. Anytime a post blames cis women using their own autonomy to engage in something totally consensual, I have to question why and what the person's reasons are. Most of the time they're angry at the wrong thing, ie, cis women in porn/sex work 'objectifying themselves' (have literally seen radfems say they're begging to be raped. Um fucking ew.) and not the typically cishet men who don't understand porn is acting and not an automatic 'yes' from every woman. Also, make up has been around for...a long time. Well before it was marketed to cis women exclusively. The entire acting industry would probably be able to support it itself even if all western women stopped using it lol. Don't get me wrong, I'm all for body positivity for women, but many women just enjoy these things for themselves, not because they're doing it for anyone else, and to call that bad just seems misogynistic to me.
That aint wrong but destroying the businesses wont help. Destroying the stereotypes is the way to go. We should be allowed to choose when to shave and when to be hairy. It just gotta be depending on the individual's choices not society's expectations
These people are both TERFs, so their opinions are invalid.
I already don't do make up despite everyone using it. I never got the hang of it and I don't care. Very rarely when I feel like it, I put on some lipstick or simple eyeshadow and that's it.
I like this image, and its absolutely true that a huge amount of women would not do either of these things if there wasn't a market capitalizing on their insecurity and on patriarchal beauty standards. This is not to shame women who do wear makeup and shave, or to say that makeup cannot be used as a form of artistry, but I genuinely wish more women would seriously interrogate their relationship to beauty and the beauty industry. 

I'm making an effort to stop shaving despite it being something I was taught to do in order to be attractive my entire life. Funniest reactions I get are when women describe it as a ""political"" thing for me to do and say they wish they could stop shaving. Why are certain people's bodies existing in their natural state considered political?
I grew up with the expectations of a woman. I shaved because that's what was expected of me and was shamed otherwise. Makeup was something I felt like I needed to learn, like a life skill and I felt as though I was ""behind"" because I could never get the hang of it. 

Does the cosmetic industry and the patriarchy prey on women's insecurities? Absolutely yes as it is a means of control. Can we still do these things for ourselves? Also yes. After growing out of these expectations, and fighting through the deep-rooted insecurities, I now know what my cosmetic preferences are.

I haven't shaved in like 4 years, and while this is partially due to lockdown, I had already started to not shave my arms and upper legs beforehand. Plus I was 15 at start of lockdown so obviously I still had a lot of self discovery to do regardless. I rarely do makeup due to sensory issues but I wish I knew how to eyeliner because that is cool as fuck.

ETA: Makeup can be so gender euphoric at times. I like presenting feminine sometimes but it sucks because I am perceived as a girl. I want to be fem in a gay way
I do agree that much of capitalism is dependent on women hating themselves 

And I think it's a fair question to ponder if you'd do it if it wasn't expected of you.
i’d shave my legs because i hâte body hair, i’d do my makeup because i find an odd sense of masculinity in a bit too much eyeliner. hell i might use a bit more makeup and shave a bit more for the sake of self experession rather than it being seen as something i should do since i’m afab. idk though i’m lazy af
I have never shaved my legs (too much work, shaving my face is already annoying enough) and dislike makeup (I think it's a sensory issue mostly).  Probably helps that my sister growing up didn't shave her legs or wear makeup so I don't see it as a part of femininity.

But if you were to add heels into the mix, I have a love hate relationship with them.  I feel drawn to them but fee like they make stand out more than I want due to height and the sound they make. But if no one else wore them would they even appeal to me anymore?  Probably not.

But that is why I gravitate towards non-binary, I just pick and choose what I like and avoid what I don't without regard to gender norms.
Yes I would still do both. Makeup is fun like art. I don't use it to cover insecurities not that I think theres anything wrong with that but for me its a form of self expression. I also just prefer myself hairless I just think it looks better and its a personal thing I don't feel pressured to shave.

But there's definitely a huge issue with Americans shaming women for not shaving and even have friends that were pressured at work to start wearing makeup.
The fact of the matter is marketing's entire function is to convince the target market of it's product that they have a problem. 

And the only solution is Product ™ - yours for only $999.99!

Unilever, the same company that owns Axe with all its problematic ads, also owns Dove.

Rainbow capitalism exists not because of corporate acceptance or genuine pride. ""Her-she"" chocolate, Green M&M - don't get me wrong, I like those especially because conservatives cry for a whole news cycle about it - aren't really authentic.

It's just not doing it is less profitable.

I remember a Financial Times article once that examined a retiring, childfree couple's retirement plans. FT's article claimed - among other frivolous charges - that the couple *needed* to buy the newest SUV model every 5 years. For ""security"".

Capitalism relies on something that transcends gender - but does disproportionately affect women and minorities: insecurity and fear.
I recognised the OP. She's a well known transphobe and anti sex worker sticker maker on Tumblr.
As a trans non binary person and sex worker from the UK, I don't think content from those who oppose my existance should be given a platform . Regardless of whether their takes sometimes make sense they are ultimately still promoting a radfem ideology and therefore dangerous narrative.

Thanks for reminding me that I gotta teach myself makeup. Thay shit looks amazing on people and I wanna look cute. (And confuse people even more than a beared person in a skirt already does)
I mean people will still be shaving their legs and wearing makeup. Just out of personal freedom than following any social pressure.

Makeup will still be used in theatrical performances and to make the characters more animated. People will shave, but only if they feel their own personal discomfort with it as opposed to trying to look feminine or whatnot (I say this as someone who still feels itchy with body hair).

We just won't make a fuss about shaving or makeup. Like if a person chooses to do it, let them. We see no reason as to why people should or should not do something based on some dumb rule.
Patriarchy and capitalism play rule in this. Patriarchy have always created beauty standards and gender roles and push them on women to show dominance and control, so women always feel obligated by those roles and then by time they became normalized, such as body shaving; and then by the rise of market, capitalism toke advantage of that and started creating products with persuasive advertises to convince women to buy them. Also, body hair shaving is a westernised/colonized idea, as body hair was considered normal in many cultures like Persian.
Ultimately whatever makes you happy and comfortable is most important. 

I saw someone else say it was TERFy and I agree, all or nothing mentality leans into TERF mentality and the ""we hate men"" mentality. 

I personally am AFAB and look pretty feminine but I don't participate in shaving or wearing makeup unless *I* want to. It has a lot of trigging things for me about it. And at one point in time I felt this way about these activities. But I've seen a lot of makeup artist videos and them just having fun and enjoying it. And although I know I don't enjoy it, it doesn't mean others don't. 

Capitalist industries most definitely perpetuate gender, gender roles and push gender conformity. That shit I hate. The pink tax is real. 

I would encourage you to look into intersectional feminism. Basically it comes down to the patriarchy harms everyone. Intersectional feminism ideals include everyone, trans, Non-bianary, men, women, POC. Ultimately it's human rights. People should have the right to live their life the way they choose.
I am angry bc a lot of products contain ammonium salts, chlorides, n stuff. Which PPM is ""fine"" but logically I cannot move past the fact that i *know* what I am being dosed with a lot of these coming from many sources, beauty products being one. I try to get the cleanest stuff I can find, but at the end of the day my power as a consumer is limited and does not help everyone else. The only way to fix it in my mind is to destroy the systems which perpetuate it, and to demand accountability in the production of these things. 

Some stuff would probably still exist after the destruction of capitalism (like makeup, shaving, etc) -- but wouldn't be marketed or culturally enforced in the oppressive ways that it currently is. 

You know. They make you feel like you gotta fix yourself with products, keep consuming snd giving them money, but also fill the products with shit and exploit the workers as well.

The last bit about boycotting -- It is true that if we all woke up tomorrow and decided to boycott all beauty products, it would have an effect on the industry. However, there are people with valid reasons for using products, and it feels unfair to them to take them away. Beauty products existed before capitalism. 

I think this dips a little into consumer culture in general. I think there is a point where you can buy into it too much for sure. For myself, I feel like I got tricked into buying stuff (like certain anti-frizz products) that is not very good for me or the environment.
I’m staunchly anti capitalism (I do like wearing makeup I think it’s fun) I deeply approve of this message.
obviously it's right. you'd have to be either an idiot, or someone who's never experienced misogyny as a woman to think otherwise.
i would still shave for hygiene and i wouldnt feel pressured to put on makeup
I think it s a good opening to discuss gender and everything that it implies. Even without society I d still like to shave though. I think it depends for everyone
 Not me tho i see makeup as art and i’m very passionate abt it
I would wear lipstick and stuff even thought no one wore it, It's fun to do make up and stuff like that, Especially with purple and black, you can express yourself in your own style with make up and i think that is what makes me like it so much
I probably wouldn't shave, I already don't shave my legs but my underarms I started and they get to itchy if I don't
I'm already beautiful, this stuff just makes me even more beautiful
I still wouldn't shave or wear make up. The last time I wore makeup was at prom and I didn't want to wear makeup then.
I don't usually wear makeup cause I am lazy and it's gonna get washed away eventually over the day. I only do it to be fancy, like for a date or special occasion. The only pressure I have is my mom who insisted on me wearing makeup on some occasions. I really don't like being Fakeuped
Shaving is fantastic for my sensory issues and makeup is art but I wear it on my face, I do them because I like them not because I'm told I'm ""ugly"" without them
Yes because hairs are gross

And no because makeup confuses me
I agree on the fact that no one should have to shave or use makeup, but if someone likes makeup, that’s valid too. The shaving one is more of a grey area, as it isn’t exactly an art or a hobby like makeup is.
I don't normally wear makeup unless I want to dress up. And I don't shave my legs or pits unless they start to bother me. I'm an afab gender queer and I hate gender norms. My husband is the hairyest mf I know and if he says ""you should shave your legs"" I laugh at him and tell him it's my body. I like a clean shaven feel and look though. I've tried both and I just like it better smooth...personal choice. Though I don't shave for other people. Wanna go swimming and havent shaved? I'm still going haha people have an issue with hairy pits in a bikini they can go cry its my body.
Basically I feel like being NB allows me to pick and choose what I want to engage in. I don't shave my legs but I do wear makeup! That's just what feels right for me!
I'm not doing either, never did (afab btw, so it was actually ""expected"" for me) but I'm considering trying make up for self expression
Regarding shaving - I only did it because my mom tought me to do so and made comments if I hadn't shaved. At one point I realised I don't need to, so i kinda stopped, now i shave sometimes when I'm in the mood, but not regularly (also I like to keep warm during winter :D). I admit, I like the shaved look, but I've never actually had anything against hairy body parts. As long as you have good hygene, who cares if there's hair on your body.
Regarding make up - never wore it. I used to be a dancer, so I wore make up for competitions, but stage make up is something completely different from every-day make up. Nowdays I sometimes put on a crazy shade of lipstick or eyeshadow when I go to a party, but that's it.
I don't do it because of sensory issues, I literally cannot stand the feeling of it, but I'm not gonna just others for doing it
I shave, but I don’t put makeup on
A better question is if there was no pressure to do this would you. No one doing it may be active deterent to not feel completely out of place. I don't do either but it's not feminist to imply women only do these things to attract others. It is feminist to instead point out that it's fucked up that unaltered feminine bodies are considered inately unfeminine.
I never *hated* myself even as a woman. I wore makeup mostly to cover my complexion because I personally wanted more uniform skin and disliked my acne-scarred natural appearance. After coming out though, I cut my hair, quit wearing as much makeup, and quit shaving my legs (AFAB here) as experimentations in my non-biased expression. It answered questions for me about how my expression changed with my now open identity. I’m still wearing light makeup because I like it and wanna play up my eyes, but I’m not shaving my legs anymore and my showers are SO much shorter. For some that never question why they shave their legs or wear makeup except to fit a beauty ideal, that’s not inherently wrong either but only they can answer if they’d be happier NOT doing it. 🤷🏼

TL;DR: for me, it’s always been about what I liked but marketing is a powerful magnet.
I agree, I do those things when I want to for myself and no one else, and it took me a while to get to that point.
Hall yea I would!! It's all bullshit anyways! We just think it's wierd because we were told to think it's wierd!
I will. Never. Ever. Give up my eyeliner. Other than that, the makeup industry can suck it. Gotta have my eyeliner though. Call it guyliner if you want. It’s the 90’s babe in me.
AFAB here, I don't do either. I tried to, though, as a teen, just to fit in, and the disphoria was freaking overwhelming. HOWEVER! everyone should be able to present whatever way they want. If the signifiers of femininity, that feel like trappings to me, feel empowering to you, go for it.
I don't shave my legs.

I wear make up rarely, like... randomly or on special occasions.
Yeah, it's very much true.

I would still shave and do my makeup tho
No, I wouldn't shave (and I don't) and yes because makeup is a creative and artistic thing for me. I don't wear it to look ""presentable"" but I'm also not a woman.
I already only wear makeup because I like it. I make my eyebrows match each other and do eye makeup because I like how it looks. I also don't do eye makeup because I also like how none looks.

Shaving my legs is a different story. I only do that out of fear of judgement at this point. If no one shaved their legs, I wouldn't. At least not until it gets to a certain length - tight pants and long leg hair don't mix.
Liking my body is the reason I go to the gym. To look after it.
People like to feel smooth and express themselves creatively with makeup. Style and fitness aren’t exclusively held up by patriarchy. Does patriarchy pressure people to look a certain way, yes absolutely. There is a pressure for women to be fit and pretty to be appealing to men, and for men to be fit to protect women. However, people’s desires go beyond that, and these industries don’t have to be defined by this pressure.
I mean, I don’t do either already… but it’s nuanced
Idk I never did despite being AFAB 😐
Makeup is art for my face. 

I think a lot of people would wear it, regardless of industry pressure.
I’m fairly indifferent to makeup, but as for shaving? The whole “body hair is gross” idea got warped in my mind and backfired on me. I don’t like body hair below the neck on anyone, not even cis men.
I already don't wear makeup because it makes me uncomfortable, and as for shaving, I do it rarely. The only time I shave is when I wear something that exposes my arms or legs and even then, it's only because ""gIrLs WhO dOn'T sHaVe ArE gRoSs"" and I'd rather not have to explain to people that I'm transmasc and feel comfortable with my body hair.
I no longer shave but I do still wear makeup!
i just read a social commentary on media peer pressure regarding shaving.  fashion continued to show more skin :  specifically Gillette targeted women to be 'civilized'  .  while I refuse to allow society to dictate body hair,  the claws are sunk deep.  maybe bc I had an elder sister & mom both leg shaving constantly.  On principle I dont shave but I admit Ive got Stockholm Syndrome -  I shave my legs before the beach.  and hate the psychology behind it
I like the feel of smooth legs and makeup looks cool. (funny enough though I don't shave my arm pits)
I feel like the idea that women or fem presenting people *need* to shave or it's ""unhygienic"" is deeply rooted in dehumanization of women and pedophilia. 


There's nothing wrong with shaving if it makes *you* feel good, and it's very hard to step outside of the expectation society places to be hairless, but I feel that body hair needs to continue to be normalized, because it is, in fact, normal and perfectly healthy and as hygienic as any other body part. 



In short, do it for you if you want but never be ashamed of your humanity.

And a counter question: if you'd never been taught having body hair was wrong, would you still trouble with removing it?
Only occasionally, for fun. One of the downsides of capitalism is that it encourages businesses to create and enforce needs to sell product, which obviously wastes time, energy and material on something no one wanted until they did.
honestly, the euro-centric standards has taken over the makeup industry, so although makeup has a been a right of passage for many cultures, we are just a small portion of who's actually using makeup.
my hot take: fuck off anti cropos, i wanna look pretty for my gf :)
I do think that these industries and trends profit off telling women that they're gross, unprofessional, or unattractive if they don't do these things. For me, stopping wearing makeup was empowering because I only did it because I felt like I needed to.

But there's nothing wrong with these things in general. Some people do like having smoother, hairless skin. Some people enjoy wearing makeup as a form of self-expression. The issue, I think, is that there's a disparity in who is exposed to these options and the social costs of not conforming. There are probably a lot of men who would enjoy wearing makeup or shaving their legs if they weren't discouraged from doing so, and there are a lot of women who only do these things because they're taught it's what women are supposed to do. And trans people (binary and non-binary) can experience additional pressures related to their gender expression, as well.
It's true
It’s not 100% wrong lots of modern industries arose from marketing saying you’re repulsive if you let your body be natural. But that’s marketing, fashion arises from creativity too so cosmetics would still exist, shaving maybe less popular but self grooming is still a comfort thing for practicality. Basically the industry would still exist but it might be less guilt trippy. Also men are subjected to this stuff too it’s not just a women thing.
The was exactly the conclusion I came to with shaving. I still shave my armpits because I don't like how the hair feels and my deodorant is FAR more effective without the hair. My legs? I realized that the only reason I ever shaved them was because it was expected of me. My showers go a lot quicker now.
I haven't shaved in years but makeup yeah I probably would. If makeup didn't exist but face paint did I'd probably use face paint. I like dying my hair and adding extra stuff like makeup
I don’t shave my legs but I sometimes wear makeup. I don’t care what other people do. I just don’t want to be shamed for not shaving anything.
""If nobody else wore jewelry, would you?"" Yes! Because it looks good!  
I like my pretty little rocks and tiny bits of shaped metal. Is the jewelry and mining industry massively exploitative? Yeah, obviously. Is it propped up by a dependency on folks hating themselves? No! People just like pretty things, and things that let them express themselves.  


I like my painted nails. I enjoy the ability to add adornments to my body, the artistic creativity it affords me is fun! The beauty industry isn't getting my money because I hate myself, it gets it because it has a monopoly on tools I want to use (although I do generally favour smaller indie companies with ethical practices and ingredients, I do what I can).  


The whole sentiment of this post is just drawing false exaggerated conclusions that don't even apply to women, let alone everyone else who do these things.
People have always decorated themselves and I don’t see why they’d stop just because a certain exploitative economic system would hurry up and fall. It would be nice keep on enjoying it even if I had to make a little kohl and something with a darker red and something that evened out skin for no other reason than the enjoyment of it.
I stopped shaving 6 years ago and identified as cis. I didn't have an issue dating, infact the attractiveness of the men I dated went up exponentially. Nobody needs to shave if you don't want to and society will get over it eventually.
I just noticed that my answer there can actually also fit as gender parallel ... and I stand by it =):
I never really liked make up, but worse I had a ""not like other girls phase"". I had to learn that it's not the likes or dislikes, the way that people like to dress or present themselves that I hated but how they hurt me, how they made fun of me and how they actively caused me harm. I once hated people who wore make up. I thought they were superficial, putting on an act and only pretended to like it through social pressure and while that can be true for someone, I'm not a mind reader so shouldn't have made such bad faith assumptions.

So my take is this: Make up is a form of expression, some like it some don't and there are many styles same as clothes. 

The key words here are: like, choice and freedom.

 A person has to decide if that's something they like. Same as an odd hobby the person might not know if they like it before trying or getting good at it which leads to the...

...choice that there exist options to choose from that are available to that person to find what they like but include...

...the freedom to wear and like and to not wear and dislike make up. There shouldn't be shaming and hate in either direction. No discuss towards those who don't cover up skin flaws and no bad mouthing and looking down on those who like to wear lots and special make up.

It's face paint and part of someone's aesthetic and style and same as I had to learn not to assume someone was an awful superficial person because they looked like people I made bad experiences with, the same we have to acknowledge that it isn't the make up we have an issue with, but we have an issue with publicly shaming, hurting or harassing those who personally don't like it. We dislike that behavior and not a product someone else might like and can bring true joy.

The line gets blurry around it when you aren't sure you personally like it but you like not being harassed or even getting compliments but that is something every person has to question, explore and discover on their own as no one else can help with that. 

What we can do and should aim at as a collective and/or society is provide that space to figure that out. The key points of freedom that provides a honest choice are in a collective hand.
I still would. Not because I am trans but my but of the tisum' makes it to where if I wear pants with leg hair it hurts and not having jeans on feels wrong
I think it’s okay to acknowledge that society has a role in our choices and find our individual paths of healing. I don’t wear makeup or shave because it has a bad connection to womanhood for me but really care about my skin and feel devastated about acne from my own aesthetic preference. I feel like terfs talk about dismantling the system but have never given logistics on how that could be done practically and without harming trans people. As individuals most people are doing the best they can to cope.
I very much enjoyed freeing myself from those things as part of coming into my nonbinary identity, but I'd never suggest that anyone was doing anything wrong by harmlessly affirming their gender in any way that feels good to them. 

If you want to wear makeup and/or shave for yourself, then by all means, you should.
I already tend not to shave or use makeup, but sometimes I do it for me specifically.  Mostly with the makeup because I like art and it’s like art but on my face-
Both practices are ancient.
i kind of agree a little bit but people should be allowed to do these things if they want to
I would continue to do both - my body hair isn't soft at all, so i genuinely can't go without shaving without skin irritation or hair splinters. And makeup is a choice for me anyway and yet I still do it.
Nearly three years ago now, I stopped shaving my legs. Everyone around me, minus a few friends, treated it like I was doing something radical.

Like I wasn't taking care of myself, all because I didn't shave my legs.

The truth is, I just don't care about shaving that much- and I love the gender euphoria of seeing hair on my body! 

Still, I'm told that I HAVE to shave- that it's ""not right for girls to have hairy legs"". Of course, when pressed why, they have no real answers just ""well. Just because!"" 

Fuck the beauty industry.
If nobody else did it, I’d still wear my eye-shadow, my eyeliner, my oversized cardigan, hair ties, my baggy pants, and my nail polish. I currently do it DESPITE societal expectations
Meeeeeeh...

The desire to chance one's own body and beautify oneself is much older than capitaliam.

And not exclusive to one end of the gender spectrum. It was unacceptable for men of a higher social class to appear unshaven in public, or even at dinner at home, in Regency England. Today, it's still hair. Razors, trimmers, hair loss treatment, there are entire parts of the industry that cater to the masc end.
Nah these industries wouldn’t go outta business, tf? Cosmetic clothing industries wouldn’t go out, people still like to look nice, just cuz not everyone wants to doesn’t mean e v e r y o n e doesn’t. Diet and gym industries wouldn’t, people still want to be healthy, and those two are both crucial in doing that for most people. People like and feel empowered by different things. Personally idc what anyone else is doing, I’m stickin to my own thing, which is looking the way I want and feeling the way I want, and everyone else should do the same. How people achieve these things is just different for everyone.
It started like that but now it's a comfort thing. I like makeup because I feel it's fun and I don't wear it when I don't want to. Shaving is a comfort thing, I can let my legs go but I need to shave my underarms for my own physical comfort not social comfort
I shave rarely and haven't worn makeup since high school, I don't even when others do
Bottom line there’s no reason to ever take away choices. Socially forcing people to take a specific choice, like expecting women to wear makeup, takes away choice.
I don’t know who “our” is but I don’t like it much. I’d still wear makeup and everything because it makes me feel nice.
Well if you want to get technical if no  one did it the items wouldn't exist anymore... Just sayin
I kind of agree. Does the pressure for feminine presenting ppl to do these things exist? Yes. Do I enjoy doing them? Yes
I personally don't think things would change so much that those corporations end up going out of business, seeing as there are a lot of folks who know they aren't ugly without these products, but like the way they look with it. I worry that that change would motivate some people to bully others into assimilating with the new status quo. I mean, that already happens in some situations. When I bought Hogwarts Legacy despite being nonbinary and disgusted by Rowling, I knew that I was alienating myself from the rest of the trans community, as I had already seen happen when I refused to force myself to hate something that helped me live to turn 22 just because the creator is a terrible woman, but the vicious things people have said shocks me. While I find Rowling repugnant, that does not change my feelings about the Harry Potter series. Separate the work from the creator. That is how I view it.
I get the problematic elements of the makeup and clothing industries but keeping yourself fit, at a basic level, is just a way to stay healthy and avoid problems that affect your quality of life.
Here is the thing the second post saying capitalism is depending on women hating themselves is somewhat correct some industries that prey on people would collapse, however, some people love their bodies and use it as a form of expression as other have said so I kinda see where this post is coming from but not exactly
The clothing industry? Are we all meant to walk around naked or?? 🤔
Sometimes I like to feel pretty
I'd still shave
I don't know, fitness is really important to me and I by no means hate my body. I'm happier now that I'm more fit. I feel pretty much the same about all of these things, I would hesitate to say all of this or even necessarily any of it is contingent upon women hating themselves. Seems like an oversimplified analysis
I wish more people would see this kind of take with a bit more nuance. I personally believe that, if it weren’t expected of AFAB people to look a certain way, makeup and shaving (at least as they’re practiced now) would be significantly less common. That being said, I have no issue with people choosing to partake in these types of regiments as a form of self expression. 
You can be all for individual expression and personal choice while still acknowledging that your choices don’t exist in a vacuum. It’s much more complicated than “beauty routine bad” or “beauty routine good”.
At this stage I would shave my legs because I like the feeling afterward. I've gone unshaved and shaved. Makeup I don't know. I also feel like if no one wore it it would t exist.
Do what makes you happy
I never cared enough about my appearance (except for my hair) to use makeup in the first place.
I'd still do as self expression. Unfortunately my lips and eyelids aren't black and gothic naturally nor can I change the pattern of my skin to include spider webs and upside down crosses and Eyes of Ra/Horus. I don't shave my legs all that often anyway either so nothing would change for me there.
I currently do neither, so no. I will say I up on makeup rarely if I'm feeling it though.
Shaved legs feel really nice.  I would continue to do so.
I shave for myself, not cause others do it
Yes... I don't wear makeup to hide myself. I wear makeup because of esthetics. I don't even wear makeup most of the time. Mostly just because I don't feel like putting effort into it when I'm just home alone. 

And shaving the same story. Like no one tells me to shave. I also don't shave because I feel ugly with hair, but more because I like it esthetically if I'm shaved
Yes I would shave because I'm happier that way and feel cleaner, I have never wore makeup so idk
yes i'd still wear makeup. i don't wear makeup because of insecurities. i do it because i like it and use it as a creative outlet.
I don't shave my legs or wear makeup, but I stopped doing it before I stopped thinking of myself as a girl. I think my take at the time was that it was bullshit that I was expected to do certain things or not do certain things because of my gender and that anybody who was going to tell me that I had to could go jump in a lake. I feel sad for and confused by people who seem unhappy about these things and yet still required to do them. (If they are actually required to do them, then I just feel sad, not confused.) If someone is happy to do these things, then that is great, right? Because it is good that they are happy.
I already don’t wear make up so obviously not; I don’t know if I’d shave or not if no one else did, tho.
... i dress very goth i already do what not many ppl in my area do lmao, I do it cuz its fun (and shave cuz i HAAAATE how hair feels on me it's not a pressure thing for me personally)
Shaving? No.
Since coming out I stopped shaving my legs and armpits. It makes me feel masc and I honestly only did it in the past because I was trying to force myself to feel cis.

Makeup? Yup!
Even on my more masc days, I wear makeup. I've never worn a ton, but having blonde eyelashes makes me appreciate mascara.
Personally, I don't care either way if anybody shaves or wears makeup or doesn't. I don't usually bother shaving but sometimes I will randomly because I felt like it and when I do wear makeup it's because I just felt like it and I wanna put on excessive amounts of black eyeliner lmao most of the time I'm not even seeing anybody or going anywhere when I put on makeup, but if I am it's because I thought it would look cool with whatever outfit
I think this is mostly to an AFAB audience but personally I'd do anything that could defy society's norms lmao
I hate foundation but I want to just do weird shit with eye shadow.  Eye shadow can be soooo much fun and you can get real creative.  I would just wear weird shit every day.
I absolutely know people who would. They would have less worry around it. But a lot of people genuinely like wearing makeup and having less body hair.
“If nobody else did/wore it, would you?” 

If nobody else did it, it would be pretty hard to find resources to do it. Many paper and canvas paints are toxic to wear on the skin or ingest which makes them unsuitable for use as makeup or body paint, for example. But I wouldn’t doubt that there are still people who would go to the effort of reinventing the products needed for it just because they want to. And if I had ease if access to them, and felt like it, then yes. I would.
Yass queen 😚
I was told around the time my legs were getting hairy that I should shave. My mum even bought me an electric one for Christmas one year. I never understood why I needed to shave my legs, but I did it anyway, so my mum wouldn't bug me on it. A year ago, I even did laser hair removal, about 4 treatments. Then, when I opened up to my mum, she stopped bugging me about shaving.
So now I've stopped shaving and I'm freeee!!! Hairy legs, baby! 
Though people look at me seeing me as a woman, then just a human.
as long as it won't hurt anyone
I only shave due to societal expectations. I do not wear makeup. Other people should feel free to do what they want.
I think it is absolutely something to consider for yourself if the things that are seen as obligatory gendered activities you're being asked to do feel right to you, but the other commenter in the post is only partially right. It would be entirely revolutionary to the beauty industry if women loved themselves, but to conflate that to nobody at all wanting to wear makeup or shave isn't fully true. Some people genuinely like it and there's nothing wrong with it, just be as low-waste as you can while enjoying the medium to the maximum extent you wish to pursue.
I stopped shaving my legs a year and a half ago, and I’m never going back 😂 far too much effort, and my skin always hated it anyway. 

I would probably still wear makeup! I’ve finally gotten to a point where I only wear it when I actually want to, it’s a fun art form for me!
I don't wear make-up to necessarily be pretty, and DEFINITELY not to fit in. I wear it to look more masculine and elf-like and to express myself, aka look like a walking candy store. I could not care less if others don't find it pretty. Shaving probably wouldn't give me dysphoria anymore, but it still irritates my skin. So I would continue to not shave.
Makeup is art to me and I stopped shaving my body like 3 years ago and I only shave my face cus I like how my jaw looks when I kinda contour with hair
No and no.
At this point in the game it's not the insecurity of \_just\_ women lmao
I shave because I love the feeling of clean shaven skin. Idgaf if you shave or not. I love feeling my own skin smooth.

I would also wear makeup. I love the freedom of expression and I enjoy putting it on. However I'd only wear it for me. Not to impress someone else.
Make-up is a form of self-expression, and I just don't see ever giving it up. I match my eyebrows and eyeshadow to the different colors in my hair for example. I don't do it because others are, and I feel like that is possibly true for the majority of people who wear make-up. We just like it for ourselves. 

As far as shaving, sometimes I don't mind the hair and other times I need to be hair-free. It is a personal choice. When I was younger, I was made to believe I had to be hair-free otherwise that meant I was dirty, and it took me a long time to realize that was not true and was just others' expectations and their own insecurities projected onto me. 

I agree that societal views as well as the beauty industry (and others listed in the pic) do contribute to people believing they have to do these things to look presentable and that is something we have to, as a society, overcome but that does not mean that if we participate in these thigs that we hate ourselves or that we are doing it for others and not solely ourselves.

This was a really longwinded way of me to say that we are all different and our reasons are our own but societal expectations may play some part but are not the end-all-be-all of our choices.
I don’t wear makeup to follow social norms or be beautiful I wear makeup to look like a sexy ghoul
I already only do either when I feel like it, so yeah, when I felt like it lol 🤷‍♂️ I haven't given a damn about what the general public thinks about my appearance since I was single digits, I think.
I weat makeup once every couple months, usually only at home, and then it's creative stuff. Recently I made myself cheetah ""tears""

About shaving, I'd still shave my armpits because they get itchy with long hair and with the private parts I'd still trim them as well because it's simply uncomfortable. Not sure I'd shave my legs though. I do it in summer but if it wasn't an expectation I probably wouldn't
I don’t shave because it gives me allergies, and I wear makeup, because I like to look cute, I really don’t care what everyone else has to say or not about it, even if it stops being normal, I’ll probably stick to wearing it as usual tbh
Idk I don't use makeup. I'd maybe feel better about my hairy legs if other fem people had them but I never notice them to begin with so idrc
Absolutely i would
I already don't do either, so can't really comment.
I think I'd still use makeup because i love it, it's a great form of artistic self-expression and i love every method and skill you can use from it.
i don't shave my legs partially due to laziness LMAO

i don't use makeup, but i definitely would still continue skincare mainly because acne is a goddamn pain in the ass
You could say the same about literally any product tho
I really couldn't care less what other people do with their body hair, I had partners who have much body hair and don't shave it and it didn't bother me at all. Me on the other hand, I just like shaving off body hair because I feel better without it, not because there's a beauty ideal (plus I'm AMAB and most people don't know I'm NB, even though I'm not making an effort to hide it lol). 

For makeup, I rarely wear it, when I do it's nail polish (which I usually wear for a few weeks because idc if it gets scraped off), fake freckles/moles or very rarely black lipstick that I only put on my upper lip.

For me, shaving and makeup are means to express myself and my identity, not portraying any kind of gender standard or whatever.
U do u boo, capitalism shouldn’t get in the way of your fun and or euphoria, just never mind other people and do you
The feeling of touching waxed legs is heavenly. I would still do it
I would probably use makeup if i knew how to actually

AND paint my nails  
and my mood just get a lot better when I shave my legs  
those things are all ways to body expression and I think nobody should neither be forced to do them by society nor forced NOT to do them
I would and do, not much make up as I suck at it but not the point.
I would probably do both
Yes, all body hair is gross 😡 and who doesn't wanna be MOAR pretty? 😅😂
No to both. I don't do either
I always felt the need to shave and would feel embarrassed when I didn’t. One day I just decided not to shave in order to get over my “fear” of being seen with body hair. I haven’t shaved since and I honestly feel so much more comfortable with my body the way it was intended to be
And I thought TERFs couldn't get any more cringe
I literally refuse to wear makeup if im expected to do the no makeup makeup like why bother
I'm gonna start calling it ""natural polite makeup"", it's so spot on I love it! Pretty much my entire makeup collection is wild colors, the softest ones I own are more for blending out or creating a base rather than wearing it alone. If I'm spending any money on makeup, it better be so it shows up (aside from foundation/concealer) or else I feel it's a waste of money
Ok but like imagine how fucking fun it would be if that were normalized in society.  Maybe not as in wearing it to work because that would get inconvenient after a while, but imagine going out in the evening and everyone is all done up with all sorts of cool makeup.  Everyone putting in effort and having their own style.  Maybe not everyone would enjoy that, so even if it were just specific places that would be cool.  Not expected but accepted.
Yeah! I love doing great big winged eyeliner much more than ""a touch of foundation to smooth out my skin texture."" I basically never do the latter.
Wow, thanks for doing the research here.  I’m totally down to delete the post if you think the author’s background is significantly problematic (I don’t have tumblr or Twitter or whatever they’re on)
God Dame it, every fricking time! Of course it's a terf,
Every time I think it seeing something nice it's either a terf or a neo Nazi 😞
This is so beautiful and I’m glad to have read your balanced perspectives.  You and your wife sound awesome!
This is such a well rounded take! Thanks for sharing
as an AMAB enby I think I understand where she is coming from. Gender expression standards are not comfortable to everyone of that AGAB. I feel relieved to not have to adhere to some gender standards for my AGAB. However, cosmetics is something I actively choose, against the societal shunning of AMAB people who do

not every cis woman likes makeup, but they are expected to. Non-femme presenting people are not expected to, so we get a choice in the matter so to speak

one of the earlier signs of me being enby was my disdain for traditionally masc ways of presentation, and I felt very relieved when I understood that I can just give the middle finger to the patriarchy
Agreed. I just like how I look with eyeliner, doesn’t necessarily mean I’m insecure about how my face looks, it’s like a cherry on top.
Makeup has been around since at least Egyptian pharaoh times. And historically, it was worn more by men in many other cultures. 

I wear it for basically the same reasons you do. It’s an accent to my features (not a cover) and a part of my outfit or look.
It's also been around for a long time in diffrent context. Like cultural or symbolic.
Yeah makeup for me atm is having crosses instead of eyebrows (those suckas shaved right off) massive winged eyeliner and blusher on the tip of my nose so I look like I have a cold 😂😂 so yeah defo ain't in my book to look like a ""pretty girl"" 😂
I've heard of a woman who's husband literally has never seen her with out make up,
She would make up at like 5 I the morning everyday to put on her makeup before her husband's awake.

She's not doing this for her at this point :/
If you feel my drift
Yeah I agree! I do both but I do it for me not for others. I don't do makeup often but when I do I really do it so that I feel pretty and good. My husband actually perfers me without it!.
Sensory issues are driving the bus for me.  I can’t stand the way makeup feels on my face, so I don’t wear any.  I like the feeling of shaving my legs and don’t like the feeling of pants touching leg hair, so I shave.
I didn’t get that assumption at all. That may be what some people think but it’s not necessary to hold this viewpoint. 

I absolutely agree with some of the critiques of this message and how it’s being presented, but it also resonated with me very deeply. I grew up doing all this stuff, with my predominant motivation being fear of being judged if I didn’t. I thought I HAD to wear makeup and shave. It was incredibly liberating to realise that I don’t have to do shit! It was a societal expectation, but not one that had to be met. I felt fine doing all of that, but I realised I actually felt better by giving myself the time back in my life

Anyway I guess my point is that self-hatred didn’t feature in my thinking at all, so it really surprised me to hear you say that
I know that there are people who wear makeup because they feel they are ugly and they have to. The perpetuation that women have to wear makeup to look presentable is real. BUT makeup has been around long before capitalism and has not always been a gendered issue. Makeup can, has been and should be reframed as a form of self expression and a form of art. No one should feel they have to wear makeup. It should be enjoyable and plenty of people do find it enjoyable.
Well, it does take an absurd / disproportionate amount of time and resources.  So we must be crazy if we do it ;)
you're right, plenty of women wake up one day and decide that, out of nowhere, with absolutely no patriarchal or misogynistic influence, ""i want to look like a prepubescent girl""
Don't think, be certain. It is super shaky and problematic vision. Those are the same people who implies that transmascs are self-hating women and that gender dysphoria don't exist
Yeah I can see that OOP is giving really TERFy vibes in their commenting.  You all here helped me learn to look out for and call that out.  :)
Never heard the term neovagina before. Sounds so cyberpunk
Thank you for this! Something about this analysis came off as TERFy to me
[deleted]
It’s interesting that this argument re: “shaved legs feel good” is flipped for AMAB people.  Before I started questioning - I wasn’t even given the choice to shave my legs.

Which begs the question - does it really feel good or is it mostly social conditioning?  (I don’t have enough hair to really feel the difference). If it was objectively good, wouldn’t men catch on?

Edit: the answer is usually patriarchy
Yeah, I don't like how the original message felt like it was shaming people who choose to shave or wear makeup. I'm AFAB and I definitely do feel societal pressure to do those things (especially shaving).
Yeah, it’s also way oversimplifying and passing multiple issues off onto cis women. 

If we interpret it as, the only reason for makeup is to become more attractive - it’s been studied objectively that attractive people make more money and are happier, and it is especially true for women. This post also smells of alpha-males-want-natural-women.

What I am really concerned about is the pollution aspect of the make-up industry.
It’s true that that’s a thing it is, but it’s also other things too
I love this haha.  You’re totally right - I am glad I learned so much from the community here.

It’s funny you call out r/im14andthisisdeep because I feel 14 as far as exploration of gender expression goes… 😂
Interesting point - there was another person who explained the social aspect of it well.  I just find it interesting because what is gender affirming is obviously defined by society - so yeah, you’re right.
Now that you point it out I can totally see it.

I will admit to thinking this way due to my own internal transphobia but everyone here helped me understand the situation better and I feel more prepared for my transfemme journey.
But would you want to shave your legs if leg shaving was never a thing?
The OP telling women in the comments that they're wrong if they shave or vice versa is definitely misogyny. And all the trans comments are down voted. I get bad vibes from that space.
Lol yeah!  When you’re GNC your very existence is political to some, even if you don’t do or say anything.
This is a really good take.  I realize as my income grows that there’s very little reason to change my lifestyle - because I’m just moving money into things that don’t really matter.  Now I’m focusing on what makes me happy :)
You dropped your /s
no problem! personally i don't care whether the post is left up or not (original is from tumblr). it's not like we're promoting them or anything. it's important to be able to recognize TERF dogwhistles, as they're often more subtle than outright transphobia. all-or-nothing condemnation of makeup and shaving is often one of them -- and i don't mean personally choosing not to partake in them, but rather saying that the entire industry is evil and that there's no valid reason for a woman (or anyone else) to shave or wear makeup.
Leave it up! We can all learn in the comments!
Nothing wrong with showing problematic people. Just give context is all, and this comment section is great context.
Absolutely true! I'm Eastern Cherokee. and masc presenting people in my tribe wore way more makeup, accessories, and fancy flashy clothing than the fem presenting peeps. AND they plucked all their body hair - it was a right of passage. Plus piercings and tattoos were the norm for everyone. So, I try to live by THOSE standards. The more piercings, tattoos, cool makeup, outlandish accessories, and bright colors...the better. If anyone says shit I just wave my hands around like an idiot and let them know my ancestors have now cursed them and their entire future line.
AMAB here, I don't ware makeup cuz I'm scared I'll get the shit beat out'a me for it 🙂

I want too tho :/
Sounds like banger makeup tbh.
Well, yeah, but that doesn’t apply to everyone is what I’m saying.
I agree. I'm Autistic, and I have sensory issues with foundation and mascara. I can't stand it (but eye-liner is fine, apparently? 🤷‍♀️).  I love the sensation of soft, smooth, heavy, and tight things. The action of shaving my legs and underarms has structure and routine, so it's soothing, and I absolutely LOVE rubbing my smooth legs together after I hop into fresh sheets when I go to bed.
Hey you know what you’re right! I didnt think about how my socialization probably affects my relationship to these activities. I can see your point that these things could be compulsory for some people, and that sounds horrible. 

I think both of these things can be true at the same time, and I think that what we’re both saying is that people should be able to do whatever they want with their bodies. I appreciate your perspective a lot.
I think there’s a solid argument though that on the contrary it’s self-love. It can be about engaging with your body and having agency, rather than frantically hiding your imperfections.
No more crazy than men who shave or use make up, or nbs who do
I’m not sure I understand what you’re saying.
It does doesn't it? I like it, im taking control of my body and making it my own.
How? Do tell, person that refers to Blaire White, a trans woman, as ""he.""
I personally think it feels nicer to have smooth legs, but I've just decided it's not worth it. I nick myself too much, it takes a lot of time, and I get so many little red bumps from it anyways. I definitely think more men would at least consider shaving their legs for the sensory feel of it if there wasn't a stigma going against them.
I didn't say what I was assigned at birth in my comment.
I’m amab and I shave my legs bc it feels good 🤷‍♀️. I also wear makeup for fun sometimes. I think if the pressure was taken off of women to do these things some women would and some wouldn’t. Likewise if men didn’t feel insecure about doing these things more men would.
I know cisgender men who shave for swimming or biking and really like the way it feels. I personally like the way my unshaved legs feel.
A good rule of thumb is to be wary of anyone saying all women everywhere have it the same (especially if they act as though women are universally reviled and the lowest social class): either they’re ignorant or actively misleading you. Furthermore, anyone who uses terms like “the west” to make sweeping generalizations about an entire hemisphere of the earth is typically going to have a bad take on things.
what a stupid question lmfao
How Should I Know? Looking Into A Different Reality And Seizing My Thought Process From Within It Is Unfortunately Not Within The Purview Of My Abilities. 

Although Considering There Are Actual Advantages Of Shaving Leg Hair (For Example It Decreases Drag While Swimming, Not Useful For Everyone Obviously But It Is For Professional Swimmers), And We Have Records Of It Being Done As Far Back As Roman Times, It Seems Unlikely Such A World Could Exist Unless Human Biology (Or The Laws Of Physics) Is Notably Different, Or Human Culture Is *Unimaginably* Different.
toxic for sure
I didn’t know that’s a TERF thing to condemn but also to still partake.  Seems hypocritical…

Admittedly the reason why I bring this up is likely my own internal transphobia (and getting cold feet for starting HRT).  The doubt here is whether I’ve falsely attributed gender identity and gender presentation.  The best sub to discuss this is most likely this one.

That being said, the whole narrative of “we only do this because society tells us to” is something that resonates with me because I’ve applied that thinking to masculinity and learned to reject the parts of my AMAB upbringing I don’t like.  For that reason I’m still continuing on my transfemme journey.
So, I heeeeavily disagree with your dogwhistle accusation here. These are common standing points of second generation feminists, a subset of them are Transphobe, a bigger subset is queer critical, but to say they are all terfs is like condemning the evolution of feminism in itself.
That’s awesome. This will be my new response to assholes 😁
Aww that sucks. I wish I could beat a MF for you.  Come to Denver. It’s pretty free. You can wear what you want.
Yea of course! I guess it's kinda like the pro choice vs pro life debate, like you can have pro choice people who would never abort a baby y'know?
yes!!! the grasshopper rub! you get it 😩
Honestly That Makes A Lot Of Sense. If I Love Myself, Why Would I Let Myself Keep Living In A Body I Don't Love, When I Could Easily Make It Better?
as in, no one does that.
[deleted]
I was referring how your statement “I like the feeling of hairless skin” is flipped for people who underwent AMAB socialization (as in: “you *should not* want/like the feeling of hairless skin”).  Wasn’t making any assumptions about your AGAB.
Would you mind please explaining why this is a stupid question?
I wasn’t really looking for an answer, it was just something to provoke thought.

But presumably you don’t shave your legs to reduce drag or because the Romans did it?

EDIT

I’m sorry for being so flippant, I just couldn’t resist.
sorry i don't think i explained the TERF viewpoint very well -- generally, they believe that makeup/cosmetics industries are predatory and immoral (this part is true) AND that anyone who chooses to wear makeup or shave their legs is only doing it for the male gaze, even if they say it's for their own pleasure. again this isn't exclusively a TERF viewpoint, but it's enough a red flag that i want to investigate where they're coming from, hence me searching the usernames from this post.

i definitely agree that there's an element of societal pressure when it comes to makeup and other 'feminine' actions. it's important to be aware of that, but it's also important to understand that many people want to look and feel nice just for themselves. 

good luck on your journey! it's awesome that you're still questioning and learning about gender stuff, it's endlessly fascinating.
I think people like this tend to underestimate the value and meaning of what society “tells” us to do. Humans are a social species. The things we do often have a social meaning, and often *only* a social meaning. They’re symbols that communicate messages. We can critique the hierarchical power structures that create and manipulate meaning, but the argument that “you wouldn’t do it if others didn’t do it, therefore you’re being forced to do it” is such a… vapid argument. Obviously we wouldn’t do things with social meaning if others didn’t do them, because they would have no meaning. It’d be like claiming that you wouldn’t speak a language if no one else did. Like… yeah, no kidding. Why would I speak a language that no one else speaks? It would literally have no meaning.

We can critique the capitalistic manipulation of human behaviour without resorting to some weird essentialist conception of semiotics.
Dog whistles _inherently_ have innocuous origins or they wouldn’t be dog whistles. 

_Trans Exclusionary_ Radical Feminists do indeed tend to be second wave (so, radical and not liberal) and therefore they _use_ those common standing points in part to signal to others who have their beliefs. 

A dog whistle is a red flag, not a stop sign. It can genuinely mean nothing. If you’re offended by people being cautioned to double check for their own safety I can’t say I agree.

On top of that… People who are still radical feminists specifically without pulling in elements of third and fourth wave feminism tend to believe lots of stuff people don’t necessarily agree with, trans exclusionary or no. I would still avoid some of them. 

Hence the other two waves. The amount of critiques of prior process since the seventies is high, high enough to often inspire libraries by other later wave feminists’ writings. No harm in proceeding with an eye out.
Define ""queer critical"". Come on.
Is Denver better then Ontario QwQ

To be fair I haven't experienced any problems yet, tho I really don't put myself out there that much, maybe I just scare myself with the news lol
Exactly!
I think there are two things happening simultaneously here possibly. One is that I feel like doing these things is really liberating and feels freeing and like a marvelous and wonderful way for me to engage with my body, and also that it’s taboo and there’s a lot of shame wrapped up with it I have to grapple with, due to the way I was socialized and the ways I was required to interact with my body as I developed that relationship. 

The other is that people socialized differently from me feel that these ways of engaging with their bodies are actually compulsory and oppressive, and that the reasoning behind that is patriarchal. 

I think those are maybe different perspectives on the same thing, which is binary gendered conditioning in our relationships to our bodies. I hope there is room for both of those things at the same time, because it should be that we can engage with our bodies differently and that’s ok. And its also totally unacceptable and oppressive that these activities are compulsory for some people, in spite of the fact that its oppressive. What do you think about that?
Thank you! She's a total badass I agree.

And blocked.
because leg shaving exists ?
>I wasn’t really looking for an answer, it was just something to provoke thought.

If You Ask Me, Asking A Question But Not Expecting An Answer Is Often Quite Silly. Although Of Course You Didn't Ask Me, And Perhaps Giving An Answer When Not Asked A Question Is Equally Silly.

>But presumably you don’t shave your legs to reduce drag or because the Romans did it?

~~Actually I Don't Shave My Legs At All, I Neither Have A Razor Nor Know How To Use One, But If I Did I Probably Would.~~  
Well Yes, I Was Just Giving Those As Examples, Reducing Drag Isn't The Only Practical Benefit, And I'd Bet Other Ancient Cultures Perhaps Even Those Before The Romans Did It As Well. The Reason I'd Do It However Is Quite Simply That I Do Not Like My Leg Hair. I Do Not Think It Looks Good, I Do Not Find It Comfortable, And I Do Not Consider It To Have Any Practical Use For Me.
I feel like shaving is nice because it makes tall socks more comfortable, and soft clothes feel really good. Also, convenient things like sports bras feel a bit nicer when shaven. Many people wont care about any of these factors, which is perfectly fair. 

The thing about attracting guys is funny, because the sort that may care about such things is also a sort that I would prefer to avoid.
on the other hand, just because society expects something doesn't automatically mean that thing is bad or you're being coerced. some things are just neutral.

besides, human beings are social creatures by nature. wanting to be accepted by society isn't wrong, it's a fundamental drive for almost everybody! presentation is a big part of how we built social rapport.
Okay I see your point, and sure I agree, buuuut- what I mean when I say ""society is forceing us to do something"" or something along those lines I'm talking about the endless advertisements you see, those actors are not real people, they do it because they are told to, and we do it too because the messageing of the ad makes it seem like we're dirty or gross or something like that if we don't,
Just think about like carrying a handbag or wareing skirts vs pants. I'm pritty sure most AFAB people would rather not need to carry easily stolen external storage and rather just keep everything in there (""male"") pants. But they don't because it's ""wierd"" so says the purse industry.

I just think if there wasn't so much society pressure from thinks like ads and such people would do thinks because they want to and enjoy to and not because they're scared of a social crucifixion.
Love this.
essentialism is a hallmark of neurotypicals though. they have to reduce absolutely everything down to absolutely nothing. if anything makes them feel small or different it should be destroyed instead of understood correctly.
thanks for expressing this much more articulately than I could have
I’m not sure if it’s better than Ontario (I haven’t been there yet). I’m also in a pretty queer friendly neighborhood/area, so maybe I’m not getting a full picture. 

There are a lot of problems with high rents, homelessness and petty crime. Other than that (lol), you can freely wear whatever you want and not be bothered (for that reason at least).
:D
It was a hypothetical question. I thought it was obvious, but I guess maybe I should have outright stated it for the benefit of people who didn’t get that.

I asked it in order to to encourage people to consider the question from a new perspective.

I don’t see how this is stupid.
You have an extremely narrow conception of what a question can be if you believe that they are only a tool for eliciting information.

Sometimes the answers a question can produce widen our vision beyond the narrowness of a problematic perception.

Maybe asking someone who has been through some really tough times about the main things they learned from the experiences will help widen their frame of reference and imply that perhaps it wasn’t all wasted time. You aren’t asking the question to accept find out what that person has learned. 

I don’t think this is silly.
i understand where ur coming from. i just don’t know how it helps to imagine a world without it since we’re already here... it felt like you were coming for the commenter above you for sharing their experiences with it and kinda invalidating them
I Never Said Asking A Question For A Reason Other Than To Elicit Information Is Silly, Simply That Asking A Question Without Expecting An Answer Is Silly. Heck You Even Mentioned Answers Here. Even If The Answer Isn't Expected For The Person Asking, Or From The Person Asked, It'd Usually Be Expected.

 If Your Desire With The Question Was For Me To Think About It And Come Up With A Reason For Myself, That's Still An Answer To The Question, Perhaps Simply To Myself But An Answer Nonetheless, And You're Still Expecting It Regardless Of Whether I Share It With You Or Not. And If I'm Going To Come Up With An Answer Anyway, Why Shouldn't I Share It? With Humans Being A: Social Creatures And B: Not Perfectly Intelligent, I Believe More Interesting And Useful Thinking Can Be Done When Multiple People Engage In It Together Rather Than Just One Person Alone.
It’s helpful because it makes you think. It  might possibly make you reconsider you opinions and beliefs on a subject. Maybe I’ve just had too much therapy over the years, but this questioning and self reflection is so useful. The concept on *not* questioning your beliefs and opinions seems utterly alien to me. 

What do I associate shaving my legs with?

Why do I think this? 

Where did I pick this opinion from?

….are examples just off of the top of my head.
So first off is there a reason that all the words in your posts begin with capital letters? It’s very uncomfortable to read.

I wasn’t *expecting* an an answer because people often ignore what they don’t want to hear, especially on social media platforms. But I wasn’t offended to receive an answer. You’re misunderstood my point. 

I agree that useful thinking can be done when multiple people engage together. But I don’t believe your dismissive reply of “how should I know……etc” really furthers any kind of deeper understanding.
lol dude. i’m a deeply introspective person as well, and i love to consider these things for myself. i appreciate that you’re assuming you’re much more knowledgeable and profound a person than me. or that you’ve attended more therapy.. it’s not a competition. i have existential ocd, so trust me when i say i understand thinking about things all day long. again i feel the tone of your comment was the issue. as if the poster hadn’t considered that before
>So first off is there a reason that all the words in your posts begin with capital letters? It’s very uncomfortable to read.

Apologies, I'll refrain from doing it in this reply. Not really a reason, To my knowledge, Just a thing I do. 

>I wasn’t *expecting* an an answer because people often ignore what they don’t want to hear, especially on social media platforms. But I wasn’t offended to receive an answer. You’re misunderstood my point.

That's Fair, I guess that is on me then. Not sure why someone wouldn't want to hear a simple question like that though. 

>I agree that useful thinking can be done when multiple people engage together. But I don’t believe your dismissive reply of “how should I know……etc” really furthers any kind of deeper understanding.

That's fair, It wasn't exactly a useful response, I'll agree, Although I suppose what I was saying is, For me, It's not a useful question, By itself atleast. It asks me to ponder something I find effectively impossible to ponder; A world in which nobody ever shaved their legs. While on the surface this is pretty easy to imagine, There'd just be a lot of people with hairy legs, Going deeper, Which I'd need to do in order to determine my own feelings within said world, Brings up other questions I cannot answer, Namely ""*Why* did nobody ever shave their legs in this world?"", And without answering that I cannot give a useful answer to the original question. Perhaps this is just a quirk of how I think, I don't know.

Or perhaps, On a deeper level, I don't know why I want to shave my legs, And that is why I cannot answer. Or I guess I *do* know why, I want to, I don't want to have lots of leg hair, Simple as that, But why I want that, As with why I want basically anything, I cannot answer, As wants are not conscious actions; I cannot choose what I want, I simply want it, In this case at least the want is an intrinsic desire. Did some external stimuli impact my desire for it? Maybe, I don't know, I'm not sure if it would be possible for me to know, As that would require an understanding of my subconscious far greater than I currently have, Not just in the present but also in the past, Possibly the distant past (Which considering my good memory, Or more specifically lack thereof, Would be quite challenging.).

I suppose, To summarise, Yes, I gave a sort of non-answer to your question, But that's all I know how to give, For a number of reasons I simply do not possess the required knowledge to give any deeper or more meaningful answer.
The tone of the comment could not be more neutral.

Maybe the poster had considered it, maybe they had not? They were free to answer in any way they felt fit to. Or not reply at all. 

Also I’m not assuming anything regarding knowledge levels or how profound we are. I don’t know why you would think that I made these assumptions. I was responding to why a hypothetical question might be useful.
Thank you for a very interesting post. I find it fascinating to hear someone’s thought process described in the way that you have just done.

It’s not always easy to imagine a world where things are very different. But it is interesting. And how you consider things can be interesting.

So instead of asking “why *didn’t* people shave their legs, how about asking why *do* people shave their legs? Not shaving is a “natural” state of being after all. 

From a practical point of view I believe the practice really took off when pantyhose/stockings became widely used. That’s probably the reason women (because it started as a female thing) didn’t shave their arm hair (some women do have quite hairy arms).

But then you can look at what shaving legs means on a deeper level. And I mean both in terms of society and you personally. Do hairless legs represent femininity? Youthfulness? Do you even care what society thinks about you?Where does your discomfort with leg hair come from? For all I know it could be an idea picked up in childhood that you haven’t re-examined? Or maybe you have thought about it deeply already. I don’t know because I don’t know you as a person. Maybe you have thought about it deeply for a long time. But your reply might change something inside someone reading the comment. It might even change my opinion. 

My personal view is that body hair isn’t inherently physically uncomfortable. I don’t believe that as a species we would have evolved to have something that causes true physical discomfort. My belief is that the discomfort comes from a psychological perspective. I must add that I have no evidence to back this up, but it is my genuine belief.

But please don’t take that to mean I’m making a judgment on people who want to shave their legs. Just because I believe that issues regarding body hair are a societal issues, I understand the importance of it still. You still have to find your place in the world and be comfortable.
>So instead of asking “why *didn’t* people shave their legs"", how about asking ""why *do* people shave their legs?"" Not shaving is a “natural” state of being after all. 

Well as stated before there are a number of practical reasons (Particularly in sports), I presume shaving your leg hair (and other body hair) could help stay cool in hotter places, Although as I don't live in hotter places I can't say for certain. Either way, It likely started with a decently small number of people doing it for some practical reason or another, And then others saw those people, Thought it looked nice, And, Perhaps not knowing the original reason it was done, Started doing it themselves. While I don't think it was anywhere near as common in the present, There are seemingly ancient examples of people doing it for aesthetic reasons. Although Of course in the present day it's not always done for practical reasons or because someone saw it and thought it looked nice, In the Anglosphere atleast I believe it's common that women are effectively told they need to shave their body hair lest they be ugly and unwomanly, Which of course wouldn't actually be the case. (None of this is from my personal experience by the way, Just second-hand information from like 2-3 people maybe, And more primarily from just reading about it online, So forgive me if I made a mistake.)

>But then you can look at what shaving legs means on a deeper level. And I mean both in terms of society and you personally. 

I mean honestly I'm not sure it really matters for me what it means on a societal level, As I don't feel that really affects me. Personally I don't think I really associate it with anything, I guess I do with femininity a bit, But I don't think that's the reason I want to get rid of mine, Not the full one at least. I mean I don't think leg hair looks bad or anything, Or that there'd be anything wrong with me if I didn't get rid of mine, I guess part of it could be that I think it looks better on me specifically, As I have decently thick leg hair but almost no visible hair on my torso and arms, So it just creates a kinda weird inconsistency, But again I honestly don't know. It's far from the only thing I do or want to do for reasons entirely unknown to me. 

>My personal view is that body hair isn’t inherently physically uncomfortable. I don’t believe that as a species we would have evolved to have something that causes true physical discomfort. My belief is that the discomfort comes from a psychological perspective. 

I'd argue that *all* discomfort is primarily psychological, It's basically your brain going ""Hey I'm not sure it's really healthy for your body to be like this/do this"", Sure in some cases it's actually something that *is* unhealthy, But in many cases it's not, And in either case it's coming from the brain. Although even if we assume that some is physical, I don't think that could rule this out as being an example of that, As human culture and practices evolve far faster than our bodies do, We are *constantly* doing things our bodies didn't evolve to do, Simply because we started doing them before we had time to evolve to do them, And perhaps we'll stop before then too. And who knows, Maybe we *are* in the process of evolving away leg hair, Just rather slowly, I don't know.

Facebook is mean to me, showing me clothes I'd love to have both the confidence and the body to wear.		"Or it's being kind, showing how great you *will* look in that dress. There are two sides of the coin, it depends if you still are willing to keep on looking at the bright side.
Also, for anyone who wants to know, those dresses are from [Licemere](https://licemere.com).

Edited to add: I'm truly shocked by and thankful for the reception this post has gotten. Those fake reddit points really helped me feel validated.
I'm just gonna scream. Okay? Okay

AAAAHHHHHHHHHH
Clothes are made for bodies. If you have a body, then those clothes are for you. (If the clothes don't come in your size, that is absolutely not your fault. It's the company's fault for being short sighted and refusing to be inclusive.)

Confidence can take time, and effort. The best advice I got from someone was ""Confidence is sexy"". I may not always feel confident, so I pretend to have the confidence I want to have. It works more often than you'd think!
Damn I love that top corner one
Could you link this dress for totally cis reasons?

I'm probably not going to buy that for the same reasons, but I'd like to have the option

Edit: nevermind saw your shared the shop
You would look great in all of these. Confidence is key! And don't you dare say something about your body that you wouldn't say about Lizzos!
Oh damn I want that bottom right one
If you have a body, you have the body for these clothes.
They look cool but oftentimes stuff I buy online is super disappointing in quality and fit and doesn’t fit ANYONE properly or flatteringly
I relate, whenever I’m in some sort of store with my mom next to me, and I see some unisex clothes that I like, I can’t say I do unless it could be pictured as being more fem.
Yeah, I'd love to wear something like that and I probably have the confidence to do it, but what I don't have is the body and it never fails to upset me
I exactly know what you mean
Those are so cool! I love the top right one
I wonder if they even have my size
look up weary witchling, she wears this getup with make up and such. She does spicy content, but i actually havent bothered looking at that...mostly envy the purple goth vibes XD She also has videos of getting excited to go outside to look at pretty sunsets...Also a vibe
Instagram is convinced I'm a cis woman and some of time ads make me dysphoric
It does this to me too. I tell it to stop reading me.  My library is closed.
[deleted]
That's a mood
These would look amazing even without breasts, you would have to do some alterations though.
Ugh yeah same 😩
Do you have a body?! If so, you get clothes! Any of those clothes seem good! Or custom clothes like them if the manufacturers of those clothes are either crap or inconsiderate of other body types! Honestly, I bet you'd look lovely. Maybe you could try just wearing inside the house for a while until you build your confidence?

Admittedly the confidence part is harder, but focusing on recognizing that any body gets to wear what that person wants it a start. I very intentionally follow a bunch of beautiful, diverse, not at all mainstream humans on instgram, and cheer accounts for things I especially want to accept more about myself (for example, for me, hairy legs!). It helps! 

I hope someday you get to feel the rare, fleeting, no fucks given, I look amazing feeling that everyone deserves frequently.
Warning: these clothes don’t exist! At least not like this lol, I’ve had these exact pictures shown and I was the exact same but anytime you look into it it’s either a weird dropshipping company or really poor imitation clothing
Do you have a body? Yes? Then you DO have the body to wear *anything* you want to. You do not need a specific body type to wear anything. I'm not going to make assumptions about your gender or AGAB but let me say this; my gf is trans, doesn't have a chest and is ok with it, and still rocks a beautiful dress both privately and when we go out even with a pretty masc body, as she works out. I have a femme body and identify as mostly masc but still wear dresses as well as masc clothes like suits. There is nothing stopping you from wearing whatever you want
Fucking love the one in the bottom right. I could probably pull it off but there is *no* way I’m finding the right situation nor the confidence to give it a go lol
I feel that everytime I go clothes shopping. So many cute things, so very few things that would look halfway decent on me.
My favourite inspirational meme:   
How to get a bikini body: Put a bikini on your body. 

You're gonna look great in those dresses
I also keep seeing that add so Facebook might me on to something. Then again I also get adds for the ""don't bully me I'll cum"" t shirts and I'm asexual so who really knows.
God, you and me both! But, give it a try!! You might feel amazing in it and who cares what others think when you’re feelin’ it! ;)
You have a body. Therefor you have the body for this. And I bet you'd look fantastic. But I totally understand <3
You should wear whatever you want to wear since when did clothing have a gender
Sometimes the bright side is hard to see, but at least I'm taking a few major steps to get out of the shadow (and to rid of the shadow on my face, lol). I also screenshotted this so I'd remember it.
Damn I wish there were more shops on this level that made their stuff out of something other than plastic.

Not to mention with prices like that I'm all but expecting to scratch that label to find Shein under the Sp00k sauce.
The real designer seems to be [Askasu Blue](https://www.facebook.com/AskasuBlue)
I'm too lazy to go back for it but I've found in the past that these websites that advertise these clothes are stealing the designs and are very poor quality. I don't remember the original designer but it shouldn't take long to find if you do want them. They're a lot pricier on the designer's website however (and probably worth it).
I can't tell, it's that a good scream or a bad scream?
My favorite too
I actually bought that dress and it does not sit right like it does on the mannequin. Like the crossing across the waist and chest doesn't just do that on your body, idk you'd need tape or something
I don't have the link for the dress, but it is from [Licemere](https://licemere.com).
I don't have the chest to pull it off, not yet at least.
I sorry about that with these types of sites, but for cheap my thought it might be worth trying to decide if I even like the style at all.
This is the precise reason I got into making my own clothes. Only I know my body and how to make something flattering.
That one is my favorite as well, might buy it just to keep in the back of my closet until I'm ready
The part that sucks for me is that I'm thin but I don't have the body shape for these dresses
I haven't been comfortable in my skin ever. Seeing this as a goal for myself allows me to start finding that comfort.

Edit: spelling.
Honestly I'm probably going to end up using these as inspiration to get items from etsy to build this look
LOL
I hear that. When you try fighting your demon's one on one for long enough, eventually the battle starts to feel unwinnable. I'm stuck at the bottom of the Marianas' trench, it's dark as heck here but I still wanna see the light one day. Someday.
a quick look through the shop told me they're 100% dropshipping

update: I was able to find atleast one of the dresses on aliexpress
Definitely good to know.
Kind of a sympathetic scream
I too wish I had the body and confidence to wear things like that ya know
Me three. Top right is sexy AF
Good to know, thanks!
Oh honey you do for the pentagram part! Hang tight I'll find a link and show you
I can help you find the pieces so you can wear something similar now if you like :)
[look at the second photo on this listing ](https://www.etsy.com/listing/241012756/lilith-pentagram-cage-top?click_key=7a66ecd4d4844592436c8e117263310a4618e2fc%3A241012756&click_sum=792e39e1&ga_order=most_relevant&ga_search_type=all&ga_view_type=gallery&ga_search_query=pentagram+strap&ref=sr_gallery-1-5&organic_search_click=1&cns=1)
That is so cool that you make your clothes , I can hardly darn a sock 🧦
That’s a great idea, I should probably do that
I love your phrasing - fund that comfort!
Hell yeah!
I'm lucky, my wife is pan so my gender identity means nothing to her love for me. She will support me all the way.
The Mariana trench has bioluminescent creatures, do they count?
I think the removal of my facial fair and hrt will help me acheive my goal of indeed wearing something like that
I will not be ready for anything like that until I am at least mostly done getting my facial hair zapped off
Do they make things like this that are more neutral / for flat chested ppl? I'm trans masc nonbinary and love the aesthetic but I've had top surgery and skirt like things make me dysphoric. But I love the pentagram straps and stuff
It's worth putting in the effort to learn. Even starting with tailoring stuff you have, it's a huge confidence boost when you look in the mirror
LOL, oops. Although I did finally fund laser hair removal.
The shimmers of light bring some joy to life, you are correct. Though they're sometimes creatures beyond human comprehension and those spook me.
Well whenever you are ready, we are all here to support you and tell you how good you look!
Yes! You can totally wear one flat chested, the pentagram tops are elastic and adjustable! [look at the second product photos for an example ]( https://www.etsy.com/listing/241012756/lilith-pentagram-cage-top?ref=share_v4_lx)

"ah yes the ""clothes shopping while in-between genders"" experience"		"Ugh so relatable 😭 also when you put on and xs and it fits in the arms and shoulders but everything else is too tight, and the small is just too long and baggy 😭 amazing art btw! So gunna follow you 🥰
My body is very thicc on the hips. I am more masculine and want to wear mens clothing, but nothing fits. I have to buy 3xl in mens clothing but sometimes my hips won't fit in that size either, since men have more narrow hips
You can find more of my art and comics at my [insta](http://Instagram.com/ashleyloob) / [twitter](http://twitter.com/ashleyloob)!
I have the opposite problem, I'm obese and I've noticed there's a lot less plus size clothing in the men's section🥴
It may be useful to remember that tailors are still a thing and they can be found everywhere. Their work is surprisingly inexpensive considering its utility.
So damn relatable! European and Asian brands at the thrift store are lifesavers in that regard at least.
for smaller people shopping for masc clothing (i.e. i am typically XS women's), shop in the boy's section: teen boys' XS is pretty close to XS womens. (In canada). When I was in the states, i was straight up shopping in the children's section.
And pants that I can't fit in because of my hips :(
Hell, even with a cis male body, it’s sometimes hard to get men’s clothes that fit properly. Not as hard as finding clothes in women’s sizes, but still. Men’s clothes seem to be made for the ideal man, a built hunk with wide shoulders and large torso. If you are skinny but also average height, like me, then you’ll find shirts and jackets that fit perfectly in the sleeves but are too baggy.
Need one coming from the other angle where, ""Nope still too small"" and/or ""Nope still look like a fridge.""
Or trying to buy a skirt with S hips and XL waist.
I am...sadly the opposite. Depending on brand, mens xxl or 3xl. The disheartening part is how many cute things dont get made that big due to the aim at smaller people. But i dont have the drive to lose weight just for clothes.
all men’s clothes look like women’s clothes on me bc of how extreme my figure is.

people are always like “your style’s so unique, where do you shop?” & i tell them it’s just men’s clothes & they literally *don’t believe me*.

“men’s clothes aren’t designed to make you ass look like that, though!” thanks, have we considered my ass is not designed to *be a part of a body that fits your narrow standard of androgyny*?
This is why I love shopping Hollister brands of clothing. They have XS in pretty much everything.
I honestly like more baggy clothes when I’m feeling masc
Aren't all men's clothes baggy?
Your art and use of colour is very nice
Did you draw this? I love it!
Rip — x/xxs?
Women’s extra small still fits baggy on me. I use crop tops as shirt sometimes, and I have to tuck in most of my shirts because they all fit me like dresses.
I regularly buy tshirts from the childs section.
Get yourself a tailor. Minor alterations to a shirt, like taking in the shoulders, aren’t usually crazy expensive and make a world of difference.
Im lucky I'm big tho i have shoulders that dont even fit in some mens clothes lol. Sometimes it feels like my body was made to wear mens clothes. My hips are a touch too big but otherwise it fits good
Maybe more like **one** 'clothes shopping while in-between genders' experience...
my size will never make me a part of this fucking identity
Mens Small juuuust barely works for me if it is close to 100% cotton and I can shrink them on high heat! Lots of guess and check, sadly. :(
This is so damn true. I think I’m gonna start sewing.
I love the way you worded the title.   
""Are you a boy or a girl?""  
""Actually I'm in between genders right now, try asking me in a week and I'll let you know""

I gotta try that response one day...
God mood! Buy mens and it’s always to baggy. Buy woman’s and the arms are too tight.
I feel that so hard! Except for me it's I'm Amab and all my lady clothes look small and uncomfortable 😂
Please I always have to shop in the little boys section 😭
When I try on new blouses, it's always either the shoulders are too tight, or the sleeves aren't long enough.  Then I'm getting into XL territory and there's too much chest room.
I put on the XXL “women’s” shirt and it’s still too fucking tight.

I just want to feel small god damn it is that too hard to ask for??
relateable, i have no freaking idea what the sizes on clothes even mean at this point
Ugh, this, but the inverse for me. I’m relatively large and typical femme clothing options fit me like a cupcake paper on a loaf of bread.
Sometimes xs is too small for me ;(
Yo same
Yepppp. Or how every pair of mens jeans is either way too tight in the hips or super baggy in the leg.
You could try men's skinny jeans?
i’m kinda the opposite. i’m bigger and i really love baggy clothes
Me going shopping.
Haha! I was just at the mall trying on men's clothes. I'm too small to even fit into an XS. I'm teaching myself to sew for this reason. 

Unisex shirts usually fit well. I just hem a few inches off the bottom.
*crying in genetically large person*
Okay, so which one of ya’ll gonna start up a NB clothing brand?
small is too small and medium is too big. I'm in between sizes so I go with the medium lmfao even tho I have a binder and smalls could work it just hh
this is very relatable and this character looks like me, same hair cut and colour. yes i saved this comic to my phone.
Ugh I feel this so hard.
I'm AMAB and I have to buy size L women's shirts, but XS trousers. Lol
I just got back from goodwill and am having this experience!

Found some men's corduroy pants that are 42 in the waist and just barely fit. Had to buy a button down shirt that was a 2xl men's and is super baggy but the only one that fit
Check out Jade Fox (and her fashion channel, Made you looks). She's a cis woman (I think?) But she's got a really masc style and gives advice to others with a ""traditionally feminine"" shape on how to dress masc AF.
Can you sew? If you split the side seam on each side - it doesn’t need to be a long split, just a few cm - it will give your hips some room. (Talking about shirts, not pants)
I've been struggling with this for 10+ years. ;__; regular stores don't usually even carry sizes that fit me in women's OR men's clothes.
Same!!!
Thanks for links! <3
""Too small! (tries on XXXXXL)""  
""Why does this feel so light?""  
""Where are my damn pockets?""  
\*Gets directed by the staff to the men's section\*  
""Ugh, why are the men's clothes so drab?!""  
""Fuckit, hoodies and sweats again""
And there's never any colors other than black, navy, khaki, and olive drab. ;_;
This! The one I go to doesn't always have xs (I'm lucky when I do find something xs) but their regular smalls are sometimes ok, they're not ridiculously baggy like other brands at least
ughh even the socks. ( I buy womens socks for this reason )
  I have to find the smallest men's size everything if I'm on the masculine side of the spectrum.
Sadly, i can't

Feeling pretty masc, even though I'm not binding nor packing! Baggy clothes ftw		"Fuck yeah cargo pants. The magic gender-benders. The wearable backpacks. The quick release systems for seggsy times. The best buddies after a big meal. 

God i could go on forever
Unrelated but u have an awesome room
Cargo pants and shorts give me the most gender euphoria omg. I love how yours are tapered! They look really good. You look awesome! 😎💯
I'm sorry, but are you using the lower half of a Thinkpad as your desktop keyboard?
Your hair looks very fluffy and ruffle-able. I love you!
Those pants 😍😍
Excellent pants, hair, and choice of chair! You’ve got a great nb vibe nailed down.
You look great, OP! I like your style
Cool bedroom but that computer setup ain’t ergonomic you’ll hurt your neck
Thoroughly enjoying ur gender
Omg I love your room
You will never feel more powerful than by wearing men's cargo pants.

Enjoy being able to carry a laptop in your pocket.

Edit: I specified men's cargo pants because I've seen women's pants and they are sad excuses for cargos.

Enjoy your power, Themperor.
Off topic but I love your room
You’re incredibly cute and handsome. You’re absolutely rocking that style. Also as others have said, your room is also on point! Very cosy and vibey.
Chris nice and bubbling
I love your hair!
The fit and the room go insanely hard. Massive dubs.
you look amazing!! i wear hoodies all the time because they’re so gender affirming lmao. also your room is super cool!!
Holy shit someone finally ironed their flag
🔥🔥🔥
This ROOM tho I love your aesthetic friendo
Love that, but those socks are distracting me because I want a pair.
Looking awesome
you’re cute, *and* you know how to iron your flag? dayum, 12/10
this, I've only seen these kinds of rooms in TV and movies lol
Lenovo sells the ""lower half"" as a separate device: https://www.lenovo.com/us/en/p/accessories-and-software/keyboards-and-mice/keyboards/4y40x49493

Clothes have no gender. Skirts should be for everyone.		"Your body type is so perfect for that skirt, i hope you have more like that bc daaaamn. Its absolute fire on you, esp with the turtle neck. Second pic is my fav, i really love those shoes
Agreed.
That skirt may not be for everyone though - - it was clearly made for you!!! 🔥🔥
Skirts are so flowy. Everyone should get to feel the joy that comes with that fact
You are sooo cute!  Would you be upset if I saved your picture to use as inspiration for a drawing?  I would love to draw you!!
You are absolutely *rocking* that skirt my friend! I also really dig your beard, if thats okay to say - you're looking snazzy as fuck!!
All of this is amazing 😍
Agreed!!! Men in dresses and skirts which extend to Assigned Male At Birth are fab!!
The skirt is cute on you. But have you tried other sweaters like turtle necks? I think a normal round or v-shaped neckcould benefit you more 😘 If you get easily a cold neck, you can still use a neckerchief. That's also a nice opportunity to give your look a little thrill like in a signal colour.
Living for the skirt shoe combo in the second one!
I mean, my clothes have a gender, but yours don’t have to
Absolutely could not agree more, fuckin' killin it too btw!~✨💕🌸🤘
True! True! True! It took me a while to realize that and when I did, it was such a relief.

You look awesome, btw!
i love these outfits, the colors are so good! i'm obsessed with the leggings too, you're killing it
You look amazing babes
Definitely love the skirt!! Super cute my dude!!
Agreed! And that outfit is adorable 🥰
A beard and skirt are a very solid combo
Exactly!! Looks great on you!!
Thank you that’s so sweet of you to say. I have like two or three different denim skirts that I think look good on me. Those shoes are like my favourite pair I love everything about them from the chunky high heel to the buckle up straps."	wzdx6b	NonBinary	1264	1.0	2022-08-27 21:24:44
Trying new clothes for my company dinner this week. What do you think?		"For a company dinner my thought would be not to wear a crop top.  It looks awesome, just not work appropriate
I think pearls would suit you
You know what, my friend? It's totally not my jam but I think you're killing it!

I just might not have your confidence though? I hope you have a great time!
Beautiful first of all!! But if I may say something I wasn’t asked to 

I don’t love the top. I guess I would use a blouse or a shirt, and the makeup is a little too heavy for the more business casual outfit.

You look fine and congrats on having the guts to go with what you like to a party, but my recommendation would be to tone down (a little) the makeup (like a nude lip instead of the red and a lighter eyeshadows) the top is fine, I just wouldn’t use it
I think you look freaking awesome! Love the splash of pink, definitely brings it all together. I think your colleagues will be stunned, cause that's what you look like: stunning!
Ahh, love your makeup/beard aesthetic! 🤩
Omg love it 🥰
You look so good!!!

I agree with others that the crop top may not be work appropriate, but I saw you were going to get a blouse. Another option would be super high waisted pants! I love a crop top + high waisted pants that cover the midriff.
Love the bottom fits well and you def got the legs!  If you’re going with that pink top I would consider another shade of lipstick, otherwise it’s a yes!
You'll be the most gorgeous person there, and it mught get awkward with everyone being completely entranced by you, but other than that, 11/10.
What a snack 😘
You look fantastic and that pop of pink on Youngs stunning! Also, makeup is on point and I'm obsessed with that lip color!
Others have kind of said the same thing but I’d go with a more conservative shirt under the jacket for a work event. Even if it’s a chill workplace can’t be too careful and you can most definitely rock a business casual shirt :)
If you don't suit up like this for work than what's the point on working
You look amazing
Looks great your a beaut! I will say depending on your work a crop top might not be the best choice!
Lovely ❤️
Love this!!!
Damn fine fit - 10 out of 10.
You look gorgeous! 😍
The color balance is on point. The cut fits your shape very well.

10/10
Uffff you look amazing
u look amazing!
I love your outfit!!
Wow looking good!!
You look incredible!!!! Im bias cause I love pink but I love the top!
You look really pretty 😁
That crop blazer is EVERYTHING. Where'd you get it??
found my internet crush
I like this outfit alot
Love the fit, I think you look great! 😁
I love the whole thing 100% beautiful!
You look fantastic!
Love it !
You look fabulous
fucking slay
Love the pants and jacket, and the bright sparkly color of the top. I work in a pretty conservative industry, so I agree on skipping the crop top - but depending on your work it may be totally fine. You rock the crap out of it! 

My suggestion would be a bright, pop color fitted top. Love the vneck idea. Eyes I would stick with a nude shimmer and mascara. Pop color on the lips that coordinates well with the top you color.

Post what you end up with!
Yays! Slay Queen! 🥂💃
I don't see no problem with it! I think you blurred the definition of two genders EXTREMELY well; you demolished the separation of the two, in my opinion! You just executed the look flawlessly 🖤🖤 I think next company dinner, you should go for this look or something similar, gorgeous x
Love the fit and color scheme
Yep, I agree. I am going to get a blouse today :)
I should try! I bought my first necklace last week, and this one literally yesterday. I am exploring jewelries :)
I have the confidence online, let's see how it goes at the party! But thanks, appreciate it :)
I agree! I don't have a blouse yet :( 

Make up is still a craft I have to master! Everyday results vary by a lot 😂 I'll go lighter for the real party. This was a tryout.

Thanks for the tips ☺️
Awwww, thank you! I really love black and pink combinations. Really looking forward to rock this style in public!
Thankssss!
Aww thanks 😊
I love high waisted pants too, but they are quite difficult to find for me because of my body. I do quite a lot of gym and female clothes usually don't fit me very well on the waist.  


I'll find something :D
Thanks! What shade would you suggest? I have red, black and a more neutral one (skin tone, pinky)
Aaww! That's too much, thanks ☺️
Thanksss
Yep, agreed! I bought something today to replace that :)
Agreed!
Thanks :)
Thanks! yeaaaah, I am going to swap that for a shirt/blouse :)
Thank you! :)
thanks :)
Daaamn, thank you! 10/10 kind person!
Ty ☺️☺️
🥰
Thank youuu!
Primark! I love it :)
Awww!
Thanks :)
Thankssss!
Thankssss!
Thanks :)
Thanks :)
Thank you! :)
Yaaaas!
Thanks for the tips! I will definitely post it :)
Yaaas!
Awwww that's so kind! Thank you :)
Go for it!
Thanks :)
Something with a V neck would look great with that blazer.  Stick with a similar color too.  That magenta looks fantastic on you
Good luck and have fun on your exploration. Sending hugs
Ha! I'm a bit the same. I'm definitely more open here than I am IRL!

I'll keep trying to be bolder if you do though? 😁
I actually love the makeup how it is, the dark eyeshadow brings out your eyes and the bold lip complements that really well
Honestly it depends on the top you’re wearing, so like for that top in the pics I would go more neutral, you don’t wan the colors to be fighting  the top will always win, more surface area, so something that either sets it off in a flashy cool idgaf kinda way (like black) or compliments it….
Thanks! I am looking for more different types of clothes but I am still new to this. Thanks for the suggestion!
Thanks you, I will! :)
Yaasss, that's the idea! Keep going until you are comfortable
  
Thanks :)
I see, thank you for the suggestion! I have absolutely 0 clue about what I am doing. All my clothing and make up started like a month ago, I am very new to this :)
My manager wears crop tops all the time, I work at a nice restaurant, she does wear high waisted pants though, so her belly isn't showing, so that may be an option to consider.
That's the dream! I'm headed to the post office this afternoon to pick up shoes and dresses. It'd be a shame if only Reddit saw the stilettos 🤣
Yep, I am really looking for those but it's not easy to find something that matches my body type. I really wish I could find clothes more easily!
Definitely! Go out with thoooose
I feel that, I'm pretty tall so pants are hard to find, recently found out tall jeans exist tho, so I'm working on broadening my wardrobe.
😁 Fingers crossed!
For me it's more that I am kinda muscular, so when I find something that fits my thighs, it does not fit my waist, or viceversa. It's kinda dificult, I feel you!
I feel that, I'm the opposite I have to squeeze into like a size 2 if I want pants to hug my thighs, my waist isn't big but it's widish for my hip size
Yep, clothing issues for everyone! Not easy at all"	zmhxqi	NonBinary	1233	1.0	2022-12-15 10:29:42

I'm sure you'd look great! Button ups and Chinos are a staple!
Would you believe me if I told you I'm not wearing a binder? *they're just small af*

Target, my friend! They're not as pricey but look nice!
Target, Goodfellow & Co, they're about 35$ a pair 🙂
You know it! Shoot to thrill 🕶 😎
Ruh roh! Fabulous commenter alert!
The highest compliment 😮
Thank you!!🙂
*dapperly bows* thank you friend 🙂
I've never had this said😭 I wish you all the Euphoria what your dream attire and appearance is wanting to be!❤
😂😂😂😂😂😂 my friends dads😂😂😂
Make sure you match colors. Especially the shirt and the pants, dark blues work really well together for me and I brighten the fit with brown belts and brown shoes.

Honestly I mostly experiment with colors, so use what colors match you, or you love to wear, and experiment with how it looks to you. 🙂😁
You’ve activated my trap card (which of course makes the flirting worse), I put my monster in defense mode and end my turn…
Ok you got me I'm now off to buy the button up I've been thinking about for weeks
Damn I envy you. The most powerful enby!
Oooo, that's even better! Looks good and doesn't break the bank! Hells yeah!
aww <3 thank you
Hahaha yes
*fumbles with Pokémon cards*

*this- this is all I have, plays an Aggron EX and ends my turn..*
DO IT, best tips to give you is if you're wearing cool colors try brown belts and shows to pop the cools, they go well together.
I bind sometimes though, for peak flat chest euphoria
Yeah, they are about 35$ a pair.
*Totally thinks that’s def a Yugioh card*

I draw a card… do you have any 8s?
So THAT'S your secret :D
This, plus cardigans in the winter if it's a more casual job - corduroy jackets are perfect for more business jobs. Though if you're working retail... jackets are pointless, everything sucks, good luck and godspeed. 😩😂
Nice!
I reply ""no."" I throw down a yellow card *UNO!* I yell.
*they're on to us!!!! AAAAAAAAA*
It is my DREAM to dress like members of the Peaky Blinders...one day I'll live a dapper lifestyle.
*I jump up and throw down several cards against humanity in no particular order*
“Dos!” I exclaim
Dammit now they got frightened again, I knew something was fishy about that dating coach
Absolutely. You'd kill it!
*uuhhhhhhh*. *GO FISH!* I yell triumphantly!
Lmao!
*I toss the wizards hat of victory on the floor*
We may begin the dance of winning! *Awkwardly circles the hat*
*huzzah!* ad we join hands and dance eagerly around the magic wizard hat.

You’re right about that.
Your tattoos are so fucking cool!
Super freaking cute !!!
I would like to say I love you. Seriously.

That outfit is fucking amazing, magazine worthy! You ate and left no crumbs!
Oh my gosh you are stunning, like wow
Ass for days
I love how simple but awesome those tats are!
lord have mercy
I love how you change so much with those glasses. Usually people who wear glasses look weird without them but in this case you don't. Not really the clothes but like the smile and it doesn't seem forced, the euphoria of feeling great and beautiful of yourself
I love your outfit!
Curious since you are using celsius weather instead of fahrenheit you probably live in Canada. Also from the building architecture and things being spread apart unlike Europe where buildings are closer. Your environment gives Ontario vibes but not downtown metropolitan area

nope honestly one of the least painful tats i’ve gotten
thank u! i love funky sunglasses
i’m canadian but i live in the usa
this is so kind!
i am sorry
I personally would check you out. Ur queerness and just outfit is so much to put me in a gay panic state 😂
I would respectfully check you out. And as a genderqueer trans man I wouldn’t have to wonder if it’s gay bc it always is😂
Best vibe. Best.
Would you want the same reaction with girls or just guys? I feel girls do more comparisons rather than guys thinking how to get with someone. I don't know if it's society patterns of cisgender society
Priceless 🤌💋
Oh wow. I planned on getting tattoos too but I chickened out.
Okay fair enough stay safe out there in the wild world
idk i think in life im perceived more femme than masc do i think if girls checked me out theyd def know it was gay? idk tho im just a genderless blob
Holy cow, you look incredible!!!

ohhhh yeah i'm a boy lol, thank you for explaining😄
i've never actually wore purple, i wanted this cute royal purple top i saw while shoppin with my mom and she put it back because ""it's for girls, people will think you're gay""
By her & my family’s logic I’m the gayest mf with all the purple I wear & am the icon of sin. You def could pull it off
my locs were purple once if that counts😂 nobody in my family or friends irl know's i dress like this is the thing

Amazing quote
Looking great and I absolutely adore that quote.
This is a magnificent photograph—really, it’s quite excellent: the subject, the framing, everything.
That's one of the reasons I coined the word freedressing in 2004.
Thank you! My mom bought me that skirt when we visited Portland, Oregon in 2004. So there is a lot of sentiment attached to it.
Huzzah! There's nothing quite like the glam life, even if you're on a budget hehe :)
Thanks. I love this word and I'm going to use it. Also, thanks for posting this. The first time I read this quote, many years ago, it opened my eyes to the fact that freedressing is ok. Before then, I'd always been afraid to
i love that term!! i’m nonbinary, and i frequently feel like i have to dress more masculinely than i want to just to look androgynous. but i don’t have to live up to anyone’s idea of androgyny, i can wear whatever i want

I mean hey I only tell the truth there"	xq9uhb	NonBinary	1128	1.0	2022-09-28 11:13:02
I wish it were possible to be SOCIALLY androgynous	"A common thing nonbinary people talk about is wanting to present as androgynous so that people couldn't tell whether they were men or women.

Honestly, giving it more thought, that sounds like the *dream*, and I'm jealous of anyone out there who has truly achieved this effect.

The issue is, I have little interest in physically presenting androgynously. I like having facial hair, wearing gender neutral clothes (which are really just men's clothes when you're AMAB), and I'm naturally muscular/broad, so I'm pretty much doomed to be perceived as a man for the rest of my life. Even if I grow my hair out, painted my nails, feminized my voice and used make-up, I'd still be perceived as a man, just a gay one.

Unfortunately, socially transitioning to nonbinary without presenting as androgynous is impossible. Like, what am I supposed to do? Tell people, ""Hey, could you please just *delete* the part of your mind that sees me as a guy? Great! Thank you!""

I only feel like my gender (or lack of it since I'm on the agender spectrum) can only ever be affirmed by other nonbinary people. I was in a group with them earlier today at my college and it felt significantly less annoying than being considered 'one of the boys' or 'my friend who is a boy.'"	"Within a small group of friends that I have known for 10+ years, yes, being socially androgynous is possible. 

Most of the world just has no idea outside the binary genders.
As an older enby, maybe I can provide a different perspective. 

Before I knew what non-binary was, I was presenting socially completely independent of presenting in a physical way - in certain contexts to certain people.  In a way, they were seeing me more clearly than (at the time) I was seeing myself.  I related to some people in a way that was inexplicable to them (and me) and wasn’t categorized or limited by gender boundaries.  You probably have examples in your own life too.  

How you look is only part of the equation, but finding those affirming social relationships/situations can be difficult.  Part of that is recognizing them when they happen, as well as accepting them for what they are.  Sometimes you have to parse meaning from language that isn’t affirming, because people may not have the vocabulary to describe what is.  Also, sometimes affirming language can be taken the wrong way because of where it comes from or even one’s own toxic internal dialog.  

This isn’t to say appearance / presenting in an authentic way is secondary, but often we present in subtle ways socially and sometimes people pick up on it.  

I’ve had the good fortune of inhabiting spaces/situations “unsuitable” or “unorthodox” for my chromosomes.  Consider if you have as well. There was certainly a lot of bad too, but after some reflection I found the good.   Even the bad can be affirming, as rejection by binary structures can reinforce one’s authenticity.  

The representation of something isn’t the actual. The actual you doesn’t have to present or represent yourself in any specific way.  Even struggling with wished appearance vs reality can be affirming - though I understand that it isn’t much of a comfort.  The thing is, you don’t have to present physically to be “seen”.  It does make it easier for some people, but how you present is for YOU, not them.  

Finally, androgyny comes in lots of forms.  I’m only saying this next part because there seems to be a sense of futility and sadness about appearance.  Please ignore if I’m wrong. 

Silhouette can make a big difference.  Fit and color can help too.   Winter is coming and winter wear lends itself to androgyny.  Leggings, an oversized sweater, and a cute beanie can really work.  Belting the sweater can create hips.  Gloves or arm warmers can make you hands seem smaller.  Layers can really work in your favor too.  At the very least, it’s a cozy way to hang out at home.  

Sorry if this is rambling and all over the place.  It’s a bad brain day for me but I really felt compelled to reply.
I used to want to be referred to as andro until I realized its a binary term... it exists between the binary of man and woman. I am outside of that. The only way for people to see me for who I am is to socially stop labelling people ""man"" or ""woman"" automatically.
Even if you did present in an androgynous way people will still make assumptions.  I’m AMAB, and people are more likely to assume I’m a woman than ask me or guess I’m non-binary. I’m still seen as a man most of the time though.

Your best bet is with queer people especially trans, and non-binary people but it’s no guarantee. Most cis people don’t think about this sort of stuff, and when they do it’s usually a fantasy they made up or misinformation.

Hopefully you get to know more people who will understand who you are, and that will help with most other people not getting you
Same. I’m afab and find the idea of top surgery and changing my beautiful closet of carefully chosen pieces for beautiful outfits very daunting, but I want more than anything to be able to slip in and out of being ‘one of the bros’ and ‘one of the gals.’
This is what really gets me when I am at work ""male to male"" recognition terms like dude, mate, buddy. My friends don't gender me, my family doesn't gender me, I mostly exist in a genderless void and then bam, ""sure thing buddy"" pulls me right back to my hideous male flesh sack.
I hope one day we'll get there. They gender neutral will be as much of a class as male or female, that social customs of behaviour from and towards people without a gender will become as established as those for men and women. I'd love to say, bring on the day where the classes and customs don't exist for any gender, but they seem to be quite important to cis people and I wouldn't want to deny them their gender expression like mine has been. 

I do present androgenous, people do ask me my gender or get it wrong. And I love those moments. Cis people think they've offended me, but I can explain to my friends how awesome it feels to just be free of any judgements or expectations placed on me by my gender. 

I hope that you get to experience some moments like that. It's nice to have them with the queer gang. Bit by bit the rest of the world will catch up.
I'd say try some of the small changes on for size first like you mentioned the growing out hair, make up and nails if you haven't tried them. I personally I perceive them more as things that push you towards androgyny rather then gay male presentation.

Growing my hair out really helped with a lot dysphoric feelings which was a relief so I'd try the small actions first to see if that helps.
Put everyone around you on enough psychedelics that their visual systems stop trying to guess genders from faces. I've had that effect before, and it was really interesting.
Check my profile to see my presentation. Even if you do try to present androgynously, people will try very hard to find anything to push you into one of the binary boxes. Even while presenting as masculinely as possible and I pass perfectly fine, my voice is enough for people to push a label on to me.
I've been having this issue but with voice dysphoria. I want an androgynous voice but it is a narrow line to hit. 

For reference, women have a voice range of 255-165hz to be perceived as female. Men have 155-85hz. The range for people to be unsure of your gender is 165-155hz. That is tiny, and your voice will fluctuate out of that range naturally when speaking.

So I dunno what I'll do yet. Part of me fears how people will perceive and treat me, and this change is permanent so no going back when you start. On the other hand, it sounds kind of cool to have a voice that you can pitch up or down and be perceived as whatever gender you want in the moment.

This doesn't even account for loss of voice quality during puberty and whether you can regain that quality if you stop midway through puberty....
Are we the same person?? Honestly I haven’t had much luck with men not treating me like “one of the boys”, but just being a masc person who doesn’t try to fuck or be weird with any woman who just *exists* has helped with women. I’ve just always been treated better by groups of girls.
Growing your hair out and shaving thoroughly might give you a more feminine look pushing you a bit towards androgyny. Although as you explained that's not quite what you are looking for.

It might help to find a very mixed friend group. Some women, men, and enbys. Then it's less likely that you are seen as one of the guys and more one of the group.
most of my friends are opposite my AGAB for that reason. makes it easier for me to feel like I'm an in between.
I feel this as an AMAB with a beard. I still wear eye makeup and nail polish on accepting circles, which helps me, but it's hard because I work with people with intellectual and physical disabilities, and it's not a concept I bother to bring up there. An elderly individual I work with calls everyone ""big boy"" as a tell of endearment, which sucks. 

I've definitely started hanging out with more accepting people and that's boosted my self esteem in some ways. DnD is also a very accepting place once you find the right groups, and bring able to play whomever you want helps
Social transition without physical transition is possible and still very valid!
Yep. Curvy AFAB here and even with my SEVERAL They/Them pins on my work vest (one right above my name tag)......I STILL get called ma'am/miss. Or Miss Orion. Super frustrating.
Heavily related to this. Although i already have long hair and am not as interested in painting my nails but yeah I’m quite stocky and a bearded amab as well. I know that i would like to get laser removal surgery for my other body hair (whatever isn’t my face and my private areas, i have never enjoyed having body hair everywhere since puberty. Although i have always enjoyed my facial hair. But yeah I’m very afraid that I’m going to get hate crimed if i dress and present in an alternative way to my assigned gender
Yeah, huge agree. My ideal gender experience is that I present however I want (which is often v femme) and no one genders me. No luck so far lmao
As an aside, havinf facial hair and a large body does not preclude androgyny. Look up ""positive"" vs ""negative"" androgyny (I dislike the words themselves, but what they describe is useful)
Saaaaaaaaaaaame!!!
My partner and I are both nonbinary, and we've created a safe space where gender is irrelevant. But outside of our home, it's definitely still a challenge. It is annoying when people who know your nonbinary still treat you as your agab. I do hope for a world that is less caught up in the binary and open to not assuming anyone's gender.
I think I understand what you mean. I don't often care to present androgynously- I love ""feminine"" clothes and colors, and I'd usually rather wear them. But I really wish that I could have people know that I'm nonbinary anyways, instead of the constant misgendering.
The thing is, it’s as simple as cishets (and other cis people) being real allies and unpacking their cisgender structure of society and language. It is *possible* to have people view you as a person first, and then not assume your gender identity based on appearances. I have had interactions with some cis people where they were able to not push a gender onto me from the get go. But most cis people enforce this societal structure on themselves and everyone around them every single day, sometimes every single moment. It’s ridiculous to me how much gender is mentioned or applied when it isn’t relevant. It’s not on us to do the work, it’s on cis people to stop forcing a social construct onto anything and everything they see. Non-binary people are just way better at doing that. And so are many trans people, although I know that transmed people exist and sometimes disregard non-binary people and their thoughts and identities.

What cis people don’t usually understand, I think, is that this will literally benefit all of them to express themselves and their gender more truthfully as well. It’s literally a win for everyone who matters, and the only ones against it are discriminatory and enjoy the way society discriminates on the basis of gender.
What helped me is meeting knew people who only knew me as nonbinary and have only known me as using they/them pronouns.
this resonates so much with me. I’m working to appear gender ambiguous to attempt this social transition to nb and man it’s fuckin hard. my voice, my mannerisms, it’s like everything about me that isn’t my appearance still gives away my agab…
The one place I've had real success is online. When people can't see your face or body and can't hear your voice, there aren't so many assumptions to be made. I volunteer with OTW (who run AO3) and so many of us are queer and even nonbinary, it actually let's me be... me.
Have you considered hormonal therapy? <:)

You have androgynous vibes through the post if that makes ya feel better! /genpos 

I totally understand that struggle tho :( sorry you have to go through that it’s not fun /gen
I'm a very curvy afab and the degree to which I relate to you is SO strong. Like. No. Don't perceive me as female. Make is better but still wrong
Spend enough time with other nonbinary people and it's totally possible to create another category of gender in your brain. Sadly many of The Cis will not see you that way, but fellow nb people will, and good allies. I see my fellow nonbinary friends as nonbinary no matter their presentation. I dated a trans woman who at the time identified as agender, had not had medical transition, and wore ""men's"" clothes. It still felt different to me than dating a cis man, she didn't have a \~man\~ vibe in her personality.
That's why I want to buy a binder, for example. I finally managed to find some good fits. But boobs = woman.
And even then some women wear men's clothes, right? So.. yeah.. I kinda want to be called ""sir"" at least once or see someone being just unsure.
I'd love to be able to be as androgynous as possible ❤️
I feel the exact same way excet I'm afab. All I can hope for is that at least my close friends will treat me that way one day. I'm so over society treating me loke a woman because of how I look, and I like how I look. I just wish I was seen by everyone as in between...
i feel like i have social androgyny but it might be harder for AMAB people
I have transitioned physically to a middle ground and I generally wear clothing that's neutral or androgynous, however it hasn't helped socially at all. I'm still either perceived as male or as female, just weird looking enough to get transphobic harassment. I still have to constantly come out to new people and almost all still misgender me as whichever they initially saw me as 

I also wish it were possible
Have you seen the SNL character Pat? After watching that and seeing the potential comments you’d get from people trying to work out you biological gender ….. you may think twice
2 suggestions:

1) Be active online under a feminine or androgynous name (andro names tend to be assumed masc, so caveat emptor)

2) I'm really thinking of getting an androgynous if not outright female fursuit.
I'd say that I pass as Androgynous somewhat well. I've noticed some people will either guess M/F, Use neutral, or just ask. It really all depends on what you're going for.
Categorizing people into the binary genders is so ingrained into our society that it really doesn’t matter if you look “neutral”, unfortunately. I know a couple of people, including myself, who can achieve that effect of confusing people, but in everyday life cis people will just try to find one or another characteristic to choose if you’re A or B to them. When I and the SO go out we’re girls to people because hair and makeup even though no tiddies, when they’re not wearing makeup sometimes they’re read as a guy, my hair mostly makes people call me a she and I never know if they’re clocking me or if they think I’m a cis woman. It sucks, but I guess all we can do is be ourselves and hope this binary structure gets at least more flexible in people’s minds in the future.
Hanging around with other non-binary people is great 😊
This is one of the only reasons only my closest family and friends are allowed to use she with me. She/they/fae are my pronouns. I like she, it makes sense to me.

But you won't catch me dead in public with a she/they pin. I'm not giving anyone permission to see me as a woman. They/them or nothing for strangers.
I hear you. I would love it if everyone jut defaulted to 'they/them' for me, and was able to just see me for who I am.  But  the society I live in is overwhelmingly binary, and the typical first impression most people get of me is 'butch lesbian', or rarely, 'twinky gay man'  both of which are incorrect on multiple levels. Those that know me, those that matter most to me, they see me and understand me. But it would be nice to not have to explain in order for people to see me and understand me, to just be taken as I am as a first impression.  Not gonna happen, but I can dream.
It works if you are in a queer community. I don't really have a problem perceiving people as nonbinary no matter how they appear. The trick is to only know queer and trans people. Maybe that sounds impossible, but I generally spend nearly all my time in the company of queers, so it is possible to find.
thank you for posting this, i literally write about this all the fucking time but haven’t been able to actually… get the words out right, i guess. i actually even got banned from another non-binary subreddit bc i was trying to ask about this & was upset with people telling me that i needed to effectively go back to starving myself or else i’d “always be a woman” & “wouldn’t be androgynous without severe intervention”.

all i wish is that presentation didn’t matter. nobody’s presentation matters to *me*, really. i just wanna be able to be whatever i say i am in the moment; i just wanna be genderless. but my body is so sexed that it even hypersexualizes baggy men’s clothes, & that’s all people in both cis & trans spaces focuses on.

fuck the haters, we’ll get there one day. we have to. 💛💜
I relate to this. Physically I want to transition to a masculinized body, I want a flat chest and the bottom bits. But socially I want to be seen as non-binary, or like, close to man but not quite. Both gender boxes are awful and I wish The Cis would see me as non-binary. Though not like they did when I was an egg kid. It's funny (read: depressing) that people knew I was different *so they isolated me completely*, both girls and guys. So like, I mean see me as different in a welcoming way, to be exact.
Agreed, I like being sexually female but would prefer social androgyny
this is so relatable 🥲 i feel this so heavily but on the AFAB side
Personally I don't identify as either but I too like having a beard (don't like how I look like a teenage girl without one even though I'm 26 lol) so I kind of relate, but when I use the bathroom or whatever it's just easy to default to being a man, I'm very hairy all over so any time I wear shorts or short sleeves everyone can tell what sex I am.
I absolutely relate to this, but I guess on the opposite end? I present pretty femininely/feminine leaning, and I like when I can recognize I look pretty, but at the same time I wish others would see me as androgynous
FWIW I've had a bit of success here by playing fast and loose with how I refer to myself. I'm AFAB and present femme but I say shit like ""you can try to lift me up but i am a Big Boy"" or ""this kid just kicked me in the dick"". Sometimes people try to ""correct"" me but once I explain they generally roll w it and after a while they might do the same.
I can say, it will be a possibility someday. For the time being I have to be perceived either as a transfemme, a gay guy or an old lady. It wasn't the idea I had, but in the end it's still androgyny. Would love to be perceived as, something neutral. But it hasn't happened to people's minds yet.
Stay on reddit.
I say lean into your enby friends, and allow them to help you in this way. If your core group is all enbies and people who truly understand who you are, then as your social circle spreads it will be more as who you truly are, not as a misconception of you. For some folks they refuse to even consider the idea that their views on the world and other people could be slightly off, but those people make for shite friends anyways :p
Keep doing what you're doing. One day, a child will come up to you and say ""Are you a boy or a girl?"" and it will be the only affirmation you'll ever need. I'm AFAB, giant tits, like I think I couldn't look more feminine, but one time, a kid couldn't tell, and that was all I've ever needed. 🧡
hey sweetness, so sorry you feel like you’ll be misgendered your entire life 😔 it’s really not fair that our natural appearance causes people to gender us and treat us according to that assumed gender. it’s a daily battle and i feel for/with you ♥️

in my personal journey, i’ve come to a place that i daily have to let go of people’s perceptions of me. but if you’re directly in my life, i will communicate my gender and pronouns. it’s THEIR perceptions that matter most to me because they affect my daily experiences. and so even though it can uncomfortable, i muster the strength to tell anyone that comes into my circles and environments. there are a lot of non-binary people in the world, cis people will need to learn to adjust eventually. if they’re in your life, they should make an effort to see/treat you the way that you want. your true self. hopefully, you’ll get to the point that you almost always have that sense of comfort that you did with your enby friends. you can tell those people, “i’m not one of the guys or your guy friend”. whatever you’re comfortable with! i just want to encourage you to communicate with the people in your life so you can more comfortably be your authentic self 🌟
I have spent my life with people asking if i am male or female ( i am 45)
Women leaving the restroom to check if they are in the right restroom, kids asking their parents if i am a boy or girl, adults calling me sir or ma’am, it’s exhausting
People just have no clue
> and I'm naturally muscular/broad, so I'm pretty much doomed to be perceived as a man for the rest of my life

have you considered hormones? SERMs specifically
I get this with kids, they don't know if im a boy or a girl...because of my short hair and boy clothes.... I know thats just stereotypes that they put on they think is a boy or a girl but it some what comforts me knowing that got no idea what I am.
Well it is and we are!
I present androgynous & most people I meet cannot tell what gender I am. They still default to she (usually) or he (rarely)--over 90% of the time. Those other moments when someone defaults to they make life feel so much better. I just wish that was the normal thing to do, rather than guess which of their boxes I seem more like in their brains.
At some point, I stop seeing my friends as their physical form- they evolve past it. I don't know how else to describe it.

So, often when trying to describe a friend to someone else, I come up with nothing helpful. And it comes out like ""Uh. He's like shortish, but he like owns it. He kinda walks with a hop and has short hair. He dresses- uh, like regular? Baggy jeans, and a much too large button down and rides the bus.""
I definitely agree. My core group of friends is 4 people including me, with a few others that join us now and again. We consist of 2 enbies, a trans woman and our “token cishet guy” (don’t worry, he’s my fiancé and enjoys that joke). Us enbies definitely have social androgyny at this point.
THIS my friends got that totally on their own, i get clumped up with the guys sometimes and other times with the girls. Example: We were preparing for a vacation trip on foot and everyone was considering 3 guys for carrying the heaviest stuff. Our group was 2 AMAB and 3 AFAB, Guess who the third guy was!
Gender euphoria at it's finest
""The representation of something isn’t the actual. The actual you doesn’t  
 have to present or represent yourself in any specific way.  Even   
struggling with wished appearance vs reality can be affirming - though I  
 understand that it isn’t much of a comfort.  The thing is, you don’t   
have to present physically to be 'seen'""

The classic ""map vs territory"" fallacy! Man this gets into some epistemology and metaphysics of gender if you think about it too hard (a common failing of mine). I really need to read more philosophy of gender and sexuality for better language on the topics
And for people to stop assigning certain attributes or conditions to each binary. Uhggg it’s annoying bc the weak feeble human brain of today wants to categorize things in a simple way, no grey areas just black or white. It’s stifling and difficult to deal with when it’s the vast majority that is this way.
Yes! I like to dress ""feminine"" because I enjoy the colors and textures and flow of female clothes. I dont hate my breasts. I bind sometimes, but overall i think they balance out my body proprtions nicely. I just dont want to be seen as a girl. I am simply,, not a woman,,, and it sucks that i cant be my authentic self and ALSO be treated and seen as i want to be.
Exactly!
>I'd love to say, bring on the day where the classes and customs don't exist for any gender, but they seem to be quite important to cis people and I wouldn't want to deny them their gender expression like mine has been.

Dang, that hit hard. You are very right, as well as for our trans brothers and sisters 🍺
Yeah, I'm growing my hair out right now! I'm really impatient lol. Also, I'm black, so it's going to take extra long for it to get to a satisfactory length for me to define my curls.

I've always just wanted to be able to play with and flick my hair and to have it flow in the wind. I really struggle to understand why people like short hair lol.

I don't think my parents are expecting me to get such long hair, so that'll be a *fun* conversation. Hopefully, they don't make the connection.
I guess it's more just about wanting to be unlabelled *inside* other people's brains, as well as them not wanting to label me either. That would be lovely.

I don't know anything about Pat, but I take it that they actually do identify as a man/woman? I think that people should just accept nonbinary and move on.
>I'm really thinking of getting an androgynous if not outright female fursuit.

... What?
I have, but I don’t think I really want them.
Yeah. I have people I've been friends with since childhood and most days I couldn't tell you their eye color without thinking about it for a second (I don't like making eye contact lol). But I can tell you all about their personality and who they are to me!
I haven’t read anything gender specific.  The quoted bit is probably most influenced by The Society of the Spectacle.  There’s a lot to unpack in it, especially through the lens of social media (or more conventionally advertising and consumerism). 

Do you know of any serious works that explore gender?  I’d be curious to read a synopsis.
sweet :) Theres like an annoying phase that lasted for a while but once you get to a good length for me that was past my shoulders you can do all kinds of things with it and vary it for how you feel and if you ever feel uncomfortable presenting androgynously in a situation like travel or a meeting tying it up is really nice and way less effort then having short hair ever was.
The SNL Pat character, from the early 90's, never self-identified, and that was part of the joke.  The other characters would struggle with what to call Pat and would try to get them to give some definitive clue as to their sex.  I find it offensive today, but I don't remember finding it offensive 30 years ago.  This is a good example:

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xV4kBndQJlE
Fursuit, like a mascot costum but specifically anthropomorphic animal based. Have... have you not heard of furries?
This particular friend I was describing snuck up on me while I was trying to explain to his coworker who he was.

Once his coworker realized he said ""You could have just said 'The black guy'. He's the only one.""

But I guess I don't think that's a distinguishing feature.

He is also the only person to regularly forget that I am a girl (AFAB, identifying as whatever, masc personality) so I feel like it was a satisfying friendship.
Judith Butler is a name I hear a lot for theory of gender, there's also Beauvoir's The Second Sex for a reflection on femininity and gender through the lens of mid-20th-century existentialism. I think Foucault is also quoted in a lot of queer studies, not sure though. I'm sure folks in the queer theory world have better lists!
I'm getting towards the end of that annoying phase right now, and god it's so nice to be able to actually do things with my hair now.
Oh yeah...
I'm in that annoying phase and I just want it to end. I'm *exactly* chin length when I pull a strand from the top of my head forward, but it's really thick and surprisingly curly. There was no sign I had curly hair before I grew it out. I use *two* products daily to try and hold it down without making it crunchy, but it just wants to expand in all directions.

Shoulder-length now please!
Easiest way to be ungendered or the opposite gender afaik.
I'm the same way, with the thick unexpectedly curly hair. Once it gets a bit longer, you should look into getting a straightening brush. Straightening my hair helps it hold way better than any product I've tried.

My clothing may not be tactical and the pellet gun may be empty. But, I love this pic!		"Can I be your slightly confused but equally fabulous side kick who may or not be trying to start a survivor cult?
That pic makes me think of Cataclysm:DDA, which is a zombie survival roguelike I enjoy. You're like a day-one survivor who lucked out and found a gun, and is making do with whatever clothes they can get; but they managed to get a set of clothes that actually works, so they have the ""Stylish"" trait and a morale buff from those clothes. In another ten or twenty days, they'll be wearing duct tape and Kevlar, but for now they're staying mobile, traveling light, and hoping they'll find that all-important lab ID soon.
this is completely wrong. how are you going to win if the pellet gun is completely empty
I'm all about fellow armed queers! be sure to pay extra careful attention keeping that trigger finger out of the trigger well.

I had to google this to figure out what your talking about! But now I'm thinking what I can (and should) do with duct tape lol.
never thouht id see CDDA in this sub haha! true roguelikes are where its at! also, to op; keep flexin🤟🤟
The guns for show, the real weapons are attached to my shoulders ;P
Ahhh caught red handed! It's a bad habit... bad habit since the pellets are pointed (when it is loaded).
Ahh thank you! I really am flattered.
this is literally what I thought when I saw this.
Thank you! I appreciate the compliment!
Thank you ;P
Duct tape clothes are fun if you have enough time, and always get lots of attention :P
CDDA, unexpected like a sudden moose attack
haha nice. your outfit is amazing by the way.
when I first learned how to shoot real guns they absolutely drill four safety rules into you and drill you to make sure everyone else knows them too, and apply them to anything you use that fires a projectile \^\_\^

* \#1 Treat all guns as if they are always loaded. ...
* \#2 Never let the muzzle cover anything that you are not willing to destroy. ...
* \#3 Keep your finger off the trigger until your sights are on target and you have made the decision to shoot. ...
* \#4 Be sure of your target and what lies beyond it.  

* also you are cute as HECC
Thank you :)
That right there is a solid set of rules. Considered them drilled in my head. I wouldnt want to destroy a finger!"	fzxir3	NonBinary	1111	0.98	2020-04-12 14:19:55
being afab and using femme clothing doesn't make you any less non-binary ♡		"also! I usually present masc and femme things make me hugely dysphoric, but with long skirts this doesn't happen! just a tip if some other trans masc wants to try skirts and gets dysphoric of presenting femme :>
So happy for you! Thank you for the reminder. I often struggle with imposter syndrome because I’m AFAB and usually present more femme. It helps me feel authentic to hear. ❤️
This helps
I'm AFAB and neutrois and present mostly femme. Glad to be reminded I'm not alone, thank you for posting this! you're helping and reassuring people more than you know <3
Yep!!! I’ve always liked being semi-fem. Presentation isn’t the same as gender, and fembies are grand 💕
I understand that, I just get really Dysphoric when I wear anything other than a maxi dress or a turtle neck. I have to be wearing very specific colors and style to want to wear femme clothes other wise I'll stick with sweatpants and hoodies. 
   You look good!
Tell it like it is! I'm an AFAB Agender being, but I don't identity as masc or femme, though I wear dresses almost everyday **lounging in long, white embroidered nightgown**
DAMN RIGHT 👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏
You're rocking that skirt!
Yeay, thank you for this!
especially when you wear it so non-binarily!!!!
I'm AMAB and I present very masculine but I still identify as nb (specifically Agender). Sending love x
I get imposter syndrome too because my face and voice are quite femme, but I just gotta remind myself that enbys don't owe anyone androgyny **♡**
 **♡**
I'm glad if I can help peeps with my own presentation! <3
absolutely! **♡**
ty! yeah maxi skirts are outfit-wise the only femme thing that doesn't bring me dysphoria, all kinds of other skirts do sjdkdk

reminder that clothing has no gender		"Honestly clothing shouldn’t be gendered. That don’t make much sense. And it would be great for clothing business to have anyone feel fine with buying their stuff.

yeesssss you look so nice!
That's always been my motto, fo sho!

Honestly people shouldn’t be gendered.
bought it from a thrift site (mercari)!! i wish i knew where it came from 😫
Well, fitting into something is very useful for people. We like factoring into a group. That is why subreddits exist and that is why genders exist. Even being agender is factoring into a group, and that group is agender. Even if you try to get rid of it for everyone, it will naturally form back again. We humans like patterns, and humans are just other patterns on a sociatal scale.
But that’s the problem. Subreddits are grouped based on topics, interests, whatever. Gender is grouped based on... What? Self-identity? But that’s obviously circular (if being a “man” just means being “someone who identifies as a man”, then it means “someone who identifies as someone who identifies as a man” and so on into infinity, until it doesn’t mean anything at all). So long as genders exist and are socially significant, there will always be stereotypes and gender roles and so on of some sort. For something that’s nothing more than lines drawn in the sand, it’s inherently limiting and divisive and a lot more trouble than it’s worth.

(Don’t get me started on the cruel irony of treating “agender” like it’s a gender. You have the people who don’t want to be put in a box and put all of them into a box anyways.)
So I’m with you that if we get rid of gender roles and stereotypes, then things would be a lot better. I also think that we should not say stuff like gender shouldn’t exist cuz that hurts those in the LGBT community, and those outside of it, that are quite happy with the gender that they identify as. Even within the nonbinary community there are those that are demigender or a third gender that might not be happy with that idea. Now I honestly don’t know if dysphoria or a want to be a different gender would still exist, but yeah. I can’t speak for others, though. Because I’m also agender, or at least experimenting. You know, trans peeps might be just fine with genders being destroyed. I have no idea.this question should be brought up in r/trans, frankly. If you’re not going to do it, I’ll do it.
Gender is so much more than self identification. The reason we should let people self identify their gender is the same reason we should let people self identify their sexuality. If someone says they are gay, they are almost certainly gay. We don't know what a person's internal experience eis like without them telling us and gender is dependent on that internal experience.

You asked ""What is gender?"". And that's a bit like asking ""what is an American?"". On one hand you could formally define it as someone with American citizenship. But what about a child that immigrate illegally but has spent their entire life in the U.S.? Are they not American?

Identities are built upon shared experiences, preferences, tendencies, and a sense of ""sameness"" usually based on those experiences. Some of those things for Americans would be: supporting democracy, celebrating the 4th of july, living in America.

There is no one trait that defines what it means to be an American. Some American's don't support democracy. Some have never lived here (maybe grew up on a military base), some don't celebrate holidays.

Gender is the same way and definitely a group with more variance than something like nationality. People bond with people of their gender for many reasons, but no reason is better than another. Someone may feel connected to women as a group because they feel that many women have the kinds of emotional responses they do where as most men don't (for example high levels of empathy). And people perceive gender differently. Like while I may think that women are typically more empathetic, you may vehemently disagree with that.

But even though people tend to disagree on what the exact traits the define a gender are, people tend to agree that there definitely are gendered traits.
Like, one problem with just dismantling gender as-is is that people might fall back to just using biological sex to group people instead, and obviously that’s not too great. (TERFs advocate for something similar.) How do you avoid that? Honestly I’m not too sure.

It’s not an unsolvable problem though. The point is that at some point in the future we *should* stop using gender, because fundamentally it doesn’t make sense. People try so hard to be accepting of every gender expression, but it just doesn’t work that way. If you can be anything as any gender, what’s the point of having gender anyways? How would you even choose one, if not relying on stereotypes and gender roles to form an idea of what each gender is “like”?
>We don't know what a person's internal experience eis like without them telling us and gender is dependent on that internal experience.

Defining a concept based on unverifiable internal experience is going to bring serious problems. Some even argue that the concept is incoherent: see Wittgenstein's argument against private language. Beetles in a box, etc. In short: if we all have a ""beetle"" in a box that no one else is ever allowed to see - in this case our internal unobservable ""gender-experience"" - how are we even going to know we're talking about the same thing when we say ""beetle""? How are we going to categorize our own ""beetle"" when we cannot see what anyone else's looks like? Wittgenstein argues that the word ""beetle"" is not even a meaningful word in this context, which I tend to agree with. If ""gender"" is defined purely in relation to internal experiences, first we are going to struggle with how we can even meaningfully refer to it.

>There is no one trait that defines what it means to be an American. Some American's don't support democracy. Some have never lived here (maybe grew up on a military base), some don't celebrate holidays.

You're describing a cluster theory, which again, does not work very well in relation to gender (or whether or not someone is an American, for that matter). There's no reason why someone who hates democracy, who hates Thanksgiving and Christmas and the 4th of July, who never lived in America - who is the antithesis of ""American-ness"" in every respect - can't still be an American, as long as they hold an American passport. 

Similarly, unless you want to deny the gender identity of closeted trans people and crossdressers, you'd have to admit that someone can be as feminine as they want, or even pass entirely as female, and still be a man, and vice versa. (And really, do you really want a theory of gender that states that men have to be at least somewhat masculine and women have to be at least somewhat feminine, otherwise they're not really men/women?) And there, the cluster theory goes out the window.

The bottom line is, people usually want two things for their theory of gender: 1) that it doesn't deny people of their preferred gender identity and isn't restricting, and 2) that it isn't completely meaningless. 

Unfortunately, as I'm trying to show, these two criteria are mutually exclusive. Gender defined solely on the basis of self identity is vacuous and meaningless. But any more substantial gender system that adds in additional criteria above and beyond self-identity will inevitably deny *some* people their preferred identity, depending on your specific criteria used.

(And of course saying ""everyone is free to define gender as they wish"" doesn't solve things at all, since if everyone uses a word differently, that word once again becomes completely meaningless.)
It’s better to have people having any gender they want and expressing it however they want than to have no gender and have it fall back on sex.
I like you haha there's a bunch I want to address here, but I think I should read Wittgenstein on this first before I continue to make sure he didn't already address these things. But I think I see some problems with his criticisms of private language. Thanks for the reading material though!

Also, where can I read about cluster theory?
I agree. The point is that having no gender doesn’t mean it *has* to fall back on sex. We don’t treat people with different eye colors and hair colors as different social categories after all.
Ye. Now that I think about it, applying Wittgenstein’s argument isn’t as straightforward as I made it to be. It seems that we *do* manage to talk about certain internal experiences, such as *pain* or *color*: however, there is of course no way to know that someone else’s “pain” is the same or even a similar kind of subjective experience to your “pain”, and of course we can’t tell whether or not others perceive color in the same way.

But Wittgenstein perhaps wouldn’t say that the words “pain” or “blue” are incoherent concepts per se, only that the internal experience that they purportedly refer to cannot truly be what they mean.

As for cluster theory, look up “cluster concept”; one introduction is in Kripke’s *Naming and Necessity* (see pp. 30-32, 64-66), which is a fascinating (if long) read. Note that Kripke’s talking about proper names (like *Martha*, *Taylor* and such), but his definition of cluster theories can be easily expanded, and I would argue that *gender* at least in the orthodox definition behaves very much like names (or even that they really just are a third name).
True, but sex is a tad more important than eye color. It holds the capability of life and is therefore very significant without a doubt. There are also a host of different things it does to a body. The two (not counting intersex) genders determine hormone percentages naturally, which causes a host of physical and psychological changes in a person. So it is much larger scale than eye color. Those things are things that people might have trouble with and confide in others for. That is what makes it a social class of a sort.
Biological sex *does* have certain influences on the body, but I still don't think that's a good argument for it being an innate social class. We don't really have different social categories based on height (the most visible trait), intelligence (arguably the most important trait in modern society), or heart disease susceptibility, or any number of significant genetic binaries. Now obviously these things do affect people's experiences, but they don't form social categories in the same way gender does.

At any rate, with the advancement of technology, it may be that we will be able to modify our bodies to be less constrained by the binary of biological sex in the near future. Sex would be even less relevant then.
You have good points. I think once tech advances and gender norms collapse, gender is going to matter so much less. That way, gender is basically eradicated.
I hope so too. It’s going to take a while for it to happen naturally, but hopefully we can see it happening."	j6s9cs	NonBinary	1074	1.0	2020-10-07 14:52:25
Can I still be non binary if I like being feminine	"So I am pretty new to being non binary, only officially left the closet yesterday actually. So I’m really not sure what’s ok as far as being non binary goes. I’ve known for a while that I wasn’t male, but I never really liked the idea of being female. Eventually I realised that sounds a lot like being non binary, but I’m still not sure if it counts.

So I really like being more feminine, but I don’t quite want the body of a female. I just like having no body hair and wearing skirts and more feminine clothes. I just don’t know if I actually count as non binary.

Edit: Ok you guys are commenting faster than I can reply. I really appreciate the acceptance, thank you all so much."	"Absolutely. Non-binary is not a third gender category, it’s also an expansive spectrum of expression and experience. Fellow non-binary here, welcome :)
There's no ""counts"" or ""what's ok"" when it comes to being nonbinary
Just do what u want
A nonbinary person is someone who is not entirely,  exclusively, and always a single binary gender. 

Presentation has nothing to do with it. I'm a trans demiguy, and my presentation is heavily mixed. I like to call it ""fem in a masc way"" -- think the stereotypical feminine gay dude, that's my general presentation.
Nonbinary means ""not 100% a woman and not 100% a man"". You can be both, or neither, anywhere in between, or different things at different times, and be nonbinary. Nonbinary is a term that can encompass a lot of different genders and ways of being.

As an AFAB, I actually wear MORE feminine clothes now than I did before I came out. I'm more comfortable with femininity when I'm being my authentic self rather than when I was trying to ""disguise"" myself as a woman.

You don't owe it to anyone to look androgynous or masculine or feminine. Look like *yourself* for yourself.
Literally anything goes. If you don't feel male or female you can id as nonbinary. No other rules at all
Being feminine does not equal woman. And being masculine does not mean man. Society is what has enforced that belief. Be you!!
Yer an enby Harry.
Of course! You could be the most feminine (or masculine) person to walk the earth while still being non-binary.
Gender expression and gender identity are two separate things. You can be nonbinary and present yourself however you like, it's entirely up to you.
I am AMAB and present masculine (beard, mostly men’s clothes) 

But I’m very feminine in my interests, I’m the primary caregiver in our household, I don’t drive, I bake and cook, basically everything a “wife” is supposed to do I do. I love fashion and houses and when I used to play with dolls (“action figures”) they would be a family and play house. I dreamed of my wedding my whole life. Pink and purple are my favorite colors. 

Not that any of that makes “gender” but suffice it to say that I’m a mix. I present wholly male other than earrings and nails but I’m mixed in my hobbies and my abilities/proclivities. That’s why NB works so well for me and it can fit anyone I think. I honestly don’t necessarily believe that *anyone* is just one gender but that’s a story for another time
Absolutely you can! Welcome to the Femby club:)
You owe no-one androgyny, dress how you want, be who you want, all it takes is looking inside yourself and realising you aren't 100% a part of either binary gender, everything other than that is up to you.
Everyone, who participates in the binary or not, has masculine and feminine energies. Your unique experience shouldn’t be determined by how someone might see you! If you wanna be fem, be fem! There’s plenty of people that are binary that go into their other energies (amabs with makeup, afabs with tomboy tendencies); there’s nothing wrong about it!
Yes
I'm like you but the opposite
Of course! I would recommend reading around here to get a feel for nonbinary culture, but you are absolutely welcome if you choose to consider yourself as such. As others have said, nonbinary doesn’t have to be a third option to the binary, it just means you don’t feel/want to be part of the traditional binary. The beauty is that your options and combination of gender expression are much more vast than within the binary. Choose what makes you feel authentic and roll with it. Welcome to the group and enjoy the nonbinary journey, you wonderful human!
1.) There is no wrong way to be nonbinary
2.) I am a non-binary transman femboy ... There is no excuse for my existence - but lucky me I don't need one.
I'm AFAB but in the same boat--- didn't feel like a woman, liked dressing KINDA ""tomboyish"" but didn't feel like a man either. I settled on ""nonbinary"" as a label. This was when I was around 20/21 or so. I'm 30 now and still content as nonbinary so, yeah! ymmv

And, I wear what I want. some days masc, some days fem, some days a combination.... ultimately clothes are just pieces of cloth we wrap on our bodies to protect us from the elements and look nice, so i try not to overthink it
Non binary doesn't mean no gender, it means you're not constricted to one gender. That's how I see it
I'm nonbinary and don't tend to do anything to ""present"" besides wearing figure obscuring clothes. No binding or packing. I'm NB cause my brain dont give a f what the body looks like. (Most days at least) 

Still trying to figure out some good hair styles for long hair that doesn't scream girl though. *sigh*
You’re frankly allowed to do whatever you want in regards to gender and gender presentation. You are free, you don’t have to conform to any preconceived notions of what non-binary people look like
ofc!! i had to ask my boyfriend the same thing so i get where you’re coming from but yes you’re perfectly okay! act the way you want it will never change who you are:)
How you present has no affect on how you identify =] I’m non binary but I present masc and that’s still alright
Its really just about how you feel and I don't think looks have much to do with it. I'm bearded and bald but I'm still agender. Same if I put on lipstick or paint my nails, I'm still agender.
I mean at this point I feel like I'm an enby trans girl so uh yeah you can be whatever you want! I'm def very fem.
Feminine transmasc dude-thing here. There’s no rules to being non-binary, so be who you want to be!
I'm a transfemme.

I'm non-binary, and present is a way that's indistinguishable from female. It's not even that uncommon.

Your presentation is valid.
I'm taking T right now and like to confuse people by going between girl and boy mode. It's kinda funny tbh. They'll be like ""wow you look different 😮"". That's the whole point. 

Nonbinary isn't about how you dress it's not fitting between either spectrum of man or woman. Or so that's how I feel. It's your identity not how you dress and this may change over time or it may not at all.
Is enbys are chill you'll find. Non-binary is an extensive title for anyone who doesn't feel they fit exactly as male or female. Enjoy being as femme or masc as you want and use the title if it's what your comfortable with. Gender is all about feeling comfortable
Yeah! I identified as Non-binary for a while but I still liked expressing my feminine side!
Yes

-signed a bearded enby
Idk if anyone has said this yet but if a cis dude can wear a skirt and still be a dude, then a nb person can do so as well. Plus, there's a crapton of non-binary identities so it's not like you have to be this or that.
Non binary is a gender, not a set of likes. Your gender is your gender. Just like cis men can like feminine things, and cis women can like masculine things, anyone can like anything! What your like does not determine your gender!
Femmes can be thems.  ❤️
absolutely! gender doesn’t equal presentation :)
I, too, am a hater of the body hair.  If you ever figure out how to properly shave your thighs so they're silky smooth, tell me your secrets
Yes , absolutely. There is no ""correct way"" to be non binary
Absolutely!!!!
As other people have said, there's no one way to be non-binary. You don't identify as male or female? Dope, you don't have to force yourself to look a certain way. The whole point of being nonbinary is to not be pushed into boxes. <3
I'm nonbinary amab and i like being masculine
Yes!
Non binary is simply not wanting to adhere to the gender binary. It’s whatever you want it to be x
Of course you are! If you don’t identify as female or male you’re non binary. You’re beautiful, handsome and valid.
I want to say to you (instinctively): Absolutely yes. And still I am asking myself the same question. 

But deeply I think that anything that makes you feel sexy is okay. It still counts.
There is no right or wrong for being non-binary, or any other gender identity! All this stuff is made up & you can express yourself any which way you like. Your identity is still valid (:
Hell yes you can. Non binary is not the third box and don't let anyone convince you otherwise
Welcome to the family.
The best part about being non binary is your like water or clay you can take whatever form you wish to take or mold yourself into. It’s like the living embodiment of, do you. Also congrats on coming out !!!
I new I was Non Binary before anything else. As I got further into life, feminine things felt waaay better and since I was in trans social circles, I thought I might be a binary trans woman, so I tried She/They

Nope. Didn’t take long to find out while it wasn’t as uncomfortable as people thinking I’m a man, it was still wrong. 

I’m still discovering about myself and likely always will be, I hope so. One thing I’m absolutely sure of though is that I am definitely not a boy and definitely not a girl
Yes
There are literally NO RULES when it comes to being non-binary (or any gender for that matter). Be femme, be masc, be neither, be both, present completely different every single day if that's what moves you. That's really the beauty of escaping the boxes the binary keeps us in... just be YOURSELF <3
The only thing that's not okay to do as a non binary person in this scenario is being disrespectful towards other non binary people who don't like being feminine/masculine. You are not doing that so yes, you are valid, you are valid whatever you wear or however you behave! There is no right way to being non binary! And clothes and behaviour don't equal gender!
Yes yes yes! Nonbinary describes everything that's not female or male. No matter what you like or who you are, if you're a tiny chaos bean, you are nonbinary (of course only of your okay with that label 😌)
The requirements for being non-binary are:
- declaring yourself to be non-binary
I consider my identity to be part of something much greater than my masculine body. I don't make any attempts to enforce or defy any of society's expectations regarding my appearance. I dress in things that bring me comfort and joy. I like shaving my head and I think I have a distinguished beard. Most people assume that I'm male and I'm ok with that.
yeah
Yassss
Sometimes the things we like to wear and do don’t match the box that we are suppose to be sitting in.

There is nothing wrong with anyone being feminine, just as there is nothing wrong with anyone being masculine, it’s all on the same pallet of paint, just different mixtures of the same colors!
YES! Gender is exclusive and unique to each individual. So if you want to label yourself non-binary because that's what feels right to you, then your just as valid as any other.
The best thing I heard [and I don't know if it's been said already] is: ""you don't owe anyone androgyny.""


I'm also pretty freshly out, and that's what I needed to hear. If you vibe with the nonbinary label, you are nonbinary.
Welcome out! You do you hun, your gender identity isn't your aesthetic, so be comfy and embrace what makes you feel good 💕
Absolutely you can
>So I’m really not sure what’s ok as far as being non binary goes.

thats the fun part, anything goes if it makes you happy! im a femby as well. like super fem. but that doesnt take away from the fact that i’m still non-binary, and that’s how i feel. be warned though, there WILL be assholes who will say you’re not “really” enby if you arent gender neutral enough. don’t listen to those people. what matters is to do what makes YOU happy, and ignore everyone else. :3
Enjoying feminine clothes and make up does not mean that one is a woman. It also does not make one more or less of a man, or non-binary. These things are just personal expression, even if society often genders them. This was a big revelation to me, an AFAB who likes fashion and makeup, and for a long time thought that meant I couldn't be trans-masc.
As an afab he/they enby that likes looking like a boy: YES

We'll love and accept you all the same!
Yes. 

To be slightly more aggro: every nonbinary person who presents as DIFFERENT than other nonbinary people makes us, as a whole, more diverse and complicated and that is a GOOD THING. You don't have to look like other enbies. You don't have to look like anything in particular, that is the beautiful point. Good job <3

To be slightly more personal: the more I have changed my body to look more masc, the more I have been able to enjoy feminine clothes, and vice versa. The more I have let go of trying to look like one stable ""nonbinary"" gender all the time, the more varied presentations I find that I enjoy doing. Nobody is one thing all the time, even cis folks. You don't have to be, either.
Yes, you can look however you want and still be valid
A another non binary femme, welcome!!
I'm an AMAB enby and generally present masculine.  I am enby because I don't care about gender and have never felt strongly either way, so I'm agender.  That doesn't require me to do anything different.  Quite the opposite, it allows me to do whatever the hell I want.  

My personal style is motivated by my general desire to draw as little attention to myself as possible.  I don't really care about fashion or my outward appearance, nor do I care to draw the attention of strangers based on superficial judgements about my appearance (positive or negative).  I'd rather blend in and fly under the radar than stand out.  I prefer to make connections with people based on an assessment of character than looks.  That means wearing comfortable clothes with a basic haircut, which means presenting traditionally masc.

My outward appearance is not tethered to my gender because I don't attach my outward appearance to my identity.  I think we as a species put way too much stock in projecting our identities to the world via our appearance.  Some of the nicest people I've ever met wore studded belts, ripped jeans, and liberty spikes.  Some of the worst people I've ever met wore beautiful dresses and elegant, flowing hair.  The reality is that the images we project to the world, be it the rugged, angsty metalhead, or the warm, gentle mother, have very little attachment to the content of our character.  They're costumes, for all intents and purposes.

That's not to shame anyone who does care about their appearance.  I do enjoy people watching and taking in all of the different styles that people present.  It's just something that I wish people didn't take so seriously all the time.
As many others have said, you can determine your non-binary-ness however is most comfy for you! 

For myself, I tend to describe my gender as half man, half slightly-frozen apple juice from a hospital.
YESS OF COURSE
As many people stated, there is no certain style of what is non-binary. If you identify yourself as non-binary, you are non-binary. You can express yourself whatever way you like, you can dress yourself whatever way you like, just be yourself and have fun!
As everyone else has said, yep, you totally can be. Do you feel partially one way or the other? If so, you may more specifically be demi-gender.
This post was really reassuring to me, bc I recently started identifying publicly as non-binary, but have been really nervous about it for similar reasons and feelings. the support and encouragement in the comments is comforting to see. :)
The way you express yourself dont define your gender :)
And femenine and masculine are two cultural concepts that in the end dont are something specific. Cause every femenine person express their femininity in their own way.
Long hair and shaved legs don't define your gender. Identity and expression of your identity are not the same. 
Nonby dont have rules like. Being man ot woman either. A woman can look ""like a man"" with sjort hair and only wearing pants and still a woman. You can do wjatever you want with your body and you clothes and you still be enby. :)
i know there's plenty of comments already, but as a feminine nonbinary person myself i want to say i absolutely support you in your journey! expression does not equal gender and never will.
Yes! I’m AMAB (assigned male at birth) and currently present more masculine. I do want to be more androgynous, but even if I didn’t it wouldn’t change who I am.
Yes
Of course!
You can be Enby and present however you want, Use any pronouns you want, you can mix it up or go to an extreme. Whatever is comfortable for you and feels the most YOU.
Yes, non-binary is a spectrum. You can be feminine non-binary, masculine non-binary, androgynous non-binary (meaning just somewhere in the middle). Non-binary means outside the binary and not agender... non-binary people can dress, act and refer to themselves as they want. So yeah, you can wear dresses, make-up, stilettos use she/her pronouns and STILL be non-binary.  
Personally for me I'm non-binary more on a male spectrum (demiboy non-binary? Transmen non-binary... a little unsure) and would like to transition in the future to look more masculine (unfortunately in my country only binary trans people can transition tho)
A thousand times yes ❤
There are no rules or expectations. Clothes don't have any gender, and express yourself however you like to!
I feel the same way tbh. I can keep the mustache and beard though
My kid is a non-binary femme, and now they are saying they may end up as a trans boy, although they still look feminine. Their outer appearance doesn’t change the feelings inside. It’s okay to be femme on the outside and non-binary on the inside. It’s okay to be unsure. It’s okay to explore your identity and let go of rules and expectations. I am a feminine woman but sometimes I like to dress in masculine cuts or shop in the men’s section. That doesn’t make me any less of a woman. Right? No one would try and tell me I must be trans because I’m wearing my husband’s sweats. Same rule applies to you. You don’t have to look any sort of way to be who you are inside.
Honestly ive never felt more comfortable with myself being feminine than since I realised i am nb. It used to be so over the top try hard as i had zero self esteem. Now i accept i am not binary i can appreciate a cute floral dress for what it is rather than how it might make me look and how people will perceive me. Since i got some mens clothes and allowed myself to enjoy my ‘man days’ and inbetween days, ive had more feminine days than usual (i didnt realise those feelings before) and I dont worry so much about it. Before I was afraid to be feminine and often felt like a woman that looks like a man in drag (because I was literally born and assigned female and was a man inside sometimes but was wearing a dress and presenting over the top feminine. Which sounds hella complicated but oh the joys of fluidity. So now I know how I feel
Inside and can match that to outside if i want without looking like im about to perform a show.
It absolutely counts. Gender is a feeling, not a look. If you feel nonbinary, then you have every right to identify as so! :)
There's girls who like being feminine (obviously) and there's boys who like being feminine (see: r/feminineboys). Why wouldn't there be nonbinary people with the same aesthetic preferences?
OF COURSE♡♡♡
Yeah man you don’t owe anyone androgyny. If you want to dress femme then dress femme.
of course!! im nb and im more fem and so is my s/o! your style and presentation do NOT define your gender <3
ofc!! in the same vein that i can be a feminine trans man, you can be a feminine enby! gender presentation/expression and fashion sense has nothing to do with gender unless that’s what makes you comfortable
You can literally express your gender however you want at any time. You can't do it wrong <3
Of course you can, presentation doesn't equal gender and you're valid in any case :D
This is going to be a pretty non-stop journey of discovery, in my experience. I’ve been out for over a decade and have never stopped trying to figure it out. 😂

You aren’t limited to the confines of masculine and feminine, friend. No one gets to tell you the correct way of being *any* of the genders, as long as you’re not hurting anyone.
I felt the exact same way and when I came out about it it was suggested I look into Demi girl or girl flux, which fit really well and is still 100% under the nonbinary umbrella
the world is not black and white.
Gender is just the body type u born with kind of link to the soul mission u want to achieve depend on the type of obstacle u want to encounter.
feminine and masculine energy are always there accessible for both gender not gender restrictive. interchangeably
gender image is just human social construction things from the ancestor of ignorance? Reality hit their face that ppl can be feminine and masculine no matter what gender they have.
Your core energy can be masked by ur parents/society construction even if u are feminine at birth. e.g. female growing up strong feminine but taught by mother to not become too dependent on man, father act in dominate way caused her to have a masculine mask so no longer balance in her energy  n have wounded feminine energy.

I don't understand y the society has so much word play and stuff...to put it simply:
preference of...dressing towards feminine or masculine...based on ur own style without any social construction;
its mostly an inner indicator of your feminine and masculine energy/essence inside...the opposite type of energy u want to attract to balance ur inner energies or ur soul felt like/prefer to express more  through dress code/develop/focus on than another energy..etc:
there's feminine guy
there's masculine guy
theres masculine woman
theres feminine woman
 doesnt matter.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E1s5BYwNlv0

so what's within us is also whats shown on outside in a way unless u have a mask on.
that's just my interpretation.
Thank you so much, that’s so nice to hear :). I really feel like I fit in as non binary, so that’s really good to hear.
thank you!!!! too many people see nonbinary as a third gender, or its own gender ID, and while it is its own ID its also an umbrella for the myriad IDs under it
The only rule is ""don't be an asshole"" same rule as the rest of life.
Oh ok, thank you
Ok cool, thank you
'Fem in a masd way' oh it's in words!!!
That’s so cool, thank you
same lol it feels so awesome to “reclaim” femininity.
Ahhhh i’m so glad to hear this said aloud by someone else cause i feel the same way! Now that i dont “owe” it to anybody i feel more comfortable exploring all sides of myself *including* femininity which i formerly expressly denied. much love to all my fellow afab enbies figuring it out together ♡
>As an AFAB, I actually wear MORE feminine clothes now than I did before I came out. I'm more comfortable with femininity when I'm being my authentic self rather than when I was trying to ""disguise"" myself as a woman.

Literally this!! Sooooo much!!!
this is exactly me! i struggled with the validity of being non-binary for a while because like you said, when i accepted myself as non-binary, i found myself more comfortable presenting as more feminine while being AFAB, and i started experiencing less dysphoria, and that was confusing. you worded it perfectly, and i'm glad someone else relates!
I do too!
I started wearing and enjoying more clothes and makeup after I kinda figured out I was non-binary. It makes me feel less like it’s a disguise and just fun now
It's not even that. If you don't fully identify as male or female, you are an enby; some people are demigender, only having a partial gender, or genderfluid or genderflux, where you might feel like a man or a woman, but only sometimes.
Ok cool, thank you
Thank you! :)
yes! just like a woman can be masculine and a man can be feminine without invalidating their gender, a non-binary person’s expression can present whoever they want without invalidating their gender
a…. A wot???
I should’ve said that. I definitely should’ve said that.


Also, fuck JK Rowling
Thank you, that’s great to hear
Oh ok, didn’t really know about that, thank you
Thank you, happy to be included
Femby.  I love that.
Thank you, I was kind of worried being non binary meant I have to androgynous
Ok, thank you
Thank you
Yeah I’ve been getting that idea now. You guys are great on here
Ok cool, I’ll take that in mind
Hmm. But technically, agender-spectrum folks also fall under the nonbinary umbrella (because of not being strictly either ""man"" or ""woman""—nonbinary people can be demi-girl or demi-boy, androgynous (both ""woman"" and ""man"" at the same time) at various ratios/percentages, genderfluid (feeling different kinds of gender at different times), agender (lack of gender), or flux of any gender (feeling different intensities of gender), and many more!


But as an aside, isn't it somewhat of a marvel how agender can count as a gender? (As an agenderflux person, this thought tickles my funny bone like you wouldn't believe XD)
Thank you so much
Cool, thank you
Ok, thank you
Basically, shave using a sharp razor, take your time, go against the direction of the hair and use moisturiser
My secret is saying ""fuck shaving"" and zapping my legs with lasers
There’s no rush or pressure figuring out your authentic self :) hope you have some safe people in your circle, and regardless, you’ve got community here!
Trust me just be whoever u wanna be
We'll accept u (as long as ur not a total asshole ofc)
I think it's valid to watch the full gender options for South Park the fractured but whole on YouTube. Non binary is an umbrella. That game somehow managed to pack in a LOT of gender options. It should give you a direction to go to find out what flavor of non binary you are. My ""gender"" or rather total lack of is in that game. Worth a shot to see if anything fits your soul that they put in the game.
YES this absolutely as well!!! I missed that in my original comment bc I was sleepy lol but yeah u are absolutely right
Listen Harry, yer gonna go to hogwarts an’ do spells n’ shit and you’re gonna be FUCKING pleased about it!
Nah! Look at Miley Cyrus. They're nonbinary and feminine as hell 😌
It is absolutely okay to practice being a masculine presence with feminine energy. Don’t doubt yourself, just do what feels good!
I consider myself non binary, when I was a kid years and years ago before there were words to describe everything I used IT. I was masculine or feminine depending on what I was doing at that second. Sometimes I feel both equally at once. Someone's I go days being a princess and then days being a beast. It's what ever you feel like. Fluid like water and time. Hail yourself and I wish you all the best
No problem, mi amigo. I hope you have a good day =]
Any moisturizer recommendations?  Feel like that's the step I'm missing atm.
Thank you, my friends have been very supportive, family well…
I usually use CeraVe because I have sensitive skin but, my secret for avoiding bumps and razor burn, is to apply a thin layer of hydrocortisone cream right after shaving.  Now, I'm not entirely certain if that's medically a great idea, so your mileage may vary, be aware of what your skin likes, but I have that cream on hand for eczema so that's what I do.
Oof. I’m sorry they are resistant to allowing you to just exist as yourself. Lean on your friends, practice validating yourself (i.e giving yourself some assurances like “my parents don’t have to understand or agree for my gender to be valid. I am allowed to exist freely”) following tough conversations if you’re feeling shut down. You’ve got this.
Noted. Thanks for the recommendation!
Thank you and yeah friends have been helping a lot, and everyone here as well, feeling very valid right now"	rxe4c1	NonBinary	1058	0.99	2022-01-06 13:03:03
I recently discovered I am NonBinary. No one was home this morning, so I took my chance to wear what expressed my gender today(Borrowed my brothers clothes). Felt so good! This is also my first time posting. Hello beautiful cuties! (closeted, NonBinary/Genderfluid, they/them).		"welcome to the clan, you wonderful androgynous masterpiece
Welcome!
Hello comrade. Welcome to the clan!

I actually just recently found out I’m non-binary as well, so we can be in this together <3
You have big thembo energy 😍
I'm so happy for you! :) You look great.
Wow, you look amazing! I wish I could figure out how to look androgynous - you pull it off so well!
Welcome to the community! I hope when you come out your family will accept you!
nice bts poster tho ;) you look great!
I love this. I love the moment you ""discover"" your gender. It is the most freeing thing to know that your idea of yourself has a name and a place in the world!!!

congrats on ur first post, looks good!
Thanks, really happy to be in the clan! your compliment just made my day
Thanks! XD
yes, that would be nice comrade <3
Thanks I guess haha
Thanks :)
Thanks! Maybe vests/jackets and a cap could help? I'm sure you'll figure it out someday XD. Until then, don't lose hope!
Thanks for the support! Maybe they will, they're open minded. But they also say a lot of comments about me or other adrogynous friends that they do not look like their assigned gender. And I don't know if it's just an innocent comment or something else. So I'll think I'll stay closeted for now.
Thanks fellow army :)
Yes it is really magnificent. It feels so freeing. I always thought that I was something else than a woman but I don't feel trans. To finally find a perfect label is awesome!
Thanks!
Thanks Kylar!
I see you're a person of culture as well XD. Love your username!
Mood, everyone in this community looks so amazing!
Thanks for your support! I won't lose hope!
Thanks :)
Glad to be here :)
Thank you so much for the compliment!
Thanks!

Not everything is a jojo reference.... to be continued. XD
Thanks!
Thanks for this sweet message!
Thanks, I appreciate it
Thank you!!
no problem!
By the way, I love the outfit and look! <3
I'm on the other end to you (AMAB), and am trying to find a good look. Thanks for the well-wishing!
No problem!

Kylar they/them
Exactly..... I can only take so much. My aromanticism  is fragile ;-;
No prob!
You look great!
everything is a jojo référence if you try hard enough :)
Thanks, I knew my brother had a good taste in clothes XD.  How is your enby adventure going? I hope you can also find outfits that make you feel happy <3
My bad, I was assuming your assigned birth and I shouldn't have done that. I am sorry! I found some sites that could maybe help in your quest to find your perfect look:

[https://www.wikihow.com/Look-Androgynous](https://www.wikihow.com/Look-Androgynous) (part 2 of this is helpful I think)

I hope I didn't insult you in any way or made you feel uncomfortable! I rlly hope you find your look and if you want help from a fellow enby, you can always message me.
He sure does! And I’m actually closeted right now, but I’m trying to work on a new name and seeing what hair styles I like and the clothes I like. I hope I can find a few outfits that make me feel like me, but thank you for the well wishes <3 and you’re more than welcome to add me on here and message me whenever!
Don't worry at all! No offense was even considered. I do realise that my original comment slightly makes it sound like I was AFAB anyway! Thanks for the links, I'll take a look!"	g1rc1a	NonBinary	1037	1.0	2020-04-15 12:53:01
After being terrified my whole life of wearing anything other than masculine clothes, I did my nails and raided my wife’s closet and felt the best I ever have!		"you look awesome!
you look incredible! tysm for sharing! ⚡️🔥🏳️‍🌈⭐️✨️
Wow. Amazing
You look awesome! Go with what you know feels right!
you looks amazing & so happy 🥺💗
And you look darling! 🖤
Totally awesome presentation reminds me of YUNGBLUD.
You did a great job with your nails! 

Pro tip for anyone listening:
1. Buy your own clothes unless you have permission from your partner to borrow their clothing. If you're the same size, it's great because it increases your options lol.
2. Have your nails done professionally. Going to a salon and picking out colours for shellac nails is one of the best feelings. Everyone, enby or otherwise, should have their nails done at least once in their lives.
You look so happy !
u did really good
Hell yes, you look great! I used to borrow my husband's dress shirts and ties, and I finally just bought my own. Wearing them right now, and it feels great.
I can't express enough care, empathy, affection and support for you, OP. I just can say u r amazing and I hope 4 the absolute best. Keep your head up, the journey is harsh, but worth it. : )

Oh, and btw...LOOKING BEAUTIFUL AS F! ♡
that sweater is yours now it looks so nice on you :D
So nice!
Gorgeous! You look amazing AND happy. No better combo out there.
Great sweater choice!
Love your style, you look great!!
Congrats on discovering YOU
So happy for you! I totally did that to my wife's clothes too xD
You look great! Like ur hair
May I say you look amazing? And I also looooooove your tattoo on your wrist. Hope your wife didn't mind you raiding her closet, though. ;)
You look beautiful 😍❤️
You look amazing
Looking so good. It makes me happy seeing posts like this!
eh, not everyone should have their nails done professionally and it's ok to not wanna do that. i, for one, shall not. but anyone who wants to should defs give it a go!
Thank you so much!  It’s been quite the journey but I’m finally seeing light at the end of the tunnel. I can’t wait to explore this side further!
Thank you!  That’s actually what happened. She told me it’s mine now and I couldn’t be happier!
Thank you!  The tattoo actually goes to my shoulder. It’s a full floral sleeve. She didn’t mind. She told me the sweater is all mine now!
( - :
Oh, it’s a sleeve! I love those. Must confess I’m a little jealous right now. 
And seems that you have the sweetest wife, letting you keep the sweater. Love that."	zbnzur	NonBinary	1000	1.0	2022-12-03 19:14:22
my partner dubbed this look “hooker wearing the clothes of the overworked professor that hired them” and ngl that is an aesthetic i can Vibe with		"This look speaks to me...
wHERE did you get that jacket from??? I feel like my closet absolutely 100% needs a jacket like that
Gosh, it's a little 80s rock as well! Absolutely fabulous 😍
Looks great to me! Lol at your partner's creative description.
That is a LOOK 💕💕
I love your look, but your partner shouldn’t be throwing the term hooker around.
😍
Pretty much
Love your look and love your bio! :)
this look is my gender
Works for me 😍
Ngl this is a bop, if you dress like this, check out Charles Jeffrey LOVERBOY
I dig it. ❤️
Your look inspired me to take my jumpsuit off and put on a pair of my dad's old tweed trousers
I love how your partner described this fit. I absolutely adore outfits that are trashy and fashionable!! Looking at this made me think of Natasha Lyonne hehe
I'm on board with this so much I'm about to steal your vibe
Where did you get your phone case? I really like the pattern
Damn you look amazing!
I absolutely love this look (and your jacket)
I see this as “If Kate McKinnon were a badass rock icon”
i’m afraid a large portion of this look, including the jacket, was just from an antique store lol
that is a very fair point. please don’t think they and i are like a couple of giant swerf assholes, we’re definitely very supportive of sex work and sex workers, and we’re close with multiple folks who do or have done sex work themselves. them saying that abt me is just the tone of the sense of humour we have between us, but it was def insensitive of me to use that word in public in that way. good looking out 💕
i think it was redbubble? not sure tho i’m sorry :(
Oof well I got my homework cut out for me. Thanks!
I don’t think that you are or that it was an awful joke for your partner to make given the context of how you both feel about SWers; the optics just change on a lot on a public forum:)
i gotchu and again that’s a super valid criticism! have a great day 💕
Have a great day as well!"	fifa5x	NonBinary	1000	1.0	2020-03-14 08:25:34

Shopping for clothes can be hard but it feels so euphoric when you find an outfit that makes you feel 🔥🔥		"no gender only gengar
You look amazing and I want that T-shirt!
I totally agree, shopping for clothes as a flux isn't  easy. 

That outfit looks great though!
Shopping is really exhausting for me, so I started to modify my own clothes. But that's time consuming, even though I like it.

You look great btw!
I got a shirt that I thought looked kinda neutral but then I put it on and it was a damn v-neck 😔
you look beautiful!!!
Hottie
That t is scary good 😁
Looks fantastic 😍👌👌🔥
Love it you look hecking snazzy♥️
OMG I really want that shirt 😍
I'm going to start using this whenever anyone questions my gender, I'm in tears 😂😂
Here's a link if you want to get it!
https://www.amazon.co.uk/James-Wood-Gengar-Pokemon-T-Shirt/dp/B07D91552L/ref=mp_s_a_1_1?dchild=1&keywords=gengar+tshirt&qid=1583067243&sprefix=gengar+ts&sr=8-1
For sure, everything is so gendered and trying on mens clothes that don't fit is such a tease 😅

But I really appreciate the compliment!
I get you! For all my t-shirts (including the one in the pic) I've sewn the sleeves tighter so I have a more muscle fit on the arms but still baggier around the chest, it's impossible to find t-shirts that make me feel good without having to do that

And also thank you !
I hate that feeling, finding a binder that cuts low enough but also does a good job is a problem for me, same goes for tank tops 😓
Thank you!
Oof, yeah my old clothes don't quite fit right anymore.
I can’t find a binder in general— 
Do you know any (in person) shops that have them?
My parents agreed to let me get one if I can find a shop to buy one.
Sorry where I live those places don't really exist, though online stores like spectrum or gc2b have a good range of your parents are willing to go online !
Okay, thank you!"	fbtc9z	NonBinary	972	1.0	2020-03-01 12:23:29

No sexual imagery. This is NOT an 18+ sub.	"We never put this in the rules because it's obvious from a glance at the front page that people have their clothes on, and 99.9% of you can respect boundaries.

No porn.

No erotica.

It’s funny, normal masculine clothes gives me some dysphoria as I’m AMAB but vintage men’s clothes give me a hella lot of euphoria?!? Here’s my look from yesterday 💛		"Vintage men's clothes are superior because they weren't afraid of colors! and patterns! It's seriously a good look though!
All emotions are weird. Because like I won’t where shirts that say that I went somewhere because I feel like I’m so showing off, yet l’ll bring my $500 headphones everywhere just fine
You look fabulous! yellow is a good color on you💛
You are seriously rocking those golden tones!!! 🤩

The euphoria is coming all the way through my screen, it’s like the opening scene of Saturday night fever. I want to walk down the street with you
I usually like vintage clothes because it feels like those clothes aren't gendered the same way as more modern clothes. I've worn so many older styles of clothes and had people legitimately not be able to tell which gender I was presenting as. 😆 Which I loved.
I think someone else said it but the patterns and colors being brighter is a factor.

You can't gender a rainbow or a neon outfit!
I can’t believe those yellow pants! I def agree that vintage men’s is where it’s at!!
I’m an AFAB and I’ve always adored vintage men’s fashion. Argyles, plaids, paisleys- so many amazing colors too! Btw love the shoes!
I'm like this with fantasy clothes. Normal dresses? Ew. Fantasy/Renaissance dress? Hell yes! I will also go for the occasional fantasy inspired dress, like I have one covered in d20s, and three with dragons. Sometimes retro is ok to. But do not give me some flowery/overly lacey thing. No thanks.
Ohoo wow yeah I get it! You're looking rather mischievous here very gender
I'm in the same boat. Lots of... baggage... involving suits and ties, but give me rolled sleeves on a button-up and a vest and MmmHmm~~
Love the mid-century modern energy. It's great that you look good and feel affirmed!
\*in a whisper\* 

those shoes.... my precious.... where have they found those shoes...
You look very dapper
Hello! You hella rocking this.
classy 💁
Men had some periods of legit style, it’s just that the ‘80s-00s were a fashion desert for men
You really pull that look off
Your gender is vintage
That fit has a stunning pallet. The whole pic does, really
\*ringring\*

\*ringring\*

Oh hi, this is the seventies. We wish to make a complaint. When people in your era dress in outfits from people in our era there's supposed to look like dweebs, not like this slick, chic enby we see before us.
You look awesome! 👍
Your wallpaper makes you look like you have elf ears! Was fully willing to accept you were just some fairy trying to blend in with society.
You look great, love the yellow
For some reason I am reminded of Rick Astley. 

But this outfit looks amazing on you, I love the summery vibes too🌞
Omg your style plus the wallpaper and credenza..... this photo is dripping with vintage swag
such a cool look!
Everything about this picture is so joyful!
I just gotta say you look fantastic and so at peace with yourself 😊 Your look also makes me think of [Chris Fleming](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=uKKSDu_a9ik), a lovely nb comedian/songwriter.
Where did you get those shoes?!? I love them, but it's impossible to find any in my size when I occasionally look.
I see it as that modern men's clothes are made for what society currently expects men to wear. No one's expecting a man to dress the way you are in this picture so, while the clothing is obviously masculine, it's not what's expected and falls into the ball of non-conformity that is being non-binary.
You looks amazing!!
Very dapper!
You remind me of [this really cool dude](https://youtu.be/dQw4w9WgXcQ)
Exactly right!!! Modern men’s clothes are just dull
Ahh yeah
Yeah, but a tee-shirt saying ""I went here"" is the week-long trip version of being someone who will tell you they know *all* about life in Cambodia because they spent two months there on their gap year. It implies a level of cultural involvement that isn't really there. But going around with decent headphones says ""I like my music. Please talk to me about it when these are not over my ears."" Whatever your tastes in music are there's already an *actual* cultural connection.
It really does! I love yellow
Yaasss
Exactly! I love the androgynous look of vintage outfits as you can style them as masc or fem!!!
Oh yeah!
Same! Thank you so much
The shoes are killer. I like wearing big, big boots all the time but even I want a pair of them to spice things up a bit.
Holy shit. I just realized that I don’t feel dysphoric in RenFest outfits but I do in “modern” dresses. Huh. Brains are weird.
❤️❤️❤️
Yup!
Thank you so much!
I got them from Depop 😄
Thank you so much!
Thank you ❤️
Thank you!
Yeah my deadline for vintage fashion is the 1970s
Oh thank you!
Yes, I am vintage

A slick, chic enby…that’s me!

Agreed. I live by Ian Dury's only new boots and panties credo. If there's anything interesting in men's fashion today (if) then you're guaranteed to have a slow trickle of in into charity shops over the next year.

When your MTF girlfriend gives you her old clothes 💁🏼🥰		"Your girlfriend has excellent taste, in both clothes and partners!
You look smashing!!
OMG IT'S A SHARK SHIRT!! I LOVE IT!!!
I LOVE THAT SHIRT SO MUCH OMG 

Both you and your girlfriend have good taste!
This is the future that liberals want 😌
I'm an AMAB enby, and when I started buying more ""women's"" clothes, my partner (bi cis lady) definitely took a bunch of my old clothes I didn't want anymore. She looks better in 'em anyway!
Cute!!
I (afab enby) lost a fair bit of weight following cancer treatment about 18 months ago. I was despairing over not having any masc clothes that fit, and then my spouse (trans man) lost a bunch of weight after a med change and getting into a new relationship. Presto! I inherited binders and pants and shirts and belts... Heaven! 🤩
That is a sharp shirt!
I love your hair! Your whole look is cool.
rad !! I love your entire ensemble fhajksdh
You look good. :D

oh, i hope your hair journey goes well! don't worry if it takes a lot of time, hair is very frustrating, but you look wonderful right now! are you planning on dying it any sort of color?
I'm not sure what exact color it will be when it's long. I've always kept it buzzed or super short before coming out as non-binary. If it's a pretty reddish brown like I hope, I probably won't dye it, at least at first. Thanks for saying I look wonderful now, because I'm just getting started on my feminizing journey!

"""gender netural clothing"" 90% of the time leaning masculine?"		"A friend once said that our society sees masculinity as androgeny and femininity as gender, and they were definitely on to something.
Skorts should be the next gender neutral fashion trend imho.
Gender neutral/unisex clothing brands always have baggy drop-crotch pants and an asymmetrical long zip up hoodie. That's it. Honestly it makes me want to just start my own brand and just have clothing just by measurements. No gender labels, no meaningless sizes.
the fact that androgyny feels like it just means ""vaguely masculine"" pisses me off more than words can describe
Shorts of all styles should be considered gender neutral too. Short shorts, track shorts, board shorts, and swim trunks as shorts.
part of it also comes from the fact that most enby representation is skinny white afab
As an amab person this is so frustrating because trying too look gender neutral just ends up looking slime I'm dressing as assigned and trying anything femme is obviously femme it is soo hard to look androgynous when your amab
Gender is a useless construct let's all wear tacos
Makeup as a concept is too gendered. Hair past a certain length is too gendered. (I'm so tired of ""if you don't cut your hair off then you're not even trying to be neutral"".) Heeled/lifted/platform shoes are too gendered. Colors and patterns can just be neutral fun if you're careful, but there's a fine line before it winds up too gendered. This is why I like to approach androgyny as less gender neutral and more gender mix-and-match. (That said, I would have an easier time presenting as androgynous if hair metal would come back into style.)
This is exactly why I don't even attempt to look androgynous as a AFAB. I like my clothes, nails and makeup. If I woke up tomorrow morning in a man's body I'd still have the same style. I'm not going to change what I like to fit into the standard of androgy. There is nothing wrong with femininity. THERE IS NOTHING WRONG WITH FEMININITY. Not gonna change what I like just to make other peopke comfortable with how I experience my gender.
The gender neutral clothing i want is a kinda half skirt thing that is more like a belt that goes over pants. Also I want it to make it look like i have hips and an ass. 

The best I've come up with is tying a hoodie/flannel around my waist but holy shit do i feel good when i do that
[deleted]
Yuuup. Gotta hate that!
Thanks, I hate it. :) :) :)
I've (AFAB) gone by my style and what I enjoy wearing.    

My style is around a more toned down goth ninja. I enjoy wearing makeup but I've been too lazy to deal with it (thanks covid). But wearing nail polish was never a big thing to me. I never liked skirts & dresses. I never really liked my hair long. In fact I plan on doing a short side, long top haircut soon. Where I could brush it forward, to the sides or even slicked back if I wanted to.     

I've always enjoyed men's clothes more than women's though. This summer I've been rocking men's shorts, a sports tank (with build in bra/shelf), and a baggy t-shirt over that. Until I can cultivate a better wardrobe.
That is true.

Still being the default, the normal is not necessarily good.
This is why I coined the term Freedressing, to finally combat this double standard.

I think I even posted this or a similar meme on my r/freedressing sub.
The reason gender neutral clothing is 'masculine' is because it's socially acceptable for men and women to wear it. 

It's not because ""men are the default"" it's because during the war women had to do men's jobs and it became socially acceptable for them to wear male clothing.

Yes people often assume the male default (saying he if they don't know and animal's sex for example) but this isn't one of those scenarios.
Why am i getting all this nonbinery in my feed?  I didnt join it and what is nonbinery mean? Cant these topics be discussed among the interested without me being asked if Bobby looks cute in his new skirt?
SAY IT AGAIN
Fascinating.

Another element to consider: all kids lack boobs, but boobs make you visibly a woman when you're afab. Without them you're just a kid.
I think your friend hit the nail on the head
There are things in a ""woman's"" wardrobe that a ""man"" wouldn't be caught dead in but are there things in a ""man's"" wardrobe that a woman wouldn't be caught dead in?
This is literally how most t-shirt styles are divided: Do you want a Women’s tee, or a Unisex tee?

As a femby I can roll with it, half my tops are Women’s cut & the other half unisex, but it’s definitely an explicit indicator of an assumed & usually unspoken societal norm.
It's a shame isn't it.
I think that's close, but it's still not the full picture. It seems that a specific combination of both feminine and masculine traits is considered androgynous. Typically this amounts to a body that is feminine-of-center and clothing that is masculine-of-center.

If androgyny were truly equated with masculinity, then we would see androgynous models with hairy, muscular bodies and a crotch bulge, to invoke a definitive adult male aesthetic. But instead, most androgynous models have none of those physical features.

A tomboy would be an example of an androgynous ideal in our culture, what some people characterize as ""soft butch"" in lesbian circles.
Great idea, I love skorts.
Yes, but there should be a better name.
\^\^\^\^\^
Ooooh I like that
Pleeaaaase do!
The irony is that back in the 70s and 80s, many of the clothes that we characterize today as stereotypically feminine were marketed to both men and women. Short shorts, crop tops, yoga pants, leg warmers, slouch socks, headbands, leotards, unitards, bikini underwear, bikini swimwear, bootcut jeans, v-neck tops, etc. could be worn by either gender, particularly in the context of fitness and aerobics.

I've long said that unisex fashion has been going backwards.
And colour! I LOVE pink! (M 52) I have pink, and yellow shorts, white, and dark blue Capri pants. (Planning on ‘coming out’ at Christmas at our house this year) Have already changed my Facebook profile pic to a Non-binary meme.
Oh and Sweat pants
Aren't boardies the same as swimming trunks?
I wish bun-huggers, like what female volleyball players wear, were gender neutral. But unfortunately we live in a society where AMAB people are never supposed to show that they have thighs or a crotch, so shorts have to be oversized and baggy.
ding ding ding, give this person a prize!
That's me
Glad to know it's not just me! I hadn't seen anyone else talk about this so I wasnt sure if I was gaslighting myself😅
That is indeed an issue I've brought up in the past. As someone that's AMAB too, I have to put a great deal of effort into my appearance (full body shaving, makeup, tucking, etc. just to look moderately androgynous). Yet for AFAB people, it seems to be as simple as throwing on a wife beater, blue jeans, and snapback to look instantly androgynous.
how does that work?
I definitely do the mix-and-match, I find it works best for my style and is always pretty comfortable
Short hair hoodie and skirt looks great
Kinda like the scout uniforms from attack on titan?
Or the bigger question: Why is the only garment that people ever bring up when talking about women's clothes being made gender neutral is skirts, even though there's some 70+ other garments that are strictly coded as female only as well. As a gender nonconforming male, I find that to be the most frustrating.
Ha! Toned down goth ninja is something I relate to!
My go to wardrobe for the past winter months has been leggings, cargo shorts over that, a tank top and then 1-3 baggy pullovers over that for warmth xD I'm afraid for summer because then I'll have to find an adaptation of this style I won't melt in lol.
I agree, if it the reason were that ""men are the default"" then androgynous models should have hairy, muscular bodies with a crotch bulge, to invoke a definitive adult male aesthetic. But instead, most androgynous models have none of those features.
I think there's a way to block subreddits, go do that. Non binary is a gender identity/is linked to gender expression. A lot of trans people fall under this. If you don't want to be on a trans sub though you should definitely figure out how to leave though!
Non-binary is for people who aren’t men or women. You should be able to find a button that says filter subreddit if you have been colonized so hard by the western gender binary that you feel the need to whine about the tragedy of having to see perspectives other than your own.
Are you sure? I mean most masculine physical characteristics are heavily gendered whereas most feminine physical characteristics are devoid of gender.

A person with beard, body hair, toned arms, toned legs, and bulge in their pants would be definitively perceived as a ""man"", yet a person with a smooth face, no body hair, no muscles, and no crotch bulge could easily be confused for a man or a woman, suggesting that a feminine physique is more commonly representative of androgyny than a masculine physique.
A cis woman? Probably a jock strap, and that’s it.
skirt + shorts = skorts

shorts + skirt = shirt

there we go, perfect
I've heard someone somewhere say that ""color has no gender"". So wear whatever colors you want 🥰.
Yes! Though I live in Texas so it is HOT most of the time.
When I mentioned boardies,, I mentioned the cut (like basketball short ) and material (like cotton or polyester). Men's swim trunks are pretty much always one cut with swim safe fabric (occasionally with netting)
Eh screw society.  It seems like men originally wore shorts like that in the 70s and 80s. Just call it retro.
No the pain is real.... It always gets me in that wishing I was afab space witch is so just ... ugh.
>Yet for AFAB people, it seems to be as simple as throwing on a wife beater, blue jeans, and snapback to look instantly androgynous.

*AFAB people who are white, thin, and not curvy. I also have to put in effort to look androgynous because I'm fat and have enormous tits and hips. Even binding doesn't give me a flat chest, and there's nothing to be done for the hips. I also have a round soft recognizably feminine face and only hormones and surgery would fix all of the things I've mentioned. I read more as a vaguely masc woman than androgynous even when I'm putting a ton of effort in. A very specific subset of AFAB's have easily achievable androgyny, not all of us are a bomber jacket away from it lol, if only.
The magic of the cool people gang, I dunno

I was thinking of something more substantial and less straps and stuff. Like some of the ""leg"" armor in assassin's creed odyssey

And i just realized i got gender euphoria from that game, wow. It's amazing how much i missed before....

Anyways [this](https://gamewith-en.akamaized.net/img/febafb28e954ecdb29e1ba87f7f21dc7.jpg) is more along the lines of what i was i thinking. I'd probably remove or add a few things though

Almost all of your comments are very passive aggressive transphobia saying how “naturally feminine like you were made that way” nonbinary people look and you can’t hide it by adding rainbow hearts. Grow up and mind your business. Nonbinary people can dress how they want, just like everyone else.
sincerely fuck off 💗

Thank you so much!
Haha not cringey at all, I love it! Thank you for your kind words
You’re very kind, thank you 💕
Ahh thank you! I’m loving the good vibes :)
Thanks for asking! I think it went well, it was my second interview with the store. They seemed to like the answers I gave and the questions I asked them. Also they seemed to approve the outfit lol
Thank you! I got both the shirt and pants from Ross, I’ve had some good luck getting some fun shirts from there :)
Thank you, I think it did but currently waiting for a call back to see if I got the job 🤞
Thank you! I’m thinking it did go well but I’m waiting for a call to see if I got the job
Yay thank you! I felt like I haven’t been able to pass as andro well enough because there are always strangers that still used my AGAB pronouns/terms towards me. I think I did well with this outfit though :)
Aww thank you! That’s my parents dog, Sadie :)
Haha that’s awesome! My hair was red and black a few months ago but I’ve been enjoying the purple lately :) and I also wear mostly red and black clothes too, we’re stylin’
Aw thank you for your kindness!
Shirt?
You're welcome 🙂 Cute dog too 🤩
of course :)
💛💛🤗
Thanks so much!
You're welcome fingers crossed
Yea no you’re rockin this look. It’s very andro to me and you are also very cute!
If I was forced to assume a binary gender I literally would not be confident choosing either. I’m really impressed and quite puzzled because idk how to even began to achieve this for myself 😣
Dunno.. Shirt reads like T-Shirt in lazy..? But yeah, better than the ones we got from fashion... 😅"	y6uytg	NonBinary	770	1.0	2022-10-18 03:02:50
My family doesn’t let me wear a lot of masc clothing so I made a makeshift suit with a jumpsuit a dress shirt and a tie I got from my brother. I feel pretty good in it.		"🔥

Sorry you don't get a lot of support from your family.
Looks cool.  Very resourceful!
You *look* pretty good in it, too!
Bro that actually looks really cool tho
I swear, suits look good on literally everyone, no matter the gender or lack thereof
That's so clever! I'm deeply uninspired when it comes to dressing, so you're hella impressive. You look great and definitely give off masc vibes.
That actually looks so cool tho, I wish I had some type of clothing like that but I unfortunately don’t get to buy a lot of masculine clothing either. Looking good!
it looks great mate

&#x200B;

always good to improvise
Love the tie
Love the tie
That’s a really good look for you! It’s something I would like. And I hope this isn’t weird but I also like your hair.
Awesome outfit! You look so good!
Love it it looks amazing your so resourceful and I'm sorry your family is unaccepting that must really suck
BRB stealing this look 🔥

Hope your family comes around.

Absolutely iconic! Also I’m not simping you are
Ugh 😍😍
Hot topic! Thats where i got the collar and shirt too, it was my first time going there and it was really fun.
:0 i feel honored
Thank you! I think it just dropped recently
Not at all, be my guest :3
At hot topic i was wondering why they had antitheft tags on literally everything until i realized their exact target demographic is the exact one that would shoplift :P
Yeah, i feel like I’m finally starting to be able to not tie how much i like myself to how feminine/androgynous i look
Thank you!
Awww thanks! :)
My mcr hoodie inadvertently became my dysphoria hoodie too lol
Well I guess I know where I’m going today
You’re welcome!
I got mine for christmas and I haven't taken it off since
Same!
where'd you get those cat ears?
My friend got them for me as a gift, but I’m sure you could find them or something similar if you searched up cat ears on Amazon (mine have little bells!)

People always say how confident I look and I always brushed it off.  But then I see your pic and DAMN, that confidence is AMAZING!
This is my new favorite photo
You look amazing


But like how do you walk in that it looks kinda tight and not really move able
Slayin' every day!  💕
You look like you're about to go fight patriarchy and cis-het normativity alongside superheros and I like that
That's the sweetest thing ever thank you so much 💕
Aww thank you so much 💕
That's really nice thank you 💕
My best asset
Thank you 💕
I gotta agree
Thank you 💕
💕💕💕
You think so???
Omg thank you so much 💕
Thank you so much 💕
It's really tight but the material is so strectchy so is so easy to move it. In terms of comfortable style and functionality it's my favourite skirt
Thank you 💕
And my super power is wearing heels despite recommendations not to and complaining about it 😂
Yeah definitely!
Fantastic for you I assume the skirt is latex or leather or something like that
Thank you 💕 💕
Yeah it's latex or faux latex I'm not sure"	ihslfm	NonBinary	718	0.99	2020-08-27 20:13:34
Drew myself in a bunch of my favorite outfits! Clothes don't define your gender, you do :)		"Omg this would be so fun to do if I could draw! o: Super cute idea & execution!!
This is cool! You have a nice fashion sense and your coloring/shading in your art is very pretty!
I love your art style!!
Where do you shop, because I want to make several of those MY favorite outfits
The bottom left is basically my goal.
That dry brush looks nice. Do you have an art Tumblr/ Instagram/Twitter etc?
[deleted]
You are a great artist and recognize great art as well. I see that Good Tiger band shirt. Met their vocalist and gave them a hug. Amazing band of amazing people. Have an amazing day! Please draw more !
Sorry for creeping and checking your other posts- you have great work! I look forward to your comic!
I was just thinking of doing this! Enby artists unite!
I'm getting to the point where I don't really have 'male' clothes or 'female' clothes; I just have *my* clothes.
I'd so draw myself in all the clothes I feel like I can't wear
I love this so much <3
Cuteee
Ahhh this is so fun, I love it!! Those outfits rule 
I wish I could upvote this more than once. Your art is amazing, and your outfits are amazing!
I love all of these!!!
Thanks so much!
Thanks! I was testing out some new brushes and shading techniques!!
Glad you like it!
The bottom left is a puffy jacket from Steady Hands, dresses and crop tops from forever21, some hand-me-downs and some thrift shopping :)

new wardrobe just dropped	Platos closet is my friend, also whichever neighbor dumped a box of clothes by the dumpster <3	"Love this color on you, it's so cute!
Those tights are so sexy!
You look ridiculously good in pantsuits. Maybe start a collection?
Holy wow you look so amazing in that first pic.  I mean cmon gender! (Also look great in the other two)
You look cute!
Your outfits are cute!

Also what class you playing in DnD? 👀
You look stunning is these fits, I'm happy you get to wear something you feel good in!
You look so nice with those outfits!!

I love finding stuff in the dumpster! If there's any clothing resale shops near you that buy stuff, definitely check their dumpsters
Had to make sure cause it looks blank in the pic
Ooo!!! Such a good idea, thanks for the tip!!!
Oh I didnt even realize it was there, yeah I got that donezo
No prob! I used to work at one, and sometimes when we passed on stuff, people would just put the whole bag or box in the trash. Then id grab it and sell the stuff online or to another resale shop. Now I own my own vintage store
Your looks are amazing but I figured everyone was already telling you that."	x3pc6y	NonBinary	696	1.0	2022-09-02 02:06:54
Felt kinda cute, I find overalls very affirming. Does anyone have any particular clothing items or ways of styling themselves that makes you feel the same way? Hope everyone is doing alright out there 💕		"This does not answer your question but I love your tattoo so much
short sleeved button ups (especially like hawaiian shirts or other prints) feel very queer
I love harem pants so much.
These eyebrows, the overalls, the tattoo 😍
My work blazer, of all things 😅

I been wearing jeans for work for a while, started wearing a t-shirt because if I'm sitting on my own for 16 hours, and it's summer, not much point wearing my polyester shirt (my uniform is a suit). I still been wearing my blazer, to look somewhat professional when I get to work 

That thing fits like a dream and looks amazing with jeans/t-shirt 

Even the full suit, I look good in a suit, but my favourite part is the blazer. I have one I bought which is similar (so probably blazers in general) but I really like the fit on my work blazer
Boxy vests with double breast pockets. Corduroy. Leather or fake leather. Tailoring.
Those overalls are cute as hell! What brand are they, if I might ask? I have a hard time finding any that aren’t strangely revealing/ overly effeminate looking on me. 

And i love a good worn flannel with an undershirt, jeans, and beanie combo. I always feel the most myself if I look like I fell out of a 90s grunge album cover. Lol
Dungarees are my favourite item to wear I got 6 different pairs
Overalls and Hawaiian shirts with cropped ankle pants. Obviously not together lol. You look great babe! 😍
Button-up shirt with rolled up sleeves are the best! I add suspenders and a tie and I feel great 🤩 (I am AFAB)
I have a spinny little burgundy skort.  And a simple leather collar with steel ring.
I have a green jacket that has a lot of patches I made on it, I get correctly gendered (they/he) whenever I wear it, even when I had long hair. Sadly I can't wear it now because of how hot it is, and I can't wear it in the winter because of how cold it is.
That’s such a cute outfit!! For me, it‘s a punk/rock outfit. Makes me feel like I can take any shit people throw at me.
Yes! A no-sleeve and open back hoodie top from an ex helps me feel centered in my body. Also, some Thai fisherman pants do similar. There's something special about reducing the physical stimulus in order to feel grounded and comfortable in the self.
Hmm rolled up wide leg jeans, Doc Martens, a clean pair of chucks, pencil skirts, any kind of dorky graphic tee, a nicely tailored suit or a girly dress.. goddamn I'm all over the place.😅

Also love the look comrade! 🥰
Button-ups (especially with collars), leather jackets, and anything that makes me look emo/punk or like a suave pirate.
For me so far, I find v neck t-shirts to be affirming, especially combined with my binder underneath! I actually learned there was a specific way to position your chest in a binder so it actually looks flat (I was just throwing mine on and going, who knew lol), and it's made it even better.
I have a completely black baseball cap. It's really basic but makes me feel a lot more masculine, which I feel more comfortable presenting as masculine than feminine.
[removed]
I feel the same way about overalls 🥰
It's overalls for me too!
Wow, you look amazing!
**WHY IS EVERYONE HERE SO HOT AAAAAAAAAAA**
First of all, you look so confident and just overall (pun intended) fantastic!

Next, for me (AFAB agender), the things that feel affirming are...kinda all over the place. So I’ll just list them in no particular order:

Ball caps, aviator sunnies, my chest binder, men’s/boy’s T-shirt’s, oversized hoodies, super dark or wildly-colored lipstick, very long/sparkly/shiny/multicolored manicured nails, shaved/bald head, rompers, wigs, lots of sparkly jewelry, high heels, tattoos, fishnet tights/stockings...

The list goes ON! Lol. Thanks for sharing!
Sometimes I feel really good when I don't wear a bra or when my piercings are showing. Piercings make me feel cool. But I love your style!
Oh my god, you look amazing! I can see how overalls would be so affirming.
Colors and flowers on my clothes. I’ve started wearing a lot more (what would traditionally be considered) feminine colors and styles and it’s worked out wonders for me. I also have a little flower ring I like to wear.

You look fantastic btw 💖
I have two necklaces in the enby flag colors and I wear 1 almost every day
I love me my gothic western cowboy hats 🤠
My work jacket (dog salon) is very euphoric for me. I can loosen or tighten it to fit however I'm feeling that day. Wanna be feminine? Tighten it! Don't want people to know I have tits? Loosen it! I love it. Hoodies are also very comforting
Button up shirts that show off my chest hair!
Sounds kinda boring but just men’s pants. It’s gender affirming for me AND I can finally fit my phone in my pocket
generally its a long sleeve dark button up shirt mixed with a colourful T-Shirt under it and either slim jeans or a skirt. I also usually wear a hat because it makes my hair do a thing and i love it. my only problem with this outfit is that it gets to around 40 celsius every evening so sometimes i get extremely hot. btw love your tattoo!!
Women's shorts paired with a men's t-shirt. Don't know why, but the combination just feels so...me.
Overalls are the best!  
No idea if it's cold enough for this by you, but I'm a big fan of cable-knit sweaters that are really big and poofy

Very ""Do not perceive me"" type vibes
Huge oversized jumpers
Overalls are LIFE 😍
You’re adorable!
Lately trucker hats for some reason! Also I’ve stopped shaving my underarms and I’m digging that aesthetic right now.
I love your outfit!  I’ve always found graphic tees to be very affirming.  My current favorite has the Legend of Zelda logo on it 😊
I don’t have anything like that as far as I know, but I just wanna say you’re stunning! Like wowee!
Yes, I’m so glad coveralls have been making a comeback; Currently saving up for a nice pair for myself
button ups and tank tops
You look amazing and I definitely agree on the overalls front, I get so happy wearing them. While I don't have one (yet), I feel like an old timey, wizard-esque cloak would be amazing and I want one so badly.
Overalls and harem pants !!!
Thank you, that’s very kind of you to say 😊😊😊
Love a good button up 😊
Same! I love fun patterns that hint to my likes, animals, games, shoes, books.
Oh hell yeah!
This kindness, your username, hoping you have a great day 💕
I am amab, going the other direction, but feeling masc, I love that combo of jeans, t-shirt, and blazer.
Love that, betting you look amazing 😊
YAS. I bet you look fantastic in all of them!
You could have a look at the brand Lucy&Yak. They make a variety of unisex dungarees and I love them
They are by Wall Flower! I got them at a TJ Maxx I had the same problem, especially being short, but find that looser fitting overalls do the trick :)
Oh hell yeah, dungarees are 🔥
You just listed like three of my favorite clothing pieces 🖤 thank you so much! Your kindness is radiant like I bet you are!
All super great pieces in any wardrobe 👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻 suspenders make me feel snazzy as fuck and I bet they look amazing on you!
Burgundy is such a great color and ring chokers are cool AF, I bet you look fantastic in them! Especially if it’s a spinny skirt, those are so fun!
I love that! I’m sorry the weather is being rude and not letting you wear your jacket, I love patches! I bet it looks absolutely stellar on you too 💕
Thank you so much! I bet you look great in your punk outfits and I bet you could totally handle any shit that gets thrown at you! You seem really cool though so I hope shit isn’t being thrown at you
Feeling comfortable and grounded in the self is so important and such a great feeling, I’m glad you have clothing that brings those feelings 🥰
Thank you comrade! I like your style range 😊
Suave pirate might be my new favorite fashion category 🖤
Affirmation is such a wonderful feeling 🖤 I bet you look pretty killer!
I use to have a dark green beanie that made me feel the same way, sadly it was enjoyed at a chew toy by one of my friend’s puppies, but I’m glad you get that feeling from your hat and I hope no puppies ever destroy it 🖤
Oh yeah, the hammock of clothing for sure! Plus the chest pockets keep me from losing my pens and stuff at work 😊
Overalls are my favorite 😊 great minds think alike!
Overalls are the best ever, I think they’re taking over my wardrobe and I’m fine with it 🥰
Thank you so much! You seem hella kind and cool!
I BET YOU ARE ALSO HOT AAAAAAAAAAAAA
Thank you, that pun was pretty wonderful! You sound like your style has quite a bit of range and I absolutely love that!
Thank you so much! Piercings are a great way of feeling affirmed! 😊💕
Thank you so much 🖤🖤🖤
Thank you so much 🖤🖤🖤 I bet you look great in all of those colors and that little flower ring sounds super cute!
I bet it looks amazing 🤩
Yes. That whole vibe, yes 👏🏻
So much function, so many choices, and both sound like they’re great ways for you to feel yourself. I’m glad you have that! I bet you look swell in both of those, however you wear them!
Affirmation and well sized pockets are never boring 😊
Thank you so much! And yeah, hot weather can be a real bummer on clothes that I also find affirming, such as my flannels and my thicker overalls/ work shirts are tough to wear when it gets hot outside. I bet you look incredible in those outfits by the way!
And, I think it would look really powerful on you!
Thank you! :D
🥺❤️
Right!?! Same here
Thanks, my friend.
Aww, thanks 💖. I might post a pic this weekend all flowered up. Lately the posts here have been inspiring me.

Also bad ass Reddit name. Mine was randomly generated but it fits me 💖
Best part about working with dogs is that they don't misgender me. It's nice
Thank you! :D does make me feel more confident, I find it hides things like my belly but does it in a way that just looks stylish!
I meant OP, but I bet you own the look too! 😉
All of us here are hotties and I’m sure we would all look fantastic 😊 I’ll give the look a shot! Thanks for the recommendation 💕
Ah lol, sorry I'm still catching up on my sleep 😅 but I can see that now!
My pleasure really"	oz9wss	NonBinary	691	1.0	2021-08-06 16:17:00
Meme I made		"Have you tried turning tiddy off and back on again?
I haven’t worn a bra since I was 18 and now I’m 25. I didn’t like that bras reminded me that I have boobs. Then I tried on a binder and made me feel worse cuz it felt like I was wearing a bra again and did not make my chest flat like I was hoping for. So until I get top surgery I’ll just deal with having boobs.
Binding - you don't see tiddy but you are constantly reminded tiddy is there by the restrictive garment :(
This is sciences fault! We need the tiddy we can pop off and on like hats! Just pop em off, leave em at home when we feel like!
I like how I look with a binder on but most days i just wanna wear clothes and be able to breath . My problem is, I am a d cup so any movement causes movement ya know? I found recently underworks has a like thin binder tanktop. Does very little compression so it's super comfy and it feels safe to wear all day but it's just a a tank top so no bra feeling and it stops the movement . Feels like the best compromise.  It feels like just a kinda form fitting tanktop i used to wear under clothes when I wore women's clothes still.
Perhaps your panic attack was triggered by tight binding. Our body is  programed to react with panic of our airflow is impeded.
I feel best when I just go braless, but I'm also like a D cup so they're very *there* >:|
task failed successfully
Nah that makes complete sense. You can ignore them when your not focused on trying to hide them. Not that people should bind if they want to
Tbh, going braless is more euphoric for me than binding. It's just a matter of finding shirts that look okay without a bra underneath
I relate to this. Dysphoria can be fluid too ~
The binder took your dysphoria with it when you took it off
Heh... tiddy XD
I have three mods: pushup, sports bra, and no bra. I switch between them based on how I feel about my tits in the morning. Pushup is when I want to flaunt them around proudly, sports bra being the equivalent to binders, and no bra is just when I want to forget they exist. It feels chaotic AF.

It's more chaotic now that they gained some extra size, like I'm always super aware they exist and I don't know if that's normal.
I’m like this! I don’t hate my boobs I hate the oppressive boulder holders
I'm simultaneously very lucky and unlucky in that my tits are so smol I don't need a binder, but my nipples are the size of fucking ping-pong balls, so I still need a bra just to hide them...
aw
SAME BRUH
Same deal with gaffs for transfems w bottom dysphoria 😓 it's like theres no fuckin winning w/o surgery
This model does exist, but not all people have it.

It seems most end up with EITHER detachable penis OR detachable tiddy. NOT both. And you don't get to choose from the get-go which model you get. Gotta aftermarket your way into it if you want a different model.

I want my money back.
At least there’s detachable penis?
But I tend to relax and get asleep when I put my binder on. I know I shouldn't. But my body does it by itself. What does that mean then?
I just looked up gaff. It sounds neat.
Honestly i can't tell. I like to do rope bondage and having rope around the chest can really be calming as well. I think it might depend on the situation.
Loool it's better than tape imo but it's also not super comfy. It's kinda like stretching some scrunchies to fit around your thighs, hips and junk 😐 and then pulling that tight so said junk doesn't fall out from the prepubescent holes you crammed it back into. But it IS a nifty tool when ya need it!
I want to try this.
Yeah. The site said to wear it sparingly. Especially if you intend on having biological kids one day. To think about freezing your sperm if you use it. 

It seems like a binder but for penises and testes."	xsdxpg	NonBinary	691	0.99	2022-09-30 22:01:43

Magically cured	"AFAB nonbinary. I wore a dress for Christmas because I felt like it and it was cute and my whole family were excited because they said my 'mental illness' was cured. 

All day they kept telling how how girly I was, how feminine, and I hated it.

I tried to explain that clothes don't gender a person but they wouldn't listen.

My brother, who is gay and a huge ally, gifted me a subtle NB bracelet, called me by my true name and called me little sib instead of sis all day. That was a huge help.

How do I talk to my parents about this and how it makes me feel without causing a huge fight? We're a really close family but they won't acknowledge my wishes and deadname me constantly."	">We're a really close family but they won't acknowledge my wishes and deadname me constantly.

Doesn't sound like they're that close to you if they don't care how their own child feels and sees themselves. Idk how old you are or if you're dependent on them. If you're independent it makes boundaries easier. But if you are stuck with them they can play the ""my house my rules"" card.
Oh no! I'm so sorry, that sucks. Clothes do not create gender (I know you know this, but I'm saying it anyway) and you are no less non-binary in a dress than you are in a leather jacket. Also, being non-binary is not a mental illness wtf


I'd say your family did a great job of strongly discouraging you from wearing femme clothes around them ever again XD
I haven't had this issue with my parents, but my partner and I both have bad mothers, and little attachment to family in general. My partner's mom is a narcissist, among other things, and when we first met she was feeling stuck between abuse if she talked with her mom, and guilt if she didn't. I told her that she's grown and can choose how much to see her mom, and when to answer the phone. I've encouraged her to stand up to her mom, which became easier when her mom started dismissing her career goals, and wouldn't visit her in the hospital. Now they simply don't talk much and we keep visits short and holiday-related. There are some fights, but they both kinda just don't like each other, so her mom has been willing to let the relationship slide.

I know that's not gender-related, but I think it's worth asking yourself similar questions about your parents. Do you value a relationship with family in principle? With any of them in particular? Do they value you as a separate, independent person, or just as an extension of themselves or their beliefs?

I'm usually a proponent of having a big argument if it means standing up for yourself, though i saw you want to keep the peace. Consider giving them firm statements on how you feel, what you expect from them, and how you plan to reduce contact with them until they get it. A letter or email are good ways to do that, especially if they're prone to interrupting you when you talk. NPR usually suggests this statement include language like, ""I value you and want a relationship, but this is how you make me feel."" That's maybe a bit too touchy-feely for me, but I agree with the sincerity. 

Good luck, OP
your brother’s a real bro
I’m not sure if this will be helpful in your situation, but this year for Christmas I got my parents a book called nonbinary for beginners (even tho I came out 8 years ago and they’ve had plenty of time to do their own research… my therapist said unfortunately I would have to start doing the work for them if I ever wanted something to change which sucked ass) Literally the only gift I got them. And I told them the only thing I wanted was for them to accept me for who I am and actually use my pronouns or else I will have to cut them off for my own mental wellbeing. It actually worked and my mom has made a huge effort to start using my pronouns. She’s literally sitting on the sofa reading the book right now. And my dad has started correcting himself to say “child/person.” I know it’s kind of a specific situation and everyone’s parents are different, but my parents are 70 so if they can make an effort (even tho it took 8 years), there’s hope out there
It’s really hard for me to imagine how you’d have a close relationship with them if this is the situation… just thinking about how painful, invalidated, and unsafe I would feel around anyone who would treat me that way. And that’s really just thinking about the name/pronoun part, the hyper fixation  on your clothing and calling your gender a “mental illness” part is so freakin’ messed up!!! that I can’t even imagine having a relationship with anybody like that. 

I have hard boundaries around it, and I kind of hope you create some too and stop seeing them— because once you experience only being around people who honor and respect you for who you are, which is what you deserve, my experience was fully realizing my own worth and now it’s much easier to continue to enforce those boundaries, be clear about them with new relationships, and stand up for myself. 

If you feel that you’re a close family, then if they actually love you they will do the work once you communicate your boundary and stop seeing them. Your absence will make them reflect and realize how important this is, and they will either choose to do the work or decide they’d rather lose you entirely than change their mindset. It can feel scary because they might choose the latter, but that, to me, means whatever “love” they express for you is conditional. 

Because it IS important. God it is so important. And when your life is only full of people who treat you the way you deserve, that becomes so obvious that now I can’t even imagine going back to the days where I would bend for ignorance and intolerance.
I don’t have advice but I’m sorry you experienced this. I’ve been recently experimenting with more femme clothing and it’s so terrible when people assume you have realized you are cis. It’s like no, dresses are pretty and fun? So hard to present how you want when other people misgender you all the time.
You’re brother sounds amazing! 

As for your parents… take my view with a grain of salt. I’m a very confrontational person, and I’m working on that. I grew up in a rough home though and am used to duking things out physically and emotionally. Small afab here. You learn regardless of size sometimes. Not everyone will take that approach and that is totally okay. 

I’d cause the fight, but hope it doesn’t happen. Peace is ideal. Nothing relationship ending though.

Don’t try anything you aren’t willing to back up physically/emotionally though. In your case this would only be emotionally. That approach usually makes people back off from my experience.
>How do I talk to my parents about this and how it makes me feel without causing a huge fight? We're a really close family but they won't acknowledge my wishes and deadname me constantly.

IDK maybe a huge fight would get it though their skulls that if they want to have a relationship with their adult child they will have to be respectful.

They don't financially support or house you? They can pound sand.
this kind of sucks, but i used to think i was a part of a close knit family too. but after i came out they never acted the same to me ever again. it turns out it was a real conditional situation - i truly believed nothing would stand between me & my family, but....some things do, i guess. hold your ground and keep your head up, i am happy to hear you have one reliable ally on your side here at least. ❤️
In your place, I would tell them that their reaction made you reconsider having worn a dress in front of them.

I had to deal with a lot of deadnaming and misgendering from my family early on. Having fights with them helped. There is no way for them to understand your pain without fights sometimes.
How are you a close family if they treat you like that?

Sorry bud, but that sounds like denial i'm afraid.
You're not a close family. You're in a family that tell you that you're close, so that you won't rock the boat and risk 'losing' that closeness, all whilst they treat you like utter crap. Keep the brother, ditch the others.
Aw that sucks! Sorry you had this experience. Unfortunately your parents may never “get it” but if you feel safe enough (physically and emotionally) to talk to them about it and it feels important to you then I would encourage you to think about what it is that you really want or need them to know… maybe you know websites or parent groups that provide more explanation? Also, I wonder if you could ask your brother to help with this conversation or resource sharing? Outside of that I hope you consider what you need to feel okay before during and after the convo. Can you make sure you have access to emotional support in the process or at least an idea of how you might decompress after? Either way, I hope you are still able to dress in ways that feel good to you in spaces that feel safe for you to do so… Good luck with all this and take your time. Trust your own process 🌿
Sometimes, a fight is inevitable if you don't want them to continue to disrespect who you are. Im sorry you had to go through that. unfortunately, we all too often have to stand our ground, and that can end up severing ties with people we care deeply about. 
Just remember, you are important too. You need to put your well-being and health above all else, including your family.
My sibling has gone through a lot of changes with her identity and sexual preferences over the years and generally lives a life outside of the status quo. So a lot of times my mom will think she is just being rebellious, is confused, or whatever. She is very timid and tries to stand up for herself but she is basically just seen as the naive baby even though she's almost 30. I am very confident and sure of myself and have no issues with confrontation. I often fight the fight for her so that she does not have to. I will educate and pound the knowledge into our parents whether or not they like it. It sounds like your brother loves you a lot and it's possible he would also be willing to do so for you if you just asked him. You don't have to go through this alone you know!
Oh gosh I would've ripped the dress right off and gone hide in a corner to cry. I'm glad your brother had your back. He's a real one. And I hope you'll be okay
I kind of have the same situation, the only ally In my family on my mom's side masks her allyship at times but I love her still.

I rather not talk about it with your family, I've tried to talk with mine and they won't listen, I'd say just do you and have them get used to it.(unless you have a really tough time with that, I wouldn't recommend masking yourself and acting like everything's fine, that just makes things worse for yourself)
Same here, but my younger sister is helping me.
You may not be able to talk to them without a fight. But you should talk to them. 

Biggest lesson I learned is you're better off losing a mean transphobic family than keeping it.
Dont, just leave ASAP. You aren't obliged to deal with their abusive shit.
Unfortunately you can't always do anything. I just do not talk to some of my family. I don't even see them. I did however recently hear that they made up a rumor about me wanting to be a man, and that I am gonna get surgery. I just laugh it off because they know nothing. It is your decision if you want to put up with the abuse, or if you cut them out and distance yourself. But I do have to say I am in a much better place mentally.
Little sib.  <= Like.
Your brother sounds lovely at least
Your brother is so awesome for that! Also yeah a dress is just fabric, you can give it whatever gender/feeling you want. People still don’t get it
Oooh, i fear stuff like this. Thats why i dont come out as an Amab Nb to my very conservative family.
That sucks, I'm so sorry 😔
Your brother is an angel though! I've never herd the term ""little sib"" and it's so cute and accurate, I love it. Hope the rest of your holidays work out better ❤️
I'm sure other people have better advice on how to deal with your family, unfortunately I'm clueless. But, as an aside, I bet the dress was gorgeous and that you looked stellar. Merry Christmas, you're brave as hell and from one dress-up-loving NB to another please keep rocking whatever makes you feel good to wear ♡
My family is also very close to each other. My dad has all queer children (two of which are trans) and I’ll tell you what he said to me one day after I asked what made him come around. That day he said, “I either had to accept you all as you are or not have a relationship with any of my kids.” That has stuck with me and even though he slips up I know he tries. If someone really loves and appreciates you, they will try. They might not know how much it hurts you. You can decide when you feel comfortable enough to tell them and even have an accepting family member or fried with you for support. It’s ok to feel conflicted about this and it might take them a while to figure out what my dad did. They might not ever come around. But you don’t have to feel like you’re giving up on your family. You still love them and that’s ok. Either way, you will figure out how comfortable you are in making these decisions for yourself in time. I wish you the very best nonbinary friend.
Well.  Signed up for Reddit just so I could respond to this question.  Here goes.  When I was a li'l fella (I'm not non-binary, but have a GNC streak haha), people used to try to give call me by a common nickname for my actual given name.  I'd either not respond to them, or I'd say something like ""Jonny isn't my name, my name is Jonathan.""  You could try using that to get them to stop deadnaming you.  Just don't respond when they deadname you; or if you choose to respond, you can say ""Landry is my name, not Janeen.  You can call me 'Lan' if you want, but I will not respond to 'Jan' or 'Janeen' since neither of those are my name.""

Or call your mom by ""Miss *insert maiden name here*"".  When she says ""My last name is *insert last name here*, not *insert maiden name here*"" you can respond ""Point made.  Call me Landry or Lan.""  You have a leg up on her if you've legally changed your name, which may be a good step to take anyway.

Best of luck with the fam ...
Honestly I would just stop trying.  You don't have to cut them off completely but I would just ghost them
tell them to fuck off and rip their heads out of their asses, and then sever all contact
Luckily, I am 31 and live apart with my husband. We've had a few conversations about it over the years but I get the age old ""I gave birth to you blah blah"" argument which is always fun
Today's family gathering features manly af Landry in their lumberjack clothes haha
Thank you for this great advice! I definitely think I have to stand up for myself more and not just roll over and take it.

My parents are my biggest supporters in everything in life and have always been my best friends. That's why it came as such a shock when they didn't support my coming out and actively go against things I ask of them
He really is. He's amazing 😊
It's honestly super complicated. We've always been close but it's because I always compensate. My chosen name is Landry and my dead name is Janeen. My family always called me Jan so I told them to call me Lan because it was easier.

Nope. No deal.

I asked them to stop gendering me and since them they keep buying me cards and gifts that specifically say daughter or girl on it. 

Mu mum said I was confused because I spent so much time with guys (all but one of my chosen family are guys) and so bought me feminine clothes and tried to get me to do things with girls in the family that I'm not even close to. I explained to her that's not how these things worked but again, she didn't take it in.

She told me it shouldn't matter because I'm married to a man (like wtf does that even mean?) And I asked her if marrying my dad meant she wasn't a girl anymore and she told me not to be stupid.

I have depression and anxiety and my family think the people online have ""manipulated me"" into having this ""disorder of nonbinary"".

My brother, my husband and every single one of my friends and even my in laws call me the right name and pronouns and immediately did this without needing to be harassed. 

As I discovered more about myself, I wanted to share it with those I love but they didn't want to hear it. I cried and told my mum when I came put as ace and she told me I was just putting labels on something that didn't need them.

I don't feel unsafe in my family home just unhappy at times. Every time they say my name it hurts. I've told them this but I get the whole ""I had a daughter and I named her Janeen"".

I'm an author and my husband told me to use my deadname Janeen Leese-Taylor on my novels, that way I could just think of it like a fake pseudonym so it would hurt less. He hates how my parents speak to me and always stands up for me and calls them out on it. He calls me Landry in front of them and is my biggest ally. Without him and my brother, I'd be lost
It's like no, skirts go whoooooosh that's why
Have you tried the ""wish you hadn't"" response lmao that always pisses my mom off lol.
Start calling them by their names instead of mom and dad, or aunt-whoever. Just names. When they complain, say ""Since you've decided to not respect me enough to use my proper name and pronouns, and insist on defaulting to 'I gave birth to you', I'm choosing to honor your parents' choice in names by calling you by that name"". Turn it around on them. Remind them it's a matter of respect, and until they respect you for who you say you are, you won't respect who they say you are, because they aren't acting like parents. They're acting like assholes.
As someone who has given birth to two humans so far, that line baffles me. It gives you the responsibility to do your best to raise a good human, not override rights to your offspring’s personhood in perpetuity.
Let them die alone tbh. Sorry if that spunds harsh but its what they deserve. If they want to try and bully you they dont deserve your love and support imo. Of course its your choice, its just that I've witnessed first and secondhand how so many good people prioritize horrible ones due to family ties.
Is your name Landry? Thats such a cool name٫ and super unique. I love it 😮
You could also just ignore them when they use your deadname. Or ask who they are talking to or about all the time. Pretend you don’t know this deadnamed person. Coz that person doesn’t exist.
Yeah, that's weird that they wouldn't be supportive, but then maybe they'll respond better to the sincerity and threat of boundary enforcement. Have you found any educational media you could share with them?
No but that sounds fun haha

My mum tries to take me out for 'girls days' to 'cure my confusion' and we always end up in Starbucks. I always make sure to use my real name and she hates it haha I get glared at.

I have begun a campaign of bring as authentically me in her presence as possible. I just wish I could bring her around to my way of thinking
One of the commenters above gave me some ideas so I'm gonna investigate and educate!
It really sounds like they're stuck in their ways, but if you think you have a chance to educate them, I'd start with history lessons on clothing and items that have now been deemed as male or female-only. Many things we see as feminine were created by and for men, including makeup, heels, and *dresses*. In fact, pants weren't really a thing until they became necessary for horse-riding, so unless you plan on riding any horses, a dress or skirt is the most historically appropriate clothing item for anyone of any gender. 

Before the 1700s, women weren't allowed to be involved in the coffee making process at all, let alone drink it! So your mother taking you to a coffee shop is, historically, a very masculine thing to do. If you explain this to her and she still drinks coffee, start calling her confused, asking if she's no longer a woman for participating in such a manly task. A lot of transphobes (that are uneducated and not hateful) learn by having the roles reversed on them.
is she buying it for you? i mean starbucks is pretty expensive, i’ll take it lol! also why is starbucks out of all things the most feminine thing she could think of? it’s just coffee, men drink coffee too!
This sounds amazing. I'm gonna start doing research! Thank you so much for your help!
I want to add in computers. Computers used to be typically women who did calculations, you know, before THE computer was invented. But even then, in the 70's and 80's a majority of coders and programmers were women and women put men on the moon with their programs and algorithms. There are so many of these modern things that have a history totally opposite of the modern perception. Definitely research more, I know I will. I had no idea that pants were made for horse riding, I just knew heels were made for it."	zvm14i	NonBinary	670	1.0	2022-12-26 12:18:12
Not Looking “Non-Binary Enough”	"So I’m AFAB. I “look” very AFAB. I feel like other trans and nonbinary people shun me over this quite a lot, because even nonbinary folks seem to secretly feel I owe them androgyny the way cis folks do. 

People tell me I’m just “changing my pronouns for attention”. But the same people treated me better when I was thinner/had a more androgynous body shape, was able to wear a binder and had my hair cut short. 

I have a really large chest and due to medical issues, I can’t wear a binder anymore whilst I try and save for full top surgery. People are always surprised when I say I want top surgery, like they treat me as some kind of cosplayer and are surprised I’m “committing to the bit”. I dress more feminine these days because the way my bust sits in clothes with more masc or unisex cuts makes me feel even more dysphoric and full of loathing toward my body, but dressing like this means people just write me off as a girl. I’m also a goth so I wear a lot of eyeliner n stuff, and that just seems to make it worse.

IDK, sorry for the rant. I just feel like absolute dogshit and I’m tired of getting downvoted and accused of being “a transtrender” whenever I post a selfie."	"Listen. A cis person can look as masculine, femine or androgynous as they want and still be cisgender, no questions asked. Your presentation is not your identity.
I’m amab non-binary and haven’t changed shit about my appearance since I “came out.” 
I wear the same clothes every day because they are comfortable and functional clothes. 
My body looks the same because I am not currently interested in modifying it. 
If anyone has a problem with it they can F off, whether they’re bigots or other enbys. 
The whole point of being “non binary” is you aren’t a part of the system. If non-binary becomes a gender of its own it will just be a Trinary. 
Fuck the binary, fuck the trinary.
Hey, I look masc and I’m a nonbinary with they/them pronouns. Nonbinary is supposed to be breaking the rules you don’t have to listen to them you don’t owe them anything
Yuck I'm sorry. I also look very feminine. Largely it doesn't bother me, but people's perception of me does. I also use she/her pronouns which seems to confuse people further. I've had other queer people aggressively use they/them pronouns for me. It's extremely annoying. But bottom line, you are valid, you are who you say you are. Anyone trying to tell you otherwise can Fuck off.
Like others have said, you don't owe anyone anything

I'm a bearded enby, so am seen as male, but I don't care because I know who I am

Be your fabulous, authentic self and sod anyone who tries to put you in a box!
I look like people expect someone of my agab. I know several other enbies who also look like people expect for their agab, including one who was recently elected to public office.

I can assure you that there are many enbies who look like people expect for their agab. Because we are less visible, this can lead to the over-representation of androgynous enbies in the minds of the general public and even other enbies, but this image of nonbinary people is inaccurate. We are not all androgynous.
I have a beard, I'm 340 pounds. I'm 6'1"" and lift up heavy things for fun. I'm nonbinary trans. I fight the idea of masculinity constantly and just want to be whatever I want to be when I want to be. You do whatever the fuck you want. And if your friends don't accept it, they aren't your friends. Threes always new friends to be made. You keep it nailed down for you.
People don't see me the way I see myself and it's just because of the body and face that I have, and it sucks. If I looked more masculine or androgynous in my appearance, people would see my fashion style as androgynous. But since I have curves and a soft face, I'm apparently femme presenting even when I wear men's jeans and a T shirt. 

I don't think most people take me seriously as a Nonbinary person. And maybe it's that they don't take Nonbinary people seriously in general. But I've been passively excluded from conversations about gender and transness when other Nonbinary people have been included, even though I'm very passionate and vocal about the topic. And I can't help but think it's because I don't look the part. Even though I have short hair and wear men's clothes half the time. I can't exactly do more without taking hormones
Howdy, I'm an elder they (as they call me at work) at 35. While I'm slender, I'm also AFAB and fem as hell looking because I too am goth and the eye makeup is always intense, so am usually called by she/her pronouns by strangers. 

Other folks have already covered all the bases, so I'm going to jump right to the comment about saving for top surgery. While this is awesome, I would absolutely encourage you to at least explore the possibility your surgery may be able to be covered by state or private insurance (I haven't a clue where you are, or if any sort of insurance is available to you.) I only bring this up because I saved the money, and literally two months before surgery, discovered my insurance would cover it with a letter from a therapist. 

I don't want this to sound like I'm pressuring you into surgery, but I'm fem presenting, never used T, never will, and top surgery was still available to me.

I also want to throw in at the end here that people don't get to tell you your gender. Your gender is for you. Be you.
Gender identity is about how **you** percieve **yourself**.

&#x200B;

What anyone else thinks about it literally does not matter.  Nobody else gets a say on that one.  That's yours and yours alone.
It’s very difficult being nonbinary in a world where people utterly refuse to understand it. You’re not alone- you’re nonbinary whether anyone else understands that or not.
Gender identity is different from gender expression I had a hard time coming to terms with it and had imposter syndrome for the longest time bc I’m afab and love everything a stereotypical woman likes my favorite color is even pink but ik that if I was Amab I would like the same exact things I’m enby and I’m me I just happen to like pink
I feel this post so hard. I also can’t bind anymore because it was causing back problems. And I go back and forth between presenting as more fem and presenting more androgynous, but seem to look stereotypically feminine no matter what I do. 

I always remind myself that men can wear dresses and are still men (if that’s how they identify). Women can be masculine and still be women. So we can present as more fem and are still non-binary. I’m non-binary because I feel it in my gut that that’s who I am. But its still so hard to not internalize the way other people see/interpret my identity 

Just sending you empathy and solidarity ❤️
A lot of people are saying really good points, so I just wanna say that this

> the way my bust sits in clothes with more masc or unisex cuts makes me feel even more dysphoric and full of loathing toward my body

is something I 100% relate to and don't see people talking about it a lot. At least fem clothing fits my body, not like the way I dress affects my passing anyway.
I'm in the same boat as you. You can be 100% feminine and use she/her pronouns and still be nonbinary and vice versa. Other trans people shouldn't be putting you down cause of your presentation. Gender roles and gender essentialism are things that unfortunately a lot of trans people uphold. It doesn't matter what others think, you know you best and if others don't respect you then it's best to ignore them and let them go.
Already been said by others but cannot be said enough: Only you get to define who you are - everyone else should focus on living their truth, not trying to enforce one on you.

Furthermore, any friend or associate who cannot manage that simple thing would soon find themselves outside my social circle.

To be fair, my social circle is quite small and I am okay with that - not everyone would be - but do take a stand as and if you can.
You don’t have to justify the way you dress, you’re allowed to just exist and do your thing and still be valid.
I am similarly built to you and when people bring it up I say, ""Have you seen well tailored men's shirt for F cups?"" which is the fast way to get people to  shut up.  

OR I go on my rant about how gendering and titles are active levels oppression people can change if they today with less effort than most, where in either they have to sit there and listen to me go on for 10 minutes or start to agree with me.

Mostly no one, NOT NO ONE after 16 years of being forced to wear a dress on Sundays gets to tell me what to wear.
People are arseholes, trans or not. Get them out of your life! There are plenty of people out there who will see you for who you are. I’m sorry you’re experiencing this and I know it always hurts more when it comes from your own community. Lots of love x
It seems to be an unfortunately common thing for people to demand enbys to look androgynous. Yet when cis people dress gender non conforming it‘s apparently okay 🤷‍♂️

I am agender. I don‘t look androgynous, most people call me he/him. I just don‘t care tbh. I know who I am and I dress and act the way I do. No one can tell me who I am and how I have to identify, how I have to act or dress. 

I am also autistic, so I have 25+ years worth of experiencing people trying to tell me how to live my life. But I only started to feel good about myself when I learned how to not give a shit about that and do what I feel comfortable with
Sometimes it feels likes we have to conform to some stereotype or what you ""expect"" for nonbinary/gender non-conforming. but the whole thing of gender non-conforming, non binary, or even gender-conforming is that your identity and expression don't have to match what others think it would be. 

&#x200B;

I had to explain that to 2 ppl (who are in the LGBTQIA+ community) that just cus someone has feminine clothes, a bust, and has she/they or whatever pronouns doesn't mean they are supposed to look androgynous. Just cus you think someone looks like (as they said, word by word) a ""straight cis girl"" doesn't mean that they have to be. there are also cis people or general binary trans ppl who use pronouns or dress the opposite of how you'd expect with their transition/lack of transition. 

 I myself love feminine-presenting stuff but until top surgery I am holding off on buying that stuff as its easier to dress down and bind(or excessively oversized plain clothes and hoodies in warm weather). 

It sucks you can't bind, I hope your top surgery money comes quickly ❤️
I've been having a similar experience. I keep having to remind myself that we do NOT owe the world androgyny, we are who we are, and anyone who says otherwise is just as bigoted and closed-minded as the rest of them 🙄
I'm sorry you are getting that. It's funny because that's the way people act on social media, but when I reached out to local nonbinary people - they all look completely different. Most havent transitioned physically in any way. The NonBinary Look (tm) is actually such a minority of what nonbinary people look like.
same boat, i use they/them exclusively even at my job, but i sit here and have all the same concerns as you. for me i almost feel bad when i dress more femme or put on makeup (i love some black eyeliner), like i must remain neutral or more masculine looking at all times. you're not alone in this, and it's societies binaries that are the problem, a lot of those binaries are nearly subconsciously ingrained cis and trans alike.
Transtrendster is a gross gatekeeper idea. I don’t  think the opinions of people who try to control you this way are worth any of your time and you do you unapologetically <3 because we got your back and support you here.
Im AMAB and I dress masc, mostly because the default useful clothes are all masc. I guess wearing jeans and a tshirt is masc.

Gender doesn't own you, it certainly doesn't own what you wear, how you act, what your body is like, or who you are. Being non-binary id about being authentically you without worry about what gender is.

Youre always valid no matter what!
reading this was like looking in a mirror lol i also haven’t been able to wear a binder anymore and i’ve chosen to grow my hair long  again, and i really feel like people completely disregard my identity because of it. i’ve been trying to lower my voice as a way to compensate, but it’s frustrating having to resort to forcing change to try and be seen as how i want. 
i try and channel this frustration into the fuel to keep going in spite of them, being able to rant about it certainly helps with that!
I’m AFAB and super femme and that’s just how I feel happy dressing! I’m still enby. If other people can’t respect you, it says a lot more about them than you.
fuck all that noise. If you say you are non binary you are non binary. I totally get where you are coming from, I am AMAB, and will NEVER fit the aesthetic that is often presented as the 'way NB people look' (Skinny, androgynous, long and tall). I am a large, muscle, bearded, heavily tattood person. I wear skirts and leggings when i want to, but often dress in a way that aligns with my agab. My therapist really helped me with this one, because the whole point of being nonbinary (agender for me) is that i dont fit in the typical categories. I felt like i had to dress a certain way, and they were able to help me understand that the way i Dress and look does not determine my gender. People that dont get that, can get bent. sorry that you are having that experience. I am almost always misgendered as male, which sucks, but as it has been said before, being trans is the lest interesting part of me, so i let it roll (have not dealt with malicious misgendering yet, ive only started coming out to people in the last few months)
Yep, this is a tough feel :/ sorry you're having these tough thoughts. 
I'm amab nb, and I'm conventionally masc looking in body shape - very tall, broad shoulders, muscular - veryyy difficult to 'look androgynous', even though that's mostly what I want. I like wearing really comfortable and functional clothing and surprise surprise there aren't many cute outfits that fit my shape anyway so the choices are limited. If I was afab and wearing the same clothes I'd very likely be viewed as way more androgynous... i don't like wearing makeup and would hate to wear it just so that more people realised I'm not a man. But yeah also sucks to have everyone treat me like 'one of the boys' 

In short - relatable, sucks that you're feeling this, but you are valid!
You don't have to look any way to be nonbinary and the people that are telling you that you do are ignorant and cruel, denying your identity like that... smh
Look extremely masc over here. Beard and all. Still identify with they/them pronouns and as trans though. I’d like too surgery as well, just don’t have the money. But I struggle with the same thing. The only feminine part about me is my voice and people just see that as me trying to be gay. Very little affirmation of my identity. I’ve almost given up completely on people using my preferred pronouns. (It/Its/They/Them)
Hey friend as someone who is AFAB as well I can really relate to what you are feeling. To this day I struggle with the fact that I love to wear dresses but then feel like a fraud when it comes to being non-binary. But that is just the thing non-binary just means you don't fall into one of the two ""norms."" 

On a side note, I have found one way to cope with some dysphoria is planning outfits that make me think ""Yah someone would definitely get pulled into another dimension to go on a magical adventure in this outfit."" It is not foolproof but boy it does help to plan my clothes into adventuring outfits versus thinking about if it makes me look too feminine.
I don't think it matters what you look like as long as your comfortable with it people should accept that. Also I went onto your profile to see what you look like and I think your really pretty/handsome, you look plenty non-binary to me :)
i’m sorry that’s happening to you. 💔 people really fucking suck sometimes. nonbinary bodies include every body, and nonbinary presentations include every presentation.

i’ve been asked to leave queer spaces due to looking like a matronly cishet woman instead of skinny and sexless and androgynous, like i’m “supposed” to be. my body has put me on the receiving end of transphobia from both cis people, and “better” trans people.

it’s absolutely disgusting that people in our community do this to us. bodies are meant to look different, and androgyny should be up to people that vibe with the word; if you identify with the word androgynous, then you are, without a binder, with curves, with ANYTHING.

fuck the haters so fucking hard. our bodies are nonbinary. you’re not an imposter. 💜
Androgyny is overrated and way too highly valued--you're you and that's all that matters :)
You are completely valid
i feel the exact same way. especially with summer coming along it’s so much easier and more comfortable to wear more feminine clothes. just means people still think i’m a girl. i wish it was easier
Gender identity and gender expression/presentation are two different things. You can dress and present HOWEVER you want, that doesn’t change the fact that you’re non-binary. I’m sorry you aren’t being taken seriously friend.
i totally get this as its the same for me. I'm cis passing to the max despite my identity. most of what I do is I remember I'm not doing this for anyone but myself and I don't owe anyone anything ever. I owe myself a piece of mind and to take care is my body and mind in the ways I need it. 

like many say, you're presentation isn't your identity. for me tho I find it to be a slight good thing in public bc its less dangerous for me but that's not the same for everyone. it gets better I promise.
I have huge boobs it really crushes my nonbinary aesthetic. It’s really hard to get a reduction or deletion but I’m trying. Good luck!
It sounds like they all don’t understand that there isn’t one correct way to be non-binary. And you are valid
It's generally wise to not care too much about the opinion of stupid people. If you interact with them just gray rock them. If someone legit says ""you're doing it for attention"" literally just reply ""ok"" or something and move on. You do not owe people explaination of justification for your gender identity or expression.
Shame on those other non-binary people for shunning you based on your appearance - those people should know best how it feels to be judged solely on appearance especially considering being non-binary literally has no look, it is the absence of a binary. 

you know your identity and don’t let anyone tell you otherwise !
I get this to a tee
I find a lot of questions here asking if they fit into a certain ""category"". Isn't the whole point that most people here don't fit a general category? Just an observation.
my advice is get off all trans subs that aren’t this one. they’re all awful. trans people on reddit are like, even worse than cis people
I really relate to this. It's definitely helped me having trans friends who I can vent too and who validate me.
Honestly, it sounds like you’re deeeep in your own head. What you’re saying may be true, but almost all your examples are your interpretations of peoples’ thoughts based on how you feel around them. 
 
You don’t owe anyone anything. The end. The rest is brainshizz YOU have to work out on your own, to persist in society (which reciprocally owes you nothing, btw).
I’m in a similar boat myself as an AFAB NB. I don’t mind the feminine side of me but it feels like by not “looking” NB enough I get cis-clocked a lot.
confuse them by wearing both traditionally male and female stuff  


but in all seriousness, this happens to me, too. im afab and naturally have a large chest. im not out to my parents because they say im not old enough so im forced to wear more feminine clothing. it sucks, a lot.
Those people are assholes, you are non-binary enough no matter your presentation.
I feel this...
People suck like that. You’re rad as hell though
I don't get the gatekeeping of gender non-conforming. It can be as simple as not conforming to expected roles it doesn't mean you need a mullet and an androgynous aesthetic in order to be part of it. 

Dress however you want, use whatever pronouns you want. People will perceive what they want to perceive and that says more about them than it does about you.
i know how exhausting this is and am very sorry you’re experiencing something i am familiar with. 

what consoles me is that at the end of the day, im a dude on a floating space rock. in the whole context of the universe it doesn’t matter, but that’s cool, not something anxiety inducing
If anyone is gatekeeping you just being your authentic self and how you share yourself with this world and are asking to be seen in it then i can only ever imagine it coming from a place of insecurity of themselves that they have to work though.

You dont have to be the fruitiest pop tart in the box theres varieties and differences in all of us and in all of our definitions, if they dont like your flavor tell em they can stay in the box they put themselves. All due respect, lmao. 😌
Sorry you’re dealing with this treatment. It sucks that some people think this way, and you deserve better. 

I hope that hanging with people online and in positive queer spaces irl can help you be yourself and feel good, even if physical goals aren’t where you need them to be just yet
Honestly I think it's sexy and fun to accentuate the masculine and feminine together. It does sound like your boobies are popular, there's no rule against pushing them up with a little mascara on any peach fuzz you got as fake stubble, can stuff your crotch too. Idk how well this sits with dysphoric feelings but as a bearded queen I thoroughly encourage busty dudes! 😁
You are fine to present however works for you. I’m also afab, but I’ve transitioned to where people assume I’m male in public. I use he/they and I’m sure if I told people that, a decent chunk would assume I’m amab and haven’t done much to physically transition. 
Point being, regardless of transitioning, people always try to categorize you, and then people assume what they “see” is your agab. Non-binary people don’t owe anyone androgyny or any amount of transition. 
However you are able and/or comfortable presenting is valid. The people who say otherwise can suck it.
I can definitely relate to a lot of this this, especially being more bothered by how feminine my body looks in masculine clothing than just wearing feminine clothing. That's not something I've heard of other people experiencing too, so it's a bit nice to know I'm not alone. (But I try to not let that stop me from wearing masculine clothing anyway.)

I don't have bad experience with other non-binary people though, even though I have never regularly worn a binder and prefer to keep my hair long (sensory issues plus I just generally love long hair on everyone!). My only strong dysphoria is around my voice, and I have decided not to go on T for that. Most likely, nobody thinks I'm not a cis woman unless they know my name, and even then a lot of people probably don't realize until I tell them I'm enby.

But enby people have been nice to me. Maybe it's because I have never posted selfies of myself? But maybe it's also because people who call you a ""transtrender"" are not non-binary people. I've never encountered a non-binary person who used that word and meant it. Keep in mind that transmedicalists and other people with shitty opinions sometimes seek us out specifically to pick on us, and they target people who they personally consider not ""trans enough"".
Just know you aren't alone in this. I'm experiencing this same sort of crisis, and I actually tried to post this problem on this subreddit just days before today before getting shredded by nonbinary people here, actually. Just know you don't owe people an explanation, and only you truly know how you identify and feel and how you are comfortable and don't let anyone else tell you otherwise :)
I certainly get the frustration of how your body fits in things and no longer wearing a binder. (I stopped because it was making me extremely anxious.) But heck, if anyone has an issue with you presenting in any which way for whatever reason, that's a them problem. And if they use the term ""transtrender"" they aren't good people to start with. Only truscum and transmedicalists use that term.
Felt this. I’m afab and just don’t want to change the way I look, and my partner is nonbinary and has a beard. We’re about as straight/cis passing as it gets, and in public it can be a nightmare. A support system of other queer people whether it be online friends or irl can make a world of difference.
ask them to describe what nonbinary is, most of the time they cannot because there is no linear nonbinary look, it’ll shut them up and then you can say it looks like this and gesture to yourself

(edited for punctuation)
I’m AMAB and thanks to genetics I look very masc. When I started telling people I’m non-binary I got a lot of “you’re the last one I’d have thought was a them/they” and even a few saying “just decide, are you a man or woman?”

People with preconceptions are the problem, not you. You be who you are.
I’m sorry you’ve dealt with people like that. I say dress how you feel most comfortable and confident. There is no one non-binary look.
Wow, I’ve never thought about it that way before! That’s really beautiful - thanks!
not really true imo. With the rampant transphobia and hyper-focus on binary trans people nowadays, cis people get ""clocked"" as trans if they don't fit the gender stereotype. Especially cis women who look ""too masculine"". 

and a similar thing where some enbies who ""look"" their AGAB, incl myself, get ""clocked"" as cis. Or worse yet, get things like ""non-binary? What? You look so masculine though!"". Especially maddening when even people within the community expect androgyny, because non-binary by definition has no set ""look""

so no, I agree with OP. It's not so much that WE don't believe we're NB despite our presentation, it's that other people invalidate people like OP as if it's simply some quirky attention-grabbing thing
Same; for me it's more about how I feel than how I present, but even if I presented in any of the infinite combinations of ways one could, that wouldn't have a bearing on how I identify. It's the same thing people have to deal with when it comes to gender identity vs. pronouns.

Presentation =/= gender identity =/= chosen pronouns. Yes, for different people all of these things can interplay, but for some they don't, or maybe only a little! Ultimately what it comes down to is what feels comfortable & right to the person in question. It's bizarre how even very ""inclusive"" spaces or groups can still end up being weirdly exclusive about some things.
Based.
I got a notification about a very strange response that is now gone… not sure if it was accidentally replied to me or if they got banned 😂
Lmao I'm exactly the same with clothes, i was dressing kind of androgynous before so i just kept doing that
Are you me? This captures my feelings completely
haha cis people are straight up scared to use my it/its pronouns and other trans and nonbinary people get angry at me for them and say i’m making the movement look like it isn’t legitimate or like a joke :’) can’t win
Also those people are also discrediting the validity of femboys. You can express your gender how you want who gives one if that doesn't align right in their brains
My entire post is my frustration that people want me to fit a category when that is not relevant or possible within a nonbinary identity. I don’t want to look how people want me to to be respected. I want to be respected how I am.
That was not a statement to say that GNC people don't suffer transphobia and abuse when they're cis. Just that they don't stop being cis because of being GNC. It is about gender not equalling presentation, not about who gets oppressed for it.
That might happen but in general it still seems to be uncommon.
It's expensive to redo a whole wardrobe! I didn't come out until I was 31, so I had that long to collect clothing of my assigned gender, but only 2 years knowing who I was. Can't just trade in the clothes for more femme stuff lol
Sadly true. We really need to normalize It/it’s pronouns. Also “CIS people are STRAIGHT up scared” lol. Idk I find the wording funny. Lol
depending on where you live you may be able to find clothes swaps/community wardrobe type things for trans and nonbinary folks! they do exist!!"	12ivwjf	NonBinary	674	0.99	2023-04-11 20:08:58
Finally talked to my parents about my gender. It didn't go well but they have dialed down how aggressively they point out that they think my clothes are too feminine!		"Honestly love your look, reminds me of a teacher or librarian. Hope your parents get used to it.
Can I just say, from one enby to another, you look like a more fem-leaning Loki, and your sense of style is incredible!
I hope it keeps getting better and better
I love your look! Hope things get better with your folks. Sending you good waves :) 
that look is amazing tho 😱💖💖
i hope things get better with you n your fam!!
Your look is brilliant, hope it gets better <3
It’s a shame they should take a deep breath hold it spin around and see u in a new light as we do so individualistically unique and beautiful ur style is straight fire god willing they will appreciate you as they should have all along very soon 💗
I love the outfit you put together and it looks great on you!
Oh I love your look.
Nice work!
You look great, and extra kudos on that shirt! I love it!! 
GOOD OUTFIT
That’s such a cute outfit!! <3
Beautiful.
you look great! i love your clothes, and you’re glowing. hope your parents come to see it too. 
I'm awestruck. You look incredible, I love this outfit, your hair, your glasses. Seriously, I aspire to this look, thank you for being you. And I do hope they come around, best wishes.
You’re gorgeous and unique! Props for having the talk with your parents. I talked to mine this past fall and it was meh but it definitely made a difference to finally have the conversation.
I'm proud of your strength.❤
This outfit is on point and so are you.  Hope your loved ones show you love, don't stop living your truth !!!
Your sense of style is wonderful <3. Love those colors.
Love your look! Any chance those high waist pants are available somewhere??
No no no, that's wrong, they think your clothes are too fabulous and they're secretly jealous.
Know what you need to do to look better?




Get out of that stuffy bathroom and get into some natural lighting and fresh air. 
Was gonna say the same. Total cute librarian!
Thanks :)
*sends robotic friend-bees to OP as well*
i just got them two weeks ago at the renegade craft fair in LA after looking forever! The brand is is Mien, i've liked them a lot so far. On the hunt for more highwaisted pants though

Anybody else feel way more gender-fucky in summer clothes?		"Lovin the stache! Your whole look/vibe is 🔥☀️🏖😎
the lump of winter clothes doesnt give u many variations of gender but summer clothes can go many different ways
Hell yeah. Summer is prime time for gender fuckery.
For me it’s winter! More layers.
the brian david gilbert vibes are excellent
Just when I thought I was 100% sure to zap my beard out, you make me have second thoughts. I like your look so much!
God I love your hair.
You look very 80s, so cool!
Yes! Don't know how to be femme in winter and it makes me sad
Yep! 🙋🏼🙋🏼 Daisy Dukes give me life 💜
Literally goals
you look so fantastic oh my god! Just darlin'! It makes me so happy to see people fully expressing themselves, it makes the tapestry of humanity so much richer. A very happy pride to you!!!
Thanks so much :)

My spouse is apparently embarrassed to be seen with me	"For context, I'm MTX, have started wearing some subtle makeup, paint my nails and am letting my hair grow out.

My spouse found out that a comedian friend of hers is in town for some shows this weekend and her sister asked if she was going (because it's my spouse's birthday today). She said no because she does not like going out at dark, it's not known as a particularly safe part of town anyways...

and then she hits me with ""and I'd be embarrased to get picked on by him because of what you look like now.""

Umm... what?

We've been to his show years before and he's very funny but unless he's changed his material a lot, this comedian doesn't make fun of anyone in the crowd (unless you're heckling, in which case good luck with that because he's great at handling idiots like that LOL). Besides, I can take a joke about myself. I'm made of tougher stuff than that.

But I love how she now apparently views my very existence and happiness is a potential embarrassment to her in public. I thought she was beginning to come around as an ally, since she has helped me purchase makeup and new clothes to help align with how I feel.

But this... this hurts.

Edit: Thank you all for your genuine concern and responses. Sorry I haven't been on to respond to you all but it's been rather hectic being New Years Eve and her birthday. I'm not going to ruin her day, but I will definitely be having a difficult conversation tomorrow.

Peace and love, y'all."	"Idk i think a lot of people here are downplaying what a serious concern OP has here. This is a big deal and you need to speak with her about it. If shes embarrassed about one setting enough to actually say it she’s likely embarrassed about more. Im so sorry you’re going through this.
That is SUPER fucked up and unsupportive. Your wife is embarrassed by your presentation, probably because she subscribes to traditional gender roles on some level even if she won't admit it. It's cruel, hurtful that she'd say it, and a very valid reason to need space from your relationship damn. 

I hope you find other, loving and supportive community.
You need to talk to your spouse about how she actually feels about you. If the comedian is not a transphobic asshole, it might be an excuse regarding your wife not wanting to be seen in busy public places with you at all. From there, couple’s therapy or the relationship might not last long
this is very upsetting, i am so sorry you are dealing with such an obvious lack of support by your spouse. i think sitting down and having an in depth conversation, even if scary, would benefit you both...i hope that things can change or that you can find a support system that sees you for who you are and not only accepts it but EMBRACES it!
I am so sorry this happened to you, I hope you can have an honest talk with her and she'll come around but if not. Remember anyone walking beside you should be fucking proud of you for you <3
This is like. Breakup level problematic. If she can't handle you being who you are in public then she doesn't deserve you.

Have a serious conversation with her about what she said and if she can't get past it, it's time to find someone who does value you.
I'm so sorry. It sounds like there are some really deep feelings on her part. I hope you can have an honesty conversation about it soon.
That's super fucked up. You're valid in feeling upset about it and I think you need to have a conversation with your spouse. I'm sorry that you had to hear someone you love say something so cruel.
yeah that sucks. unfortunately partners are often not supportive of a person's transition.
Oh hell no, I’d not put up with that kinda disrespect.
I was lucky. My wife digs it. But she dresses like a tomboy (hmmm) so I think she likes the extra colour by her side.
So she's not for you.
Me wife is fine with women’s clothing, and makeup but draws the line at being seen with me in a dress. I’m sure part of it is embarrassment but a lot of people also assumed I was a trans woman at the start of my transition, and my wife got called a lesbian a lot unfortunately.

Social situations can be scary for any trans person unfortunately, and this can carry over to our partners. Still what she said was hurtful, and rude. You should probably talk to her about your relationship, hopefully things will improve but it doesn’t sound like you’re presenting in a hyper feminine manner. Hopefully a few small concessions for now, and some time will make her more comfortable, and you can just be yourself.

Good luck, and I hope you feel better.
I hope they was just misspeaking, and doesn't mean it in a hurtful way. Have a chat with them about it, it's something you should sort out together, good luck hun xx
This. Is. Hard.  You deserve so much more and better.  Sending love ❤️
This makes me mad. Like…they’re clearly uncomfortable by your reaches to find what makes you feel your best. OP, I’m really sorry that your partner made such a transphobic comment. You deserve affirmation and love- not passive aggressive resentment loaded with transphobia and ignorant discomfort. We support you here. Really.
This is one of those times, it may be best to part ways. My wife and I left a cult, Jehovah's Witnesses, and thankfully, when I went through my gender identity crisis, it brought us closer together. You guys just may not be compatible anymore, and hey, you made it however long.
❤️❤️❤️
I think it's about time your spouse became your ex-spouse.

I'm so sorry, it may be best for you to break up
OP’s wife very bluntly views OP’s presentation as something that invites mockery, and cares more about how that mockery, in this mythical situation she’s created, impacts HER rather than her SPOUSE.

One of the comments in THIS VERY THREAD pins it on how OP’s wife might feel safer at night if they were presenting more masculine.

There was ZERO MENTION of unsafe areas or of worries about physical safety, and what OP’s wife said was very clearly about her vanity and belief in her self image over her partner’s autonomy.

It’s fucking disgusting how people on this subreddit respond to a post about discrimination against AMAB enbies with MORE DISCRIMINATION AGAINST AMAB ENBIES.
If you OP do go to couples therapy I suggest looking for a therapist that has LGBTQ+ experience. Otherwise that could get messy and be an Unsafe space for you.
sort of similar experience here. My boyfriend is both traditionally masculine and very 💅 which balances nicely with the whole genderless gender I'm going for.

Their wife said “I’d be embarrassed to get picked on by [her friend] because of what [OP] looks like now.”

This is not about safety at night, this is not about “women feeling safer with men”. This is front and center, incredibly bluntly about OP’s status as a presenting non-binary person, how she cares more about herself and her self image than OP’s identity, and how she views OP’s identity as a threat to her.

I recommend you delete your comment. It’s incredibly disrespectful.
Say it again and say it louder. Very well said. Thank you
I may not be old enough to have experience with marriage issues, but I *do*, however, have experience with discrimination because of my status as an AMAB nonbinary person. So, I can recognize that kind of bigotry when I see it."	zzs557	NonBinary	613	0.99	2022-12-31 11:30:52
trying to repurpose some of the more “masculine” clothes I have,, what do y’all think? 🖤🦖		"It looks great! If I saw you I'd be like, ""Wow they got great style.""
you look so good!!!!! id pair it with black boots next time if the weather isn’t too hot :)
So cute! I was in the military for a long time, and still love the aesthetic of those cargo pants, especially tucked into boots. Also, your hair and makeup are 👌
you look like you go LARPing and know how to shoot with a bow
That's epic
Obsessedddd
That’s really cool
Love this look so much :0
You look great!
Never in the military, but I wear camo pants almost every day. I own other pants but mens camo pants are the most comfortable I can be. Basketball shorts are a close second.
(am afab, pronouns are they/them, and I'm mostly androgynous for reference but I think camo pants are the most versatile things)
Again, you look so awesome! If people look at you weird, it's their problem.
I LOVE this outfit!!
You look so cool :D

Reminds me of a rockstar
You pulled it off. Looks great!
Holy crap those looks so cool! And you definitely  wear them well so that’s an A+ on all fronts 💜💜
You’re fucking rocking it!!
thank you !! i went to the store like this and i got a bunch of weird looks so it’s nice to have yall say nice things ((: 💛💛
smart!! i get ridiculously sweaty all over when it’s too hot out so i’ll always wear floppies or sandals instead of boots, but i do have the pair in the background there 😉 one step ahead of ya! lol 😊💛
Ummm babe they were looking at you bc you look gorgeous 💕

aah genderfluid goals man.
What a jazzy human you are!
you're so androgynous I'm really jealous!
Wow, you’re nonbinary skills are impressive 🤔 you have my highest of regards 🤩
Both of these are goals.
Love the way you cut your hair! I've slowly but steadily been working in that direction, but my hair does weird stuff when is long. Hopefully I can get something like what you have soon :D
They're some of my favourites! INTO THE AM if you're interested
Mine forms frizzy ringlets if I let it natural dry from soaked. I don't really want to mess around with a tonne of product so I've found some frizz ease serum, a little argan oil for the tips, blow drying, then damp brushing back through with a round brush to kill frizz and set looser curls helps a lot.
Right, time to go Google that.
I appreciate you taking the time to type that up for me! To be honest, anything more than gelling mine after I get out of the shower is more work than I care to do. I've using frizz easing shampoo, so hopefully that'll make things better over time. As it stands, I've just been shaving the sides every other week and letting the top grow
No worries! What I've written might look like a lot, but besides blowdrying which I can omit if I'm not in a rush and don't mind wet hair that I can brush out later, it's really just running a squirt of two products through it after washing it and takes about 2 mind tops haha

When I was starting to let mine grow back out pre hormones [(sep 2018)](https://www.instagram.com/p/BnzB4TcnCAa/) I just used a really small amount of hair clay to help it not frizz all over the place!
Hair clay! Maybe that's the product I need. I'll look into those other products, too. Maybe they'll help me get the look I'm desiring. Thank you so much 🥰"	erzvyc	NonBinary	606	1.0	2020-01-21 19:45:55

Wellp im now stuck	"So this game is story of season: power of Oliver Town. I was in character creation thinking ""it's going to be tough to pick a gender"" but there wasn't any in the character creation, so you could have any hair style, face shape, voice or clothing. Which I think is pretty cool. 
Also thinking are we going to be a non-binary/agender character? But nope it is a kids game after all, so here we are. Still nice that you can pick anything in character creation, so that's a step."	"Looks like there’s no progressing past this point 😔

Games over
I remember this moment. I'm still glad for the positive progress made with the character creation choices. But it almost made immediately being forced back into the binary by this feel worse after that brief glimpse of possibility of enby being an option. At least there's no relationship gender lock.
I like how it defaults to a gender neutral term but then makes you choose a gendered term anyway 🙃

you were right there, game! and tripped on the finish line
Grandchild is in the question ;-;
I always flip a coin when they make me choose like this. A non-binary pokemon protagonist would have made my childhood.
I had the exact same experience 😔 I ended up doing what I usually do in games like this and making the most GNC character I could. Thankfully all the marriage interests are bi and any character can wear any clothing, and even in the marriage scene you get to pick which outfit you want to wear, so gender doesn't really matter except for pronouns in dialogue!
how do i get past this level???? did i need to do a glitch before to skip this step?
And its right after the awesome character customization too. 😔      
One day, they’ll get there
I always do whatever is the opposite of my AGAB
Damn, your gender got you softlocked :/
Real gamers: Games are so easy nowadays, they don’t even challenge you anymore

Me in the character creation screen: *whips off sunglasses* looks like another Sophie’s choice
I hate how close it is. Like it says grandchild right in the dialogue! All they have to do is say, “that would make him… my grandfather, yeah” Ugh.
Yea I just quit anch cuz I'm not interested in being constantly deadnamed. 

What is wrong with video game developers? Seriously. Its 2023
Pokémon did this to me too, hair and clothes not gender locked so I picked the cutest starter avatar and customised from there, and now every interaction it’s “miss [myname]” because it’s set at a school 😩
""My game's softlocked, anyone know a fix?""
Ugh, Olive Town was so close. Good bit of designing the character without binaries but… yeah.
Me starting a Pokémon game
I have tried to live as non binary but I found it way too frustrating, almost 99.9% of everything assumes gender binary, usually not deliverately against enbys but out of sheers lack of education through social experiences
Here we go agin...😩
Flip a coin
Not gonna lie, I've dropped games and not picked them back up for this. Like, sure it's a small dumb thing, but... fuck. Just. Tired.

It's like anti-dopamine.
His Grandchild* jeez, it isn't difficult. Why can't devs just add that third option to, literally, anything?
Noooo 😭
I do know a couple of games now where you can pick to be nonbinary and even your pronouns. I'm just happy more games are doing this
Sims 4 is the best example of this with you being able to choose body shape, voice, pronouns, if they can get pregnant or not, get someone else pregnant or not. And there, even adding top scars and binders soon.
Exactly my point XD why didn't they kept that?
Sequence breaking the gender binary
Harvestella let’s you pick body and neutral pronouns!
Yeah. Sims 4 is great for that. I'm in the US and play PC so I already have top scars, binders, and pronouns. But I know some other countries still don't have all those things yet. Hopefully everyone gets them soon.

Coral Island also has really great nonbinary character options, although it's still in early access. And Sunny Side, a farming/life sim with a very Persona-esque art style and social sim aspects. It's officially wrapped beta, but I don't think it's even to early access release yet (it started with Kickstarter). One to keep an eye out for if you weren't already aware of it and like that kind of game though!
They added binders & top surgery scars a while ago! As far as I know they release globally at the same time, did they not?
I shamelessly got the game when my friend told me this!"	127fgh3	NonBinary	602	0.99	2023-03-31 09:06:06

You look really cool.

I found them on Amazon!! I think I was just searching for cargo or khaki pants!
Yes!! I was huge into the cybergoth look when I was younger - the full plastic hair and goggles type haha :)
Lara croft is an icon hahaha
I found it in a charity shop, but the label says it's Boohoo man! :)
Behold: Pants!

:D
(also thank u)
are they all the way down to your ankles or just over the knees? do they fit comfortably? I found that men's pants are difficult to find in a size that fits me cause I'm short and have wide hips.
Ah ha I found them! I measured where my hip bone is (hopefully that makes sense) and picked the size closest :)

I have exactly the same problem! These go all the way to the ankles, but they have tie bottoms so you can shorten them to your knees.

I'll try see if I can find them in my Amazon history :)"	bfpwi6	NonBinary	588	1.0	2019-04-21 15:22:39

That style is you! Looks amazing!!
Your style is called: fabulous(ly queer)
I feel like pics 2 and 4 are ""Artist's casual"" but all of them are fantastic!
it’s *your* style and that’s all that matters
This is exactly how my nb ex dresses and I feel like it’s such a beautiful blend of different genders. Keep it up, it’s cute!
So good! That 1st pic is basically my goal!

A cheeky little comic I made about the struggle of trying to wear cute underwear when you’re a transfem enby 😅 Any recommendations for trans affirming clothing brands? 🤞		"Tomboy X has good gaffs
This isn't a brand, but you might consider boy shorts (it's a type of women's underwear). I find that they are really cute/fem but also ""keep everything under control"".
My ex girlfriend would always wear wemons boyshorts. She said they fit better.
This is my life lol
I like Calvin Klein hip briefs. They look like panties, but everything fits so well, only plain colors as far as I've seen tho.
I dont have the info on me, but ik for a fact that somewhere out there, there are cute fem undies made for cute fems who have a delicate package that needs cradled. I just don’t remember 😩
I feel called out lmao
And I don't really know any trans affirming brand but last time I went to C&A there was a sign basically saying they won't discriminate individuals for wearing what they wanted too
What about xdress? They have some really pretty stuff, which is made frilly and beautiful but patently for those who need a little extra room for equipment :) I haven’t tried any of their stuff because I’m particular about my undies, so I can’t speak to their comfort or durability, but they sure look nice.
Just gained a new follower on Instagram. I love, love, love your comics, wish I could give you a hug!
Parade makes a “dream comfort brief” (name of the style) which is basic but also girly and supports my anatomy. I own so many pairs in different colors
This took me a second to understand lmao awesome comic
Can’t recommend this place enough, their stuff fits my trans femme enby wife so well!
[https://www.fancysatinpanty.com/](https://www.fancysatinpanty.com/) Katie and Jacky panties and they have sizing guide for men
Too real
this is literally me in like half of my panties 🙃😅 took me a while but i do have a few that work consistently. but fr that shit be so annoying when you cant do anything about it the moment it happens💀 also HELLO!! :D i rarely see other people on here that share the transfem nonbinary label with me
I just wear bloomers. Still hella cute, but everything fits!
Check out MeUndies, they have underwear in all kinds of styles and patterns, and I think all of them have the option of lace. Also, pride flags. On underwear.
Hipsters is a good style that usually fits. And yeah the struggle is real with women's underwear. As a transmasc enby I'm bout to make the switch to mens underwear.
I didn’t get it, I didn’t get it, I reread the title, and then I did! And omg, lmao. 😂 Very well done.
If you know how to sew, it's easy to take a pattern for men's briefs (if you skip the fly it looks basically like panties with more room in front) and just make them in cute fabrics with picot lace trim! I got pretty knit fabric from spoonflower and bought the grundlewear pattern from stitch upon a time on etsy to make panties that fit my fiancé better.
You could try sock drawer heroes. It's an online store that sells products for trans people, including tucking underwear and lingerie.
It took me a second to get the joke lol
Yo I’m afab and 28 and I somehow still buy underwear too small. It’s like my brain is stuck thinking I’m the size I was 12 years ago. Lol
Cacique is my go to brand for cute, well made, supportive underwear. Even the thong holds everything snug.
I knoooooooooow dis 😭😭😭😹😹😹😭😭😭😹😹😹
TomboyX has gaffs?!
Started wearing them like 5 years ago and never looked back 😊 2 years before I came out.

They're expensive, so it's good to look for sales, but my favorite are Soma Vanishing Edge.
I wear these if I’m not wearing tight pants. I agree they’re super comfortable, but they don’t exactly hide the bulge.
A Headmate took a screenshot of advice from a Tramsfem about where to find cheap form fitting panties. The advice was:""Search Amazon using the keyword 'Sissy Panties'."" The image was:'A pair of panties but with extra room for the bulge built into the front'.
I’ve been using them for about a year now and I find them both comfortable and durable. Would recommend a delicates bag (they sell them quite cheap on their site) when washing them to protect them. Only negative I would say is the printed patterns can fade quite quickly but other than that they’re great.
Thank you sooo much Mia ❤️ virtual hugs all around 🤗
I’ll check this out!! Thanks :)
I’m not a man but thanks for the resource!
Good luck 🙌Hope that’s wonderful for you :)
Yes they do! And I have both styles, and they’re amazing!
Sorry, no I knew that but that part was why I liked them.
Thanks and same to you!

embracing more fem clothing and finally went outside in this!		"You seem like a fun they! Damn, that doesn't leave mush room for word play.

Looking excellent! Have a great day.
Everything about this is amazing. I love out there fashion. You are truly a champignon!
Mushrooms are just some weird little lifeforms in the space between plants and animals, and biologists had to give them their own category because they refuse to fit into either of the former. Mushroom nbs rise up!
The hat is so cool! Where did you get it from?
Did you randomly go up to people and say their princess is in another castle? Seriously that looks like it is a pretty good  mushroom outfit or Toad from mario outfit.  Which is awesome and amusing.  I love it, I want it.
Please excuse my dirty room 🙏
This is awesome
I absolutely LOVE this outfit!! Great job!!
That's so fucking awesome lmao
I feel like people would be only staring at your mushroom cap (haha get it? 😉🍄)
I love this !!! - most original look i seen for ages
Mushroom!
Where did you get your hat?
showed this to my friend. she said you look like a mushroom deity.
Amanita Muscaria has no gender!
Reject modernity, return to shroom
Your hat is so cool 😲

*MARIO!*
i absolutely love this
If ever I wanted to spam the upvote button this is the exact reason
Lovelovelove that hat
I had to keep reading it over as I was sure you said this was a costume of some sorts, but no? Lol that's pretty cool. Nice mushroom head, you 😏
Omggggg FUN
Mush appreciated pun!
Mush appreciated!
Mushies are the OG nonbinary organisms with some being sexual, asexual, and intersex all at once!
I made it! Followed some good videos on YouTube
Thank you!

Made from cardboard, fabric and lots of hot glue!

I made the hat for Halloween, but the rest is just my clothes. I did get some interesting looks with the hat though

Threw my hoodie in some bleach for a bit of gender euphoria. Do you guys have a particular item of clothing that makes you euphoric?		"I love your look! :) The hair especially 🤩.

Hm. For me, I'm not sure if there's one specific clothing item. But if I were to pick one, I have a necklace with a little butterfly in (fake?) amethyst, which makes me feel a little cute, a little GNC, a little feminine, even if the rest of my outfit is just standard dude stuff. I love it. 🦋💜
I have this big corduroy jacket that my dad gave to me. It's oversized with big shoulders and kind of old. I love wearing vintage stuff and this one especially since it used to be my dad's.
Holy cow what absolutely wonderful beauty do my eyes spy upon here? :000 you look so so cute ahhh🥺
And yes, I have euphoria clothes and dysphoria clothes actually. Some give me joy and happiness, and well, the others... I just keep procrastinating the act of sorting them out to put them in the donation container... 🤷‍♂️😂
I have a big hoodie that does the thing where it covers my whole hand. It semi does spinny
I have this one sweater.  It's got a wide collar and is not quite cropped, baggy sleeves, and is the perfect sweater for fancier or more casual vibes
It’s mega dope
You look incredible, holy shit! The bleached colour on that is awesome!
The result on the hoodie is so great?? I definitevely have to test that sometimes ! And the picture is sooo nice
You look amazing. I also have a sweatshirt that gives me lots of euphoria.
Dungarees - who knows why but Enby feels
Damn you look awesome as *fuck*

For me, it’d have to be my dungaree shorts :)
An old oversized hoodie
Oh shit that turned out really well, nice job! 

I have a couple sweaters I love to wear over button downs. Just classy af and a really chill vibe that makes me feel calm and genderless. So I love summer but winter has my favorite clothes.
I have a cat ear hat I bought at an anime convention recently. It isn't much, but it makes me happy.
Any and all hoodies for sure! Love yours!
A tank top paired with my binder or sports bra, and a NASA sweatshirt. Basically anything that is traditionally masculine, or hides/smooths my chest in some way.

That looks so good btw! I need to customize more of my own stuff.
I have a Deadpool hoodie that makes me feel super badass.

It's really soft, too
Oooo, that looks sick. 

And honestly for me it's a T-Shirt I have with the shoulders cut out. I like to present more femme because I find that the clothing looks nicer and feels nicer personally, and that shirt just feels super euphoric.
I too have a euphoria hoodie! It's tie dye with the words ""cease your investigations"" around the Illuminati symbol.
I have a whole outfit that makes me feel euphoric af. Sadly I haven’t felt comfortable enough to wear it anywhere…
I have a cardigan that feels really good to wear
That hoodie is fuckin dope as fuck
Jupp a white hoodie with dracula on it!
It's more of an outfit:

Bowler hat, simple black suit vest, random shirt, floor length piston skirt, budapester or boots (eitherway steelcapped), and a cane.
Yeah my binders !!! 😂😂 you are looking particularly cute !!
Cute
I love the look!

For me, I have this one pair of ripped jeans that are really big at the bottom and all the rips are kinda yellow to make them look more worn, and they have like 5 buttons. They’re super comfy and looks really good on me. I don’t know what it is about them but they make me so happy.
I can't explain it but this comment gave me so much warmth

Ok so real talk, I saw your pic and thought, wow, that person is very stylish and androgynous. Then I was like hmmmmmmmmm, then I looked a little closer, and I was like, ahhhh, they’re AFAB. Very smooth skin. I shall tell them my initial impression as a compliment and pretend I couldn’t tell they were AFAB.

AND THEN i saw your flair. No bamboozle fam 💚

Where did you get the jeans/jeggings from btw? :P

Any sewing friends on here? I couldn’t find any Femby clothing I liked, so now I’m trying to make some. Here’s my upcycled autumn fea inspiredness. I wanted flowy.	All rayon. The top was two dresses and the side panels of a men’s button up. The tie was stolen from my partners shorts. But in repayment, I fixed their elastic. I like the color. The shorts were originally pants. The floral panels on them were scraps from a previous project.	"Currently i'm more focused on patches and preserving my jeans, but i do plan on sewing some clothes in my life time. I'm also trying to learn embroider!
Amazing work! You should crosspost this to /r/femby, I'm sure they'd dig it.
My big dream is to sew my own clothes in the future. Clothes shopping stresses me out on so many levels. I can't wait till I can go supply shopping and go all out on my clothes.
I absolutely adore your outfit. It looks fantastic, OP.
Oh wow!! I love this!
I’m a knitter, so I can totally share the joy of making my own clothes! Would love to add sewing to my repertoire. 

And I love the outfit! It’s unique and cute, and it looks great on you.
Hello friend I've been sewing since I was 6. I may not answer right away but love questions and to see what people are making !♡
Love it! Currently making my own outfit for my wedding since non-binary formal clothes are so difficult to find!
Sewer here! Welcome to the journey! This looks liberating
I love sewing my own clothes. This outfit is super fun! I really like all of the paneling.
Nice work :-)

Not the same kind of sewing, but this is fire! Looks amazing!
Ahhh, I love it 💕 So much fae vibes 😍 I do sew too, but I haven't for a while, only mended stuff.
Cannot get over how cool this is!!! I’ve made some stabs at sewing button-downs and pants before (for professional masc clothes that actually fit my body) but these days it’s a lot more inserting panels and patching things, etc.
Love this!! I made a big ruffley skirt recently and felt very gender
I sew too :) and make patterns.
Looks cute!
this is insanely beautiful I'd love something like this
OMG I love this outfit so much! I can't sew myself, seem to always get all the threads tangled up the wrong way, but my mother is a brilliant tailor, and since I'm on the shorter side, she makes clothes for me that actually fits me
I didn’t realize that was a subreddit! I will!
I love overalls, but most are either ugly and designed for mechanics, or really pretty but with no room for my boys and their leading lady. So I knit myself some shorteralls and now I'm gonna take those lessons learner to knit some full sized ones for the winter 😁
I just had to tackle that problem recently!  I used vogues v1617. It’s a really pretty kimono jumpsuit. I made it in a Rayon crêpe.

ok? and? they look good
Thank you. Just an ordinary shirt that might be a tad to big for me.
That's okay! Neither can I but I still sing along anyway 😂
I never said they didn’t? I’m pointing it out because it’s not a men’s shirt. The pattern on the inside is very specific to horse show shirts that you wear underneath jackets."	mnks73	NonBinary	551	0.99	2021-04-09 16:18:28
tired of gender?		"Sorry I am already a wizard

Hey if your someone who wants to be femme and your bones's difference in length or breadth still gives you dysphoria, you can always trade with a someone who wants a masc version of those bones, and vice versa! Just pop em off, hand em over and recieve your new bones.
 
Non-binary people can just shuffle up a bunch of bones in a big hat with eachother and mix and match.
but i like my meat and neuron soup sloshing around up there

thanks but i'll pass
ughhhhhhhhhhh...yes plz. 😞

i'm so gd tired. i yearn for the simplicity of nothingness
I would kill to be an undead skeleton.
But I like my gender :(
Fuck it I'm just gonna turn into a bodyless spirit
I wonder if this content is suitable for r/voidpunk
The growth plate in my hips is probably entirely ossified by now. I'm still essentially pre-HRT. My bones will be in a masculine shape for at least the next few decades (they may eventually reshape, but certainly not soon). So I'd rather have flesh I can reshape between me and directly perceiving the bones whose shape is more or less fixed.
So how would we tell each other apart? Like one of those ""Hello my name is..."" sticky tags? Imagine the creativity that could be utilized. Like Timmy over here has a rainbow left femur, and Moss has their entire skeleton painted to look like their namesake to be a spy in the skeleton war.
2 genders
Even skeleton is gendered for eg pelvis width and elbow carrying angle
But you could be a skeleton wizard.
I was about to say that I can't imagine how much dysphoria my skeleton would give me
Remove the hips, replace it with magic
I always wanted to be a Lego

"So I recently cracked.I was so afraid. Like literally had the thought of ""I prefer to keep suffering daily then being a pain in the ass for everyone"" am afraid to come out and am afraid that looking kind of masculine people won't accept me.I'm not comfortable in my clothes but baby steps for now."		"Welcome! If people don’t accept you for being slightly masc I’ll fight them- that’s not the energy I want in my community. 

Also you hair is so lovely.
You’re beautiful
Lord you're stunning. Like, hard to look at with my just-woke-up eyes. At least let them adjust first before you go blinding me with all that.
Dude, you look awesome! And no-one is saying you have to be androgynous! You're welcome!
""I prefer to keep suffering daily than being being a pain in the ass for everyone"" is so relatable. I have been out for 8 years and I still have a hard time asserting my needs.

I also look vaguely masculine, mostly my ol' big beard, but plenty of folks are respectful of me as a non-binary person. 
You will get were you want to at your own pace.  This is not a race💙
i relate to your title completely and am so happy that you came out and found yourself. went by she/they for the convenience of everybody. nobody called me they and it made me feel terrible.

i hope you can continue to grow and find yourself !! goodluck
Often we wish were accepted. I too have that wish. I also realize they really aughta be more concerned if I accept them and their odd, insignificant opinions. For ages I used other people's words in my own voice against me. No more. 

You are beautiful in a way some can't handle. It will never be your fault that they came to the game unprepared. You owe nothing to anyone. You accept you. We accept you. Those other knuckleheads are just going to need to catch up. Don't let people try to convince you you aren't winning. Victory is difficult, but your difficulty signals the beginning of your victory.
Oh holy fuck, you're ABSOLUTELY GORGEOUS.  You in a well-fitted suit has me in shambles. 💕

I definitely relate to preferring being in pain rather than being annoying or whatever.  I rarely correct people who misgender me, because while I tend to present pretty neutral, I rarely get read that way.  Correcting people just means having to come out repeatedly to literally every stranger and aquaintence, and that's just too much effort.  But I'll beat someone up if they misgender my pals. 😤
Excuse meeee that black shirt and tie pic is to die for
You are beautiful as you. It takes courage to demand that the world treats you the way you want, and that can be a slow process. So take it slow. Baby steps. If you’re uncomfortable in your clothes, wear ones you are more comfortable in - if that’s too confronting in public, just wear them at home. Give yourself permission to be who you are. ❤️
You look absolutely awesome, like, honestly kinda goals, for me who's a non-binary guy.

Suffering everyday isn't worth it, take the baby steps that make you happy. Try out things and see what works, let yourself experiment. Non-binary only means not strictly man or not strictly woman... everything else works, be it a bit of feminine and masculine, be it none of it, be it a lot of one and some of the other... It's whatever works with you.
Gorgeous
I am so jealous of those luscious locks. You’re looking majestic OP.
I love your hair!
i accept you, you are valid and good and wonderful! also, your eyes!!! they are so incredible and you are so beautiful!! brown eyes are criminally underrated
🎉🎉🎉🥳
you look like the lovchild of Borns and Hozier and I'm in love akjshfkjshfd
Well I’m proud of you!! It’s a lot just to come out to yourself and make that realization
Your hair so long and thick im jealous 😄
Here to support!! Sending much <3 your way beautiful human

AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA.

You making me so happy... Thanks, seriously thanks.
🤭😊
You made me blush so hard I almost explote and make a mess in my kitchen....
Thanks.
Thanks!! Reddit helped me so much in my discovery for my sexuality and gender... I'm so happy that the Queer community is in media so clearly.
Thanks, reading this from somebody in the same situation helps a lot
Thank you, and same to you!
I hope your path gets easier everyday
AAAAAAAA THANK YOU.

You are too kind! 
That suit is from the 80 and has shoulder pads, actually it was my grandmother's she dressed a pretty genderless. 


I it must be so difficult... I like all pronouns but when somebody use they them or she her...  Sometimes I literally feel euphoric.

It would be so beautiful a world where everyone say.

Hi, nice to meet you, I'm X what's your name and your prounomus?
Thaaaanks this is so strange I don't know how to react to compliments because it hits so different when people compliment you for who you are and. It what they think you are
Wear them at home... You now I did that once with a. Crop top and I almost cry...

That's such a good advice.
Yes!! Gender is fluid! But... It is curious how something that actually doesn't affect that much to others. Can affect so much to yourself...

I wasn't a really dark place and I didn't know why today I didn't just came out to you guys I also came out to my best friends and all of you being so nice had to give me courage to do it and they are so nice about it.

I'm so happy for this community thank you pals.
Thanks 😊😊
Hahah thank you!  That's how I usually look people.

 people tell me that I look intimidating 👉👈 but it is what it is 🤷🏻‍♀️
I love your unicorn mug! I may have took a peek in your profile 😜
You are valid too! You pals are so nice
Hahaha well that's a compliment..
 Thanks!
Thanks! It was actually pretty hard...  I also come out to my friends today and part of it it's Couse  you to being so nice.
You give me confidence that I deserve to be happy.
Thanks! My grandfather give me this hair, but your hair is beautiful too, I like the color
I like your Baphamet t-shirt! You look awesome I'm it! I peek your profile hope it's okay 🙂
Somebody out of Reddit. And that attitude made me think that some people would act like that. ...and that maybe they were right.

 But this community is so welcoming that is overwhelming!!. 

And you pals are right, I should not listen to them or use their words to hurt myself.
Thank you for the award pal 💚
likewise. also, THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR THE REWARD !!
Nice to meet you, too!!

I'm Vesper, and I use they/them or fae/faer pronouns.
(I can DM you if you'd like?  You seem super chill, and I vibe well with wearing grandparents' clothes lol)
I know! Omg being non-binary and realising your gender is just the best feeling. 🥰
Cool! I checked out yours too. So why do you keep your books turned wrong way around?
thank u, thank u x
Thank you ☺
Thanks!! and ssh I totally did the same thing to you <3
Haha yeah ofcourse also My name is Wolfgang Neko, but becouse I don't know how to call myself is complicated I will tell you in DM!
Haha that! 
Well that's not my actual library.
 I sometimes rescue books that people are going to throw away to the garbage, most of the time when somebody old past away. (I obviously keep the ones I like) and I donated them.

Those books that are turned the wrong way are ""books to donate"" my actual library is the normal way around and organized alphabetically by the author surname.

Boyfriend thinks I am faking being nonbinary.	I’ve never had someone be openly aggressive to me about me being non-binary before until tonight. It feels really bad. This person said people think I’m a joke for using they/them pronouns, and that I am definitely cis because I present cis. He screamed in my face. I don’t blame people for misgendering me because I have long hair, usually shop in the women’s clothing section, and wear makeup. I don’t ever correct people when they use she/her to me, even though it makes me uncomfortable when people call me a woman. I like presenting femme. But to have someone tell me my identity is just… a lie… hurts on a really deep level. That I am being a bad ally for identifying as non-binary. That I am stealing someone else’s identity. That I am a fake. It really hurts. And that other queer people are also questioning my identity. I feel insecure. I want to cut off all my hair. I don’t want anyone to look at me or think I’m a woman ever again.	"Thanks everyone for your supportive words. I have decided to break up with the boyfriend. This has just been one painful thing on top of many other painful things, and I know I deserve to have someone in my life who respects me and loves me for who I am. I reached out to a few real life friends tonight and they all agreed too. Breakups are hard but it will be worth it to stand up for myself and show myself some respect. 💕 Thanks again all.
I’m sorry you’re going through this. This is emotional and verbal abuse. Massive red flag.
Hello I am a they/them, masc-presenting AFAB enby. I don't own any make up or dresses. I have short hair and work in a male-dominated field.

You can tell your boyfriend that I think your identity is 100% valid, and there is no such thing as ""stealing"" someone else's identity. I don't even know what that means. 

Go return your boyfriend and get your money back.
I'm sorri 🤗

Honestly it sounds like he's afraid of you being anything other than cis and this relationship might not last 😥
Boyfriend sounds like an ass.

Edit: congratulations on dumping the jerk
Hey that’s a huge red flag. That type of behavior is completely unacceptable and would make me afraid for my safety. I’m so sorry that you are feeling so invalid and insecure after what he did to you. Please consider the fact that your BOYFRIEND  is the one making you feel so bad about yourself. Is that something you want in a partner?

Please sit down and think deeply about what you want in a boyfriend.  What would a loving and fulfilling relationship look like to you? If your boyfriend is not living up to that standard then he needs to go. The bare minimum in my eyes is not getting in my face to verbally abuse and invalidate me. Please be safe and look after your own health and happiness. His behavior is horrifying.
Ahhhhhh congratulations on being single now OP! Sorry you had to deal with that stupid ex
As an AFAB fem-presenting enby, I'm gonna jump in and say OP totally didn't steal my identity either. 

The search to find the poor enby whose identity was stolen continues, but things aren't looking good guys, we might never find them. OP, on the bright side, you are on your way for a brilliant career as a professional thief cause I must admit this first heist, although amatorial, was absolutely flawless :)

(In case it wasn't clear i was 100% sarcastic pls don't blast me thank u)

Also I'm happy to hear you dumped him lol
that's an unacceptable way to treat someone. of course youre valid <3
Ditch the boyfriend. You should never be yelled at for your identity, and honestly should generally not be yelled at at all (barring being about to injure yourself or others)
Heard you broke up with him, which I am glad to hear, because you deserve better. It's never easy to leave someone you love though, or even just someone you care deeply about. I hope you're doing alright. Just know you are loved and supported here. Also, you'll find someone who loves you just the way you are eventually, don't forget that - how you identify is valid and there is nothing wrong with it.
Good that you're breaking up. Not accepting you for you isn't something a partner will suddenly change. 

> that other queer people are also questioning my identity

Those people are assholes. Nonbinary isn't ""one"" thing...

> I want to cut off all my hair. I don’t want anyone to look at me or think I’m a woman ever again.

You can't control others, only yourself. Don't cut your hair just because others are jerks if you like having long hair. Even if you cut your hair off, some people will just find another ""reason"" to misgender you.
Hey I’m an AFAB femme non-binary who solely uses they/them but doesn’t correct people when they say she/her. I have long hair and shop in the women’s section because I think women’s clothes are cute. 

I’m non-binary as fuck. And so are you.
I have a boyfriend who supports my gender identity and doesn’t feel uncomfortable about me being myself completely, autism included.  I hope that you will find someone like that for yourself.
So glad you're breaking up. You don't need that negative energy in your life
dump his crusty ass and block him, i dont understand why you still stick around. he doesnt give a crap about you or how he makes you feel. im sorry for what he's put you through tho, your identity is valid.
Update: the deed is done. The breakup text has been sent.
I'm sorry that happened to you, I'm glad you broke up with him, he sounds shitty. You are nonbinary! Doesn't matter how you present. Just in case you need to hear it again.
I’m so sorry this happened to you. Your identity is not up for debate. 

This is also kinda the reason I’ll stay in the closet indefinitely. If my boyfriend acted like this toward me, I don’t know how I could cope.
Good riddance to him, everybody should be supported by people who love and validate them 💕
Fuck him. You could be AFAB and dress like a 60s women straight out of a kitchen utensil commercial and that wouldn't make you less of who you are.
A lot of people are saying break up with him. Don't break up with him - dump him. There's a difference.
I’m sorry you are experiencing this. As a mostly femme presenting non-binary individual who doesn’t advocate for themselves, I feel this in my soul. I just take the misgendering and laugh it off. I won’t speak out because I am non-confrontational when it comes to matters about me but I will speak out for others. 

Does this make you or I any less of our identity? No. I think it’s more of a reflection of the society we live in. Should we have to advocate for our gender identity when it is known? Should we be in positions where others knowingly misgender us and laugh about it? It’s harmful and kind of abusive and not okay. But whether or not you’re comfortable to speak against it doesn’t make you more of a “woman” or a “man”. You are still what you identify as. Their choice to accept that and behave is a reflection of their character not on your identity.
Good for you for breaking up with him. 

People can’t seem to understand that non-binary does NOT mean androgynous. It’s not a third gender that rides the line between man and woman. It simply means that you don’t identify as a man or a woman. 

Non-binary is in and of itself an extremely vague label, and IMO that’s a good thing. 

Im a non-binary person who very much looks like my AGAB, but that doesn’t make me (or you) any less of a non-binary person.
I'm so sorry. These aren't good friends or partners if they can't make room for the fact that nonbinary doesn't look like one singular thing and one can present differ ways and be nonbinary. You deserve room to express yourself authentically and be affirmed by people who truly love and see you. 

You aren't fake and you aren't invalid.
What a prick. Glad you're dumping his sorry ass
I'm so relieved to come to the comments to see you kicked him to the curb. Good for you. I present femme 80% of the time, still an enby. You don't owe anyone androgyny.
Tell him the only thing you’re faking is your feelings for him. You deserve someone supportive.
Hi, Im also nonbinary and present femme because well, making myself appear androgynous takes time, money, and effort that I don't have right now. I use any/all pronouns and mostly just cringe when someone calls me a woman or girl.

I'm sure others have said it, but I will again anyway. You don't owe anyone androgyny. Present how you want to for whatever reasons you want to. You aren't stealing someone else's identity. A huge point of being nonbinary is that you get to define your own expression, whether that's within or outside of typical gender norms. 

I'm glad you're dropping the boyfriend.
I just wanted to drop a comment to say presentation does not equal gender, and you don’t owe anyone androgyny.

I struggled with my gender identity for a while, finally settling on gender-fluid (though my personal experience is somewhat bi-gender as well), and even on days that I am male, which is most days, I present femme because I don’t feel like I need to reject “women’s” clothing in order to be a man.  The fact that I have dysphoria and would be willing to get my tits cut off is proof enough for me (though I’m not saying that you have to have dysphoria to be under the trans umbrella).

I read through some of the comments, and I’m glad you’re cutting off your relationship with someone so judgmental.  I wish you the best of luck moving forward!
I apologize 4 the queer ppl whom say such and wanna assure you that you're 100% valid.
You mean ex-boyfriend
The boyfriend sucks a lot and I’m happy you are breaking up with him. If you have no attachment to your hair and like the idea of presenting more androgynous, short hair is something I’ve liked and has made me feel better about presenting femme still as well :) most importantly though present however you want. Non-binary doesn’t look like anything, non-binary breaks the gendered need to stuff everyone in boxes. You can be a femme non-binary person. It’s okay.
How are you doing? I think we are all here for moral support 💜
I can tolerate a lot of wrong assumptions because there's much I'm not ready to share, and even more I am not sure how to share and show; but not from a partner. A partner should hear me, not scream my wrongness.
This person sounds hurtful and to be honest abusive. Very glad to see you decided to end things with this person. 

You know who you are, don't let assholes dictate to you who you are.
I'm sorry that other ""queer"" people think this as well. They're probably cis gay dudes lmao
Tell him to eff off and stop being such an immature twat, you deserve better. Presentation and gender aren't the same thing, and nonbinary is an umbrella term for a bajillion different genders, anyways.
Sorry this happened to you. You should never have to cut your hair or get a surgery or not wear gender oriented clothes or not do gender oriented things just to be “more non-binary.” Anyone who tells you any different doesn’t even know what they’re talking about. Doing any of the above will never ever make you less enby.
Yeah sometimes friends and family for me are like this. I mean they don’t try to misgender me on purpose but it’s not like an active practicing either where they literally identify me using “they/them” as part of their speech to me and I cut off all my hair so lmao. I identify as she/they because I think it’s too hard for most of them to use anything else. I am very fortunate to have a partner who supports me and even offers his clothes to me. Sometimes I get very agitated where I have to say loudly “I’m not a girl” like I did a few times at game nights. It’s not great that you’re being ignored (too). I definitely empathize with you. Personally if my partner wasn’t able to accept and support me, I don’t think we could be together. I think your boyfriend may have issues with it because it may make him feel like he needs to question his attraction towards you, which isn’t fair. It’s just odd he’d be so belligerent towards you like it’s hurting *him*. He’s obviously embarrassed but he should be embarrassed about himself and his behavior. It’s been a journey for sure but just know you’re not alone. ❤️🏳️‍🌈
I am an afab femme presenting enby (although I’m not trying to be femme presenting but people tend to gender everything and think that I am… but I did get called a tomboy by a cis friend who didn’t know I was enby the other day so that was a nice change despite being gendered lol!) 

Anyway.. I completely get the fears of people thinking your identity is a lie and wanting to change things about yourself for people to see you differently because of that. And ultimately if that makes you the most comfortable and happy with yourself, go for it. But don’t think that you have to in order to be valid in your identity as non-binary. Because it’s called called non-binary for a reason. And outside the binary doesn’t necessarily mean you present androgynous or as the opposite gender you were assigned at birth. You can present yourself and express yourself however you want without assigning a gender to it. 

Who said that long hair is for femmes and short for mascs and that’s it for everyone? That’s the same as saying pink is automatically a girls color. Gendering everything is creating a binary. Wearing what you want and expressing yourself however you want despite traditional binary gender roles is non-binary.
Your boyfriend is not respecting you, and he is not loving you for who you are. You deserve a partner who truly loves and supports you.
That ain't your boyfriend anymore. That is a pile of refuse.
Oh bb I’m so sorry that’s just terrible. I’m glad I saw your update and you left because the level of disrespect here is astounding. Be kind to yourself, your presentation is yours and yours alone. Keep looking however makes you happy!! Sending love and validation
Cuz your boyfriend's a b*tch! No seriously that's some terrible treatment, you so deserve better! You are non-binary, you are valid, and if you can afford that, dump him as soon as you can.
pls just leave your boyfriend, you deserve better. Honestly be glad its not your parents assumed that they think know everything about you when they really dont. Last year, I told my mom that  my gender expression Androgyous and you know i thought she took pretty well or so  I thought. but  I still having those questions about it  because I wanted to feel comfortable in my own body despite me not experiencing any gender dysphoria. When I found out about Gender nonconformity made feel like I belonged int the LGBTQ community 

&#x200B;

The one thing that made me feel disappointed was my mom telling me That androgyous means non binary just  because I told her that I dont care which clothes I would wear whether if it for a female or male I would still both.............. but shockingly enough this after when I told her that I was Genderqueer.........and well It didnt go so well my mom told me that Genderqueer means that Im a lesbian  and that I was accepting theses labels for no  reason. parents are gonna make damn assumptions about you when they dont know everything about. I didnt say her that Girls, identify as nonbinary, all I want was for her to accept my gender expression and Gender identity
someone once told me something that has stuck with me for years: breakups almost always suck, but they're also almost always *good* things. the changing or ending of a relationship usually signals a time of growth or healing. in your case, it sounds like this is learning that you deserve to be respected and don't have to settle for people who don't love you the way you are.

there's no such thing as ""presenting cis,"" although I think we all know what is meant by it. having long hair doesn't make you less nonbinary anymore than having short hair does. doing makeup or dressing fem doesn't make you any less nonbinary than having a beard or dressing masc. what's ironic is nobody would have said you ""present cis"" if you were amab. why do they thing there are different ways to present nonbinary depending on our AGAB? that sounds, well, pretty binary. ignore them <3
I breathed such a sign of relief reading this comment, no joke. Anyone who is comfortable screaming at their partner, calling them a joke like that is not someone who will provide a healthy relationship. You deserve so, so much better. It'll be hard in the short term and so insanely worth it in the longterm, I am so proud of you ❤️
I’m so relieved to hear that. I’m also so sorry that you had to be let down so badly by someone who is supposed to love and support you. I hope this is just one of many steps you take to actively bring love and happiness into your life. Its a hard thing to do and none of us are perfect, but you don’t deserve to be abused in the way your boyfriend abused you. Please always remember that 💜
I agree that breakups are difficult, but if the person can’t accept you for who you are, then it’s not worth it. You’ll make it work, and you have our full support!
Good on you sweetie! If he's able to treat you like that once, he'd probably do it again, and you deserve better! Remember, no matter how femme or masc you present, you are 100% valid!❤️
Best of luck love, breakups hurt, but yeah, sometimes it's the thing which has to be done to preserve your self worth. 💜
I'm so glad to hear this. Sending all the good vibes your way.
Good for you OP <3
People suck 😥
Yes! So sorry you had to deal with that. You are valid as you are and your identity is yours to decide. Best wishes ✨
Life’s too short to stay with abusive and non-supportive partners. You made the right call. 💖
Proud of you!
Your identity is your own and I’m proud you stood up for yourself! I hope all the happiness to you, and thank you for being an inspiration in our community! ❤️🙏
You deserve happiness and supportive relationships - the right people are out there and are able to love you as you are. I’m 48 and have been happily with my wife for almost 13 years when I finally put the obvious pieces together that I was non-binary. She was and continues to be supportive and loving and understanding. And accepting as I slowly navigate my way through this, switching to he/they, etc.
It’s good that you broke up with him and tho it may be hard you don’t need that toxicity in your life. You will find someone out there for you I believe in you.
I'm so glad.  My first thought reading through this was ""holy shit why does the title not say EX-boyfriend?!?""  Nobody deserves to be treated like this, and ESPECIALLY not by their partner.  If your partner isn't affirming your gender identity, they don't deserve to be your partner.
Good for you OP! He sounds ignorant and hateful. Good riddance
I already know this sub has got your back, but I want to be another voice telling you that you are valid and you deserve so much more than what this person is giving you. Sending you so much love and strength- it will be difficult but you deserve better.
wdym ""red flag"". Instant Break up
This made me smile. Thank you. 💕
Afab, fem-presenting enby, here too. Nope, my identity is also safe.
Yes! Exactly! My most complimented shirt is from the boys section (not mens) does that make my 30 yo ass a little boy? 

I have to remind myself all the time too, especially when I wear makeup, there's no way to present nonbinary.
Honestly kind of shitty. I do feel super validated by everyone who has commented, I am not at all doubting my identity, but my feelings are really hurt by the boyfriend. I am a non confrontational person and I have been trying to work up the courage to try to talk to him to break things off, but it’s so hard. I am also worried he’s going to make fun of me to his friends (who are also my friends) and just afraid of everyone talking about me behind my back about my gender identity being fake. I feel a little traumatized tbh. I don’t want to be yelled at again.
> having long hair doesn't make you less nonbinary anymore than having short hair does.

It makes you more metal, lol. General length of hair being gendered is silly.

> breakups almost always suck, but they're also almost always good things.

To put it another way, breakups suck, but so does being in a relationship where both people aren't happy.
nah Life and people suck the most
I don’t think they disagree. A massive red flag definitely constitutes instant break up
Yesterday I neatly folded my identity and put it on a chair, but today I can't find it. OP must have stolen it. :P

OP, glad that you are getting away from this person! I think he is deeply misogynistic and loves feeling better than women. That is a reason why he gets so aggressive when you want to get out of that little box.
Crap, the mystery deepens
Exactly. There is only societies expectations, which the point of enby is to shatter 💜
Do you live together? If not, I'd say do it over text and if your friends get gossiped to, show then this post.
Yeah I know, I just heard ""Massive Red Flag"" for everything on r/Tinder
I as well, I swear I put it somewhere, but I just can’t find it anywhere, I have my sneaking suspicions about OP. Just kidding, what’s my gender (*can be*) your gender. Anyone who gets mad at you for “stealing their gender” doesn’t know how gender works. As long as your gender is what makes you comfortable, then that’s all that matters in this sense.
I did it by text. I completely cut things off and said no contact.
Alright, well probably don't take social queues from r/Tinder
Good for you! You doin okay?
Yeah, hanging in there. Luckily I have like three friends that have been talking to me through the process so I don’t feel totally alone. I have pushed people away a bit in the relationship… but luckily I have some really awesome friends that know I’m NB and support me all the way.
Good, I'm glad you have support!"	11pvntq	NonBinary	537	0.99	2023-03-13 01:03:47

Capitalism is Incompatible with Non-Binary Identities and Gender Abolition	"Capitalism absorbs and commodies every subculture. Look at the punk aesthetic, which is all about rebellion and resistance, which is now its own store at the mall.

Non-binary identities and gender abolition are about the erasure of categories that can be easily commodified. I don't want to shop in the men's or women's section; I want to go to the clothes and buy something that's cute and fits. But capitalism's attempt to fully commodify me means it needs to fit me into a box. 

As non-binary identity becomes more and more commodified, you will see a set of stereotypes emerge that will become the single new non-binary style. We will see a lot less of, ""You don't need to dress any particular way to be non-binary,"" to a common aesthetic with its own market and preferred providers who meet the new niche. This subculture will be resisted by the dominant culture until it becomes a way it can be commodified, at which point we will not be non-binary any more, but instead just a third gender to be marketed to in new and ""hipper"" ways."	"My experience is this is already happening. In the few clothing stores I've seen that offer a ""gender-neutral"" or ""unisex"" range, the clothing in those categories is very much geared towards a specific androgynous style.

I don't hate the style, but I hate this behaviour.

Edit: corrected spelling.
I agree. No ethical consumption under capitalism even in alt sub cultures.
But. Alt subcultures like punk especially developed because those people couldn't afford anything else so they had to get creative. Now 2 generations later people still can't afford anything else so where else are they going to get their clothing but cheap crap online retailers like cider and shein. Queer people are more broke than ever but if there's a way they can still express their core identities for very little money then they're also free to do that because what else can they afford.

You are totally right in order for capitalism to function it requires an ""ideal"" to work for and an ""other"" to discriminate against all the while selling you the stereotypes of both.
Capitalism is incompatible with life in general
Capitalism is incompatible with the human experience, it’s core is exploitation
My dyslexic ass read the first word as ""cannibalism"" and I'm like, that doesn't know a gender, does it?
Agreed.  Capitalism and Patriarchy always attempts to co-opt revolution and slot into a place where it become profitable and controllable.
I’ve felt for a long time you cannot truly be for liberation of ANY oppressed/marginalized group without being anti-capitalist.
There's a great article about this by Marcella Althaus Reid. Capitalism reinforces norms that benefit cis gender white men. Non binary folk challenge this norm and are a threat to the system.
Idk, I think it's possible for clothes to be sold without gender. Just like how kids' toys are much less gendered than they used to be, clothes could also have a market without relying on gender. Clothes are still gendered because of culture. Culture will decide what the stereotypical non-binary aesthetic is, not capitalism.

Non-binary can (and probably will) become a commodified fashion aesthetic but that's not really the fault of capitalism. Even in a hypothetical society where everything was free, I'd expect there to be a group of people who want to fit in by wearing a particular aesthetic
Working in capitalism is incompatible too. I look mainly stereotypically feminine. But my mannerisms, thoughts, speech, etc are more masculine. So I piss people off at work a lot. People don’t know what to do with me. Am I supposed to be meek like a proper professional woman? Or am I supposed to have a backbone like the strong professional man? 

So I’m always at odds with various people who expect me to be something other than I am. 

Everyone says “you gotta play the game in corporate America”

But they also say “be yourself”. 

But I can’t be myself and play the game. 

It blows.
capitalism is incompatible with humanity as a whole
Give it time, they'll try to sell it to us
It's already happening. Companies have started making ""gender-free"" ""gender neutral"" options in addition to men's and women's sections that are not any different than men's clothes. There are specific clothes heavily marketed towards trans people - which normally I'm ok with because sometimes they are actually designed with different goals in mind - however some stuff is almost identical to regular clothing and they are extremally overpriced for what they actually are. I'm guessing in the future pushing the idea that one must get rid of all their gendered items and get almost identical gender neutral options will be pushed by companies - instead of them just de-gendering all products.
Capitalism is the idea that, if there is a spigot with money coming out, somebody will put a bucket under it. 

And then they will defend that bucket to the death!

If there is a market for ""non-binary"" clothing, somebody will try to fill it. And somebody else will probably try to follow them and steal their market. The imitation will become a style, and some people will mistake the combination of terminology and style for a definition of identity, either for others, or for themselves.

As I am always pointing out, terminology is a tool that we can use to describe the way we are, not a mold for us to pour our identities into. Too many people asking ""Am I trans enough?"" ""If I'm non-binary, is it ok for me to do X?"" 

Just be you. 

Don't let anybody else define you. 

Whether that is a thread on Reddit, a book by a noted scholar, or the Hot Topic clothing store.

Capitalism will capitalize. You get to choose whether to buy what they are selling. 

Especially when what they are selling is identity...
Totally agree
I think you intended to talk about _consumerism_, not capitalism. Capitalism would encourage a wide variety of options for the most amount of sales. But you are very right that as subcultures become more accepted in society, consumerist markets determine what products are offered by tailoring the illusion of choice with sprinkles of niche aesthetics. Once they concede that a unisex option is required, they will agree to sell this ‘third gender’, but not offer a truly unisex shopping experience for anyone to access products that work for them.
People shouldn't need to have a certain opinion on economy for their identity to be valid. Economy is complex and people should have time to think about it in peace and inform themselves about how capitalism and other systems affect different people. Saying it isn't compatible with non-binary identities restricts that or gender exploration/discovery or both and doesn't benefit anyone.

I see problems with capitalism but I also see problems in all other system I know. I still have to do research and I have no clue what's best at the moment and maybe I never will. I do know I'm non-binary though.

We should welcome all non-binary people in this community no matter what they think about the economy (or other topics that are not directly related to being non-binary) as long as they're not queerphobic/racist/etc.
Homophobia is incompatible with non binary identities not capitalism
If society wanted more (true and diverse!) ""unisex"" clothes in stores and less sepration then I think capitalism would pick up on that. I feel like the main problem is that most people are comftable in the system, and capitalism follows what the paying majority wants.

Capitalism did help spark some separation, stereotypes and stigma tho, so it certainly doesn't help.

Edit: and most will absolutely avoid things that could potentially make karens angry, so no nice things for us anyway. Imagine being able to buy a binder in any regular store - even if that was profitable - not gonna happen.
ngl when i read that title i was like wtf is u talking about but no i get you lmfao carry on 🫡
Good luck getting rid of the market economy in less than 15 lmao
[removed]
> We will not be non-binary any more, but instead just a third gender to be marketed to in new and ""hipper"" ways.

""A third gender"" is perfectly compatible with ""non-binary"", and as far as I know plenty of people under the ""non-binary"" umbrella already identify that way. And as far as I know plenty of people under the ""non-binary"" umbrella aren't strong proponents of gender abolition either.

Also I don't think the concept of a non-binary gender identity is quite so fragile that commodification of a subculture associated with that identity makes people not be that thing anymore.

Like, if we're complaining about the eternal treadmill of all things into shallow ""hip"" garbage, the equation of ""identity"" with ""subculture"" is a big step in that direction, so maybe let's hold off on that. Punk is a subculture. ""Non-binary"" isn't.

(And if you're already taking that step, then it's not clear to me that anti-capitalism has a chance of saving you.)

If I had to list some things subculture membership pressures me into via ""hipness"", I'd put hating capitalism pretty high. ""You don't need to dress any particular way to be non-binary, you just need to weave anti-capitalism into your identity."" Neither the consumerist hell-machine telling me I have to dress a certain way nor the rebels telling me I have to feel a certain way about capitalism are welcome to lean on my gender to tell me these things.
Kinda like the Borg if you will a desire to catalogue dynamic things in to a flat static manipulable data set....skinning the culture and using the culture vulture influencers to hawke the latest on the fashion runaway. It's what they want, to skin the good bits and parade around in a safe facsimile without ever engaging the ugliness that gave birth to it.  


  
I suppose I always thought of non-binary to myself as an intermediate word due to the willfully under developed language surrounding it in english, I was kinda hoping folks from cultures may be willing to share gender relationship perspectives.  


Maybe if it's left as a set of relationships to ones emotional sense of self and those you interact with with descriptors coming in to being as needs dictate, a sort of waivering language.  


I wish they'd stop culturally A\*\*\*ing every attempt to cultivate any sort alternative resource allocation models. See those who use the word cuck with a guttoral contempt. it's a bit of a projection imho, how they see themselves and their relationship to societies resources and to bully out everyone else.  


I wish I had a better answer than to make emotional intelligence and empathy an educational priority. Needs a lot of mum energy.
Capitalism kills
Cis gender straight white man
When they say ""be yourself"" they mean ""buy this product so you can be your true self"" I guess ;(
Exactly this. They can add a huge markup to completely regular clothes, just like how you can also buy biological food for huge markups. Or clothes that are supposedly better for the world in some way. Etc.
I agree with your point, although I'd argue that consumerism is a direct consequence of capitalism.
I feel like this post was commentary on what companies will do with their products and advertising and not a personal attack towards non-binary people. It's not saying you cant identify with being non-binary and like capitalism.
Your identity can be valid and you can also believe things that hurt people who share your identity.
Homophobia is a product of imperialism, i.e. capitalism.
have you ever heard of market socialism? worker cooperatives are an example of this where everyone who works there gets a share of the company and gets a vote on how the business is run.
you can't be a capitalist unless you actually own capital, you can advocate for capitalism without having any capital though.
The word you're looking for is ""class traitor.""
Yes, thanks for that edit!
I don't think it was an attack on nonbinary people, since OP hasn't said anything queerphobic.

However, I do feel pressure from the online queer community in general to have a certain opinion on the topic. You can see that the only person in this comment section who has said that they like capitalism got downvoted. This stresses me, since I don't understand the topic and I would like to have a space where my identity is accepted and I can explore other ideas without getting judged immetiately (as long as I'm not queerphobic/racist/sexist/ableist/etc. of course). I don't want to be pressured into other boxes in the only space where I don't have to fit into the gender boxes.

Maybe OP is doing exactly that, just exploring ideas and sharing their thoughts. I do think they have good points and it's an interesting topic to discuss, but I also think we need to be careful about the distinction between our identity and our opinions or the issues that our community faces.
That's true.

Capitalism isn't queerphobia though, it doesn't affect nonbinary identities as directly as queerphobia does. Capitalism affects everybody (although not everybody in the same way), just like every other economic system. Other systems could hurt nonbinary people too. We should get to question what's best and consider all options, including the one that capitalism isn't worse than everything else.

I think it's good that this topic is talked about and it's important to point out how capitalism affects nonbinary people. However, saying that capitalism is inherently incompatible with nonbinary identities isn't the same as saying that capitalism affects nonbinary people negatively. It's saying that you can't be nonbinary in a capitalist system or that you can't be nonbinary and capitalist. This is not true and in my opinion bad for nonbinary people because it makes them shut up about important questions that should be asked and discussed.
Homophobia is more like a by-product of class relations and imperialism than strongly caused. Unfortunately, you could still have an anarchist, socialist or even communist society and still have homophobia and queerphobia.

(Also, colonialism =/= capitalism, it predates it but they make each other a heck of a lot worse!)
But I have capital not a lot but I have it.
Nuances are hard to talk about, I think. In part because our language is fuzzy and I may not understand the same thing that you were trying to say. 

I think it's important to explore and understand (and be able to talk about) ideas and their nuances, otherwise we don't really know if we're criticizing the same thing. And that will probably alienate other people who are also just trying to explore and understand.

I'm usually on the side of ""capitalism bad"" but it's also more complicated than that. What we think of as ""capitalism"" is only one form of it. ""Neoliberalism"" is a better term for the system/ideology we live under now, and deals a bit more with the specific commodification of ideas, identities, and human relationships in general.
Capitalism adds to dehumanization though, so it is indeed queerphobic, because capitalism demands that cis binary sex and straight marriage be the basis of society since capitalism needs more and more young people to explore, and throw them in the trash when they get old and ""useless"". I think one cannot stand up for human rights and capitalism at the same time, those are mutually exclusive.
being a capitalist also means that you own the means of production (eg. factories, farms, workplaces) and that you don't have to sell your labor to survive.
I agree that capitalism in it's pure form, without any restrictions and protection of workers/minorities etc. is not a good system because of the exploitation that you mentioned.   
At the same time, capitalism is an efficient system because it produces what is demanded and not what some authority says.  
I think we have to find some middle way between capitalism and something else to have an economic system that is as efficient as possible while still being accepitng of minority groups and having good working conditions.

i just want to be pretty in the way boys are pretty	does anybody else struggle with this? like idk, sometimes i wish i was born a boy so i could have a more traditionally masculine body and still wear pretty clothes like skirts without looking like a girl😩 idk one of these days maybe i won't care so much but i really wish id have been without such feminine features😮‍💨	"This is exactly how I feel,  I want people to look at me an think ""*femboy*? ""

I just want to be seen as both masculine and feminine and feel pretty ;-; 

I want to wear feminine stuff but not be seen as a girl but even when I'm trying to dress masc I'm still misgendred  in the way that's makes me uncomfortable 

Being called him? No particular feelings but better then her

I just need to wait one year until I can finally start T
Same but the opposite. I (amab) find myself wishing for masculinity in an afab way. It’s pretty frustrating honestly
I feel the same way, and have been trying to work out a dose of testosterone that feels right so I can be more masc in a skirt
I feel this way all the time. What I want in my heart is to look like a guy in a dress. I want to be perceived as base masculine and then wear feminine attire. 

I am well aware of the grief that AMAB people and people perceived as men get in feminine clothing. And I know the price it would come with. And it is something I still want. 

Comments about what treatment masculine perceived people in femme perceived clothing received are not helpful. They hurt. 

Comments about wear what you want or don't copy others do not help. They are ignoring the core desire. 

It is a core desire to start from a base of masculine and then a presentation of feminine. It is about how we are perceived, whar our body looks like, and then how we are treated. 

And personally. The grief of looking like a man in a dress would be preferable than being seen and treated as a cis woman.
I feeeeeeel thiissss!!!! I feel like people with more masculine features can actually pull off androgyny, whereas anyhting I do gets interpreted on a scale of ""ah. straight woman"" to ""that's a butch lesbian"" and there is nothing outside of that. It's SOOOOOOO frustrating.
I have this the other way around lmao
I'm the opposite. I wish I was born a girl so I could get away with wearing men's and women's clothes. I feel like people AFAB have TONS more options in clothes. If I wanted to wear something tighter or more feminine, I'd either have to worry about my dick showing, the clothes not fitting my proportions properly, or the looks I'd get 😭
I can totally relate to this! I am enby and like to where skirts sometimes, but I don't like how a lot of people (at least a lot of people who I talk to) always tell me ""well if you want people to see you as enby then don't where a skirt."" I was AFAB and just because I have a feminine body and sometimes like to where skirts doesn't mean i am ""asking to be miss-gendered"" I want to wear a skirt and not be seen as a girl! we really need to get rid of the clothing stereotypes.
i just wanna be pretty the way girls are. wear pretty dresses and shit
This is very much how I feel. 

I get dysphoric about being assigned female, about being forced into the ""woman"" box. I want  femininity to be something I can visit on my own terms, not a social expectation.
Opposite for me aaaaaa
Yes this is the exact thing I want. I want to be feminine in the way pretty boys are. I wanna wear a skirt but not be seen as a girl. 

I am afab and I don’t have a problem with femininity, I just don’t want to be seen as a woman but as a feminine boy.
I’ll trade you. I wish I was born female cuz then I could wear a skirt without feeling so damn self conscious and the imposter syndrome of “just dressing up” (actually got that one once)
Yes...

I feel like if I was able to take testosterone, I'd be really happy about the changes

but I'm married w/ 2 kids, and I can't do that to my husband
Yes! I’m AMAB, and I still want to look pretty in the way boys are pretty, because I have way more masculine features (male-pattern baldness being the main one) that really detract from that, I feel. It’s a big reason I want to look into hrt, though not the only one. 

To an extent, I understand that feeling.
feel this sooooo hard. i’m like a transmasc femboy
THIS!! The only time I feel comfortable in skirts and dresses is if I'm binding. And I wanna look cute and Femme but in the way only guys can be, y'know. I used to think that discounted me from being trans masc, but then I realized, if cis guys are allowed to wear more femme clothing (those who are brave enough to lol) then why shouldn't trans masc people be allowed to do the same?
SAME. I personally actually quite like my body, but it annoys me that no matter what I do people try and force me into the “woman” box. Like, I see myself as a femboy 100% and I sometimes wish others would too :/

I still don’t know for sure, but I find myself often thinking about what it might be like if I went on T. I don’t think I’d want to be on it long term, but I like the idea of going on a low dose and just seeing what happens? I like being pretty and cute but I want to look like a boy who’s pretty and cute and I don’t really. 

I don’t think I’ll ever know for sure if HRT is the right path for me and as of right now I probably wouldn’t be able to go on it (I don’t thinkkkk my fam would be super duper unhappy at it but I’ve got enough going on atm and I don’t know if I can’t handle any more changes right now my life sob) but I feel like I think about hrt a suspicious amount 🤔
FUUUCK, SO MUCH YES. I am so envious of the several AMAB nonbinary folks I know because their aesthetic is exactly what I wish I could have. 😭 but if I wore earrings like that or painted my nails like that or wore those sweaters or whatever I would just look like a classic cis woman. 😒

I just started T though recently, and I've been working out, especially focusing on my shoulders in hopes it'll give the illusion of more broadness, so I'm hoping I can at least get closer to that aesthetic someday. 🙄
Maybe you can think about the specific things about that which are appealing so you can move towards a clearer picture. That might help you figure out what’s achievable for you!
FUCKING SAME
Haven't fet this seen by a reddit post/comment section in a very long time
I 100% know what you mean. When I wear a dress and do my makeup I really want to look like a beautiful man in a dress. I wish I knew how to achieve that
I feel the same but sort of the opposite.

I wish I could wear men's clothing the way women wear it, so I wish I were born a woman, because I worry that I just look like a normal guy in men's clothing. I could go on and on and on... but my rant would be too long. What I can say is that gender-affirming treatment to make my body look ""more like the opposite sex"" has helped (HRT among other things).
I want that too. I want people to look at me and see a boy in a dress. Just like in the manga Thigh High
Me too, OP. Maybe not exactly taking it to the ""wishing I was born a boy"" part...Idk. it depends. But me too.
Yes exactly. I want to be feminine in the way guys are feminine and masculine the way girls are. Specifically the feminine one
I wish I could be cool the way girls are myself
yesssss
EXACTLY I AHHHHHHH
While I do like dressing masculine most of the time, this is definitely a mood. This is one of the two big reasons I decided to start T. 

I'd probably dress 50-50 feminine and masculine if I looked more masculine body-wise.
Yup, absolutely the same here
See I have this but the opposite way, I want to be feminine, but in the way a threat is feminine
Ive felt this exact way so many times and then i realized its not that i want to be pretty in the way a boy is pretty its i want to be respected like a boy while looking pretty but also in general i just hate being seen as a girl so like femmeboy over s girl anyday but in realitity nothing but pretty
Yessss I’ll join here and say the same as all my other siblings. I just wish I looked more feminine in boys clothing. I wish I didn’t have to do so much to achieve a feminine look. It’s so hard trying to figure out what clothes will look good. I really think that one of these days I may have to start some minor hrt. But then again I have the fluidity in me and I’m all over the place. It makes me feel crazy at times. I even wonder sometimes if it is fluidity or if it’s just me conforming or being too busy to express myself in the way that I truly feel. It’s tough. Any body just wanna tradesies?🥹😭
this is so fucking real dude i struggle with it every day
that is just exactly who i feel 🥲🥲
Yes! Total femboy here. I struggle a lot as someone who is AFAB to truly embrace my feminine side due to dysphoria. I feel more like a “feminine man” than anything. I’m hoping that after my top surgery I’ll be able to explore this side of myself more freely!
I wish I waspercieced as a girl dressing masculine. I want to start estrogen really bad and get láser. I still love feminine Clothing and stuff too but yeah I have the other way lol.
I super adore how cute those who are proclaimed male upon birth look when they wear clothes designed for people who are proclaimed female upon birth.  


Meanwhile me: figure like a short 1980's Barbie and literally have to play dress up on my body every day.  
Also me: chest too big to fit men's shirts unless my waist is drowning in fabric.  
Also also me: paid 1500 for ""custom"" suits & shirts from Indochino only for them to f\* it up every time and eventually tell me that they did their job and won't be fixing the lack of fit.

&#x200B;

\*\*pro tip: don't be like me. Indochino will straight up lie to your face to get you to purchase from them. Zero refund policy, do not provide copy of terms for fit guarantee, and will stop helping you if ever you drop a hell or fuck in their presence. Just get a tailor. Today's TED talk brought to you by: me. I paid for this shit. x.x

&#x200B;

okay /endrant lol
Boys who do that generally get a lot of shit for it
I prefer to be pretty the way I am pretty however that is.

Why copy others?
I like looking pretty without a gender presentation. Like ""whoa! he... wait no, she... wait no, whatevs that is it's Hot""
This but the opposite i wanna be masc in a girl way 😭 like i wanna be a tomboy or masc like a girl would be
[r/ftmfemininity](http://reddit.com/r/ftmfemininity)
First time I came to this thread there was a little bit if ""Same""  
And a couple of unhelpful comments. 
But now there is so much solidarity. I loves it!
I get basically the exact opposite. I’m happy being nonbinary but wish I was AFAB so more masc or androgynous outfits would look cute AF!
SAME
""Why can't I be handsome in a feminine way, pretty in a masculine way, and just attractive in an androgynous way all at once"" me literally 2 days ago
I want to be a goth femboy twink. No idea why but that’s what this heart desires only problem being I already look so much like my dad that T would make me his clone and I don’t want that. Like at all.
I feel this in my bones 😭 As an afab enby, who still does their makeup semi-regularly, I see just a pretty boy in the mirror and dont know how no one else sees it. I have been “sir”ed before, but never with makeup on 😞
I resonate with a lot of this. I kinda wanna be read as a femboy or really pretty boy
That but opposite for me lol I like to say my gender is amazonian woman, without necessarily being a woman
If you’d like to look masc but still wear feminine clothes, then i suggest looking into the many tutorials for how to use makeup to look more like a boy or man (depending on age) and wear skirts then!
I wish I had curves
very well said, thank you for putting into words how i feel lol 🙂/gen
same, my mom always tells me i dress like a lesbian and it frustrates me to no end😮‍💨
Thiiiis it feels like my AMAB non-binary friends slap on a colourful skirt and some eyeshadow and get read as androgynous and I’m out here in a full tuxedo with a binder and a fade and people are still like, “excuse me ma’am.” 😭😭
Exactly, when I came out as enby my mom told me that she thought I would come out as a lesbian eventually.
That's so interesting, as an nb amab, I always thought that fem features could pull off androgyny better. I've always felt the exact same frustration you have, just reversed. That really goes to show how powerful perception can be.
I would trade you bodies in a heartbeat. I want those masculine proportions, I want the grace of a man in his element, I want a cape. Idk. I wish I was amab.
📠📠📠 bigggggg 📠📠📠
for real. i think a lot of people, even cis people, would be happier if we got rid of gendered clothing. why does a piece of cloth have to determine how we're viewed🥲
exactly how i feel. like people shouldn't expect me to be this or that just because i look a certain way. who i choose to be should matter more than something i didn't get any day in.
damn, fr bet💀 and yess the imposter is too real💀
i feel you there, i can see how that can be difficult. if it's safe for you to do so maybe talk it over with him, you may be surprised. either way i hope you do what's best for you🖤
I feel this. I often think the same thing about estrogen and hesitate big time due to the fact I don’t want to make life any more difficult for my wife or son. She’s very accepting and encouraging when it comes to me dressing up and my gender identity, but she’s loves that I’m fluid. Being fluid is tiring at times. So many times I don’t express myself with how I’m feeling because I either am conforming for the public, too tired to put in the work to feel cute, or just so busy I don’t even have the time. It would be so much easier if I was blessed with an even more naturally androgynous appearance. Also facial hair is a big pain in the butt. I used to be so self conscious when I was young and confused and didn’t understand who I was. I wished I could just grow facial hair better. Then I became a father in 2018 and I could finally somewhat grow a beard and I did. It made me feel like a dad. Like the man I needed to be. Then I broke over a year ago, but I was afraid to look weird to others without it. I got the courage to shave and I got tons of laughs. Now I look at photos of me with it and I cringe lol. The beard is not me and I only did it out of what I thought others wanted of me. Now it grows in even thicker and I just wish I could shave and have it last at least a freakin week instead of a day🥲The longest I like to go is about a week. If I’m super busy and exhausted I’ll go two and start to really hate it. 

Who knows, maybe we should really think this trough more and communicate these feelings to our partners. I know if my wife (nonbinary but more so leaning towards she) told me she wanted to do hrt I would be right by her side. I guess it also helps that we are both bisexual/pansexual (whichever people like to use nowadays😭).
ok SAME, that is exactly how i feel!
ok for real, im over here like 'how to do eyeliner like a boy' i can't cope with doing femme things and looking femme unless it's interpreted as a boy doing femme things.
yea i feel you there. ive been wanting to like microdose T for like so long now but im terrified of it making me look manly🥲 like give me the deep voice but not the facial hair plss
that's true, i do have plans for several gender affirming procedures later, tho in the meantime it's difficult to both explain to my partner and difficult existing in a curvy body :/
On one of my worst gender dysphoria days I was sobbing because I am AFAB. And the horrible thing at the center of it all was knowing if I had been AMAB I would be crying in the exact same way. 

I completely understand where you are coming from.
Yes yes yes
yea, tho im not worried about getting shit for it or not. i just want to look how i want to look lol
How is pointing this out helpful? 
This is comparable to telling trans women how awful cis women find their menstrual cycle. 
Or telling Trans Women how uncomfortable breasts are. 
Or telling trans men the discomfort of more body hair. 

I assure you that the OP and anyone else who feels this way already knows the difficulty that comes with this kind of presentation. And that should tell you how strong the desire is. Because it does not dissuade us from feeling that way.
Thats. Fully not the point.
This is about how one wishes their body appeared and was perceived. Not copying.
you're not necessarily wrong, but i am uncomfortable in my own body and how it looks. if you were a man that developed breasts you would likely feel uncomfortable and embarrassed and want to get rid of it. it kinda feels the same way as me for certain features of my body
I've tried I'm absolutely terrible at it , my round ass face doesn't help lol
I'll trade you, lol!
Right I just want a curvy figure
You are most welcome. And you are not alone.
BIG OOF. I'm sorry lol. It is kinda funny how people will make weird generalizations like that.
Yeah!! And obviously it's a HUUUGE double edged sword -- my AMAB enby partner gets HARASSED constantly by random assholes and I don't think it's ever happened to me when I haven't been with it -- but like. I am super envious of actually being able to get read as not cis, especially being pre-medical-transition.
???????? strange thing to say but ok! 

&#x200B;

sheesh...
That's fair, but I think mostly when I say ""pull off androgynous looks"" I mean ""actually get recognized as not being cis,"" which for worse or for better, seems to be well-documented as being easier for AMAB people due to how rigid social perceptions of masculinity are (I did also try to address the issue of being hyper-visible in a different response).
If this were possible I'd be down to do this today 😭 you are more than welcome to whatever maleness I have going on. Please take it away!
Oof I hear you, when you’re aesthetic ideals are incompatible with your body it can be painful.
Ya but what's boy pretty? Like Tom Holland or Matt Damon, like Sugar and Spice off TikTok and RPDG?

I know plenty of masc looking girls isn't that boy pretty as well.

I meant more as copy of a perceived type ""femme boy"" rather then creating their own.

I didn't mean they wanted to look like someone specific
Okay so that's different it's not that you necessarily want a full over haul you would just like to tweak some things you're not happy with.

Like the way I choose to buzz cut my hair rather than have it long because length equals femininity in my eyes which I want to distance myself from.

Am I on the right track?
I’m sorry! Idk anything about makeup, mostly just that it exists. My gender is complicated, but for the most part, I’m trans masc and non-binary. I’m afab, so my face is super feminine. It doesn’t help that my extended family keeps buying me fem clothes
Wouldn't it be so cool if enbies/trans people could just exchange their desired body features with each other
<3 hopefully we pass each other on the seas of gender like ships in the night, same trip, different directions. I wish you fair weather and full sails.
Every one has a different definition of boy pretty. 
David Bowie 
Prince 
Boy George 
Sam Smith 

You seem to be seeking a debate. 
And I am asking you to show empathy instead.
yea that seems pretty spot on. i have always had a curvy figure, especially carrying a lot of weight in my hips and thighs. having that reduced would make me look more androgynous i think, as well as a breast reduction and a slightly deeper voice. 

but as far as tweaking things i view it exactly as that. i personally don't feel like my body is attached to my gender per se, it's just that the body i want tends to be more common in people born male than female, ive seen women who look that same way as well. i hope that makes sense
Nah its pretty good advice for some folk , 

maybe try telling them to buy something baggy will help ? It's harder to get feminine stuff to be baggy plus it's easier to its comfier then outing yourself if you aren't ready
This is all we want. I bet every single one of us can spend hours in a video game character creator😭
Same to you my gender-fluid sibling. May you never get lost and reach your destination safely ❤️
Makes total sense.  I'm a curvy AFAB  as well.  Working out helped a bit, also using shape wear to pull things in.  Unfortunately hips are a bitch because of bone, but there are clothing and layering techniques that ""mask/hide"" the feminine curves so if not masc definitely can pull andro.  YouTube is my friend for that one.

Aaa thank you! That's exactly how I want people to perceive me: I want them to see me and go ""ah yes, the main character"".

I've been binge-watching Yu-Gi-Oh recently, so maybe that's where that vibe is coming from lol
Amazon, my friend. You don't even have to order off there, but it's great for finding stuff.

Recently realized I’m not just Trans Fem but Trans Fem Nonbinary— Im living that Alien in Housewife Clothing life 👽💁‍♀️		"Honestly this is such a mood and of course you look amazing. ❤
Do you also have the boatload of insecurity where you constantly think you’re about to be called out for saying “I’m a trans woman” or “I’m non-binary” because you’re not fullllllllllly that thing?? Because I sure have that and it makes me want to go home. Lookin gr9 tho.
You are absolutely fucking gorgeous 😍
Yay moar trans fem enbys like meeee! You look sooo good!
Doesn’t trans feminine fall under the non binary category."	cxma9u	NonBinary	475	0.99	2019-08-30 20:16:20

I'm confused about myself, I don't feel a girl but sometimes I like girly clothes. not always tho.. I want to know if I'm valid?		"Everyone is valid. Including you. I feel different every day. And I dress to match how I feel. Some days it's a dress. Others it's basketball shorts and a huge t shirt. Just be you and wear what feels good for the day.
You're valid! I'm nb transmasc and don't feel girl or boy and I still wear things that could be considered girly! I also wear things the at could be considered masculine but I feel like clothing doesn't have a gender. If the clothes you pick out are how you feel comfortable, who cares what gendered section they came from?! 🖤
If anyone is reading this the answer to ""am I valid?"" is always yes. 

Unless you're a racist or homophobe or transphobe or bigot, etc. Those things are not valid but rather seek to invalidate the existence of others.
Clothes have styles, not genders :)
You are valid. Clothes are not gender. Yes, we're told that the pretty pink frilly skirt is for girl. But that is society pushing binary labels onto clothing. In and of itself a blouse, or shirt or pair of trousers has no gender, it is just a piece of clothing. Wear what makes you feel good. Wear what makes you feel you.  You are valid no matter what you wear.
gender and presentation are not at all the same! you could be the most feminine person ever and it wouldnt make you a girl. gender is how you feel, not how you dress! <3
as also being a confused non-binary. you are very valid. i wish you a good day and good luck!
In todays society clothes are seen to have a gender when in reality clothes don’t have genders. If you like it then wear it
you're 100% valid. Clothes don't dictate gender, just wear whatever *you* love and whatever makes you happy and fuck anybody who says you're not valid
Of course you are valid.  I'm NB and like to dress masc the majority of the time but now and then I like to put on feminine cloths.  Gender is not binary, you don't have to be a girl or a boy, do what makes you happy :)
i’ve looked fem my whole life and i’m okay with it: nonbinary doesn’t have to look or act a certain way. if you consider yourself nonbinary and that makes you comfortable then you are
This was actually a huge issue for me, growing up having gendered biases put on me. I never actively believed them, but unknowingly it stuck with me and really delayed my transition. But now I take testosterone and identify as a masc leaning non binary person, but I also have a pair of pink uggs with bows for a winter boot. You like what you like, and for that you are valid.
Feeling girly sometimes does not make you any less valid.
Always 💖
Your experience is completely normal and you are valid. I present pretty androgynous leaning masc, but I love to wear really loud makeup and sometimes a dress with AF1s feels right. Define gender and how you express it in whatever way feels right.
Ofc! I’m very fem myself and I’m still Enby😌😊
Ah ofc your valid!! I struggled with my identity for a long time and decided for me that it’s not worth stressing over, I’m non binary and I wear whatever I want no matter if it’s fem or masc 

Also u look really cool❤️
Clothes arent inherently gendered. Im nb transmasc too, and I LOVE everything pink and cute. But I am not a girl at all. (Maybe check out r/ftmfemininity if you want to see other people who express themselves femininely, without being girls. I sometimes dont feel valid because I like feminine stuff, and then it helps to go on that sub and see that Im not alone.)
Why would wearing a specific piece of clothes make your identity not valid? Gendered clothes is fake, heels and makeup used to be super manly. It's just clothes. Plus gender can be fluid sometimes, that could be why it changes or it could just be mood.
Hell yeah you are. ❤💪
hey I love femme things! doesn't make me any less transmasc, it doesn't for you either 🏳️‍⚧️💞
I feel the same, and my label of choices is girlflux, so maybe check that out, hope this helps! <3
You're valid as FUCK bro
Might be non-binary or anything else. Do what makes you feel right and don’t do all the other things 🏳️‍⚧️👻😋😉
Your valid no matter what and it can take time to figure out a label and even if you never find one that fits your still you 💖
If you feel valid, then you are.
Of course your valid i mean you are a human. Last time ive checked thats all you need to be valid.
I know it can be difficult but just remember that you are valid because you're you
I mean my AMAB ass still wears ""male"" clothes all the time (mainly cause i dont have a skirt yet). The clothes you wear determines your gender as much as the stuff in your pants, they dont but you in your brain define yourself
YESS YOU ARE VALID. Gender identification doesn’t make you any less of a person. How you feel is how you feel and you have the right to feel that way. If anyone tells your anything different please ignore them. Some people aren’t educated enough to fully understand that sex and identification are 2 different things. If you don’t want to have a gender FUCK IT you don’t have too. It’s what ever makes you feel happy is what the right answer is for yourself ❤️
I can't edit my post but I just want to say that I appreciate all the love and you all make me feel so good. I might not be ready to come out to my family but it's amazing to have a supporting group, I love you all 🤍🤍🤍
Absolutely! Expression can have a complicated connection to identity, or no connection to it at all! I often dress feminine when i feel most masculine and vice versa. Dress however u like, doesnt make you any less valid
Yeeessss!!!! I would describe myself as an afab femboy. Pretty much the same problem... If I want to dress up, I go for girly. If I'm just at uni, I go for masc.
Of course u are! I also don't feel like a girl and mostly i dress in ""girl"" clothes because I think they're cooler! U can be whoever u want to be and don't let anyone tell u otherwise!
You are valid✨Don’t let anyone tell you shit
you're so valid! i am exactly the same! i tend to dress more feminine most of the time but i don't feel like a girl all the time!
As an afab nonbinary person myself, you are absolutely 100% valid. It's perfectly acceptable to like things that are traditionally liked by your assigned gender at birth, likeing things and styles don't determine your gender, it's how you feel about your gender that's important. Personally, I also like girly things and dressing feminine, but I also really enjoy appearing more masc, as well as androgynous. I like to identify as nonbinary because it's my way of saying ""I do whatever I want with my gender no one can stop me."" And honestly I think it's the best way to look at it. Gender doesn't need to have limits, and you're absolutely valid no matter how you present or what you like.
I'm Amab and I don't feel like a girl but I like girly clothes
Your validity goes without saying. It is the baseline from which all other facts are relevant.
You don't feel like a girl but sometimes like girly clothes... That's totally valid! gender identity and expression are two different things! 💜 it's not really about what you like but who you are :)
Hella valid!!!
I like lolita fashion and wonder this a lot of times myself ///
You are hella valid my fren!
Yep! Clothes have no gender
Of course you’re valid! You’re who you are, only you can decide what your true self is. You decide your options, your feelings and your looks. Nobody should tell you otherwise, and if they do then they don’t deserve you. It’s okay to experiment and figure out your gender, not all genders are binary. I’m identify as enby (AFAB) and gay. I am me and I will forever be me. You can also be yourself, experiment, have fun and enjoy your life.
 Edit: I like your hair :)
You are valid! I am nb but I accept my femininity more often since that what I am used to. its a spectrum. Being nonbinary does not mean that you owe everyone androgyny
Yes, Of course! Just to let you remember Non-Binary is an umbrella term for anything that isn’t binary like cis!female or cis!male (I think that also  means transgender, gender-fluid, queer, bigender agender etc..). And clothes don’t have gender 😉
Of course you are valid! ♡
Yes you are. I feel exactly the same way
thats valid as hell!! you can like feminine clothes without being female. and you can like masculine clothes without being male. what matters is that your comfortable in your own body and doing your best to make sure your comfortable
Of course you’re valid. No matter what clothes you wear, how you chose to identify, you are valid and it’s okay to feel confused
Yes you are 110% valid!!
I go through hyper feminine episodes to! I thought it made me gender fluid but I still stick with non-binary because I think that fits me better! You are always valid!

Yes that's true, I just got a shirt from the 'boy section' and I just love it! Thanks 🤍
Thanks that is really sweet 🥺
I think so too, but a lot of people in my life don't...
Thanks! You too
I know we never met but I think I might love you 💗 for real, thanks
Thank youu ❤️
Yes I think so too, but the people in my life don't believe non-binary is real.. so I don't really know what is allowed? I don't know if I make sense..
Yes they are just so pretty sometimes
Thanks!

Why?
is it the stripy blue one? you look great in it!
And to that i say frick gender norms. Being normal is boring as hecc anyways
Psst you may wanna check out r/ftmfemininity!! They take all transmascs, not just trans men, despite the name.
Tell them to fuck off because you look amazing no matter what you wear or how you present yourself.
Yeah I get it. I'm from a small town in Texas. I didnt know what the word trans meant until I was almost in highschool. But yeah gender fluid is a thing that is valid (not saying for sure thats what it is). Gender is weird. There aren't really rules for it once you ignore society's bullshit gender norms. Not sure if it's what you're looking for but maybe try r/ftmfemininity. There are a lot of nb and trans masc people there too, not just binary guys. It's just for afab people that aren't women but don't fully reject femininity

This brings me so much joy ❤️
Hello!!! I’m only from pompy! Got my little tie dye shop, was thinking About doing “flags hoodies” would you be interested in some super colourful stuff ??
I love it so much. I don’t understand why this can’t be the norm. It would be a win-win situation and it would make a lot of people so much happier.

you look so good !
Nice shirt, crop tops are awesome
Great fit - the design on that crop top is fekkin cute
That's awesome! I'm still working up the courage to wear crop tops, but that's mostly cos I'm shy about showing off my stomach-- no real reason, just irrational insecurities. Good for you!
And you look ridiculously handsome and good looking into them.

I always have a difficult time deciding what to buy when I'm shopping for cute clothes.		"Those knee highs are amazingggg!  Keep doing you, and rocking it ❤️
For all the people commenting on the shorts, in the 70's 80's and 90's you'd see people of all genders wearing very tight, very short shorts.  Just google 70's basketball shorts of you don't believe me. It's just a clothing style, not connected to sexuality or gender.
Judging by the spiffy outfit you're wearing, you're not doing a bad job deciding.
going through the comments on here is just...man. I expected better from the nb sub of all places, existing as an amab nb person and wearing what you want isn't inherently sexual
Is that Target? I recognize the carpet, set up, and the sign on the top of the clothes wall.
Forget about new clothes, where can I buy these shorts!
Me too😢
Love the shorts and socks
cute

[deleted]
You look awesome!  Honestly when looking at the outfit, and your hair, you look a lot like sailor Uranus from sailor moon lol
wow, so gorgeous with what  and how you are wearing
Yes, I love shopping at Target because staff are friendly, and I always feel safe there. They also have some of the best selection of clothes IMHO :)
I’~~m not exactly sure what this is all about as I’m not really involved, but in the post you’re linking they explicitly say they are not cis, so wouldn’t that mean they’re trans?~~

~~https://i.imgur.com/M3vLKkg_d.webp?maxwidth=640&shape=thumb&fidelity=medium~~

Edit: oh I found where they said it. It kind of seems like semantics on their part, I can see why it may tilt you a bit since isn’t non-binary supposed to include all gender nonconforming identities and agender?

For those curious what the poster above me is referring to in specific in that post: https://i.imgur.com/afAAsYT_d.webp?maxwidth=640&shape=thumb&fidelity=medium
There is nothing sexual about what I am wearing. And if you think my dressing authentically to express my gender and sharing that here is a fetish then you need to step back with your misogyny.
I just did a reverse image search on Bing, Google, and TinEye. They all returned 0 matches.

So you are obviously trolling at this point just trying to stir people up. Given that this is the first time I've even posted this photo online, the idea of it already getting cross-posted to Twitter and a search engine also crawling it in barely 10 hours is what's known as ""fake news"".
Let people exist. ""It's already on TERF Twitter so I was right"" bish It's *TERFS,* they're going to hate on trans people no matter what. We shouldn't have to change ourselves just so people who already hate us hate us slightly less. Fuck the hell outta here with that ""it hurts our community."" Someone existing as themselves does not hurt the community. On the contrast, people like you who try to be the pick-me/""model minority"" bs, hurt the community tremendously.
Terfs will find anything to post about even trans women just being out in public.

Heck there was a time that gay men told me I shouldn't be openly bisexual because I'm harming the community and will give a bad image to gay men.
How does the boot taste?
Nice! There's one around where I live and my mom used to work there. You look around maybe 5'7-6ft? I don't know why but in that picture you seem like you would look nice in red, but that's coming from a person who would (if given the choice) wear pajamas everyday.
>Edit: oh I found where they said it. It kind of seems like semantics on their part, I can see why it may tilt you a bit since isn’t non-binary supposed to include all gender nonconforming identities and agender?

From the [Agender Wiki](https://gender.fandom.com/wiki/Agender):

""Many agender people also identify as genderqueer, non-binary and/or transgender. However, some agender people prefer to avoid these terms, especially transgender, as they feel this implies identifying as a gender other than their assigned gender, while they in fact do not identify as any gender at all.""
Aren't you the one posting yourself in skin-tight leggings with your genitals clearly visible? That's a bit sexual, isn't it?
[removed]
I'm trying to imagine people coming into this post thinking ""That's an interesting outfit, I wonder what the comments say"", and their eyes falling out of their sockets with all the controversy xD
I feel you on wanting to wear PJs every day. I'm all about being super casual and comfy. I put the bare minimum into outfits. T-shirt, shorts, and flip flops? Yep works for me. Never been one to be super fancy, tbh unless like I'm going to some kind of formal gathering. I do want to get some more stuff in red, tho.
FACT: Agender people can still be part of the nonbinary community

Here's the thing, just because I don't refer to myself as nonbinary or trans doesn't mean I'm not still under the nonbinary umbrella because I'm AGENDER.  
  
**That's no different than a pansexual person saying they are not bisexual and not gay. They can still participate in the bisexual community because pansexuality is under the bisexual umbrella.**

I mean there are plenty of nonbinary people that don't call themselves trans, and some that insist they are NOT trans, yet they are still welcome to be part of the trans community, if that's what they want.  
  
Edit: It should also be noted that what terms people prefer to use FOR THEMSELVES, don't always signify with WHAT COMMUNITY they are part of. Heck there are literally trans girls posting in the r/femboy subreddit. Even though they might not identify as a ""boy"" they can still be part of the femboy community.
>\> Aren't you the one posting yourself in skin-tight leggings with your genitals clearly visible? That's a bit sexual, isn't it?

Where did I post that in this sub? Last I checked I don't see that I posted any sexual things on this sub?
Oh and also forcibly interrogating anyone about whether they are AFAB or AMAB on a nonbinary sub of all places is terribly enbyphobic and transphobic.
So people on this sub are never allowed to post in NSFW subs?

There are plenty of users on this sub that post in NSFW gay porn subs all the time. I know because I follow them. And nobody is complaining how they post in NSFW gay porn subs.

What is your problem with identity policing? Are you that anti-queer?
Kinda was to be expected tbh, sadly. There's a lot of internalised LGBT phobia in the community. Like essentially it is ok to be LGBT but not look or behave LGBT.

Good points, and that's partly why I kept this post up anyway, because even if I might get some hate, I really want to inspire people to stay confident and true to themselves and not to be shamed in the face of adversity.
That's not a sexual post in even the slightest. I can easily scroll through my Facebook feed and see posts of gay men out in public wearing skintight jeans or shorts that are far more revealing than anything in that photo.
Btw, thanks for reminding me about that post because I just noticed there were some nice comments I forgot to reply to. :3
I'm not ""cis"". I've written about that plenty of times. I'm agender. I DON'T HAVE A GENDER.

STOP CALLING ME CIS you closeted transphobe.
I can see your glans. Perhaps you don't think it's sexual but others could be forgiven for thinking it is. And given that exhibitionism appears to be your bag, I don't think I'm being unreasonable when I say your opinion is a bit biased.
[deleted]
Anything could be regarded as sexual depending on a person's hangups with the human body. Plenty of men see a woman in a bikini at the beach or just uniform short shorts playing volleyball as extremely ""sexual"".

 If you don't like it, then reddit provides a convenient blocking functionality, which might be in your best interest since it seems you already know that you find my content disagreeable.
If you think it’s sexual, that’s on you. That’s a you problem.
PS. Thank you for helping to set the record straight and coming to my defense. It means a lot :3
You can literally see their glans ffs. It's beyond inappropriate.

\^ Exactly, this is what women have been always saying.

I am utterly blown away how this post could start so much controversy. When I uploaded this, I literally thought nothing of it. It's not even one of my better photos, and I'd planned to keep it up for a few hours, not get any comments, then delete it. It wasn't a big deal at all, no harm or foul intended. But somehow it really struck a nerve with a few people here

Sigh.
[deleted]
I'm not talking about swimsuits at a beach. Take Twitch for example, which is an all ages ""gaming"" site with scantily clad women flaunting their assets in order to rack up views and bitties.

[https://i.imgur.com/SAZ52sc.png](https://i.imgur.com/dUeN6IA.png)

They put a blow up pool in their living room while exposing their body in highly provocative poses to appeal to straight men's desires while wearing nothing but tiny risque thong swimsuits on a site with little kids and no content filters.

Believe me I'm five steps ahead of you.
You did nothing wrong. People are just dicks sometimes and can’t handle someone else living their best life because they can’t for some reason or another so they lash out.  You do you, boo, and keep walking past all the haters. No one can tell you who or what you are except you, and remember it’s none of your business what other people think of you anyway. Keep being you!
Wear something that doesn't become see through around their dick and balls? Like this is basic respect of other people. 

Breasts are not remotely equivalent to a penis and genuinely fuck you for comparing them, that's MRA garbage.
Btw, I almost forgot this example, to showcase how there are also instances of cisgender women dressing in ways that are *interpreted* as sexual, even when that isn't their intent.

[https://www.insidehighered.com/news/2019/04/01/letter-criticizing-notre-dame-women-wearing-leggings-prompts-campus-debate](https://www.insidehighered.com/news/2019/04/01/letter-criticizing-notre-dame-women-wearing-leggings-prompts-campus-debate)

Take the controversy a few years ago at Notre Dame University. A mother became disturbed because so many college girls at mass wearing skintight leggings that showed every curve of their body, including their ""nether regions"" (as she called it).

The mother was so disturbed that she even wrote a Letter to the Editor to the school newspaper, begging for the college girls to stop wearing leggings, because she didn't want her sons seeing women in such provocative clothing at mass.

Guess what happened? The girls decided to come to school the next day and stage a protest proudly flaunting their leggings to show the mother how they are not going to appease her insecurities about the curves of women's bodies.

To think if those college girls had listened to your advice, they would come to believe a) women should only dress in a way that people expect them to dress, b) women should never dress in a way that shows their ""nether regions"", and c) women should never dress in a way that is judged as ""too sexual"" by onlookers.

Imagine how much of a setback that would have been for women's liberation.
And they do so for sexual purposes. That's the attention they want. How are you not understanding this? I might as well get banging my head against the wall. Enjoy your evening.
[deleted]
I'm understanding perfectly well. You think people are supposed to dress how is ""expected"" in every social situation. Yet as my Twitch example above proved, that isn't how it works at all. On a regular basis cisgender women find ways to push gender norms, sometimes to their extreme, whereas AMAB folks (whether cis, trans, or otherwise), are continually policed to ensure they stick within their rigid box of gender norms and expectations, never to push social norms because people might be too sensitive to handle it.

Here's the the thing, even gay men kissing in a public park isn't expected and some conservative folks might become deeply offended at such a public display of male homosexuality and would argue what they are doing is ""sexual"". That doesn't mean those gay men can't or shouldn't kiss in a public park.

Not everything conforms to your specific set of gender norms.
In conclusion, I get far more compliments, particularly from women and mothers, when I dress exactly like the outfit that you link above of me wearing in that grocery store.

So whatever expert three steps ahead ""theory"" you think you've devised to attempt to dissuade me from dressing how I want, isn't going to work. If I get treated NICER and cishet people actually go out of their way to show favouritism and appreciation for what I'm wearing -- while here you are trying to deter me from dressing that way -- yeah sorry, the ball is not in your court on that one.
The fact that person was claiming what I was wearing was ""see through"" shows how intellectually dishonest they are. Even more ironic is how this person is preaching about basic respect, but doesn't adhere to that principle themselves."	uxvob7	NonBinary	408	0.95	2022-05-26 00:53:50
All names are non-binary. All appearances are non-binary. Non-binary is not synonymous with gender-neutral or androgynous.	"TL;DR: This is exclusionary and invalidating, please stop.

Recently I've been seeing more posts where people talk about having a ""non-binary name"", ""looking non-binary"", or ""wanting non-binary clothes"".

These things don't exist.

I am non-binary and therefore my name is a non-binary name. I am non-binary and therefore I look non-binary.

Non-binary is not another way to say ""gender-neutral"" or ""androgynous"". Using non-binary when you actually mean gender-neutral or androgynous is exclusionary and invalidating. It sends the message that those of us who do not have gender-neutral names or who do not look androgynous that we are not really non-binary and are not valid.

Please be conscientious of your word choices and avoid using non-binary when you actually mean something else."	"Heh, I just posted a selfie to this sub half out of wanting to help reaffirm people who aren’t androgynous-looking and don’t want to be, and then I came across this post. Yay!
Pardon Me, But 111-101-10000-10010-111-101 Is *Not* A Non-Binary Name.
I appreciate this. Like I don’t ‘want’ to look ‘non-binary’ I want to look what makes me feel comfortable and non-binary is just a word that best fits my gender. I think pursuing looking non-binary is putting us in the same icky pressure that binary people feel to conform to a really specific idea in order to feel like they are ‘doing their gender right’. Non-binary is a big roomy box, it’s why I use it as my only label most often and it has given me a lot of acceptance about myself. I don’t want this to be a community that makes people fit themselves into small boxes. It hurts people. I think many people here get that though and that gives me a lot of hope.
this!!! i hate when nonbinary is treated as the Forbidden Third Gender for Gender Neutrals. it literally just means you’re off the gender binary. doesn’t have a look or a set of pronouns. it sucks that this is such a skewed idea when it’s right in the name T_T i see so many of my nonbinary friends get criticized for dressing feminine or masculine because “aren’t they nonbinary” and it makes me sad:( hopefully this truth begins to get recognized more among both the lgbt community and allies
i struggle so much with feeling valid. like i am not my socially assigned gender, but because i pass as it i feel like an imposter. this post helps a bit.
I look non-binary


I'm enby and valid, therefore I look non-binary
Thank you
Agreed. I sometimes catching myself saying it, but that is because my birth name is super male and I mean to say gender-ambiguous but I suck at wording .
i love this
Yes, finally someone is saying what needs to be said 🙌
thank you!! honestly i'm tired of seeing posts like those too. i'm definitely gonna start pointing it out when i see it said like that
I categorize non binary as a lack of judgement or pressure to conform, so when I see all this ""nb"" presentation stuff it is a real turn off. The whole point is to not care about conforming to a standard - to remove standards!
Take your damn upvote.
I don't think binary includes dashes so technically 🤔
I've debated with myself a lot about saying anything on individual posts. Online I always worry about how to word things so that it comes across as constructive rather than condescending. Especially since Reddit is an international community and a lot of people are speaking English as a second/third/fourth language. However, it also seems to have risen to the point of being a *major* problem with a decent number of people feeling alienated, so....
Thanks! ~~I Would Say ""I'll Give You One Too If You Can Read The Name I Wrote"", But Then I Realised I Already Gave You One.~~
I Mean The Dashes Aren't Numbers, Simply There To Separate Different Numbers, Same As A Space Would Do, I Just Figured Dashes Looked Better.
i think it's important to bring up. and like you said, it's become a big issue. it would probably be easier if the mods addressed it to keep the community more inclusive"	jgr6vc	NonBinary	404	0.99	2020-10-23 17:05:53
Just realized I was non-Binary, just in time for a new job, so I pulled some clothes I haven’t touched for a while out. How I look?		"You look like Janet but dapper.
You look amazing, I love it!! I just recently came out also and have never bought a suit before. My dad is getting remarried soon and I want to wear a suit for the first time. I'm a bit overwhelmed with where to start looking though
Look great!  Super dapper and perfect for summer!
a true stunner ;D

ooo I'm loving the suit! you look great!!
You look blinkin’ spectacular. Congrats on the new job.

You are absolutely stunning!! It is my dream to have a work outfit that looks this good on me, amazing.

Love the glitter!
Oh that necklace is lovely on you! Love it with the sleek black layer. You have style!
YOU LOOK SO AMAZING!!!!
You look gorgeous! Love the all the glitter
Work's paying out. : )

I hope u find one million more reasons to keep that smile. ♡

(Oh, also, before I forget...OP, U R LOOKING GREATTTTTTT!)
Wow, you look awesome!
i love your style! you look amazing!
Sooo pretty!!!
You look awesome! Btw, I've been thinking about shaving my head as well. I want to keep the beard, but the baldiness spreading through my skull has started to bother me a lot, and somehow, in my mind it feels like shaving it all would make it more feminine. What do you think?
Wow. The beard and the makeup goes so well together! :D
Wow! Sib. That red lip is absolutely perfect on you. The necklace really brings it together too. Solid work!
You look gorgeous! I love the shining of the dress and the necklace. Perfect match
Looks great! The outfit, makeup, and nail polish match up very nicely. Not a lot of people know how to do that.
Aw, thank you! I love the necklace too!
Oh thank you! I am sure you'll fine something. I just went to Primark and tried every dress I saw until something looked nice :)
Thanks 🥰
Thanks! I really appreciate :) This is my first dress, and I love it!
Awwwww, thanks!
Yesssss, glitter everywhere :) Thanks!
Oh that's so kind, thank you!
Thanks :)
Thank you soo much!
<3
Go for it, shave it. I started to shve the second I had bald spots, never felt better! :)
Aw thanks! I cannot shave without killing myself (very sensitive skin) so I kinda have to play around it :)
Oh god, thank you! So kind! :)
Yay, that was the idea! Thanks for noticing it :) I also have some silver glitter on my cheeks but not too visible!
OH thank you! I did not really know what I am doing, but I think it worked in this case! Thanksss!
I think I'm gonna try some different cuts first, maybe something similar to OneTopic. Depending on  the results, I'll shave it later. :D
Well, it really suits you! :D
It is visible, very subtle but adds a cute detail to the look! Love it
Then you’re a natural! 😁
Good idea! I hope it works out! I used to have hairs long to my ass, but had to cut them at some point :(

I did it, I finally purged my closet of all of the overly femme clothes that I've tried to force myself to wear over the years. I got sick of staring at a closet full of what, to me, are just costumes of a character I'm no longer interested in playing.		"Someone on this sub should organize a clothing swap. I bet it will be a riot!
You ought to be so proud of yourself! This is such a brilliant achievement for you.
I'm proud of you!
Oh my gosh I just decided to do that too. I am so proud of you!! Bravo!
Hi5
To the good will!
Yay! I did this a year or so ago, it was so freeing.
PREACH
I did the same thing a few years back. It was cathartic!! I gave away some to my friend & my mom, and everything else was donated.
*yoink*
neeeeeeeeeeed to do this
I like that; especially how you described them as stuff you tried to force yourself to wear.  It sounds like you recognized them for what they truly were: costumes.  Keep moving forward!  You can do it.
Seriously! Lately I’ve been thinking about all the beautiful clothes I’ve simply stopped wearing, and how wasteful it seems to donate to foundations that don’t *explicitly* support the communities I belong to. 

If anyone knows a sub or site for this, let me know!
Well, I'm giving them to my trans gf, who then will keep what she wants and give the rest to her transgirl friends, and we'll sell the clothes no one wants. I hope I give y'all some ideas 👀

Similarly names are just syllables we identify each other with.

I know they can be gender affirming but I feel like that almost plays into gender roles.

I went to school with a girl who had a stereotypically boys name and now I associate that name as gender neutral.

Imagine how much better it would be if all names were like that 💜"	mz43j7	NonBinary	378	1.0	2021-04-26 18:15:21

With the help of a friend, finally bought some clothes outside the men's section. A photo that was years in the making.		"Wait til you need some shorts, it's even worse. I bought all ""men's"" shorts this year and my god the POCKETS! They're huge! And there's four of them!
Hahaha, the horrendously small women's pockets
When I was in middle school we had uniforms and I couldn't even fit my hand in the pockets of the ones designated for girls. Thankfully they weren't strict about wearing a certain uniform for your gender as long as you were in uniform so I wore the guys pants.
Congrats! You have now upgraded to level:
who invented women's pocket???
I am glad the clothes make you happy even if the pockets aren't great
Hahaha reminds me of the time I bought my first menssection pants. They would not let me enter the changing rooms, so I had to carry that pair up a flight of stairs to the women's section where I was met with many weird looks.
It was also the first time I experienced pockets that my phone actually fits in :')
Ah yes, pockets. The bane of female clothes designers, I guess?
Hope you don’t miss the pockets.  Other than that, proud of you.  Here’s to many more shopping trips.
Achievement Unlocked: “Pockets”
Wish I could my only hope is online shopping, Amazon to be precisely since i use gift cards rather than a credit card.

Nice ^^ uwu
Haha welcome to pocket hell I hate it here. But as long as you like the pants you do you!!
good for you! I freely shop in the women's, men's and sometimes boys' (I'm small) sections. And let me tell you, the looks I get in the boys' section >.< even worse than shoe shopping in the children' aisle!
Yep I can fit my wallet keys and phone in both my front pockets and still have room left
I have a friend who could fit his whole Nintendo switch in his pocket. Granted, he was wearing sweatpants, but still.
I remember I had a pair that could pretty much fit an iPad.  Not very comfortable, though.
I had some jeans in highschool that could fit my ti84."	hdbf37	NonBinary	375	1.0	2020-06-21 18:05:15
This is your daily reminder that clothes don’t have a gender 🤍		"This outfit is so cute, I love it! You look fantastic in it too!! 😁💕
I’m coveting those boots. Hair color too 💜!
Omg please mercy - you're gorgeous!
Stunning.

That entire look is heckin' cute!
i have that same dress and i love it!!! you look stunning <3
off topic, but I love your rubik's Cube collection. I've got one just like the carbon fibre 3x3

First time wearing “men’s” dress clothes!! and yes, i wore vans to my job interviews		"If you want some more formal shoes in smaller sizes, check out tomboytoes! I love them. 
Rockin’ it! 
You look great!! I’m so jealous.
Looks great! Good luck with the interview. 
Also, fully-lined dress pants are the best thing. 
Stylish as fuck 🤩🤩🤩
You look amazing!!
You are so goals! 
You look fantastic! 😍
If you can, get shoes with leather soles. They make their own unique sound and are just fantastic. 
thanks! i got the job!!!
all great suggestions, however, i’m not in a place financially to buy shoes that i’ll wear twice a year haha
Omg!!!! Congratulations!!
One advantage to leather-sole shoes is that they're almost infinitely repairable. It's not uncommon for them to stay good for more than 30 years even with regular wear. 
okay fair, but I still don't have money to buy them lol"	ac0nnq	NonBinary	371	0.99	2019-01-03 02:07:45

Very cute! Nice and balanced ensemble, well put together!
This is such a cute outfit! Really brings out the curves!
fabulous!
You look amazing! The red stockings, the visible garters, and the mismatched fishnet... giving me major goth vibes <3
Well is what I aim for 😊
Thank you! I didn't use to like how I looked in fem clothes either. For the personally, re-learning posture, changes in grooming habits, improving skincare, and putting together outfits that work best for my body type went a long way. Wherever you are in the journey, you got this!

I run a clothing brand and am seeking feedback on this top. If if was in store or online or available in other colours would you consider purchasing?		"I feel like its very body type dependant. If one has beasts or a large belly then the lower cut to the midriff would not make this an ideal option.

I like the cold shoulder and neckline but would probably add a few inches of fabric to assist with any potential curves that someone might have (and want to hide - this shirt looks great for trying to reduce overall curvature tbh)
I definitely would if it didn't have the flared/waterfall (?) hem.
Nah- it isn’t my style. I would be worried it would emphasize my hips and I don’t like the hemline. Super cool that you run a clothing brand and that you are asking peoples opinion on this stuff! ❤️
Idk if I would personally but I like the look of it.
I would never be able to rock it like the person in the pic but heck yeah I would
Thanks for the various comments. As I said I run a clothing brand. I’ve not long started and I’m looking for a group of folks to join a focus group to discuss clothing going forward. I have some things already produced and sampled. I have some things already made but I want engagement from a collective of 12 -15 people on ideas. The best way to solve any clothing issues going forwards is to listen to what is needed. 😊😊 feel free to drop me an email if you’re interested to get involved marc@fashion5678.com
I absolutely love it and want it. Black, royal blue, grey, or heather would be my choice of colors BTW.
I don’t personally like shoulder cut outs, so no
Yes, one in every color
It's very cute, but I personally wouldn't wear it. Too fem for me.

If I did wear it though, I would want it in black. :)
If I wasn't as chonky as I am around the middle, sure.
I would love this in orange or teal if I had the body type to fit it.
Very cute but not particularly workable on rounder bodies; the lines all depend on a rather slim silhouette. So -I- wouldn't ever be able to wear one and have it look like something other than an ill-fitted mess, even if there was enough fabric to go around me. 

Black is an excellent color option; I would also recommend your standard ""Quartet of Jewel Tones"" - a rich purple, a nice dark green/teal (more forest than olive, if green), a deep blue (darker than royal, lighter and more intense than navy), and a dark ruby. Those four cover 99% of peoples' favorite colors and 100% of ""will this match my skin tone?""
No
I would!
Looks awesome. I would get black/dark grey in a xxxl ""mens"" size for a cyber streetwear look
I’d like that! 
Black or red would look cool
Maybe a dark teal

Maybe less flowiness on the bottom, add some darting into the waist too? I’d wear it as a long top or as a short crop top :)
Oh I love the cut and length!  I would definitely drop this into my shopping cart (especially if it comes in pink )
If this was a crop top, fuck yeah
If I were to buy something like this, it would have a straight hem and a circle neckline. But i really like the tight fit around the arms. Good luck!
The one thing I would recommend is trying it on with binders from a few different major companies (and preferably having people of different sizes and body types do the same) and see if the edges peek out around the neckline or the cut-outs of the shoulders. I would love to have some tank tops in my wardrobe but my binder ALWAYS shows a little because either the necklines aren't cut high enough or the shoulders aren't wide enough to cover them (and often both). It's an instant dealbreaker for a piece of clothing for me, so if this top does that, I would have to pass it up.
This looks very unique! I think a lot of people will like it.
I like the look of it, but a someone with some belly on me, I'm not sure that it would look good on me.
Less flowy, but long, yes
Add a light turtleneck
I would it looks nice
Yes
Oooh I love it! Especially love the exposed shoulders
Yes! This def appeals to the eye! Please lmk if you do sell it, I'll def buy one <3
1000% i love the shoulder cut outs and the a-line style that the shirt falls in is very flattering. since i don’t want my hips to be emphasized though, a style that is not flared at the bottom would be great too!!
Purple!
Absolutely love the shoulder less design with the v neck not something you see often and far as colour goes the black looks amazing the waste is super cute and the fit in general is just wonderful but yeah definitely would be interested in buying some 😍
Pink ,a reddish , purple,  grey .I have one similar an love it ..but I love yours more . I'm definitely in for this
Absolutely. I rarely see shirts like that thay can cover my binder, but this one looks like it would
I think it's cool but not really my style
I like the top half, but not so much the style of the hem. Maybe with the lower part centered towards the front?
Most of the shoulder stuff has a very love neck line, I quite like this one. I have a really long torso so I probably wouldn't get this shirt unless it was longer.
I say make one of the sleeves longer and add a bit more v to the V-neck
I'm not a fan of ""cold shoulder"" shirts myself, so I would not personally buy it based on that. It's a lovely shirt, my preference aside. 

Aesthetically, I think the hem should be different. Idk if these are industry terms or not, but maybe try it with a hanky hem (pointed and lower in the middle, higher on the sides)  or like a tunic hem (where it's square with slits at the hips) (*edit*) or offer it in a couple different hems.

I do like the shallow V neck and length of the sleeves. It really seems like the fabric doesn't roll or bunch too much. Overall I do like it and think it will sell, it's simply not my personal style.
i wouldnt but mostly because i dont like my shoulders
I would buy it right now in black! Other colors would only be more awesome.
I would absolutely wear this. Personally I'm flat chested and pretty muscular but I love black clothes that lean femme, and I'm very into the turtleneck and the waterfall hem.

I see why some other people wouldn't be into the hem flare but personally I love it. Maybe releasing a few different variations would help with that?

Also please link your shop!!! If the sub doesn't allow it please DM me because I need new clothes badly and I love this style. Especially if you sell pants of varying sizes/of stretchy material (I have abdominal inflammation and I'm dying for new pants and new clothes generally).
Dark olive green would be nice, the waterfall hem gives it a Ren faire vibe for me
I would want it in a bright color like yellow/gold, maybe orange, a nice blue.  But i like oversized clothes.  I wonder if ther would be any xx-xxx available
I would definitely buy that top, just as it is. Love it.
Would definitely get this :) 

I think it looks good in the black but a dark red might look really nice too
I like it, though I’d prefer if it was a bit longer or a different hem. As for colors, grey or heathered are my go-to’s as a cat owner
It's interesting, I like the cut of the neck and shoulders. But I don't like flouncy shirts. Like them straight or fitted.

(Okay I like big baggy things, but I like the look of fitted stuff)
I would absolutely wear this, though I think the neckline would look better with a slightly deeper V.
It’d be quite pleasant in mauve.
I agree about wanting the hem to be straight. I would also want a lower cut v-neck. I would totally buy this :)
no but only bc I hate anything without long sleeves, u look great tho
YES
It’d really depend on color for me (I do like the black almost too much, but I’d buy the H3// out of a red, blue or a dark purple one) that being said I’m wondering how this would look on a bigger person design wise
This looks so awesome!!! I love the off shoulder and the flowy bottom!  
I'd buy this in a heartbeat <3
I would honestly love this top I think for colors I like the black, a dark forest green would be really nice, a lavender, and a pumpkin/dark orange would be probably my favorites.
I like it quite a bit as it is!
if it had a downward pointing v hem i would snatch it up
My mom probably would and she has a good taste in clothing, I'm a little more alternative or emo outfit kind of person♡
Yes
It's a cool cut, I reckon it's in my department of curious fashion. But it would be nice to have a brighter photo, it's a bit hard to make out anything more than the outline in the photo.
100%!!
Looking at this without context I would 100% of the time say that that's a women's top. The waterfall hem and the way the shoulders are cut off favour slim shoulders and a lack of fat distribution on the stomach.

Maybe you're going for a feminine style, but given that fact you mentioned that you're NB I would assume you're going for androgenous. If you are, I would maybe suggest starting from a men's or unisex cut because they tend to be more androgenous. This would be very cool if it fitted more unisex
The high-low drapey hem is pretty frumpy and looks like it would emphasize curvy hips, so no. The cold shoulder trend is also slightly out of date so I’m not trying to buy cold shoulder items right now.
You've managed to put everything I hate - dark colour, cold shoulders, waterfall/flared hem, high/tight neckline - into one shirt so; that's a no from me.

ETA: getting down voted for answering OPs question. Reddit, you doin okay hun?
No I don’t like the neckline or shoulder cutouts or the lower silhouette
As a curvy person I totally second this
Second that. It wouldn't necessarily be a deal-breaker because I always tuck in my shirts into my pants, but I always prefer tops without one, and it lowers the amount of fabric you need to manufacture each piece.
Yeah same ! I like how the neckline is a bit masc while having the fem cold shoulder but I could do without the hem tbh"	vvofez	NonBinary	353	0.99	2022-07-10 10:10:52
I’m AMAB and Non-Binary, and when it comes to dressing up, I only wear mens suits because of societal pressure. Tonight I tried on a womens skirt suit and I’ve never felt so comfortable and gender euphoric!! The proportions were just right! I still need to buy some different clothing to pair with it		"[deleted]
you look great. im getting big legally blonde vibes
very 80's power lady vibes, I love it. you look super classy in it, and it's a very striking sillhouette!
Very classy!
That’s a lovely outfit
you look so amazing in this! your smile is priceless and made me smile too.
You look amazing! The outfit is super cute! 💕
You look fantastic!!
i love it! this color looks fantastic on you and it fits you beautifully. (:
Hi, im just curious to learn. What does amab/afab stand for? Thanks 😊
You look fantastic oh my gosh! 

Ugh now I’m yearning for this look lol
Oh my god, you look great. Your face has such a happy glow I love it. You are rocking that look!
Is this a business look? Or is this supposed to be ""twee nanny for hire"" energy?
Suggestion: add pants in the same color as the skirt, unbutton the first button on the top, and get a pin or two that looks like a ladybug.
If you have thrift stores around, maybe take a day to try on all the suits they’ve got just to see if anything has potential. If you can save money on the suit itself, then tailoring is less of an issue.
I’m pretty sure that there are websites specifically tailored (pun intended) to AFAB people who want to wear traditionally masculine clothing. I can’t remember the names though.
assigned male /female at birth
Do you have any advice on getting suits tailored for AFAB people? When my trans friend bought his suit for prom a few years ago, he was refused from a tailor because he didn't see him as a man, which is a whole other can of worms. Do you know of any chain tailors or suit stores that will tailor on AFAB people?
[deleted]
Thanks!
(Sadly) Its really less about the chain or brand and more the personal beliefs of the tailor/workers there. Ironically today’s the day the (American) Supreme Court sees the trials on lgbt discrimination in workplaces
Yeah, but there are places like [Bindle and Keep](http://www.bindleandkeep.com) that make suits specifically for the LGBTQ community with the knowledge of how to hide what we want hidden and emphasize what we want emphasized."	deti9y	NonBinary	355	1.0	2019-10-08 02:02:23
Boyfriend took me shopping for masc clothes yesterday & helped me figure out sizes/outfits/etc. I've been really hating my usual skinny jeans lately & these pants from the men's section of Walmart are making me feel incredible.		"Love it! And side effect is having better pockets too :)
Yay for supportive boyfriends! Mine helps me with shopping too :) great pants!
Stylin'!
you can 100% rock these, hell yeah

Anyone else share your partner’s clothes?		"i just made a joke this morning “(my name) not wear (partner’s) clothes for one day challenge: impossible!!”
Yes, of course! Great outfit btw.
Gender envy
Looking great 🥰
I adore your vibe! You look so gorgeous in that outfit
That skirt was MADE for you, I swear
Damn, you looking 🔥
Your eyes are really pretty :)
Uhm my lil femboy partner cruelly accuses me of taking his clothes out of the laundry basket like a ""raccoon"" instead of wearing my own clothes which is... true 😔 it's a comfort thing I can't help being a feral little beast
Yes! That's part of what made me realize we had a Very Queer Relationship and it's the best!
I would tuck in the straps… this outfit screams no straps but you look amazing either way
My partner is over a foot shorter than me, so unfortunately no
You guys are getting partners?
No bcz i am a turbovirgin
Me and my partner share clothes but both of our wardrobes consist solely of like t-shirts and sweatpants 😹😹😹
Yes 🤣
Oh you win it for real I must try it
Yes! But we have way less style than you, lol. We share just about every tshirt x)
I live with my ex still and I steal her shit all the time.
I fucking wish
I'm a foot taller and about four times the size of my partner.. but I'd steal their clothes so often if I was even close to their size lmao
Me lmao. Mine actually *offered* and I felt so loved ❤️
Yes all the time
I wouldn't call it ""share"". Me, my wife and my mother live together and all of us lost a lot of weigh recently, so my wife got a bunch of clothes that belonged to my mom, I got a bunch of stuff that are too large for both of them and some people in need will get most of my wardrobe (specially my masculine outfits).

Every time my wife tries an outfit and finds out she lost weigh again, I yell: ""MINE!!!"" and she cries: ""Noooooooo"". 😂😂😂
Yes and I feel it will happen more when we live together. Cause we both wear the same shirt size and he loves wearing my leggings. Even though he complains they don't have pockets.
Can I say that you look amazing in that skirt and top! 🥰 So cute 🖤
I mean, if I had a partner maybe
that outfit is so flattering 🖤 your partner is awesome for letting you borrow it especially since it looks so badass
the skirt really works with your legs
I wish! What a fuckin viiiiiibe though ur both cool as hell clearly
Yup. I've definitely borrowed plenty of his. Just need him to agree to wear more of mine lol

I’m still non-binary even if I’m femme!	"I hate how I’ll be talking to someone in public or online and I’ll express how I’m non-binary because I’m very open about my identity, and they’ll tell me “but you’re very feminine so obviously you’re a girl.”

NO.

I’m still non-binary. I go by all pronouns since I don’t mind being referred to as she, but I mainly use they/them. I’m not androgynous and never will be because I’m not comfortable presenting that way. I’m not a girl just because I’m dressed femininely. Clothes don’t have a gender and anyone, even an AFAB non-binary person, can wear clothing that’s seen as typically feminine. It’s not hard to understand yet people don’t want to take the time to listen and learn about it.

I wish more people took the time to look up gender expression and learn it does not equal identity. I wish more people would use gender neutral terms automatically when they see someone that they don’t know the gender of. I wish people understood stereotypes hurt all communities, especially a community that is so vast and different as the non-binary community. I wish people would just ASSUME I’m not a girl even if I’m wearing the most feminine get-up that I could possibly wear.

I just wish more people understood."	"I've been talking about being trans-femme (as someone AMAB) and people keep saying things like ""but why would you want to look femme when you're nonbinary?!"" Weird that they never say ""But how can you be nonbinary when you look masc?!"" to me.
""Even if I'm femme I'm still a them""
Yeah. I have a coworker who routinely misgenders me anyway, but she goes EXTRA out of her way to do it if I'm wearing something she deems femme. I remain very unclear on why this isn't exactly as big of an offense as deliberately using incorrect pronouns/terms for a binary trans person, yet she just keeps getting ""talked to"" about it, never fired.
I may not be femme, but I feel you so much. I don’t even dress femme and people still call me a girl. But something so important that people just don’t understand is that non-binary people do NOT owe anyone androgyny. We can dress as masculine and as feminine as we want and still be non-binary. That’s the point of it all — we do not align with a binary gender identity. I wish more people understood too. Giving you all the hugs.
Valid
_Big_ fucking mood.

Though honestly I'd be happier if we just stopped gendering this stuff entirely. There's absolutely nothing inherently feminine or masculine about aesthetics, and feminine and masculine are arbitrary concepts anyway.
Yeah I know that feel..
When I was exploring my gender one and trans-questioning of the first comments I got was “but you were so femme as a child.” Except I remember being a tomboy who loved playing with boys and girls toys and hated dressing up in dresses. Our outward presentation and people’s interpretation of that doesn’t necessarily (and does not have to) match our internal experience. Hugs to you.
There is no right or wrong way to be non-binary as long as you’re not racist or homophobic/transphobic
I understand greatly as I'm an AFAB enby myself. I do want to dress more masculine.

There's a post somewhere that proves the point you're making. A picture with text of ""you have to dress the part if you're nonbinary,"" and then ""meanwhile, I..."" with a picture below it of a person dressed like a super-femme bunny lolita.
True. I've always struggled enjoying dressing feminine because ppl always assume but tbh I just have a idgaf attitude 😎. Tbh I do like androgynous dressing but I like to combine femme and masc outfits
I’m in the exact same boat as you!! I’m a very feminine AFAB nonbinary person, and I’m just not happy when I present masculinely or androgynously. I’m happy with my long hair and makeup and dresses, but I’m still nonbinary! The way I express myself makes me feel happy and confident, but I’m still nonbinary.
i feel the same :[
I dress masc most of the time, but I work in aviation as a pilot, so it's job security to dress as my perceived gender. Also remember, its not clothing, accessories, make-up, etc...that makes you Non-Binary, **it's what's inside you.**
I have the same issues, people want to assign a binary role even when you tell them it's not correct, it's frustrating. Or they tell me that I'm just a girl who wants attention which isn't the case
I also wish that people who take the time to actually look it up when you tell them and not get the ole “I just don’t understand it” like no sally sue you just chose not to even try
I’m an enby as well. Many people just don’t get it and will not. It’s frustrating as hell sometimes. I will occasionally purposefully dress andro in public and not answer people’s questions about my gender or pronouns. Some will cycle through things, miss or sir, she, he etc. and I just smile politely at them and tell them to have a nice day. I’ve noticed when I act more mysteriously, people are much more pleasant that way. It’s like wearing a veil without actually having one on. When people just let me be, but try to be respectful, I see they are starting to get it. 

Other times it’s people wanting to fight and use whatever excuse that I don’t exist. Lots of times they bring up nature. Which is kind of funny considering how much DNA that humans share with everything, and that nature literally operates in the way people have had to hide about themselves. Anything that’s LGBTQIA+ is literally reflected in nature and the world around us that was here long before we were. That in itself gives me hope.
We non-binary peeps can be whatever the hell we want
I just want to say I admire your self-certainty and your passion in getting this concept into people's heads! 
Not only is this just TRUE, and I'll only speak for myself here, but keeping this fact in mind also helps keep a lot of dysphoria at bay.

I generally prefer presenting mostly androgynous, but there are days where I want to lean into feminine aesthetics and that was hard to accept for a long time because it made me feel like my identity was less valid. But that's BS!
I'm trans mask enby. Present very femme when I go out. Heavy, bold makeup and alt, usually femme, flamboyant clothes, I'm very hard to miss, still go by they/he. They way I usually tell people is ""they way I look has nothing to do with how I identify and it's also none of your business"". I find it works ok depending on the kind if people you come across
fuck yes 💯
I feel ya. I am a masc-presenting amab enby.

Gender expression ≠ gender identity.
THIS! This is so important and I completely agree. I face the same problems everyday and yet I feel guilty for feeling this way. But truly I am non-binary AND I dress stereotypically femininely. They are completely separate things!!! Gender≠expression
You're so valid! Obviously our experiences are incredibly different, because, like you mentioned, no nonbinary person is the same as another, but I can sorta relate. I'm genderfluid between agender and male mostly, however I rarely present in a masculine way because to be honest I hate that style, I think masc clothes are boring and just overall not that comfortable for me. I quite frankly don't give a damn what other people percieve me as and I use any pronouns except they/them, but it would be quite nice if people didn't see long hair and lots of jewelry and instantly assume female. And on that note I find it incredibly strange when other trans/nonbinary people do this, shouldn't other trans people be literally the last people who would assume gender/pronouns?
I've got an appointment next month to start hormones. I'm planning to continue using neutral pronouns and identifying as nonbinary. I still have people questioning why I want to ""become a woman"" and I have run out of ways to try to explain it.
I mean I'm non-binary regardless how I present or whatever pronouns I choose to go by. There's no one way to be non-binary, if you say you're non-binary you're non-binary end of story!
people think I'm a transmasc when I am nonbinary (I do try my best to look androgynous while avoiding certain clothes like leggings mainly because I hate wearing them) they think I'm a transmasc and TELL me I'm a transmasc because I cut my hair short (I would grow it out if I got a cool moustache)
Exactly! Like non binary just means outside the binary, you can present any way you want and identify any way you want
My MIL tries very hard to be supportive, but in a way that makes me think 'bless your heart,' a lot of the time. Before I came out, she used to tease me a lot for being very masc. Afterwards, she keeps getting fixated on anything at all I do that might be interpreted as femme. She, like many confused cis people, can't seem to wrap her head around the idea that 'nonbinary' doesn't always equal 'perfectly androgynous and devoid of gendered mannerisms or aesthetic preferences.'   


""If you're not trying to be seen as \[binary gender\], then why do you \[do anything at all that isn't perfectly neutral by common standards\]?"" has been a repeat conversation about hair, clothes, the way I talk, hobbies, the way I move/walk/sit, etc. I've given up on the idea of her getting it through her head that the answer every single time is going to be ""because \[gender\] doesn't own \[ANYTHING about personal expression and pleasure\], and doing so doesn't make me less NBy.""   


It's [this meme](https://d3n8a8pro7vhmx.cloudfront.net/ousa/pages/1917/attachments/original/1582134710/Screen_Shot_2020-02-19_at_12.51.32_PM.png?1582134710) basically every time. Other trans people (at least for the most part) have no problem understanding that (presentation) != (gender). Anyone on any part of the gender spectrum can look/sound/present however the hell they want - it's basic sexism to assert anything otherwise.   


Yet, with (mostly cis) people stuck in the mindset of gender binarism, there's no winning. Any way you look or present, *somehow*, you're the one enforcing sexism and gender stereotypes. Any level of comfort/discomfort with things commonly gendered one way or another is scrutinized as either proof that you're just running away from misogyny, in denial, confused, doing it for attention/to feel special, etc.
This is one of the THE most frustrating things about existing. It’s especially disappointing from people who want to consider themselves LGBTQIA+ positive and feminists. For binary folks, they are so laissez-faire about who can wear what. But then all of a sudden for us, it’s acceptable to be the gender police and subject our presentation to intense and constant scrutiny. And if we aren’t doing what they deem to be ‘enough’ to match their idea of what a nonbinary person should look like (which often includes expensive and painful clothing items, specific body types that are completely unattainable for many of us, and surgery), then they feel entitled to decide our gender for us. 

It’s such an extreme double standard and it makes me so fucking angry. I’m so tired of having to argue with self proclaimed ‘allies’ about things that should absolutely never be considered up for debate.
Sure would be nice, but you can't expect years of conditioning and learning to go away so fast, unfortunately.
[deleted]
Actually, people do say, ""But how can you be nonbinary when you look masc?!"" I'm AFAB, and everyone calls me a transgender male, even though I'm enby.
I've seen masc-presenting people say they've been excluded from LGBTQ+ spaces for being too masculine, or told they're too masc to be non-binary, especially when they're newly out 😥
I fucking love that
I totally, agree with you. I simply hate when I can go shopping for most of my clothes in the men's section and have shorter hair than my brother. And still, people tell me If you're Non-binary why do you wear a blouse (that is a shirt from the men's section)? Why don't you always have a flat chest? Why don't you start a screaming match every time someone uses a gendered word for you, if you say it doesn't describe you? And why do you have to tarnish my language with a ""gender-*"" (pretty much the best option I have since my language has no they/them, pretty much the same debate as well) when revering to yourself? It simply is exhausting. I don't have the energy to fight every little battle at once. Because you don't deserve the hate I feel toward myself afterward. For still not looking enough like I feel inside. For you not seeing the efforts I make to make it easier for you to see past this shell, and see me for who I am inside. For not fighting harder against restrictions that cage me, because you are scared of them falling. Of opening up more possibilities than you personally knew what to do with. If I scream, you are annoyed at the noise I'm making. If I stay silent, you use it to put me down. So just leave me alone would you? 

Sorry that turned into a rant, and is obviously not aimed at anyone here, just feels good to get it out there.
I’m sorry this reminded me of the tictok sound and I have to say we do owe them a little dance or a jig
EXACTLY. I feel the same. Stuff is pointlessly gendered nowadays and it’s ridiculous. We should just let people enjoy what they want to enjoy.
On point.
Isn’t combining fem and masc outfits dressing andro unless you just mean switching between the two in witch case my bad
Exactly!
Yes, good for you, but please keep in mind this is my rant post and it isn’t about you :) I don’t mean to be rude but the comment was unappreciated even if you had good intentions.
I should have said people don't say it to me. Sorry though, that's so frustrating 😔🤗
Regardless of our AGAB and expression, society loves to invalidate us. I wish people could just be chill and not get all investigatory.
Legit thought best friend refers to my chosen name as my trans guy name even though I chose a neutral name
It certainly makes me nervous about attending women and nonbinary events.
Oof
Not mine but I can't remember who said it. They even had a little jingle.
I love that TikTok sound 😭 I’m also a fan of that one tweet thread that’s like “Non-binary do not owe you androgyny” “No but one does owe me money”
Yea I like to switch between the two. I think it's kinda limiting to always be 50/50 ya know so I like to lean heavily into one side while still making it somewhat andro.
That would be miserable 4 me especially being AMAB I already try to get as femme/nb as possible to pass. That must SUCK
Even when I’m femme I’m still a them, even when I’m femme I’m still a them, I’m a they either way, no matter what the day, even when I’m femme I’m still a them! (Haha I memorized it, it’s from tik tok)
Ya know what I appreciate the honesty

Went shopping. I love the clothes 👌 I didn't give a f**k and went to the ladys AND Men section		"You look amazing and those clothes look amazing on you!
Looking great in your non-binary finery
love that plaid color
And you look tf good!
Thank you so much! I feel great though
Thanks :)
Thx!  I thought I could try something new beside my standard colors (grey, blue, black, red and any combination of these ones). I know that black and grey aren't colors but hey haha
Thanks! You're so kind
You should feel great :)"	qkmji9	NonBinary	345	0.99	2021-11-01 20:07:59
A hater dude at the gym mocked me for wearing what he called “women’s clothes.” I just shook it off and kept on doing my thing!		"Honestly the outfit looks unisex I wouldn't question anyone wearing that. 
It's just clothing. 

I'm sorry you had the hate.
Uhhhhhh maybe dudebro should not fuck with people who are clearly stronger than he is in body mind and soul eh? Good for you for getting to the gym on a Friday. Have a kick ass weekend!
I don’t know why people just have the audacity to gender clothing.. I hope you are doing great though! Have a fantactic weekend!!
All clothing is unisex if you're not a coward! 
Good for you doing your thing and not letting some dude that couldn't mind his own business get you down.
Big mouth nobody needs to stfu and not bother people with his hateful nonsense
As a fellow gym person this makes me mad. One guy at my gym called me a fairy because my nails were painted. He is a very scary and intimidating person so now I try to avoid going when he does.
Screw people. Do you.  I am a strong female bodied person who is bigendered. I get looks for ""being too strong"". So I can out push up most dudes even. I am a muay thai fighter and in the military.  Part of my job is to keep in shape. I just happen to have a female body that puts on muscle. I don't care about the stares. I chalk it up to they are just jealous they can't do the same. Lots of women give me smiles and way to goes... the men just often stare. Just do you.. I go to the gym for me, not for them... be well.
Hell yeah! Keep doing what makes you happy and screw what anyone else has to say about it! 👏
You look so cool! Your strong for doing your thing :))
U look awesome ! That sucks they are so insecure that they have to do stuff like that.
As u should!! Amazing job mate :)
Damn warrior you are. Show'em how it's done!
And also have you seen how CIS/Straight dude bros wear to the gym ? Far more questionable in terms of gendered clothing . Probably intimidated or something.  You should walk up to em when their doing the peak of their workout and tell em good job and they will get there . And you remember when you just started and their not doing bad for a lil guy.
Hater dude sounds *very* insecure about himself...you do you!
No offense to your genderfuckery, but I thought that was a men’s shirt. Looks cut like one (from this angle). What was he on about?? - Not that it would’ve been cool either way but ????
No offense to your genderfuckery, but I thought that was a men’s shirt. Looks cut like one (from this angle). What was he on about?? - Not that it would’ve been cool either way but ????
I buy my workout clothes (and most other clothes) in the section marked women’s, through I’ve never really understood the difference. The only real difference is the weird stares from people who live by labels. But whatever, I  buy what I like and what fits me best. And the ‘women’s’ styles, especially with pants and shorts, fit me much better.
Thank You!!
Even from a young age I never understood the gender rules for clothes. I only understood that most people have strong opinions about what’s normal and they expect everyone else to live by their rules.
I don't get why people bother to comment what other people are wearing in general. Unless I'm totally naked, it's no one's business. And who cares if a dude is wearing a skirt or something? No one makes comments when a woman wears pants.
Agreed! I never understood the difference.
I’m sorry you have to live in fear of haters. You deserve to be you without judgement from narrow minded people.
I am AFAB and hope to build my own strength! Thank you for your comment. Gives me hope I can get there!
Thank You!
Thank You
Thank You!!
lol I could be wrong but ime, bodybuilding communities are typically full af of bisexual dudes, it's kinda just part of the culture from what I've seen. at least, getting into bodybuilding definitely contributed to my recognizing that part of myself haha.
Fact! Thank You!
Right right. 

Yeah it's to bad clothing is gendered, like there's no point so as long as what needs to be covered is covered.
You can.  I won somewhat the genetic lottery for strength... but any female body can become strong, just takes time. Don't be discouraged and keep doing you.
You're entirely welcome...you've the courage to be who you truly are, which is no small thing, at all :)

Being ✨Non-Binary✨; pros and cons…		"TLDR: 

pros of being NB: being myself!

cons of being NB: discrimination :-(
I honestly needed to rant my non-binary pals :(
The biggest con is that I’m waaaaaay too passive, especially with other adults. I can never bring myself to correct anybody about my own pronouns. My mom is particular is reeeeeeally bad with it despite me having been out for a year and I just can’t bring myself to correct her. No clue why
Q: What toilets do you use?

A: The ones that are clean and working!
Pros of being NB: I can be myself!
Cons: I can't be myself at work, so as to not confuse the people with disabilities I work with, so I purposely misgender myself to everyone I work with on a daily basis
A god... Clearly 🤷
As someone who can do deathcore vocals the demonic dinosaur screech is definitely something I use on annoying/rude people like that lol
i like the dinosaur response lmaooo. creative and fun :)
Except I am too scared to even enter the women's section in the store with my wide frame and hairy...everything. I'm scared I'm gonna look like a pervert. Also women's sizes scare me...
Pros: I feel free from societal standards of men and women, good friends use my correct pronouns, I can wear whatever I want however I want whenever I want, I get to choose my name and I love it!
Cons, everyone who doesn’t specifically know me miss genders me, 90% of people are either confused as to what NB means or thinks i’m just confused myself, ”But your a girl..?”, and when you tell your mother that you don’t identify strictly with female and she still calls you her daughter and she still calls you your birth name…. That fucking stings…
This would be accurate if my family was accepting, haha
Nb lore
>> What toilets do you use. 
You know standard (insert country) ones. 


>> You are confused 
No, but it seems that you are. 

>> purposely use the incorrect pronouns 
Purposely ignore them until they stop being a dick.
Love this!!!!
Wait, people actually get upset at the word ""confused""? I thought that was a meme
Your lucky to have an accepting family, be sure to let them know they are super cool.
We are all inside dinosaurs keep killing it quing
There's no indication at my workplace that I'm an enby (though IIRC it's possible to put it on name tags?) (chain gas station) but customers ask from time to time if I'm a man or woman. I just don't answer and move on with the transaction.
Imagine having a supportive family 🥲
-proceeds to maul them to death uwu-
I wish I had a family that was fine with me being nonbinary...
Yep, i feel ya
Sameeee
I’m the exact same way. I’m a teacher and with my team I’m “Tr” but a lot of other staff at my school refer to me as “miss” and sometimes I want to scream and just be like “if you’re not gonna call me Tr then you have to call me Mx, there’s no other option”, but instead I just in my head forgive them for mistaking me for how I know I present. I don’t like it though and I struggle greatly with it.
Same here
Happens with a coworker of mine. We work in a very public-facing customer service job, and he'll occasionally get misgendered (maybe like 20% of the time). And he's not ENBY; just a somewhat effeminate looking cis-guy. I keep telling him to speak up more for himself, but...🤷‍♂️
Lol. Best response.
Walk out of one toilet and into the other, for maximum confusion
I will start using this, thank you!
Feel you.. I've been on stage when I was younger and now that old ""she""  just got my work role
I have won..but at what cost..?
Yes, me and others incourage this screeching..haaahhaaaa
Shop online... Google the measurements for specific things- look for a size chart and at the reviews. (Also, sorry our society makes you feel like you can't shop without freaking people out.) Good luck ❤
Kinda the same for me, but i feel ya dude/nice person.
Oh no! I need to adopt you, welcome! U r accepted.
This lmao

Awh, im here if u need to vent okay?
You go quing
I will be the online family
Start sitting down on one, stop midstream and finish at urinal
Huh. I don't really get it but then again it's not really my business. Now, another question, why spell ""bis3xual"" the way you did, with a three? On a surface level it looks like censorship...
Thanks I appreciate that

Why do women’s clothes not have pockets?	"I always hear my female friends complain about this, and my cis-male self at the time just ignored it.  But now as a transfemme NB I’m quite confused and annoyed - it’s hard enough to find clothes, now I have to find room for my phone and keys?  What is up with that?

How does everyone else handle this?  Jackets?  Even those have a 50% chance of having nonfunctional pockets.  Carry a purse everywhere?

Ok that was just a rant - please delete if inappropriate."	"Probably because they want to sell handbags or whatever. Or it's cheaper.
There is some history to this because womens close used to have pockets. My understanding is that it was ""fashion over function"". In particular womens clothing became more and more form fitting so having stuff in your pockets started to look bulky and interrupt the ""look"". At this point I'm pretty sure the fashion industry has more say over it than the people buying the clothes. And I'm sure the market for bags has a big influence because the handbag industry is a big industry.
What to do about it: 

* Be picky about your clothes and refuse to buy clothes without adequate pockets
* Carry a bag, yeah - doesn't have to be a purse necessarily
* Learn to sew and make your own clothes or at least add/expand pockets - this is easiest in looser clothes and in things like skirts
Originally it was because male designers liked to ogle women and they said that women having things in their pockets ruined the female form’s beauty. Now it’s evolved into that and lots of companies sell handbags and other solutions for no pockets. It’s extremely dumb if you want a full history check out Bernadette Banner on YouTube she has a whole video on the history of pockets in women’s fashion
Unfortunately, the answer is a purse everywhere.  As to why, you can blame the male fashion designers that perpetuate the patriarchy to sell more handbags and purses.
\- It is cheaper to make clothes without pockets (women't clothing is cheaply made in general)  
\- Women are just expected to use bags  
\- Lots of women's clothing is too tight for actual pockets

Sexism wooooo! /j  
Bring back pockets deep enough to store at least two cats!
In all honesty, I've gotten to the point where I buy men's pants over women's. The downside? My boyfriend and I have debates about this. Because he has this stupid thought that I should be happy to carry a purse. Yeah... With the way things are getting - fuck that noise. How I identify aside - my safety is far more important.
This is part of the reason why I'm a kilt evangelist, modern/utility kilts typically have ample pockets 😁

I do have a purse, but I don't really care for them in general. But I also have some belts with pouches on them.
Ah. Welcome to women’s world where the clothes are made for men’s pleasure at looking at women instead of women’s comfort or functional needs. 

High heels. Need I say more? Sure, lots of women find them empowering. They are for some. Because they capitalize on male gaze and sexualizing female bodies. They also destroy the muscle, tendons, ligaments and bones in the feet and legs and can cause serious back issues. But you know, they “look good”.
I've heard it's a really old practice going back to witchcraft times, in that people were scared of giving women easy access to pockets in case they would use them to hide things for casting spells and such. I don't remember where I read that or how serious it was, but it sounds like a cool reason.
You can find clothing with deep enough pockets, and clothing with enough pockets, and sometimes clothing with both but it’s an effort. Incorporating women’s pants into my daily wear has definitely changed how I approach getting dressed because I have to think about if I need a jacket for extra pockets or how I can divvy up what I’m carrying between the pockets of my pants. With my men’s jeans I could fit basically everything I needed into my two front pockets.
Combination of the purse industry maintaining its influence and holdovers from the time when women weren't allowed to carry money. Began with the patriarchy, continued by capitalism.
Once upon a time, clothes didn't have pockets at all! 😱

You should check out this podcast, which goes into the rather interesting history: https://99percentinvisible.org/episode/pockets-articles-of-interest-3/
To prevent femme folk from carrying poisons and staging a coup I assume 
(Being playful of course lol it's seriously irritating though!)
i watched like a whole YouTube video on why women's clothing doesn't have pockets and if i remember correctly, the main reasons were over time dresses for women started to be less poofy in the hips and more form fitting, no poof meant no space for pockets, little mini bags were developed as the result of that, another reason was because at the time where more form fitting dresses were being made, women (but like middle and upper class) weren't really expected to carry anything big around with them and that was ""the man's job"" or something like that.

If i find the video I'll add it here.

Also, if you wanna find clothing with pockets, go to charity shops, they have a variety of clothes that look cool and have pockets. I found a long skirt with pockets in a charity shop and it was life changing.

Edit: FOUND THE VIDEO

Welcome to the joys of living in a patriarchy.
Shoulder bag, or what I do is modify the pockets. Cut them open and extend with more fabric. Done.
Historically, it's a hold over fromm women being considered property. Small decorative bags and no pockets meant women couldn't escape or leave very long because they couldn't carry anything with them.
I carry a backpack everywhere I go
A fashion historian answers your question[https://youtu.be/W2zSSE9pgC8](https://youtu.be/W2zSSE9pgC8)
Because clothing companies foolishly think that women and femmes don’t like and collect cool shiny rocks, so they omit pockets from production. 

But oh, how very wrong they are.
Men, In the early 1900 there was a ban on pockets for women clothing... France started it if I remember correctly.
I wear a fanny pack / bum bag and get lots of compliments 😎 I especially like wearing it across my chest
It's an artifact of patriarchal domination... we can't ruin the female silhouette with pockets. We can give women fake pockets and clothes that mimic men's clothes without the functionality... personally I stick with ranting against the patriarchy and buy a nice backpack
having stuff in pockets can distort the shape of the outfit. a dress i have with pockets is a light dress. it's really only fit to have tissues. a wallet or phone sags the dress.
Because if they have pockets, we wouldn’t make so much money off of handbag industry.
i don't mind it too much. i switched to women's clothes recently; jeans in particular. it's an adjustment, but it definitely helps me reduce how much i need to take with me. 

sometimes i'll have pens cards, a little notepad, whatever. and obviously that's too much. i like the minimalist mindset. but that's just me. 

you do you.
Women need to look pretty not have functional clothing! Sure you can’t store anything but your husband can do that for you :) /s
Ok so I actually found out something, it might not be true, but like way back in the whole “women are witches” thing they stopped making pockets in dresses, (which was basically all women wore at the time) because they thought they could carry around spells and potions in them to just like, randomly attack people? It’s weird but that continued even after they got over the “witch” thing. This might be completely inaccurate, but that’s what I heard about the reason.
Christian Dior actually explained this phenomenon all the way back in 1954, saying ""Men have pockets to keep things in, women for decoration.""

It's basically a conspiracy by the fashion industry, to sell designer handbags, and to sell more than people would ever need, by making them ""in season"" or ""last season"" and deciding they need to match belts or shoes, and then inflating the price to sell a bag that costs less than a dollar to make for $1500, so they seem like luxury items.
I heard it was in medieval times so women couldn’t conceal spells and witchcraft upon their person. Could be utter rubbish but sounds like something society would do.
Hre are a few fun youtube videos ive seen on the subject recently!:

It seems possibly its more a result of fashion trends than anything but its hard to say.
I have swing dresses with pockets.
as a fashion design student I can tell you: because people buy it anyway and it saves fabric. Fashion is an industry driven by money and they will do anything to cut the costs. 
Also putting things in the pockets ‚destroy‘ the ideal feminine figure/sihouette.
If you don’t mind the look, a fanny pack can help.  I started wearing them when I was more masc (I’d joke back then that it was my purse) and really started appreciating how much more I could carry around.
This is the main reason why I want to buy boys' trousers some day.
Best solution I've found is a denim skirt with pockets - best thrifting find I've had!

When cold: jacket

When warm: cross-chest bag/satchel

If it fits the aesthetic I'm rocking and my leg is mostly accessible (i.e. not a long skirt/dress): Leg bag (strap around one thigh and waist, with the bag resting on the outer thigh.
Because women have purses to carry their stuff, „of course“
I developed the habit of Backpack Everywhere when still IDing as a cis woman and even now that I mostly wear mens’ pants I still Backpack Everywhere. I also like to carry quite a lot of stuff with me tho (at least 2 books, a notebook, wallet, keys, phone, water bottle, etc) and I definitely feel nude without a big backpack. (I’m a nightmare to take to clubs, as you can imagine)
I carry a bag, mostly a black tactical shoulder bag. I also carry a backpack or satchel. I have some men’s pants and I need more cause POCKETS. My girl friends also carry backpacks, shoulder bags, or rarely a purse.
Dunno, but it's pretty annoying. I am personally thinking of maybe seeing if I can buy a nicely made leather fanny pack (like actually nice, maybe even more akin to a handymans belt) to use with my skirts.

Because Women Don't Need Pockets, They're Born With Bags On Their Hands, Obviously!

Honestly I've Never Really Had A Problem With Jacket Pockets, Although To Be Fair I Don't Have Many Things I Bring With Me Anywhere.
I carry a rucksack of varying sizes every day depending on how much I need to carry. I'd rather wear 'male' clothes and have the pockets for most times leaving the house but my body shape won't fit lol.
>Why do women’s clothes not have pockets?

So that these companies can sell purses and handbags.
I will admit that I miss cargos, but now I get to show off my legs I spent a lifetime cultivating (and are practically the only part of my body in good shape lol).
This is what I do. I’m afab nb/Agender dude I wear more gender neutral/masc clothes like kid/neutral/men’s clothes they have pockets. Idk if this makes sense I’m sorry
That's why I got the sewing machine months before I started HRT 🤓
Fasion threoy has a nice summary vid on youtube about it
They wanna sell purses. Simple as that.
A ploy by purse stores to sell more purses lol jk but really I’ve heard everything from that to “designers think women want a more slim design and pockets put rumples in the look” or whatever and I’m like okay but faking pockets is worse than functioning pockets. Plus purses and bags are terrible for spine health.
Purse or tote bags have become my friends my thude
It's because clothing companies expect a women to have a purse so they don't need pockets. They expect men not to have anything but pockets to carry things in which is why cargo shorts are a thing. Also they tended to be for looks NOT function. I think the stupidest thing is a ""pocket"" that is only a pocket in look but isn't a pocket at all as it's sown shut.
I have loads of women's clothing that has pockets, some even big enough for a large cell phone. That having been said, I'd rather carry the purse that stuff my pockets like a starving chipmunk.
as least your rant wasnt worse  than mines. but anyways its like every womans  pants rarely has any pockets because womens jeans or pants, Sweatpantsshorts, and overalls have pockets. dont get leggings cus TTHEY ARE WORST ONES. Jeans and pants pockets can sucks because if the pockets are sew in the the pants or possible you struggle to fit your hands in them then your back pockets  are your friends. Hoodies have good pockets as well
Cargo pants. I have fancy cargo pants for going out, work cargo pants, and every day cargo pants and jeans. The pockets on my butt and hips are still impossible to fit anything into, but with cargo pants there’s at least two other pockets on the pant leg I can use. Most of my cargo pants are pretty form fitting until they reach the mid-thigh and then they taper out a bit, which I personally prefer, but I know they make cargo pants that are tight all the way down the leg, they just have extra pockets down the sides too. 

When the occasion simply does not call for cargo pants, I fanny-pack it up. Purses are annoying to me, but part of that is because I try to be as neutral as I can with how I present, the closest I’ll get to girly is a ‘hard-femme’ vibe but that usually works with cargo pants. 

Other than that, sometimes I use sports bras with removable padding, take out the padding, and use that pocket as an extra carrying case for small things like my credit card, ID, and lip balm. I’ve got a naturally pretty flat chest, and I find that the lack of boobies makes for a perfect extra pocket in my bra, especially if I’m wearing a loose shirt over.
MatPat just released another theory channel called Style Theory and one of his new vids is “The Great Pocket Conspiracy”. Highly recommend.
I found women's Levi's at Walmart that have the pocket space of men's pants. So. Amazing. Hope this helps anybody.
Get a nice sporran imo. All you need is a belt, I wear mine over skirts at my thigh, I have even worn it and nothing else. And don't let anyone call it a fanny pack. Beats the hell out of a purse!
Magic pockets in jackets/sweaters and wearing dude jeans... seriously. ;)
[A good explanation of the history of pockets in traditional ""women's"" clothes.](https://youtu.be/jGEYGevx13s)
I like fanny packs worn across the chest! as someone with medium-small boobs who sometimes likes looking flatter, it can also minimize your chest to have something covering it, which may be a plus or minus for you
“Women’s pockets essentially disappeared because their husbands would carry all their money and necessities. After all, women were meant to just sit at home, drinking tea, preparing meals for their husbands and knitting little jumpers for their hordes of children.” [read more here](https://medium.com/verve-up/the-bewildering-and-sexist-history-of-womens-pockets-1edf3a98117)


Essentially it’s about control and sexism, women MUST rely on men back in the 20th century and unfortunately the fashion hasn’t changed much despite equality laws changing. And yes as many people have pointed out, after the war era women’s clothes were made to exaggerate their soil and curvy figures to phase out women wearing masculine clothing during war times.
I carry a bag if I wear “women’s” pants and it’s too warm for jackets. It’s really the worst
Plenty of clothes do, you just have to pay attention when your buying things. They can create a pendulum on dresses and loose flowy clothing and doesn't really always work with sheer clothing. 

Mostly sucks but there's reasons occasionally 😊
I studied fashion history, I know why this is. Yes it is to sell us purses. And to save on fabric. Women’s clothing tends to be made much more cheaply as women are marketed to in such a way as to convince them to buy more frequently
I highly recommend backpacks! They’ve always been a godsend to me
https://youtu.be/jGEYGevx13s

This video gives a pretty good overview.
Everytime I find pants or even a dress with pockets, It's hard to not start dancing with joy in the middle of the store. But even then, feminine pockets are usually much smaller, so I started to buy purses and shoulder bags instead of expecting to find actual functional clothes.
Cargo pants from the women's aisle have cool pockets :))
I only get mens clothes cause I want pockets that I can actually fit my phone in and I just watched an episode on YouTube by MatPat on this very topic
My experience is that's why femmes carry handbags/purses.
I take both a backpack & a tote bag everywhere, although most of my clothes either have no pockets or real pockets, I don’t think I have any fake pockets. I mostly take those bc I’m an artist & I carry my iPad absolutely everywhere. At comic con last week one of the other stall holders had a nice dress & they excitedly told me it had pockets 😂 it was very sweet (but sucky that it has to be something we should get excited over)
Well first it was sexism then it was the hand bag industry then it just became a thing so that’s what designers do now despite the irritation of many women. The way I deal with it is cargo pants and back pockets. Cargo pants have an abundance of pockets and most jeans at least keep the back pockets fortunately. But you could also try to actively look for cute pants with pockets. Or carry a purse, mini backpack,Fanny pack ect with you. Also stay away from skinny jeans because 9 times out of ten no pockets even back pockets will be fake.
To the last question: purse, handbag, fannypack, backpack... Only good thing is that you end up having a lot more inventory space than with regular modern pockets.

For why they don't have pockets: well, there are a couple of reasons. ""Women"" clothing tends to be or skintight or etherialy flowy. In the first case, the pockets would ""ruin"" the silhoutte (keep in mind that women obviously only dress to appease the male gaze). In the second case, the materials of the garment aren't sturdy enough to resist the weight of the stuff you normally carry around. The hand bag industry has also been pushing the use of handbags and other stuff you ""need"" to buy. The more women think they need to buy, the better for them. And probably there are a couple more reasons.

In short, misogyny.
'Cause people are sexist.
It's a conspiracy by the handbag industry. I'm completely serious.
They're also considered ""unaesthetic"" because they disrupt the contours of the desirable feminine curves or whatever.
If it was truly cheaper then you’d see market pressure to remove pockets from Men’s clothes.  But that hasn’t happened :P

Also the size of the pockets are always smaller on women’s clothes.

Ok.  Time to look for NB-friendly purses.
Interesting.  I guess I did start buying from the women’s section because of how it looked - so maybe my giant phone kinda ruins what I was going for.  Thank you for the perspective
I started carrying a bag, first it was a simple satchel until I said fuck it and got a purse
Also Abby Cox!
yeah I've always done the men's pants thing. imo a lot of them are indistinguishable from women's pants, except that the men's seem to be more durable and with real pockets. I even have some that are pretty slim.
He can carry a purse if he's so hung up on it! 

Shame men's handbags aren't a thing, you could fit so many cool things inside.
This is the way.
Thank you!!
Masc presenting people also live in a patriarchy, they just have their own set of issues which are different and more subtle then the issues women have under the same system. 

If your an mtf egg until your late teens you've already been, *at least,* emotionally and socially abused as a matter of course in growing up. 

You only really get to enjoy *all* of that male privilege as an adult and under the condition that you remain in the closet and at the cost of being shunned and treated poorly by *many* other women (I accept there are reasons for this but they aren't relevant to the end result). 

I would trade the privileges I had before for the life I have now, in a heartbeat, every single day. Being treated like a human is lovely.

Edit: I'm not trying to come across mean or agressive here 🥰  just trying to explain how patriarchy negatively impacts everyone, because the pervasive myth (or argument) that amab people  exclusively benifit for it is bs and probably causes a lot of damage to our agenda.
Photo/link?  😊
Wait, the other people advised me to get a purse or bag, but really the solution was to get a husband?  Wow, this is going to be a lot more work than I thought..!
pretty sure fem clothes in medieval times had pockets, it was only relatively recently that pockets started disappearing from women's clothing.
Yeah Im also a backpack afab. 

Its mainly so I can bring my switch, jacket and water bottle with me. 

I don't go to clubs but I'm a nightmare at the supermarket because I keep forgetting I've got a backpack on and how bulky it is so I tend to be a pain in the ass in the aisles
Wait, the other people advised me to get a purse or bag, but really the solution was to get a husband?  Wow, this is going to be a lot more work than I thought..!
You’re right, I moved towards women’s clothes because of how it looked, and I now realize the look may be incompatible with the way I’m used to doing things.  It was just unexpected…
Also totally agree, they want you to put your phone in your butt pocket but that's like the worst idea ever
CURSE YOU BIG BAG!!!
Take a look at the style theory video by MatPat
I think it also has something to do with how snug the clothing is supposed to fit the lines of the body, as well as the handbag conspiracy. IT's NoT sExY for femmes to carry things in their pockets cause with as tight as a lot of femme clothing is, it accentuates curves and stuff like gloves just look like big ol lumps. Plus it's a little uncomfortable for the person wearing it when it bunches up weird when you sit down in those tight ass pants and what not, but that's just my two cents after years of wearing skinny jeans with not just shallow pockets but also the infamous FAKE pockets in the front. 

I second the backpack/bookbag comment and also propose messenger bags as NB friendly
I just use bookbags!

Personally I'm not a fan of purses as sometimes they are just hard to open, too small to carry all my stuff, easily stolen, etc  
So I got a bookbag, the front pocket has all my previous ""purse"" things and the bigger pocket can hold my hat, gloves, a jacket, and diapers and wipes for my son (who's still in pullups XD)

Its been really helpful for my mental health and it doesnt hurt its got a cover covered in slime rancher slimes that are all rainbowy!
Personally i think They do it to try to force women into needing a purse, and also to try to keep women's clothing as sexualized and tight as it can be unfortunately. 

I'm not sure what your style is, but at h&m, they have these adjustable little shoulder bag (in the men's section) that i absolutely adore, i got a cute little olive one. You can loosen the strap and wear it at your side, or tighten it and wear it across your body. I hate using purses, from a gender and a sensory perspective, and the little bag actually can carry everything i need and more without feeling super gendered in either direction. The other day i had my wallet, keys, phone, vapes, headphones, and a piece of pumpkin bread all fit comfortably inside a bag that's around the size of my hand. I love it. Im just a gay that needs to carry things damnit
Rothco Canvas Ammo Crossbody Shoulder Bag https://a.co/d/6KKsg4L

I got this as storage on a ghost face cosplay, but it is actually super useful. 

So now I bring it pretty much everywhere.
Third vote for backpacks here! I’ve recently rediscovered fanny packs, too. Baboon To The Moon has a great 3 liter pack that works as a cross-body sling if you don’t want to wear it around your waist. They’re coming out with new colors all the time, too!
I have a happy meal box that's a crossbody bag, it's pretty bulky but it carries a lot of stuff!
I found messenger bags to be a great option.
Actually it is happening, as someone who buys solely men’s pants. I blame the fanny pack
I'm enjoying cute backpacks for this purpose!
I recommend techy bags. the more ""features,"" the more nonbinary looking they tend to be lol. Like bags with secret pockets, elastic grids, anti theft, RFID, water resistance, etc etc
It is cheaper but supply and demand dictates that men’s pants without pockets wouldn’t sell very well because men aren’t as used to carrying bags and purses
I recommend Freitag bags if you have the money! Pretty much eternal, eco friendly and just cool
backpacks are the best back imo but totes are not bad either, super hard to keep organized though lmao

edit: or fanny packs if you only have a few little items to carry around
Pockets don't have to be around the hips though. Jackets, coats, tops etc exist. and more ergonomic bags than handbags. Plus, if you like wearing skirts or dresses, you're entitled to HUGE pockets. People used to be able to stuff bookS in there.
I can't figure out how to comment a pic so I'll make a post!
Could very well be an urban myth I heard! I have no evidence to back up my point at all
Yeah, if it really bothered people that much they should just shop in the menswear section 🤮 those clothes *already* exist and there is a reason you're not *already* buying them.

Never thought I’d ever dredge that up from my subconscious - but here it is.  Growing up in the 90s was weird.
Yeah, the fake pockets really piss me off.
[deleted]
They read very masculine to me - mostly because that’s what I had before I made the change.  But they are cool though!!
Thanks!  It looks great on you and adds a lovely splash of color and energy.
I feel called out.  My phone is the only thing I have in my pants that keeps getting bigger every year.
Try Sherpani if you can afford it, a lot of their stuff is more squarely in the middle.

That's a great look! Very chic, especially with that haircut. And your smile is lovely :)
You look amazing and super comfortable!❤️
Pro tip: H&M sell a line of clothes called Divided that can easily be worn by anyone no matter your gender. All of the women's stuff fits well on men and all of the men's stuff fits well on women :) 
Looks good on you and what a great smile.
Total cutie! 
You look excellent! I love this look!

This is a dope look. 
Fuck u look amazing, thats what im gonna do someday

My first time transmuting fabrics: into enby clothes, using these queer magics
love that outfit. you look awesome 
You have made this genderqueer's day, maybe even my life! Thank you
You look great btw 
I now need to go and see if this is available here in the UK... 
what if i’m fat tho
Target created a line of clothes called Universal Threads that's supposed to be more inclusive of different body types. Plus they installed gender neutral bathrooms into every store recently
Lose some weight, I lost 40 pounds and am so much happier now as it is much easier to pull off an androgynous look 
I knew this already but to those that didn’t, seriously go check it out. 
It needs to be said that losing weight isn't always an available option right away for a lot of people. Time, money issues, health issues, disability, access to healthy food, access to kitchen tools. These are barriers to losing weight that can't go away overnight for a lot of people.

I could talk forever about how society is mostly at fault for this and they should give more support and resources to prevent and treat obesity but that's a topic for another day.
I do agree with your sentiment but I still believe it is easier to pass as androgynous if one has a lower body fat percentage, especially if one is AMAB as fat distribution is much more likely to go to the belly than to the hips or legs

Hi I'm new! I was liking my look (for once) and wanted to ask who else share clothes with their partner(s)?		"I’ve always been a hoodie borrower (and lender) but one time I had a break up and we had to figure out who got to keep our collective favorite pair of cargo shorts
I don't intentionally share clothes with my partner, but he steals my clothes to wear sometimes 😂

Also,  you look awesome!
You look so cool! 🤩🤩 My partner and I share some stuff but there's a hight difference so it's a little more difficult lol
Yes! Since I came out, he’s been super supportive about buying me a surprise sweater or something in a more masculine style (which is where I’m comfy atm). So glad to hear you have that support, OP
I wish I could share clothes with my partner so you're lucky
I share with my partner quite often! We’re very different sizes, so it’s sweaters are nice and oversized on me, and my oversized shirts fit it perfectly :)
My partner and I share clothes, but we’re not this stylish lol. I need to go shopping (and workout harder- serious ab envy here lol).
I'm built like a Mom from a Pixar movie and my cisgendered husband's clothes do not often fit me XD
My partner and I would if we were close enough in size. I have some of their shirts they’ve grown out of that are still big on my but that’s about it.
Been stealing my husband's clothes since day one, unfortunately he doesn't fit into mine to get any revenge 🤣
Life cold and hard, Tummy soft and warm UwU
You look amazing 🖤
THANK YOU SO MUCH!

Yeah I feel you, unlucky for me the only difference is that my wife is a smaller shoe size and she has some cool ones.
I haven't been to a gym in 8 years tbh.
Oh that's pretty lucky! My partner has been really nice about jerking and eye out for stuff she would wear but in my size I think it was so I would stop stealing from her lol
That’s amazing! I have a natural lean build, but not that type of definition. You’re blessed :)
Lol cute!
Thank you so much but honestly just any they/them I just have really good jeans! Lol *finger guns*

Hello everyone! I'm back again! Alex (They/Them) Recently this year I have been getting into more feminine clothing and was looking for some inspiration. I tend to go toward short skirts but not too sure on what tops I could do? Hope everyone is having a fantastic day ❤		"I think what you got on r right now looks amazing!!!
Crop tops work great with skirts esp if they're high waisted

A nice tighter fitting babydoll tee is a solid choice, a few long sleeved high-low shirts (shorter in the front longer in the back)

DONT SLEEP ON BODYSUITS they look fucking amazing, a little uncomfortable for the downstairs but worth it

Also I mean you can never go wrong with an oversized sweater or hoodie with some tights and boots on
That top and skirt are such a good combo!! I'm a sucker for florals but the colors especially work well together 👏
These outfits kick ass
out and under tank tops from urban outfitters are good but this looks cute as it is !
Oversized crop-top hoodies are a thing, and they are GLORIOUS
It's about to get colder so I've been looking at long, dress length cardigans
Oooo body suits. I can never seem to find ones I like is my only issue. Any online recommendations?
In Australia its getting hot haha 😂 so trying to find some more summer wear

Yeah, that's how I'd describe my style, too - a balance of masc and femme clothes in each outfit. I also love low-key casual femme tops with PJ pants for ultra comfy days that are still affirming.

That's me when I get asked about something.

""Isn't that a woman's belt/socks/whatever?""

""Not as long as I'm wearing it!""

Of course, my appropriations aren't always noticed that easily.
Love this whole style! The hair, the accessories, the suit, everything! And the dog, too, so cute.
I’m Mary’s great great great great nephew and I’m a trans man. Seeing people quote them always puts a smile on my face 😊
I'm not sure who the person in the picture is, but the woman they are quoting was a bad ass. Dr. Mary Edwards Walker was the first female surgeon employed by the US army. She worked as a field surgeon during the Civil War. She also fought for abolition and women's suffrage. She refused to wear standard women's clothing, and instead wore what was considered to be men's clothing, including a top hat.
She also was a front runner in the AIDS movement since the 70s. She established what started as a small clinic in DC for people with AIDS to not feel judged but get the help they need while enlisting some of the best doctors and researchers to help fight it. Today her small clinic has turned into a HUGE staple in DC and is massive and specializes in safe, responsible and caring medical care for the DC LGBTQIA community. Helping tens of thousands of people a year. They have everything you need in an amazing 6 level health care center. They’re slogan is “We see you” and the Whitman Walker Health center has saved my life. The mental health care is AMAZING! She was a bad ass, everyone should know about her!

Edit: also that’s me in the pic lol
Thanks 😊
> for abolition and women's suffrage

I read that the first time as ""The abolition of women's suffrage"" and I needed to hard reset my brain for a second.

She sounds super dope, tho.
Ohhhhh 😅 im face palming!!! That's so cool, though!!! Queer history is so affirming to learn 💜
You look great & I love your dog!!"	gmktd5	NonBinary	310	1.0	2020-05-19 08:46:31
Picked up sewing. Now I finally have clothes that make me feel euphoric.		"You look amazing!! I, too, turned to sewing to make gender-euphoric clothes for myself—and I love having a one-of-a-kind piece to wear❤️
May I ask what pattern you used? Thanks!
Very nice and you look great!
sewing was one of the best ways I could make masculine patterns and colors but for my female body.  It became a hobby from a necessity because I could never find good clothes in stores.  

Then I’d have friends ask oh where did you get that from lol and I’d be like oh I made it haha

I swear there’s a huge profit market for non binary clothing but they need good designers with a designer eye to vet the merchandise .. this is a totally untapped market
Nice!!!
You made that shirt? It looks really nice!
Looks so good!
I never even thought of trying to sew clothes for myself. This is a remarkable idea that I am going to try! Thank you so much for sharing 😊
Thank you very much \^\_\^   
Agreed, it is both the joy of having a self-made item, and that it fits my gender.  
This is a Yukata made of silk! ([http://www-personal.umich.edu/\~weyrbrat/Japan/yukata/](http://www-personal.umich.edu/~weyrbrat/Japan/yukata/)) only I made it shorter (shirt length) and wear it with Hakama-style pants.
Thanks a lot \^\_\^
That is an interesting thought! I think you are right. Yeah you need a good designer, and probably some market research. To find out what people wish for!  
Yes sewing is great \^\_\^
Thanks :D
Thank's a lot \^\_\^
Aw, thank you :)
Thank you! \^\_\^ I wish you a lot of fun making your own clothes!
Thanks for the info!!
You're very welcome! 😁"	11cd30i	NonBinary	313	1.0	2023-02-26 10:59:00

I made a tik tok showing my clothes thought y’all might appreciate		"All clothing is gender neutral. This is just a gimmick to attract nonbinary customers.
You could be kurtis conners little bro
it's literally men's cut tshirts, what exactly makes them gender neutral other than being a piece of fabric?
Op here. This is my website :)… https://www.hadleyartandclothes.com
i'm gonna order a print from you and your cute self 🖤
it’s just t shirts too lol ofc that’s neutral

Feeling euphoric: wore a cute sundress on a zoom call (first time any of them have seen me in femme clothes) and got a few compliments! Needed that affirmation today 😊		"That is a cute dress! Love your necklace too! I'm a sucker for green stones.
You look great!
You're precious!!! You're so brave darling and you look fantastic.
Gorgeous print!!
Very pretty!
It's a lovely dress and you look absolutely wonderful.

love your style! I need that tie 🤩

Aww, thanks for the kind compliment! 😊
Ties are the best. I love wearing them and breaking gender expectations! 😌
can I ask where you got the shirt? seems like it would be a good work shirt for me!

I'm afab and have always gotten dysphoria wearing women's clothes, especially short skirts. But this weekend, I found the only skirt I will ever happily wear!		"I still have to wear shorts underneath and I'm barely comfortable wearing this skirt, but it was $5 at Goodwill (no brand logos or anything, so unfortunately I think it's homemade) and there was no way I was not buying it.
[deleted]
I love it!! and for $5, thats a great price!
Dr who 💕
I have a few whovian shirts I like.
It looks good, go off
very happy for you :)
I need one!
Yes!
That's such and awesome find! I love it! You have excellent taste.
That's absolutely amazing I love it
You could wear tights under it (leggings?)
It can fit sharks underneath, so I would say yes.

(I have a pair of shark shorts I wear underneath it because I hate the feeling of bare thighs touching)
I literally saw TARDIS anything and didn't even try it on in the store, because it was going to fit no matter what. :)
Hahaha, that is perfect! I did the same thing when I found a TARDIS t-shirt at the thrift shop, it was in my basket so fast. :)"	pani6g	NonBinary	304	0.99	2021-08-24 13:38:03
I'm super gay for vintage clothing and just snagged this 1950's Sears jacket for mega cheap and it makes me feel so euphoric!		"So cute! What a look

Went shopping yesterday, and I think I'm finally getting the hang of masc clothing! Got some outfits that I think I'd genuinely be comfortable wearing somewhere other than at home. The ✨euphoria✨ is so real right now!		"Love the first look! Very summery without going full tropical. Where do you shop?
That's spot on, mate.
Good for you :)
They look great!
you. look. amazing.
Man every time I see a new post on here my brain automatically goes ""*I spot a gay*"" 

Congrats though! Euphoria rocks
Love that shirt on you!
Target! For real I can't say enough good stuff about their clothes. I'm rarely disappointed when I shop there.
same! i’m small-framed and target’s men’s shirts fit me well. you look amazing!! 🤩

This weekend was the first time I've worn feminine clothing. It was a fantastic experience with a great friend supporting me on the way.		"Just before people comment, I'll acknowledge a few things.

While the NB Flag is present in the backdrop, this isn't my place. It's my friends place. Still closeted and the last people I want knowing about my gender is my parents. 

Yes I got a bit of a facial shadow and my arms have veins popping out. Preferably don't mention them because then dysphoria will go BRRRRR!

Sincerely
Chernyat
Cute! It suits you!
Glad you have a supportive NB friend! (Or an NB supportive friend)
Damn this outfit is hella sexy! I need it too! Where did you get it??
you look fabulous! dysphorias a bitch, you look amazing <3 /p

"Omg the euphoria im feeling after buying this cute shirt from my local thrift shops ""women's Tee's"" section just now is through the roof! Bonus because it's rather hard to find certain clothes that fit my build *does happy dance* lol 😊"		"Also that's FREAKING AWESOME
Looks amazing! I'm glad you found something that made you feel so good! 🖤🖤🖤
omg you look so COOL :00
Omg you're so good looking!
That and your mask !!!
You look great!!!! ❤️🌻
Thats so awesome, you look totally amazing, the top looks so nice on you, perfect fit,  love your hair and nails too...
TOTAL late 90s/ early 2000s vibes in that top. I dig it.
LOVE your look 🤩
Love the shirt!!!
Ty so much! :)
Ty and yeah it fit so great and feels nice too, plus I think the dragon design on it is so dope!
Awwww ty, I try, I'm decent I guess lol 💜
Oh my, ty! 😊 I suppose I'm moderately easy on the eyes lol ☺️
Lol ty, yeah Im a huge Twilight Zone/Scifi and Horror nerd, so I got that mask last year and I use to have another one, Resident Evil one but sadly cannot find it :/
Thank you, hope your having a lovely day!
Ty, I love coordinating clothes with my make up and vice versa, tend to gravitate towards purple, green and blue colors the most.
Why ty! 😁 You know that probably explains why it called out to me when I saw it, as late 90s to early 2000s was my formative preteen to teen years 💜
I like Horror and your mask had that appeal mixed with sci-fi which what caught my eye with the E=MC² but all your look is great I would love to have a shirt like yours I love these type of dragon prints !
I was born in late '96, so late 90s is the world I was born into, early 2000s was my developmental stages.

Late 90s early 2000s really impacted me in what clothing styles I like, because all the TV shows and movies I grew up on had that style, so in my young, developing brain, late 90s fashion (particularly men's/ teenage boys fashion) has been branded into my brain as the epitome of cool clothing.

When I accepted that I'm non-binary (specifically a demigirl) it made sense why I was always more drawn to 90s cool boy clothes more so than 90s hot girl clothes.
Ty! My look and daily style in general is all over the place, with the one key thing I always do is i very much love to have a style that I feel is a amalgamation of masc and fem, like i modified a skirt once along with a pair of black jeans due to being inspired by Tifa from FF7 (original and remake) and combined them into a neat little look 😊 
That dragon print screamed to me when I was looking into he women's Tees section, like you know when your just going through a selection and a article of clothing just stops you dead in your tracks? That's was my reaction to this lol. 
You can't tell in the pic, my shoulders are broad due to weight lifting so I was very pleased it fit just right , with just the right amount of stomach exposed, can't wait to wear it out on a night out 💜 especially with the summer hear at play recently! Egads! Lol
That makes sense, I was born in late 85 so that should give you even further insight to my style, taste and interests lol.

I have a fond appreciation for late 80a early 90s style and adore a lot of late 90s into early 2000s, especially early 2000s due to it being high school when I actually started having a social life 😂
I found a lot of music, games and scifi of the eras informs my fashion and certainly at a young age deep down I knew my gender wasnt like other little boys (well when Identified as just that lol as a amab Non-binary I specifically identify as BiGender with some fluidity, I basically feel like male and female mixed together, felt Bigender fit best, I thought I was Androgyne at one time but upon furth reflection Bigender better fit my idea of feeling a mix of both). I  mean looking back a lot makes sense, I was and still am a huuuuuge Jem and the Holograms fan and no little boys I grew up around cares for that or a lot of the things I liked. 

Lately I've been wanting to revisit and perhaps try bring some styles back, with how fluid I am  in how i present day to day I love taking styles both masc and feminine and making something new. It's been very freeing since coming out as I am, and I'm realizing how much my fashion now is me pooling from a lot of masc and a whole lot of feminine fashion style from your early development years 😊 

 What type of styles did you dig the most growing up? Any people in particular who informed you fashion tastes? I can think of a few for myself lol 

...I will say one thing I hope never comes back are UFO pants...ugh what was I thinking back then smfh 🤭😂
You sound like you really know what you are doing with clothes and how to fit it into your own...! That's just genius 👏👌! 
...the combination of it all is great and how you have the masculine body but then fits perfectly in feminine clothing is everything! Lucky shirt to have someone unique to wear it! 💙"	oba84g	NonBinary	285	1.0	2021-07-01 00:24:24

Have gotten a couple of compliments on my new clothes and while I'm not able to dress as femininely/androgynously as I'd like I'm starting to feel like my style actually represents me!		"Love that jumper on you. Looks perfect.
That sweater is super cute! And your facial hair actually DOES come off a little androgynous somehow, and generally you look great.
I know exactly how you feel! I always tell people I discovered my gender in the thrift store. Great place to experiment without investing too much. You look amazing btw!!
You look great!
That's a kickass sweater. Great colour & style.
It's neat.
Yay! Lookin good
This is such a good color on you, love it!!

"My therapist said I dressed inappropriate today. She claimed my bulge was obvious. I told her I wear girl's clothes so it's due to the fit. She asked me to take ""extra measures"" to hide it. I asked why girls aren't told to bind when wearing men's clothes. She said, girls don't ""flaunt"" their body."		"Your therapist is the only dick anyone needs to be ashamed of here.
Very unprofessional of your therapist. Please look into someone else, this one needs to be fired.
You need a new therapist, and make sure you tell her exactly why she’s being fired.
Get a new therapist immediately if you can. No one, especially not a therapist, should be commenting on your body that way. 

You didn’t walk into the office with your genitalia displayed for all to see. You weren’t wearing anything particularly revealing or even all that tight-fitting! And just from this picture here, I’d have to be *really* trying to see a bulge, in which case, *I’d* be the one *behaving* inappropriately by trying to see your genitals! 

This is so fucked up on so many levels. Please don’t go back to this therapist if you can help it. You need to be able to let all your guards down in therapy, while knowing you’re safe and won’t be mistreated, mocked, or belittled. She broke that trust by belittling your appearance and saying it’s *your* responsibility to hide your body so you don’t “trigger” female patients. Which is also bullshit. Anyone triggered by the sight of a bulge in someone’s jeans (not even an erection bulge, just the presence of something underneath) has bigger issues.
It's such bullshit. No one says this to masc-presenting men who wear any kind of tight bottoms that show a bulge. It's only 'inappropriate' when a fem-presenting AMAB person has a bulge. You're not flaunting it (I assume), it's just the shape of your body. Your therapist is essentially saying your body is inappropriate.

There's this common idea that any AMAB person who presents fem-leaning must be trying to be a woman and must try their best to hide any 'masculine' features. People are sooo upset that someone could look feminine but have a penis. AFAB people mixing masc and fem presentation is mostly acceptable (at least here), but if you're AMAB you have to present masculine, or fully pass as a woman, otherwise you're seen as a freak :(

Sorry this got fairly negative. I'm also a fem-leaning AMAB enby that does not tuck, and this stigma annoys me so much.
Your therapist is a tit I'm sorry you had to deal with that
Oh honey, I’m so sorry. You shouldn’t have to put up with ignorance like that—especially from your therapist! Sending all sorts of love and good vibes your way!🥰
u need a new therapist
Therapist: ah yes, I will tell you that your body is scary, there's nothing traumatic or harmful about that at all.
Storytime! A couple years ago I was seeing a new psychiatrist for depression. Out of the blue he said to me, ""I can tell you've really been depressed: I bet you never would have even bought shoes that ugly otherwise, let alone worn them."" You're outraged for me and totally understand why I fired that jerk, right? Same damned thing here.
F your therapist.
I read that you're getting a new therapist in the comments below, and I'm glad to hear that. It's disappointing that your therapist thought it was acceptable for her to comment on that. There are people that walk around all day with visible bulges and I doubt she pulls everyone she sees aside and tells them to fix their bulge. Even if you wear men's jeans you'll get bulge. That's just what the human body does.
Not to derail the point, but you look really cute in this!!
Girls don't flaunt their bodies? Shit, I didn't get the memo. I guess I have no use for my high heels and my yoga pants now 😂
Shitty therapist. Yeah, I'm not a fan of the look. Same way I don't like bows and ribbons but other people love it. Who the fuck has a right to tell other people how to dress. As long as everyone's privates are covered in public excluding nude beaches, do your thing. Get a better therapist if you can.
Girl, get yourself a new therapist ASAP. That is way beyond unprofessional and absolutely not okay for her to bring up. Especially considering you were wearing Jeans of all things. Report this to her manager too if you can.
I'd get a new therapist. That one sounds too judgemental.
Your bulge is as much a part of you as everything else, and F anyone who tells you to hide it.  


Editz: 1) what bulge, anyway?  2) I love that top
What kind of therapist is that? That's so wrong.
uuuuh, I have straight up boy clothes _from the men’s section_ that show off more than that.  Including the ones I’m wearing now. And I just left work. You need a new therapist, like, yesterday. :p
Fuck that therapist. Feeling the need to be completely smooth down there is such a pressure and it’s not easy. I will take off an outfit if my crotch sticks out to much even though my husband CONTINUES to tell me it shouldn’t matter, like should I be tucking? Is there another way to keep a bulge from showing or should we just not care?  Because I’m getting pretty close to just not caring.
Your therapist sucks, you look super cute!
Maybe she felt uncomfortable that you dress better than they do 😉
That’s completely unnecessary and transphobic. Fire your therapist and speak with the management.
Your outfit is cute AF and so is your smile! That ""therapist"" can go french a chainsaw.
You look gorgeous! Get a new therapist, if you possibly can.
This whole session sounds like a dumpster fire, and not one bit of that is on you. I can definitely understand your anxiety about filing a complaint against her (I am totally that person who never, ever files a complaint) but you should certainly be looking for a new therapist, because what she is doing here is anti-therapy.
Thats a shitty therapist
F your therapist, you look amazing and if anyone thinks they have the right to call you out for how you dress, they need to sit on a cactus 😤
Hmm. As a constant devil's advocate: do you think maybe she wanted to address a different outfit that *did* have a ""significant outline"" and was waiting for you to wear something similar, and this was the ""largest"" she's seen you in since then? Bulges do fall in the category of ""things that shouldn't be inappropriate but currently are"", like visible nipples, body hair on women, or perhaps the most comparable, a ""camel toe"". She *may* have felt it her responsibility to make sure you knew, as a social skills thing.

Now, with all that said - clearly she *hasn't* addressed it in an appropriate manner if that isn't the message you took away! Either she's trying to send a different, and possibly wrong, message, or she's failing to communicate, both of which are not great for a therapist... I'd say talk it out with her before switching because that's the ""right"" thing to do for therapy, but I didn't with any of mine that I didn't get along with, so that's a bit hypocritical lol.

Anyways, there's a lot of dumb standards for appearance out there, and we're already getting flak for breaking the gender norm ones. Might as well break all the others while we're at it.
FIND A NEW SHRINK OMFG, this is horrible to hear. Wtf is an lgbt therapist? This person is not helping you likely.
Sadly, she guilt tripped me about how I might be triggering female patients by flaunting my genitalia in the waiting room. Yet I assured her that I wasn't trying to show off anything and I was wearing ordinary blue jeans just like any girl would wear. Since she's an LGBT therapist, I thought she'd understand.
She seems to be very young, so maybe that is a factor. I guess I was more amazed about the fact that she kept trying to justify her argument, but couldn't objectively describe what I actually did wrong. Now I think I understand what women go through with continual body shaming no matter what they wear :(
Thank you so much for your understanding and support. I guess I'm afraid of filing a complaint because I'm not a vengeful person. I know what she said is very unprofessional, but how can I be certain she is in the wrong? I mean maybe I am dressing inappropriately. I don't think she should have mentioned taking ""extra measures"", but then again it's my word against hers. And the entire agency is run by women. So they could easily accuse me of refusing to take women's concerns about their personal safety seriously. I'm afraid it would be a lose-lose battle.
It really did come across like she was reaching for some excuse to be overly critical. Add to the fact, I wore this outfit in the picture above two or three sessions ago. So why did she just bring it up now? This week I had on a pink dress, which even she admitted wasn't at all revealing. She's supposed to be my therapist, so it's extremely disingenuous and dishonest for her to sit on something important like that for two or four weeks, and then suddenly bring up a problem completely out of context.
Solidarity. With how often spiro sends me to the bathroom, I gave up on tucking within a month or so of starting HRT. I've gotten a lot of flak for it, to the point I'm now reluctant to wear any bottoms thinner than jeans. It seems like attitudes are slowly changing, at least.
Thank you for your understanding and support. That really means a lot, as I always put down my guard when I go to therapy and so wasn't at all prepared for that kind of antagonizing encounter :(
Thank you! I'm just so confounded because when I got home I checked in the mirror, and I could see nothing that could be construed as flaunting. I've even worn this same outfit on numerous SFW subreddits, and nobody has ever taken issue with the fit of my jeans. Sigh.
Yeah, that was really strange coming not only from a woman, but an openly butch queer woman of all people. When I explained to her that her being worried about how I might be triggering people was kind of a double standard as she was showing no sensitivity by saying something so upsetting and hurtful to me, esp. given all the past trauma I've experienced being bullied for being feminine, her response was ""Your feelings are valid. You should go home and take time to process those feelings because they may be telling your something important."" Um, okay.
I have to wonder if she was battling her own demons or something, because she admitted to being LGBT when we first met, so maybe there is some internalized insecurities going on. I guess what bugs me is that she waited so long to bring it up, like just completely out of the blue ""So a few weeks ago you wore an outfit that...."". Who does that?
Wow, that is so insensitive. Thanks for being open to sharing what was obviously a very upsetting experience. I guess I'm just too trusting of people, so I find it hard to think that they could so something so mean. I second guess situations thinking it must be entirely my fault. I should learn to to get over blaming myself, and consider that maybe other people should be held accountable for bad things.
Yeah I admit I don't like to be angry or resentful, but my head was just spinning with so many thoughts of self-hate and self-doubt after that, esp. since she's a queer therapist. None of it adds up at all. Almost all of my of my other therapists up until now had been straight cisgender men and women, and they showed respect toward me for dressing feminine. So I don't even know how to mentally process why she would act like this.
Thanks so much for your support. To be fair, I tried to explain to her that back in 70s men wore much, much tighter jeans and shorts than I was even wearing with bulges for days. And instead of dropping the subject, she kept arguing about how she could see ""every detail"", and that is what made it inappropriate. Yet there was no every detail, I even looked at myself in the mirror as soon as I got home. I couldn't make out anything obscene. It's like she must have just been focused squarely on checking my crotch the entire session.
Thanks but I was just dressing casual for my therapy appointment.
I tried dropping hints about how on my way there, I saw numerous girls on campus wearing booty shorts with their but cheeks hanging out and nobody was telling them to put on more clothes, but her response was that we live in a society that is more accepting of women dressing that way. So apparently she accepts double standardd of society, so I need to cover up as much as possible because I was born male any hint of my natural body is shameful and disgusting.
Thanks for your honesty, I went to her mainly because I needed someone to talk to about the trauma I've experienced being being sexually harassed and molested over the years. I guess she must think that it's due to how I dress. I am definitely switching.
I know right? The only reason I decided to come in jeans (since the past few sessions I'd mostly worn skirts and dresses) is that I saw a college girl in the waiting room a few weeks in a row, and she was wearing super skintight ripped jeans. And I figured if she can get away with wearing jeans that tight and holey, then I knew my jeans would be completely appropriate by comparison. Little did I know there were totally different standards for men and women :-/
Thanks for the advice! Her argument was that since my friends, family, etc. are people that know me personally, they wouldn't have the courage to be honest with me. So she figured since she was my therapist, it would be better conducive for her to be upfront with me about what I was doing wrong :S
It means a lot to have your support, as I want to do what is best for my mental wellness. And I think that is the best option at this point. I've never had any therapist talk like that to me before, so it's probably best to change.
Thank you for your understanding and kind words!
I appreciate your insight! It helps to get different perspectives. Sometimes it's hard to know if maybe I'm overthinking things. Glad you understand.
Thank you! I always get worried if I'm being gaslighted because I had a gay boss at my last job that was extremely transphobic and he would always tell me how ugly I looked. And another gay boss would fondle me and tell me I should be arrested for dressing like a girl. So now my guard is always up and it's hard to know who I can trust when they say judgmental  things to me like this therapist did. Sigh.
you know what, after reading your other replies i change my mind. i thought it was just in passing near the end of appointment or something and you were overthinking it, but you actually *did* talk a fair amount about it, and **she sounds like a TERF**. i mean think about it

1) she's a queer woman in an all-women organization, so correct demographic for the RF part of TERF

2) admitted to having a more lenient standard for cis women

3) tries to justify that by talking about how traumatized her female clients have been by penises, as if none of her female clients have a dick and only females are ever raped and only ever raped with a dick

4) when you pointed out you are also a survivor, and that your trauma was related to your gender expression, she responded with some vague insinuation that you should go home and think it over and you'll have some kind of epiphany about... implicitly, your gender expression?

like, ""egads! i have unknowingly been a pervert man invading queer women's spaces for all these years!"" or some other disgusting TERF rhetoric she knew she'd get in trouble for actually saying out loud

it just makes sense. TERFs are obsessed with dicks. cotton ceiling and all that
Does she say the same to patients with noticable breasts? (Rethorical, we know the answer)
You don't need to file a formal complaint. Fired in this case can simply mean ending your relationship with this therapist and telling her why you no longer feel comfortable with her as your therapist
Even if you were dressed ""inappropriately"" (you absolutely were not) it is not her place to say those things at all, ESPECIALLY un asked for.



And filing a complaint wouldn't be about vengeance or ""getting back at her"" at all. It would be telling her and anyone in charge of her, in the most professional way possible that her behavior was unacceptable. It would also serve to help prevent her from doing that to anyone else. If they don't listen to you, then you ought to write an online review, because that's just even MORE misconduct, which other potention patients should be warned about.



You had the wherewithal to leave and find a new therapist, someone else may not. Someone from an abusive situation might wind up falling into unfortunate tendencies and stick with a therapist that judges their appearance and makes them feel bad about themselves.
Sometimes certain people go looking for some way to tear others down rather than facing their own insecurities and prejudices. Sigh, indeed.
These are back pocket responses, kinda like auto answers by text. She sounds very inexperienced and intern like. Her response is thoughtless and mean.
My personal big-brain theory is that messaging about genitalia being bad(especially in america) is so internalized that it makes people uneasy to deal with them in a non-sexual setting, because there's so much weird cultural stigma around them. What's even funnier is that I probably suffer from the same problem. What must be kinda surreal is being a therapist with training but not realizing how arbitrary a fear of genitalia is.
Sending you hugs, sib. TBH, as a Enby pansexual, I have gotten more hate from within the community then outside it. Hopefully your therapist was having a bad day and didn't think her words through. But if she stays by them, get you a new therapist. Therapy is supposed to be good for your mental health, not erode it. 

Sending you all the love.
That’s extremely unprofessional of her. Even if she was uncomfortable she didn’t have to react the way she did. If you were wearing the pants in the picture that you posted I personally think they look fine and wouldn’t have even said anything. So silly. 

Also, you’re very welcome.
That's dumb. I think I you look very cute and adorable. Nothing in your picture stands out as sexy or flaunting. You should have asked her why her mind went there.
You do look very happy in all of the pictures I've seen you post. And I think that looks awesome.
Ah, I see. Makes sense, and I see where she was coming from. But it's still kinda uncool of her. I hope things get better for you though! You're a beautiful human. You got this!
Of course you have my support. My Uncle comitted suicide because he was gay. I myself am gay. It's really easy for me to empathize with you.
She said that one time she explained to a patient that was wearing an athletic sports bra to an appointment that the bra wasn't fully covering her breasts. However, I'm not sure if that was even a fair comparison to my situation. Nothing was falling out of my jeans, I was fully covered :-/
Oh wow, thank you. I was getting anxious, but yes that makes a lot more sense. I've already decided to cut ties. You really have helped me a lot!
You don't need to say anything! Leave get a knew shrink. See if the local LGBT center has a recommendation. You are beautiful btw.
She was probably right, so I told her I would only come to therapy dressed in oversized jeans and oversized tee shirt so that people like her are more comfortable. It's not about me. Sometimes I have to do what other people want.
I appreciate the advice. I can only assume it was these jeans because she said it was an outfit I'd worn a few weeks ago, and I'd only worn a romper and a skirt and blouse at my last couple appointments. I really have no idea why she waited so long if it was a concern.
Thank you! I just wish she'd asked first if it's something I'm comfortable talking about instead. And why she waited so long to bring something like that up, is a mystery.
I'm deeply sorry to hear about your loss. That is an experience that nobody should have to endure. I'm sure your uncle was a wonderful person, whose life was tragically cut far too short. I just hope we can see a brighter day when nobody has to fear being alive just because they are different.
That's definitely not a fair comparison. A fair comparison would be if she told one of her clients a shirt was too tight and highlighted their breasts too much, and that they needed to bind or wear looser clothing in the office. Or, an even more fair comparison would be if she told one of her clients that their leggings made the outline of their genitals visible (a super common problem) and that they had to wear something else. Existing in jeans, one of the best-coverage clothing options out there, is not indecent.  Not tucking is not indecent. A therapist scrutinizing your crotch to check for the outline of your genitals _is_ indecent. You might not be comfortable filing a formal complaint, but you should definitely make it clear to her that her policing your genitals makes you too uncomfortable to continue seeing her.
Therapists are there to help you. If you don't feel comfortable/safe because of something they've done, providing them with concrete feedback so they don't make the same mistakes again is pretty helpful
I agree. Things have gotten better for LGBTQ though. Even Taylor Swift, Miley Cryrus, Against Me and just so many celebrities have gotten involved and have changed things for the better. My dad and I celebrate my uncle's life at PRIDE in Atlanta. He was a good guy. You seem like a good person too. Personally my current therapist is very non judgemental and I hope you can find someone like that. It just feels better that way. I hated seeing this one Jewish therapist lady who was so judgemental. Every single time I visited her I felt more worried and depressed than less because she was big into judging. I thought I had every mental disorder known to man talking to her and then I see someone else who isn't into labeling and it's so much better. I am so much less depressed and anxious. I've been there.

Feel free to PM me anytime. :)
I really wish I could find the courage to complain. It was just such an outrageous experience, esp. since she waited three to four weeks to even bring up the issue, rather than telling me at the time I wore the supposedly indecent outfit.

Not only that, but she spent the full session being engrossed about why my jeans were inappropriate and that she could see ""every detail"" of my penis. The entire reason I'm getting therapy is because I need help overcoming trauma from decades of being bullied and taunted and even raped for being gender nonconforming. And so her solution is to bring up a hyper judgmental ""concern"" (that's how she justified it) about my jeans being too tight for a therapy setting, nearly a month after the fact? It's all so mind boggling.
absolutely! I did not mean file a complain and get her fired from the agency. I meant firing her on a personal level as your therapist, and finding a new one. I added letting her know why she was being replaced as your personal therapist to let her know she was inappropriate and made you uncomfortable.
She's playing the ""I'm just concerned for you"" game. Like when assholes harass fat people for being fat because ""I'm just concerned for your health."" No, honey. You are not."	dem7wm	NonBinary	272	0.98	2019-10-07 16:56:46
can you identify as NB and still go by he/him?	"hey guys, i’m 24 yo and life happens quick. after going to therapy, I realized that I am either nb or trans. I was AMAB and honestly, i’m not sure how to come out to people. I visually still present pretty masc (mostly because of my short hair), so it feels kind of weird to go by they/them. how have other people been able to get through that experience with work and older (college and hs) friends?


EDIT: Thanks all! Honestly, this is the most accepted I've ever felt in my life, so much love to all of you <3

Edit 2: You guys gave me enough courage to actually go out and purchase femme clothing for the first time in my life!"	"yeah you can be nonbinary and go by any pronouns you like. whichever ones make you feel the most comfortable
Ugh. I'm in the same boat. I'm masc presenting nonbinary AMAB. I usually go by they/them but still feel most comfortable as he/him since I've used that most of my life and present masc.... Iunno gender presentation is so confusing. I just don't really care if people misgender me anymore, especially if they don't know me.
There are no rules here. Be who you are.
I’m a he/him AMAB enby. In the last year or so I’ve come to terms with the fact that I’ve never felt cis, wished I could click my fingers to swap between a male and female body, and having to pick from male or female never made sense to me, so non-binary is the most fitting label for me. I don’t feel like a they. I don’t leave the house femme because I don’t feel comfortable doing so.
So it’s he/him for me.
Short answer, yes
nonbinary ≠ third gender, its an amalgam of endless genders. so, yes.
ofc! i am enby and use he/him pronouns, and i swear to god it's so much easier than they/them and i can just tell people i am trans and they get it
Im enby and I go mostly by he/him. Im also ok withthey them but I like he/him the most.
idk, it feels like enby is right, but doesn’t going by he/him still enforce that binary? I don’t just want to do it for attention, but every time i’ve talked about it, that’s what it feels like
You do you, cutie patooty! I'm a transgender, genderflux, she/her only, non-binary girl. I LOVE being a girl but I fluctuate and feel agender sometimes: even during those times I prefer only she/her. I don't mind they/them, but I certainly have a fave 🩷

So yeah, if using he/him exclusively makes you happy then absolutely do it!
Same story here, I can wear fem clothes but present myself as masc and use he/him for myself as it feels most comfortable.

Think of how you would think of yourself yourself, not because you should, but just what your inner self thinks. That would be exactly your pronoun. It can even change depending on your internal feel, and that is also okay.
I identify as Agender and I usually prefer to go by he/him :)
ofc. non-binary just means you don't identify specifically with the two default genders. I'm amab and masc presenting, but that doesnt make me less non-binary
“Enby people do not owe you androgeny” and I would add to that that Enby’s do not owe anyone anything based on assumptions. Be you. Life is too short to worry about what others think of your pronoun choices or any other choice you make if it’s right for you ♥️♥️
Absolutely! Pronouns =/= gender! There are many NBs who use he/him, doesn't make them any less NB. It's all made up anyway, so we should have fun with it imo 😁💚
Absolutely! I do and using he/him pronouns was absolutely the best decision, making me feel more comfortable with my own identity!
I do
Yes yes yes! Pronouns do not equal gender!
Yea like you can be demiboy or whatever
The point is disengagement from gendering things! So being enby and using he/him degenders he/him, which is great and very highly advised. Also, you can be enby and trans, and it's up to you which of those labels feel right to you.
heck yes, your pronouns are your pronouns.
Pronouns ≠ gender. Use what you want
Congratulations on buying your first femme clothes.  Bought my first skirt a few days ago and it feels awesome lol
Yeah, you can. I identify as a man. I am a father, a nanny, and it's confusing for the kids, and I was born a man. But I'm also nonbinary. When people mistake me for a woman I don't correct them and if someone is talking to me and referring to me as a woman I go with it. Most of the time people realize real quickly they made a mistake and apologize although it's fine by me.
yes

unless you're me, i gotta treat pronouns like Pokémon
The point of Nonbinary is to say ""fuck the Binaries"" so dress however u want and use whatever pronouns u want
Definitely!! Pronouns don’t equal gender🥰
NO. You CAN’T. IF you do, I WILL know and I WILL show up at your house and I WILL stop you.
Like other commitmenters posted: Yes!

I am an AMAB He/him Nonbinary.  

At first I identified as a gender nonconfomist, and got called out by a high school buddy as he started her final steps into womanhood.  My websearches into it revealed that GNC was a subclass of the nonbinary category. 

It actually affords a bit of respect from most of the binary crowd, because only the dumbest of them can't wrap their heads around the concept of being yourself, even if it's girlier than your average tomboy.
gender expression is something that’s complicated and on a spectrum. if being non-binary and using he/him pronouns feels right to you, then it works!
yep!
You can do whatever the fuck you want
Go for it and be who/what you want x
I’m not AMAB…I’m AFAB, but I use he/they pronouns because I identify as transmasc non-binary. I prefer he/him pronouns but they/them pronouns are cool too
Yes. No limits.
You can identify with whatever you want and still go by whatever you want. They don't gotta match. Hell, They don't even gotta make sense. Labels are too help you feel comfy and give people a rough idea of how you identify. So whatever you feel comfy with
Yes, non-binary people aren't required to use any particular set of pronouns
I do!  I'm AMAB, and learning what NB was, and found it a fitting way to describe how I've actually always been.  So I didn't feel any personal need to go by different pronouns or to change name to something more neutral.  I'm also quite a low profile person and I just want to be me in my own way without attracting extra attention or potential hostility.  Almost another topic, but I like being seen as male with my respect to my non-traditional parenting role - I'm not the breadwinner, do most of the childcare, the cooking and cleaning, and gossip with the mums outside school.
You can use whichever pronouns you like, regardless of how you look or present. Or no pronouns! Do what makes you feel best.
Of course, I'm non binary and go by he/him and she/her
Any pronouns are allowed for anybody who wants to use em. Personally Iidentify as transfem genderfluid nknbinary and use she/they pronouns even though I am mostly masc presenting (due to being in 30's and not on hormones, and also cuz I like having a beard).
Yes I’m agender and use they/she so why the fuck not
Well in my opinion it’s non-binary AND trans, they’re not really separate. One of the goals of finding your gender is to feel comfortable with yourself, so if he/him is comfortable, there’s no reason for you not to use them. In my experience, unless you’re already working in an LGBT+ space or with other trans people, getting people to use new or they/them pronouns is tough. Especially with older folk who don’t “get” it. The best you could do is tell them and remind them.
If you want you can go by he/they, so you’re cool with either one
I’m a teacher in a very conservative neighborhood. I’m gender fluid and would be seriously afraid for my job and well being if I came out, so I’m AFAB and still go by she/her. Some days it doesn’t bother me, and other days it really does— it all depends on which end of the gender spectrum I’m feeling on any given day. Making someone choose certain pronouns just to “prove” that they are nonbinary is totally wrong and not at all what this community is about. Do what works for you and what makes you feel the most comfortable and/or authentic
Yes
Yeah ofc :D
Pronouns≠gender
So yes you can go by he/him and be Non-binary xx
Yeah!! I’m nonbinary & use only she/her!! <33
Yes! You can use any pronouns you like and be nonbinary. That confused me at first too when I figured out I am nonbinary because I thought nonbinary meant androgynous, but really it's just someone who doesn't 100% identify with being a man or a woman (and it's different from intersex).
You can do whatever you want personally I go by any pronouns if you wanna go by he then knock yourself out
Of course!

Fem clothes are cool and pretty so I am happy that you got confidence from these nice people. :)
just asked my mom she said yeah it's cool but she does want you to give me back my DSi tho sorry dude I hope you finished that playthrough of pokemon mystery dungeon if you didn't I'll see if I can lend it to you another time :/
Nate Stevenson, the creator of She-Ra and the Process of Power is nobody and uses he/him pronouns.
Yeah, Do what makes you feel mentally happy. There really shouldn’t be any gatekeeping about your identity. Because it’s a personal decisions for yourself
It can be difficult to tell people how you want them to refer to you and it can make you feel vulnerable, whether because it's the public and people can be awful or even with people you trust and are confident will be cool about it. Do what you need to do and know that you are who you are regardless of what pronouns you use in any given circumstance.

For my part, I'm AMAB and go by they/them. I still generally present the same way I did before coming out. Granted, my personal style is basically long hair, hoodies, and corduroy which isn't really gender specific, but I also still have a beard because my face *hates* being shaved so most people make gender assumptions. Sometimes it's still just enough safer or easier to go by he/him that I don't say anything and let it happen. I do what I need to do and I know that I am who I am regardless of what pronouns people use in any given circumstance.
I'm nonbinary (genderfluid if we want to get into specifics) and my pronouns change based on my environment and overall how I feel that day! Do what feels true to you and don't be afraid to try on new pronouns if you feel comfortable and safe doing so.
What pronouns feel good to you? That's literally all that matters. Your identity is what you make it. I'm wicked femme a good part of the time but still genderqueer and they/them regardless.
absolutely yes!!
I'm afab and femme presenting, so I definitely get struggling to feel valid in your gender. 

You don't have to look or act a certain way, use certain pronouns, or anything else in order to be non-binary. There are no rules at all! 

We will accept you no matter what. 

Best of luck on your gender journey ❤️
Pronouns do not define gender so yeah of course you can!
thanks! this whole experience is brand new to me and i’m feeling so lost rn
Another enby here who typically presents like their AGAB. 

It can be really hard to change up gender presentation, especially after a few decades of existing. I’m very comfortable experimenting in private spaces, but public…. well, it feels vulnerable, particularly when living in an area that explicitly rejects queer people all together.
Same for me as nonbinary AFAB. I love it when people call me they, but I don't mind going by she. It's just easier than explaining my gender to strangers and I am used to being called she.
I’m the exact same down to the very word, just switch the AGAB (& the pronouns/presentation along with it) & I don’t use they/them at all. She/her makes me feel comfortable, I don’t see the need to change it just because I don’t feel like any existing gender.
""There are no rules man, *we're lost*""
he/him enby here, and i personally dont like they/them being used on me - but pronouns don’t dictate your gender at all (think of all the drag queens that call each other she/her) so theres no right or wrong way to use the pronouns you like!
Nah you do what you feel most comfortable with. It's not for attention you're just following how you feel about your own identity. That's no one else's business.
The only thing that “enforces the binary” is defining yourself according to stereotypes. This is not an ideology, it’s who you are. Use what feels right
The only person who gets to say what your pronouns are is you. If being referred to as he/him is what makes you comfortable, there's nothing wrong with that; it doesn't make you any less nonbinary.
I've always considered all the typical gender identifiers like pronouns as sex identifiers. They/them pronouns are meaningless to me, and neopronouns are downright offensive to me. It definitely makes me feel... fake, in enby spaces. But it's about how you feel.
you actually just made me blush a little. Thank you!
and that's completely okay! I've identified as nonbinary for over 2 years and even I'm confused and lost sometimes, so trust me it's all good!
😊 Awe, of course!
Yep, amab currently referring to myself as trans nonbinary (still figuring out where exactly I feel I am) because it's easiest for other people. No pronoun preference, use whatever you feel comfortable with as long as it is respectful."	11un3gb	NonBinary	267	0.99	2023-03-18 12:26:21
I was asked to model for my friend's gender role destroying clothing company		"Amazing. Would effing wear these clothes.
So pretty/handsome. Who makes them and do they make amab “big and tall“ equivalent sized clothes for us big fluids?
Wow you look stunning!
I'd be 100% fine with a shameless plug here. What's the company?
YOUR HAIR!!!! <3 <3 <3
You are breathtaking! I can see why they wanted you to model
Hell yeah! Just read the front page on their website, and I've never wanted to support a company more. I hate how flimsy and disposable most clothes are now.
I know we're supposed to be looking at the clothes here, but I love your hair!!
i've mentioned the company in a comment below :)
they thrift, adjust, and resell

i don't think they've gone for the big and talks yet

i'll mention it and see if they can do it :)
thanks! :)

Went shopping for makeup and clothes with my partner and found a few things. Had so much fun and am really feeling myself in this look.		"Gorgeous! The colors are very complimentary 💅🏽
You look so fabulous, you really nailed it! Very pretty pics. 💕

Also, are your eyes green or grey?? They look a lot like mine, which are grey but can look green or blue depending on what I'm wearing, so I was wondering if we're twinning at all! Either way, they're gorgeous.
Makes me so happy and validated to see other bearded NB’s.
Outfit looks awesome! Especially with the pink offset tele!
Awesome look, and nice guitar! ✨
Glad you had so much fun! You look amazing!
Wow, I’m so jelly of that top!! You’re striking!
My word you look so cute 🥰
aww ty! Excited to try more and see what works on me 💜
aww thank you 💜!! Tried some new hair stuff today - growing out my undercut is the worst, actually. Would be feeling so much better with my hair longer and more style-able.

They are grey!!! Yesterday they were appearing very green, but they definitely change a lot. You are so sweet and I appreciate the compliment :D
Beard solidarity! 

I did have my barber bring it down this close - I've worn it long for years now and really needed a change. Idk that I'll do a clean shave, I do like the beard just don't want to hide behind it either.
thank you!! I loooove that guitar - just got a tortoise shell pickguard for it - it is gonna be true perfection then.
Feeling so incredibly good when I can dress how I feel. Thank you for the kind words!
awwww ty so much! You are so kind 💕
I am too! I’m feeling like this is just the beginning of some beautiful experiments. Glittery facial hair, bright bold eye…it’s gonna pop! And the colors in the top highlight your eyes and allow the lip color to shine. Spring has sprung 🌸
That’s where I got with it. I trim down close. I like the way it makes my face look. Who said I have to be clean shaved to be NB? I wax my arms and legs, have fabulous nails and a beard. Wear what  I want. I feel prettier in the beard.
I have a CV Jazzmaster in that color with the tort pickguard. Love it!!!!
You are SO sweet. I will remember you hyping me up when I'm feeling blahh. Feeling very much like I'm in a spring cycle of growth and new life, appreciate you so much and I will certainly share more soon!
💜  I like and want to feel pretty too, and I do love the shape the beard gives my face. I'm envious of the nails, I simply cannot with the type of work I do. I'm going to get them done for a music festival coming up soon, since I'll be off for like 5 days or so and cannot wait for that.
I ended up getting a short scale bass in shell pink shortly after this Tele hybrid. One of my favorite guitar colors for sure glad to see multiple brands embracing it 💗
That's so cool! What kind of music do you play? Is there anywhere we can listen?"	tvc6fr	NonBinary	266	1.0	2022-04-03 15:44:17
Same makeup and hair, but with femme clothes and masc clothes! I've realized I basically just want to dress like a librarian, but I feel cute both ways!		"very cute 😽 love it ... honestly i couldn't tell if those are masc clothes
Love both looks!
Fabulous fits! And I love that accent necklace, you look lovely!
Looking great as usual!
You look hella good in both so wear whatever your lil librarian heart desires
You look so great in both pictures, I really like the necklace and your hair! 🖤
Ahaha thanks! That's the suit I wear to weddings and stuff, not sure what came over me, usually I hate masc clothes when I'm feeling more fem, but I put it on and felt great!
Thank you 🥰
Did you notice those star earrings with the necklace? *chef's kiss
Thank you as always 🥰🥰🥰
Thanks!!
Thank you!! 🥰 This is my favorite wig, wish my actual hair could do basically any of that 😅
Yeah, I feel like the second one is femme with strong masc undertones, lol.
awee💞 same here, yesterday i bought a trucker jacket at the mall, i liked the way it looked even though i really dont want to dress masc anymore lol i guess i would wear some makeup with it hehe🤭😹 and a necklace too if i find one that i like
💙
Ahaha yeah that's fair 😅 I think I was just in a very fem mood but wanted a touch of masc.

I shopped in the women's section today for the first time since I realized I was non-binary. I thought I'd never feel good in girl clothes again... I was wrong, but I ain't mad. :)		"Nice! I'm not that courageous yet, but I'm getting closer. I need to try and figure out what size I'd be...
You look great! 😊
Wear all the clothes!
Same! Its confusing but after accepting im NB I stopped caring about presenting masc/butch all the time and just wear whatever now... I even enjoy the womens thrift section now (which is so much more extensive)

Keep being you 😎🤙
You can do it! Look up some size charts in a brand you're interested maybe? Or just do what I did and wing it a bit haha! Took a little bit for me to figure out what was gonna fit me and how (and I'm still not great at it haha). Let's just say the people at the returns desk know me well.
Thank you 😊
All of them!!!
Thank you!! It's funny isn't it, how it comes full circle like that sometimes? I had to first outright reject femininity to realize that no, I actually am feminine in some ways and I can feel good about expressing it in my own way. Clothes have stopped being about trying to make myself fit into a box and now they're just a way I express myself and make myself feel good :)"	n5xcpy	NonBinary	259	1.0	2021-05-06 02:43:47

I wore a dress to an interview and it's the first time I don't feel dysphoric in feminine clothes since I came out a year ago		"I figured out as I don't really pass as male yet and have no legal name change I'd have to out myself pretty soon in the process anyway, might as well go full femme and I'm happy I was able to pull it off without feeling bad!
Really looking forward for this to happen to me. I legit cannot use half my clothes without feeling like I'm faking my entire existence. I'm really happy for you! And you look great!
You look so pretty! Really love the color of the dress. Hope you get the job!
Absolutely gorgeous
You look great! I love your outfit 😍
I am very proud of you, you look lovely. :)
I really want to pass as a boy wearing dresses but I'm not there yet.

However coming out as trans means I've been socially presenting as masc to be ""respected"" in my identity by my cis relatives. Being somewhere else and presenting as a woman has the advantage of no gender presentation pressure.
Thanks! I hot this dress second hand because it was so pretty, and bought it in a moment there was no way I was comfortable wearing feminine cothes. I'm glad I got it now! It's just missing pockets :(
Thank you! :)
Yea feminine peeps will always struggle with pockets. Honestly, one of the reasons why I wanna try to buy male clothes cause their jeans have pockets for days! And all of the different colors.
When I got my first pair of mens pants I was like whoaaa infinite pockets and now I get all my stuff lost in them 😂

However I've never had much luck in cool colour and patterns in the men's section, kinda why I'm not minding keeping women's clothes.
I can understand that. 

I'll just look forward to not having to carry around a purse or bag all the time. Sure would love that. 

Don't think I can ever bring myself to wear dresses or skirts again though. My mom forced me in high school for the prom/homecoming and my orchestra finale. Ugh
I'm a backpack person, I always have a water bottle, my notebook, my camera, a book, food, and/or more random things with me, and even in men's pockets they wouldn't fit."	nmyiqq	NonBinary	255	1.0	2021-05-28 14:02:57
First photos with no makeup! Super nervous, can you tell? Excuse the mess, new clothes excitement.		"That’s no makeup?! You are blessed child!
:0 that hairstyle really suits you!
Omg, you have such good skin with such even skin tone, I am so envious you look more made-up with no makeup than I do with some.
You have amazing cheekbones!
OMG please tell me where you got that skirt i need it!!
Seriously....model material you are, so beautiful!!
You look gorgeous love! 😘😍
I would certainly kiss you!

I wish the NB community would move away from the constant 'masc' 'femme' and 'androgynous' descriptors	"It just feels like Binary Gender 2.0/Gender Binary Lite™. 

Let me tell you that when I found the descriptor ""virid"" (a ""neutral"" gender expression, NOT the same as andro, which is a mix of femme and masc. I'm talking totally unrelated to the gender binary. Think virid as green vs femme pink, masc blue, andro purple.) it totally and completely changed my perspective on gender expression. 

We're taught that dresses and long hair = women/feminine and pants and short hair = men/masculine. What I keep seeing is essentially NB people doing the opposite of what they were told to do for their AGAB in defiance of the gender binary in order to ""look"" nonbinary (can we talk about the concept of ""looking nonbinary""? What does that even mean? It shouldn't be a thing imo just as women and men should have more room for their respective genders). Which, I think a lot of the time can just replicate and reinforce traditional gender roles because we keep saying makeup is femme and short hair is masc. 

People are constantly asking on here ""Do I look androgynous"" ""Do I look nonbinary"" ""I feel like I'm not nonbinary enough"" ""Can nonbinary people do x"" etc. And I think this points to a lot of the confusion that especially questioning people have when they start exploring NB identity. AFAB people feel this pressure to cut off their long hair and get a pixie and AMAB people feel this pressure to wear makeup or grow out their hair or wear skirts, because ""That's what NB people do"".

And these are AWESOME things to do if you genuinely find joy in this! Gender euphoria is always an amazing thing to experience and everyone's idea of what they want to be, look like and feel is different. I know a lot of nonbinary people genuinely enjoy using masc/femme/Andro as descriptors or goals for themselves because it's what they like! And it's how they feel.

But I also think having this ONE, ubiquitous way of describing our looks with no alternatives is harmful sometimes-- I know it was for me, as an AFAB individual I ended up using my NB identity to justify my internalized sexism and thought I was ""basic"" and ""just a woman"" if I had long hair, so I cut mine off and held myself to these really unfair standards for years until I finally figured out what I ACTUALLY wanted to look like and not what I thought I should look like in order to be NB. Now I rock long hair because I just genuinely like it, and saw plenty of men and nonbinary people with long hair and different gender expressions rocking it too, and wear whatever the fuck I want, and I'm still NB.

Anyway, I like terms like virid, the Galactian gender system, and even the sexualities made specifically for NB people (trixic, toric, tiric) which help get rid of the ""do I call myself straight/gay/bi/etc."" issue. I think they help move away from the very binary-centered interpretation of physical appearance and internal feeling. The Galactian system can also sometimes feel like binary 2.0 in a way but at least it attempts to find new language and create new perspectives and interpretations on things we traditionally associate with binary genders. 

I'm a neutrois/agender person; wearing a dress and heels doesn't make me ""femme"" and wearing ripped up jeans, converse and a hoodie doesn't make me 'masc', because I'm not femme or masc-- I'm just a neutrois person wearing clothing that I like. 

I think this can be a difficult avenue to explore because almost all clothing and beauty practices in the world currently have historically been crafted and consumed within the context of men vs women, and even ""gender neutral"" clothing (in the west, usually mean's 'mens clothing'...) isn't necessarily without its associations. And I also understand that there's still use for using these terms for beauty practices we do bc we are still interpreted in a binary way by binary people and that affects our lives in similar ways according to what binary side you might be associated with.

Even when I say I'm looking positively virid to others that might just be, in their minds, masc or femme and they might not know what I mean when I say that because it could mean anything in this case. But I think using alternative language for people who want to do so would be a step in the right direction to give people even more freedom to look or feel how they want.

I look forward to the ways the NB community can continue to break norms and not just in the ""do the opposite of what I've been told to do thereby reinforcing the original system"" but ACTUALLY bringing in new perspectives and crafting new areas of aesthetics that can broaden the aesthetic world into places we've never been before.

Sorry if this came off as ""old man shakes fist at cloud + doesn't offer many solutions"" but I just wanted to vent and see what other people thought. I've just felt a bit alienated particularly from the nonbinary community as of late. Thanks for reading this far!

Edit: I think people are repeatedly misinterpreting my post as saying ""We should abolish the use of femme/andro/masc completely"". That's not what I'm saying. My point is that I wish it weren't the overwhelming majority of the language used in NB spaces at the expense of potential conversations about alternative language for NBs who don't identify with the binary at all."	"I get what you mean, often people (even within the community) talk about nb people as basically two quasi-binary genders where one is ""FTM lite"" and the other is ""MTF lite"". There should definitely be space to make up your own signifiers that aren't based on masc or femme at all.
I do agree with you and I wish it would be a realistic possibility. For me there's more to it though. I'm afab non binary and everywhere I go, I get constantly called ""she"". I fucking hate it. Aside from the fact that my native language doesn't have any neutral pronouns, the only thing that helps me a little in social spaces, is to present myself as masc as possible. Might change after I transioned, might not. What I'm getting at is, that the world we live in, is dominated by the binary system. I don't want to perceived as a girl. Although I'm not a boy, it feels better for me, if people think I'm a boy. Ideally they would respect and recognise me as non binary, but that's not gonna happen with strangers. I think some might feel similar. In order to be perceived in a way that doesn't cause gender dysphoria, I and maybe also other comply to the binary system in our own way.
I dunno like I get what you're saying and agree to the extent that we obviously need to have better vocabulary. But also, I don't think that non-binary means totally unrelated to masc and fem. There's a continuum between the two and it's still useful to use these terms to describe our position along that axis even if it isn't at the binary endpoints.
>I look forward to the ways the NB community can continue to break norms and not just in the ""do the opposite of what I've been told to do thereby reinforcing the original system"" but ACTUALLY bringing in new perspectives and crafting new areas of aesthetics that can broaden the aesthetic world into places we've never been before.

The only way to do this is to design your own clothes and define your own style. Submit designs to actual lgbtq+ positive fashion companies. Start an Instagram or hash tag. Spread designs and spread the word that this is an untapped market and people will try. Sometimes when there isn't something out there you just have to go for it and be open to criticism but still know not everything will suit everyone's style. I'm also agender/neutrois and have been trying to form my own style that completely envelopes me in euphoria. It's slow and will take some time, especially since I have a few medical transition goals. 

I understand it can be a nightmare to sew or tackle things like this but it's SO worth it. What I did to start was make a hidden pinterest board of all the things that gave me euphoria, makeup, clothes, styles, mood boards, bedrooms, anything. Even if it was ""close"" but not perfect I threw it on there. Then I started trying to play with those things in my own style and see what actually felt right on me. If I try something out and end up hating it, I take it off the board. If I try something and it's close, I alter it until I like it. Im not the greatest seamstr/ess so I have my limits currently, though I plan to keep pushing into this and will hopefully come up with some decent designs that others can adapt for themselves.

Final thoughts: It's uncharted territory, which can be both exciting and intimidating. I personally am thrilled to see what kind of stuff we can come up with if we really try!
I really feel this! Even though im comfortable using femme/masc/andro to describe my expression or gender, sometimes it just doesnt feel like it enough or that its quite accurate, and i also have found myself projecting those labels onto others in my mind. I try hard to separate the concepts of gender expression as a trans/queer person from what society has taught me, but i definitely still find myself thinking in a very binary or binary 2.0 way. I really appreciate your post on this, i dont have many thoughts myself to offer but its definitely making me think some and i feel the need to look into virid and other terms of expression that dont rely on the binary system as a comparison. Thanks! :)
I don’t mind using words like femme, masc or andro when talking about exploring your gender presentation because is simply easier when you talk about something so abstract, to me it wouldn’t be useful to get rid of those words. My main issue is how people use or perceive certain terms, I still believe that something being masculine or feminine is extremely subjective. Most stuff traditionally associated with femininity can’t be seen as neutral by most people and that bothers me a lot, to me my gender presentation is androgynous because that’s how I choose to see myself. Ugh, I feel like I’m over the place trying to explain what I want to say, but like you said, I wish people move on from the idea that non-binary is a third gender with more stupid norms. I just want to chill out in a field full of flowers with my titties out and stop seeing posts policing how being non-binary should look like.
I understand your perspective, but don’t personally 100% agree. I think it’s valid to prefer the non “masc/femme” gender language, but that is not going to be every non binary persons experience. I think you see a lot of NB people talking about gender and gender expression using more “traditional” language because many non-binary people do not identify as completely separate from those terms. It’s valid to identify as non-binary and identify with terms like “masculine and feminine” to different extents or not at all.

Just because your personal experience as a non-binary person is more toward neutrois doesn’t mean that other people have that same experience, and that’s going to be reflected in the language this community uses. I understand your feelings, but this does feel like a perspective that does not take into account a good chunk of the non-binary community’s experiences. 

Tldr: I think it’s valid to prefer agender/gender neutral language, but also important to recognize that not all non-binary people identify as completely separate from masculinity/femininity/gendered language.
I think we need to stop asking what we need to be non binary and start saying “this is me and I’m non binary”
like what would mtf have to be femme or ftm masc? what if they like dressing not taht way but are transitioning? Like is osmoene femme masc if they alternate styles?
It would be great to have words for all kinds of gender expressions! I'm personally femme and feel quite connected to that word and don't feel like to me it's ""woman enby"" implying, but completely understand how others don't like terms like masc and femme and andro for themselves. 
For me, it's all about how we tend to view femme VS masc on a sliding scale rather than pinpoints on a constellation of different gender expressions. That's no different than the male VS female binary. 
Femme is more than 'cis people think you're a woman or want to be a woman' so I try not to let cis people change how I see myself. We are infinite 😊
For me personally masculine and feminine are just descriptive words to what we can see, just as tall, petite, etc
These words are not related to gender but they exist which makes it easy to use. I know we need new words but it's hard to just implement them into language because it's not how language works.
We can push them, but if they are actually used in the future is another thing. 
I think it would be easier to get rid of the connection between masculine/feminine and man/woman than to invent new words that only the lgbt community knows about. Because in the end we are part of society and this is how society works.
Atleast that's how i see it.

We just need to teach the world that nothing that exist is binary and that everything that can't be put into boxes.
While I did cut my hair short it's because I wanted to. I got it before I realized I was non-binary and fell in love with the short hair, it was also a way of dealing with trauma, and decided to keep it that way. I do use the terms because I'm comfortable with it for myself. I appear extremely girly but I am fine with that I wear what I want. I just wear whatever I'm comfortable with that day. Some days I don't want to wear a dress and some days I do. I am just being who I am without holding back.
I agree with most of this but masc and fem is useful for a lot of people. Like I'm ftm as in f to masc. I'm nb but lean heavily towards male. For people who do lean towards the binary they are useful but yeah having better words for certain situations would be better
My gender is: tired and just trying to be true to myself as much as possible. 👍
I'm me. Non-binary, dress how I please but the NB is how I feel inside. It fits how I feel like a glove. I don't like pigeonholes and too many descriptors confuse me.  Does it really validate how you feel about yourself to squeeze into very tiny multiple pigeonholes? Probably, for some people who haven't found quite where they fit but for me, NB is awesome and nothing more is needed.  It covers a very broad spectrum!

For me, it's how I feel inside that is more important that the clothes I wear.
yeah, I’ve always been green ;) i don’t try to explain it to people if they don’t want to know — far too great a leap for most people, unfortunately 👽
To u/washa30786 , I can see your comment in my emails but for the life of me cannot find it to reply to on this post lol maybe it's a mobile issue. So I'm replying this way. Hopefully it's actually on here and it's just a me problem! 

I would disagree that nonbinary exists because of the binary, at least not in its entirety. I think for us westerners here and most of the English speaking nonbinary community, that IS the case because the binary has been part of European cultures for a long time, but historically there have been cultures with ""nonbinary"", third gender or otherwise, in our definition, gender non conforming genders, and these are good examples of genders that come from a different perspective and are a different ""flavor"" than many western NB identities that emerged recently because the gender binary wasn't necessarily as much of a thing for them. Even people from other countries like Japan or Spain (random countries off the top of my head that I know have NB communities) might now have different terms or feelings about NB simply due to language difference. So, not every NB identity might have necessarily been precluded by a binary. Nowadays, many have though.

Yeah, as other people have made me realize, I am neglecting a bit the NB who genuinely need these descriptors because it DOES fit them. 

Haha, yeah I totally agree with you on the absolute finickyness and subjectivity of using gendered descriptors only for people to disagree and interpret differently. I think this is just something that each person will have to decide how they want to handle these-- it's kind of the same as how a trans woman might feel like a woman, in her eyes look like a woman, BE a woman, but a transphobic cis man would disagree because his interpretation doesn't match. Doesn't mean saying she's a woman isn't accurate or isn't useful. People will interpret how they want but it's up to YOU to decide how you want to navigate the world. 

I think you posting a selfie but making your gender identity clear would only backfire simply BECAUSE people have these associations for what femme and masc might mean even in the NB community, tho tbh people who post on the NB subreddit and don't """"""""do the NB costuming"""""""" ie don't go out of their way to dress against what society might like of them, they're still accepted warmly and gendered correctly (ex, ""Even tho I'm femme I'm still a them""), tho how each person might see them inside silently might be very individual. I actually think making your identity clear can give a nice cue for others to determine what compliments or gendered language to use for you, such as the determinations you used just when reading my post.

And this is where I think whether or not to keep your identity to yourself is a personal thing. For me personally, I just don't talk about it unless asked 90% of the time in public. Drs appts, grocery store, job, etc. My gender is beyond them, so to speak lol. If someone outright says ""You're a girl"" due to a line of convo or something, I will at that point correct them because it's just wrong. Pronouns are less of a deal for unimportant strangers who dont know my pronouns tho bc like... Who has the energy. Lmao. Only people I work with who I think would be supportive, and close friends and family. 

Thanks for commenting, I like talking about this kind of thing! Lol
I see you. I personally get stuck in a weird place, and I think a lot of other people do to, of things I do because I want to and things I do out of dysphoria. No most people aren’t going to understand my gender and treat me appropriately- but that hurts me so if I try I can atleast make it so I am treated like my agab less often. I think too I have different sets of language- for cis ppl I’m just meeting, for binary trans people, for other non-binary people- I describe myself in different ways and they are all true but they all serve to describe myself to the listener. I don’t need to describe myself to me- I just am, and using words to myself doesn’t make me see myself more clearly.

Idk- so I’m non-binary, asexual, biromantic (attracted to two or more genders) and transmasc. But I’m mostly a lot of things words don’t capture. I look pretty neutral, some people could see me as masc or androgynous- but I just want to look and feel neutral. 🤷
Could you expand on the Galactian system? I found a description online, but it seems basically the same as the normal gender binary, except that 'female' is named for the moon and 'male' named for the sun (maybe its just the specific Wikis I found?). Is virid similar?
I appreciate this post. First of all, I learned some new words. That's always a blessing. Second, I feel like I'm always trying to justify to people that I'm nonbinary because they consider my presentation femme and I am AFAB. I don't feel things considered generally femme have to be considered that forever in society. I'm more comfortable in tighter clothing. I like makeup because it makes it so you can see my eyebrows and eyelashes because I'm blonde not because it makes me look for feminine. There just doesn't always seem to be room for me in this community based on the things you pointed out in your post, but I'm hopeful when I see posts from people like me. It helps to see everyone from every corner of the community. Third, I don't think gender is a spectrum from femme to masc because we don't have to be limited to think of gender just in terms of those things. What about intersex people? They're not broken versions of the other genders - they can be a gender in themselves and that is more how I feel and what I want to emulate in my behavior (less my appearance and more in the ways I interact with the world like my personality). Does that make sense? Loved the post once again, thank you for the learning.
omg thank you for this, I always wear clothes I like and I'm confortable in and I'm tired to hear people say I dress like a woman just because I wear a skirt, I feel amazing in my skirt doesn't mean I'm feminine and not non binary anymore, I didnt leave to binary box to be put in another box!
I absolutely love your thoughts on this! I think I feel similarly to you in regards to having distinct language for my experience that doesn't center binary understandings of expression. Like i just want to express myself and explore expressions that I was not allowed to experience due to the restrictive norms imposed upon me at birth. I think its perfectly valid to articulate your experience using the 'traditional' ways of describing expression (masc, femme, andro) and still recognize your own connection as being distinct from the nominal association to them. Just like if a nonbinary person uses binary pronouns it doesn't mean that they carry the conventional association to these things. I personally believe that someone can completely not relate to the binary and still use the 'traditional' language to describe expression but I do think it's also important to expand our understanding and allow people to have a more intentional and potentially accurate way of reflecting their expressions and identity. 

It's things like this that give me hope and remind me of how much beauty there is in finding intentional ways to reflect your being. I love this community ❤️
My pet peeve is that the community has taken up saying andro as short for androgynous when it means man because the word is a mashup of the binary. Really gets my goat.

You’re far from alone, I generally abhor pinning myself and others down on some gradient of man to woman. But some nonbinary people aren’t as distant from the binary as others. And there’s no hierarchy of “whose experience is more right?” There are a massive amount of nonbinary people for whom these labels do provide useful description of their goals and desires.

It can feel awkward when that’s not you, and confirmation bias + the nature of Reddit provides you with ammo to feel drowned in this terminology, but other people using these words doesn’t say anything about you and what you ‘should’ want, because nonbinary is defined by what it’s not, and you can be incredibly different from 5 other nonbinary folks in the same room. Most nonbinary people understand not to push masc/fem/androgynous labels and descriptors onto others, or they do after a quick discussion of why not to.

There’s another thing at play here, and that’s the bias of this sub towards people at the very beginning of their journey. When I was first figuring this shit out I had “girl days” and “boy days” because I didn’t know how to be my neither self yet. When first expanding past the binary, most people still need it as guardrails and guideposts to begin flexing outside their norm and find what’s better.
This is an interesting discussion because, as I understand it, the very reason why non-binary exists is *because* of the binary. The very reason why I identify as enby is *because* I feel like a mix of boy and girl. For example, if I had to do a somewhat mathematical proof of my gender to someone, I could not do so without using ""feeling like a boy"" and ""feeling like a girl"" or derivatives of those concepts. These are the basic building blocks on which my gender identity is built. And that *is* stupid in a sense, because the very concepts of ""feeling like a boy"" or ""feeling like a girl"" are themelves built upon the very stereotypes I would like to see destroyed in the first place. The problem is that, at least right now, I do need them. It *does* make sense to me to see at least some of my clothes as ""girl clothes"" and others as more boyish or neutral. Similarly, I would assume the very reason why you identify as neutrois is *because* you *don't* feel either like a boy or a girl. The very reason why we are here is because we had to formulate our gender identity in terms of the binary, because this is how we've been raised. You settled for ""neither"" while I settled for ""both"". The fact that it bothers you that people might think of you using gendered terms seems to me like just another pointer towards the fact that you identify with a neutral gender so it makes sense for you to somewhat ""reject"" those terms altogether. That being said, they definitely are useful in my opinion, especially for new enby who still need to refer to the binary because this is all new to them and the binary is the only way they know to perceive the world, at least for now.

That being said, there is something very alluring in being able to talk about gender and gender expression without having to refer to the original binary terms. Being able to say something that basically means ""I'm cute like a girl™"" but without ever using a truly gendered term. I think that would be freeing to some extent, but obviously you would lose the ability to talk with people who are unaware of those new words. I mean, you could always revert to the gendered version but that kind of defeats the purpose.

Actually, what I've seen being done here a lot, and I really like it, is saying things like ""I feel very gender"". To be honest I don't know what that means for sure, but I interpreted as ""I don't really know where I stand on the gender spectrum and I don't care, this style suits me and I feel happy"" and I *love* this approach. I prefer it to the galactian system or any other new words system because, ultimately, gender perception is not universal. For example, some things that I see as ""girly"" or let's say ""female-leaning"", or ""lunarian"", my wife would disagree and say that for her those things are perfectly neutral. Or, the opposite, I do have some clothes that are litteraly labeled as ""men"" that my wife considers to be ""female-leaning"". So this would be a more interesting approach in my opinion: just forgo those concepts altogether. It doesn't help that much to label yourself as ""femme"" or ""lunarian"" or whatever, because people will interpret your gender using their *own* prism anyway. If you say ""I'm lunarian"" and people don't see enough ""lunarianeness"" in your gender expression then it could quickly evolve in an awkward situation, while actually it shouldn't even matter. We are all valid as it is, no matter what label we use, so basically the label serves no purpose outside of our own mind. Therefore, I'd suggest maybe to keep the label to yourself ? For example, if I was to post a selfie of myself right now, while I feel like I'm mixing both feminine and masculine clothings, I'm sure most people would also see a guy with a skinny jean. So basically the label would not help anything and could only backfire in this particular case. I don't think this community would blame anyone for not really physically matching the label we put on ourselves but the point is that the label is useless outside of our own mind. We're all very gender anyway and it's awesome.
We have similar feelings. I want to create a mind eraser where we would forget all of the social programming that has been jammed inside of us and start from neutral. Have it where regardless of anything (e.g., AGAB, the way society thinks you look or should act/dress) you have access and ability to do whatever you want with your body as it seems fit and right to you. I would love if a piece of clothing was just that - clothing. Something you put on your body that doesn’t have a gender. Because why the fuck did clothing become gender?! 

I can understand why some others in this subreddit want to go the opposite of their AGAB because they are also feeling external pressure, as well as internal, to fit what society still expects of them. It’s hard to push off doubts when you are presenting close to your AGAB and are constantly being misgendered and thus experiencing gender dysphoria. Sometimes extremes might seem like the only choice. Who knows. I just try to respect their decisions and know it’s not mine and that’s fine. I will continue to work in my way, in my space for now and maybe leading by example (e.g., confidence in who I am regardless of what society wants me to be based on what I wear) will help someone who is struggling.
And that's why I'm transneutral and neutrois!
Everything is just another binary system to shove us into. People can't help but think in terms of binary systems. Male/female masc/femme. Even binary/non-binary is a damned binary system. It's one easy way for humans to categorize things. We won't escape it until we can release our need for labels & categories. There will always be boxes to be shoved into and labels and people who don't fit them and make new ones and then someone else doesn't fit those and makes their own. So why don't we just stop? Idk. Why think of gender as pink, blue, purple, and green? Why not a gender void. Just nothingness. 

Sorry I'm just rambling.
Finally someone else who I gets it! OMG. I also feel like agender/neutrois is a good descriptor for me.
Yes! I will say I didn’t read the second half, readings is hard for me, but I really get the “I’m AGAB, so I can’t do this thing I wanted to do because it’s associated with that gender”  stuff. I’m afab, and I like wearing makeup, but I’ve always thought that o shouldn’t because associations and everything, or I wouldn’t be “masc” enough
Ugh, yes exactly 😩
Honestly, I get it. I used to say I'd rather be called a boy and have male descriptors used than female because at least I'm not being called a woman. I haven't considered it from the perspective of people who use other languages though-- I likely have privilege of complaining here because the English language has room for it where other languages might not. Because of that room, I've had the ability to discover that honestly, I don't like being called a boy anymore either, because I had space to come to terms with separating my body and other people's perceptions from what I see as my actual reality. Almost as if I'm, y'know, nonbinary! Lmao and not binary, make or female.   
But yeah. Like I mentioned, I don't think masc/femme/andro needs to be gotten rid of entirely, but I just have this giant suspicion that a lot of NBs might also be using those just because again, there's no other alternatives they know of, and it would be nice to see otherwise. In the English language at least :( That doesn't go for people who are CONSCIOUSLY using these because they honest to god like it and made the decision to do so in the face of alternatives. I'm glad you have that safe spot to fall back onto it when it comes to a masc identity or presentation!
Yeah, that's fair. I'm coming at this from the perspective of a neutrois person like I mentioned, and have felt alienated by the continued ubiquity of binary influence on nonbinary communities, but yes there's probably quite a large, if not majority population of the NB community who have connection to masc/fem in some way or another so it's still relative to them.

I think the thing that bothers me the most is that because of the limited language that we have, I get the feeling if I posted selfies here for instance, other NB people would still be interpreting my appearance in terms of masc/femme which is like... I can't escape it! Lol and additionally, just the thought (and evidence that this is happening just from all the posts I see) of newcomers thinking that this is ALL that nonbinary is bc it's the majority of what they see.

Perhaps I'm prioritizing my own perspective here over the perspectives of others. Either way, I do still think more diverse language is needed and I'd like to see more circles where these things aren't the case. There's r/agender but it's still such a small community and isn't quite the same as other NB circles.
Holy crap, that's so awesome! I have so much admiration for people in creative spheres, especially those who work with clothing because it's never been an area I felt confident in unlike with painting or drawing. I love to hear that! 

I think honestly that's one of the biggest ways to go too, right now the NB community is still in its infancy and this was one of things I can't wait to see from people because it can change the way we see fashion. I personally hate altering clothes/sewing/etc unless it's literally painting on fabric 😩 I wish I didnt otherwise I probably would do cool stuff like this and would have less of a hassle just altering my clothes in general! Lmfao
Hey, no problem, and glad to provoke some thought! Tbh there aren't many more descriptors that I know of which has been disheartening, unless you want to count the Galactian descriptors (solarian, lunarian, etc.) But not many people know of that and I suspect many might not like it as it might not be universally relatable + the ""binary roles dressed up in different clothes"" criticism. Hopefully you can find more than I can or maybe eventually people will start coming up with more!
Hell yea babie B)
Yeah, that's fair! I can understand that viewpoint, not everyone will see themselves reflected in this.
Femme or masc can be whatever that means to them. My point here is for NB people to not also feel like they have to use these descriptors when that might not necessarily be their experience. I'm not advocating for people to get rid of femme/masc entirely, just to allow more room for people to use other things if they want and to increase awareness of the alternatives.
😄
My qualm is specifically with the nonbinary community, and not the world population as a whole. NB have adopted plenty of words that we generally only use with each other. That's more my area of concern. That's much more approachable than trying to change English diction on the whole which is not my aim here lol.

I think masc and femme are currently still very tied in with notions of gender. It's how a lot of trans people gauge how well they ""pass"" as their gender.
Hey, that's awesome to hear! I'm glad you found yourself.
My clothes and looks are all figured out and represent me fine. It's being called masc, femme or andro that bothers me because it doesn't suit me at all and it's not true, I'm not those things. It's like being misgendered almost. I almost don't even like being called nonbinary. Lol
Honestly, literally same lmfao
Yeah I used to have plenty of weird display issues on mobile too at some point.

I don't have an extensive knowledge of non-binary genders in other cultures so you might very well be right on that one. I have seen the indian ""two-spirits"" gender been thrown around a lot as a proof that non-binary genders has simply been erased by western society but is nevertheless valid. However, the name itself ""two-spirits"" implies that even then they already had a binary understanding of genders, it just happens that they already got a word to define the people who were outside of this binary way before we did, and that it was a valid accepted gender in their otherwise binary society. That being said, I do not know anything about the history of that particular gender or about any other non-binary gender term in any other language so, again, you might very well be right on that one.

I agree that making your identity clear is useful. I should add some label with ""they/them"" to my account now that I think about it, as I've seen a lot of people do. However, I don't think self-describing your gender expression is that useful. I mean, you don't need to write ""Even tho I'm femme I'm still a them"", because the picture already conveys at least part of your gender expression, and the information about your gender identity can come from somewhere else, like the user labels for example. Gender identity cannot reliably be inferred from gender expression anyway.

Actually, now that I re-read your reply, I feel like you might mean when people use words like ""femme"" or ""masc"" to describe their gender identity ? I don't have a clear understanding of those term when they apply to gender identity rather than gender expression. I have heard of some people labeling themselves ""transmasc"" and ""transfemme"" and I'm not sure I understand what that means. Is it like ""non-binary with a predominently masc/femme gender expression"" ? But then why mix your gender expression with your gender identity ? Or is it like ""non-binary with a predominently masculine or feminine gender identity"" ? But then isn't this very similar to ""demiboy""/""demiman"" and ""demigirl""/""demiwoman"" ? I'm sure it makes sense to the people who use those terms and they are as valid as any other gender. I'm simply genuinely wondering what people truly mean when they use those terms in that particular context.
https://the-mogai-community.fandom.com/wiki/Galactian_Alignment_System

Not sure if you saw that or not. Yeah, it's a redressing   in a way of the binary descriptors, it's specifically a way of saying masc or femme without saying masc or femme, adding a NB spin on it, and adding a whole lot more than that as you'll see if you look at the graphs/list of identities under the system. Kind of in the same way (might be a bad example but not sure how else to put it) that, say, outsiders might interpret fa'afafine and hijra both as ""third gender"" but the flavors are distinctly different because they have different cultural contexts, and are not the same thing, even though they're both often categorized as ""third gender"". Femme and lunarian can be similar or different, just depends one the individual using it.

I still don't think it's a perfect system though bc of the redressing issue. But I do like that it attempts to broach the issue. Honestly, until femme and masc get broadened in our wider culture over time, this language issue might persist because the underlying systemic framework isn't changing with our language. :(

Virid isn't related to the Galactian system, no. It's kind of its own thing lol.
Yeah it makes sense! Glad to provide more sense of community for you :)
😊
Yeah no, everything you've said here is totally right! And is a very fair point lol. Thank you for adding that.
Yeah, I understand people going the opposite too because I literally did it too. I guess from my perspective as someone who came out the other side and saw it for what it was, I'm probably judging too harshly because you kind of just have to make the mistakes before learning from it, lol at least from the people who that kind of thing it ISN'T right for.

I agree with p much everything you said haha.
My goal would be to think like you about people's perceptions; I get you point and I wish I could be like that, but maybe it's possible for me after the mastectomy. Things seem to change after one is freed from crippling dysphoria^^
As a gender fluid person, i live my identity through masc and femme. Its a unique experience for everyone. I honestly dont see the need to stray away from masc or femme because those are two things that help us define our gender identity in the first place! Just because we are non binary doesnt mean we have to do away with the two ends of the spectrum . Some days im a woman some days im a man some days im both 🤷 not sure how it would be described without the use of the two idenities
And what does Solarian/Lunarian mean? Is it just masc and femme respectively, without saying masc and femme? What system does it use? There's multiple old faiths where the moon is male and sun female, including my own, while in others it's the reverse. So would I have to go against my personal beliefs in order to use this galactic system?
Ive definitely heard of galactian because i was looking up a bunch of pride flags and labels and i really liked a lot of the celestarian system genders, sexualities, etc. Galactian was probably linked/recommended but i didnt super look into it at the time, and i haven't heard the term virid before or many other galactian terms to my knowledge. Im definitely gunna have some fun researching more on these and maybe ill find more i identify with!
I hope you have a great day 😊
I was glad too. It took well over a year of questioning myself and growing to accept that. I'm glad you found yourself too.
Yeah, I get where you're coming from. I guess I made my point badly - basically that I don't find MASC/femme etc helpful at all. I do like NB however as it covers a massive amount of different scenarios:)
Nah, I meant when people say ""Having a masc day"" or ""I love looking femme"" or ""What are femme things I can wear"" or ""Am I nonbinary if I dress masculine"" etc. 

Not trashing these people for saying these things and being honest about how they feel, that would be stupid, and some things are kind of hard to NOT say like that bc in order for a language to be effective, everyone has to know what the words mean (like asking for femme clothes communicates an idea quickly and will probably get what the poster wants, probably isn't the time to use non gendered language or it would be confusing.). My gripe was how that seems to be the only lens a lot of NB people see gender expression for everyone, that everyone has to use these labels bc nothing else exists and that a lot of people just seem to think being NB is being either a third gender in between boy or girl (androgyne essentially) or boy/girl lite. For many people that might be true but there's almost this blindness to agender people's perspectives, for instance, and I think ONLY having fem/andro/masc as descriptors in the NB community and almost nothing else is almost odd for how much many of us want to ""smash the binary"" and for such a unique, diverse bunch lol. 

Transmasc/transfemme generally indicates people who feel somewhat attached to male/female concepts but not necessarily in the way a man or woman would be, or yes, kind of just fits gender expression in there because that pointer I made about language having to be widely known to be effective. Like, I can be agender but call myself transmasc if I'm taking testosterone  for indtance. For some, demiboy or demigirl can fit and that can include them also, but for others the feelings are more nebulous, they might not like the name or description or otherwise just might not like being specific or care, it's an easy way of tipping someone off to their general identity.
Thanks for that description! It's really helpful. Yup, that's the site I saw.

I think it's a fantastic idea to develop a gender system that avoids thinking in terms of masc/femme, but it's really hard to implement in a way that doesn't reinforce existing binary stereotypes. 

A lot of it could be unconscious associations - like, with the sun/moon thing in the galactic system, I guess the idea was that the creators were thinking of interchangeable star signs. But it makes me a bit uncomfortable to say that ""masculine"" is this giant powerful source of light that rules the entire solar system, while ""feminine"" is this tiny rock that helplessly revolves around the sun because its influence is so strong.

I guess someone could try developing a gender system that is based on self-perception, personal traits, and self-presentation, but again, there's a big risk that they would still have masc/femm associations, and could come across as even more restrictive than the traditional binary.

 I guess one advantage of the masc/femm binary is that although they do have their rigid stereotypes they have changed so much over the centuries and have basically always been challenged, so there are so many flexible models of masculinity/feminity to follow.
Right, totally get it. It’s a hill we don’t have to die on because people need to grow and learn on their own. We can’t even change peoples minds. Can you imagine where you were, trying out the far far side of the “gender spectrum”, and someone tried to convince you otherwise? You might have resisted and gone further down a path that you (much) later found out was not for you. 

It’s a painful journey for all of us, and you and I as well as some others, are fortunate enough to come out the other end with our true selves intact. But I think as creatures we are always altering ourselves through change and growth and I can never say I won’t go to an extreme again. I think it might be less likely as I am very happy with who I am, but I can’t ever count it out.
That's another perspective I haven't considered! The only times I feel dysphoria now are in social situations and when I did feel dysphoria with my body, it was actually self-induced because of what I was talking about above-- the pressure to look more masculine in order to be a ""true"" NB if you're AFAB. I considered testosterone because I wanted to ""erase"" my current body but I'm glad I didn't go through with it, because it wasn't a nonbinary issue, it was a sexism issue. 

I hope you can get relief from that burden after having time with your new physical form :) Having crippling dysphoria I'm sure just makes everything that much more complicated and I can understand that it might necessitate more black and white thinking for people, and so I might have a different perspective here than others. Thanks for mentioning that!
I can't say whether it's something that would go against your faith or not, I think that's something you personally would have to decide. 

https://the-mogai-community.fandom.com/wiki/Galactian_Alignment_System
Yay! :)
☺️
Yes! Lol 

I do disagree with that interpretation of sun vs moon. Not everything has to be about size or strength, and you don't have to take it literally a la the actual scientific properties of our celestial bodies lol. It can just be more the IDEA of the two. I mean hell, your lunarian could be the moon that eclipses the sun, or the blood moon. Your sun could be a dying star or the sun at dusk. Etc. Lol
And I thank you for your nice words. It's great to know there are awesome people like you in the world. I really appreciate conversation like this - no fighting over arguments, just exchanging point of views in a nice, civil way and enrichen each other's thoughts.
Maybe changing our expectations to be acknowledged for who we are and how we feel by everyone is the key?

A coworker apparently had a ton of beauty procedures done (less than me but mine are subtle and invisible). And I noticed how she struggles with being shamed for it. So I showed her some scars on my nose (was part of ffs) and she opened up with about even her multiple BA and we connected about that topic. 

My point is she is cis but also has to deal with not being accepted by everyone. Maybe its a mistake to want that as it makes me uncomfortable and unhappy, and focus on those who are supporting.
That's my point though. You've said you want everyone to move to that system, as opposed to just you, but that system doesn't fit everyone. It would mean that I, a distinctly not male, more female but still not - hence femme, not female - would have to use an effectively male gender designation. Having to use this system would effectively be me having to give myself dysphoria, and dead gender myself, every time I discussed my gender. I'm less worried about it going against my faith and more worried about it going against my mental health. 

I don't have a problem with a different designation system, though I can't think of any way of them being any better than our current one. They'd have to be very abstract which has its own problems, or stereotypical which has its own worse problems. I think femme/masc/andro are good because it refers to presentation, I understand while disagreeing with your issues, but I genuinely can't think of a better alternative.
This system is interesting thanks for sharing the link
Aww, thanks, and likewise. Yeah that shit's rare on Reddit sometimes lmao.
That's awful! I've also looked at having beauty procedures done but the judgement from other people is insane, particularly for women. You're only worth kindness, admiration and respect as a woman or femme if you're hot but if it's not effortless then you're high maintenance, vain, selfish and mentally ill. That's sad to hear.
I'm a bit confused. A male gender designation? What do you mean?
Yes, I got a lot of close people scared about me and my mental health when I decided to have FFS. Including some trans people. 

Then after it they where extremely relived I still look like me and not like a instagram model or something… it was all about them and their judgments.

Edit: The way I see it is that makeup or surgery will not change your insecurities. But it definitely changes how others view you. Like everyone has  perfect teeth these days… in the 60s you would see people who had natural teeth on film and tv.

If you want something done just get it and ignore the haters as they are just envious you took control of your life.
The moon is male in my beliefs (and many other old beliefs), but based on the link you provided, a femme enby would be lunarian. So I have to be a moon person, but the moon is male with my beliefs, so if I designate myself a moon person, I'm saying I'm a male person.
For sure.
Ohh, I see. Sorry, I thought I was looking at a different comment line so lost the context of this convo.

Never anywhere did I say I wanted people to move en masse to the Galactian system, or really even as a solution to this problem. I personally have my own issues with it which I've stated before (lack of relatability [as your case kind of could be construed as] plus references and reskins to [western] binary concepts). I've been using it as an example of a system that is attempting to address the issue that I've brought up here, and to therefore show that it is possible, either as a current potentiality or a future one that would necessitate further development of the NB community + cis people's education on these kinds of things. Again, not as a solution because it is not haha!
Oh, and as for your point about a ""replacing"" system instead of femme/andro/masc and the issues with finding a suitable one, yeah I agree with that. My focus wasn't on, again, getting rid of those terms (title of my post relies on the presence of the word ""constant"" there lol) but adding more language (hence my focus on 'virid' as an example) and increasing awareness of alternative methods of descriptions. And yeah, the issues you mentioned are an obstacle. I'm not claiming to sit here and have the solutions since this was just a rant + I'm not really an ideas person, I wanted to start a conversation about this phenomenon so that hopefully more people can think about it and hopefully, with more conversations like this, the community as a whole can decide what it wants to do, what direction to go in and hopefully that will include more people like me who don't feel attachment to the concepts discussed here."	tlxkfz	NonBinary	255	0.96	2022-03-24 04:24:14

i prefer ""free-range"" and ""organic"" artist 🤣 i have a team, but i tell THEM what to do. not the other way around 🙄
HeShe definitely feels apt sometimes!!! 💜 I’m fluid so I’m just kind of figuring out which Neo pronouns work for me in addition to the usual gamut of He/She/They. 😊 I was referred to that way pejoratively by classmates as a kid so using it as one of my pronouns feels reclaimative

"When youre an enby that loves to be mistaken for a queer guy, walkin on the street feelin your gender and some stranger goes ""Bro wtf pink clothes like that?!"" Youre like... Thanks for the validation!"		"That's awesome and I know that the lovely word here was ""bro"" 

But just for clarity: Ain't NB queer?

As an NB, I think I'm queer, even though I don't think I'm gay.

synonyms:odd, strange, unusual, funny, peculiar, curious, bizarre, weird, outlandish, eccentric, unconventional, unorthodox, uncanny, unexpected, unfamiliar, abnormal, anomalous, atypical, untypical, different, out of the ordinary, out of the way, 
You look great and that's an awesome jacket! 
Hehe, it's a super cool weird bit of validation. 

That reminds me of a few months back, I was once buying a lighter at the counter of a convenience store and was trying to figure out which to grab before saying fuck it and muttering, ""Sure, pink"" under my breath. The cashier remarked after, ""That way your friends won't steal it.""

On my way out I had a dorky grin on feeling strangely validated because it had been a little while since someone had read me as male. (I say strangely because I'm AMAB, but honestly I have a way harder time passing as male)

Controversial take?	"There are a lot of posts with people asking ""how to dress non binary"" and it irks me. Because to me, being non binary means non-conforming to the duality and the weird social construct of having to be a certain gender in order to wear certain clothes. When people ask ""how to dress non binary"" I ... I don't know. It confuses me. Just wear whatever the hell makes you happy? To me, the point of being non-binary is, in part, that I don't want to be told how to dress or present myself. I want to just be myself.

What are your opinions on this?"	"“How do i dress more non-binary” is usually code for “how do i present less as my AGAB without looking like the ‘opposite’ AGAB.”

Yes, dress how you want. But when people ask how to dress more non-binary, they usually mean “how do i come off less AGAB, without taking it to the other extreme?”

Usually, the answer is one of: “wear both masculine/feminine styles/clothing”, or “wear subtly cross-AGAB stuff”, or “wear mostly unisex stuff”.  But the answer depends on the person, and is something that is best determined through experimentation and sec-exploration.
I think there are 2 sides to it; 1, yes we should take pride in being inherently nonconforming to the idea of gendering appearances, 2, we still live in a society that genders appearances and attempting to look androgynous is the best some people can do to minimize dysphoria because of misgendering because people won't be able to recognize their AGAB as easily.  I don't think it's always phrased well, but I get the desire to cultivate androgyny as a social defense mechanism.
I haven't made a post like this here, but...

I spent 30 years playing the part of a boy, and now that I've come to terms with the fact that was always just a costume, I get a little paralyzed with all the options.

Asking for fashion advice is a nice way of getting some concrete things put in from of you, making it easier to say ""yeah, I like this"" or ""nah, I don't care for that"".

It's no different from new players asking for help with parts of a game that might be obvious to you, it's part of finding yourself and learning about what's available.

It's also one thing to think ""I want to wear big ridiculous heavy earrings"", and a completely other more validating thing to hear someone else say ""you'd look great in dramatic earrings""

Just some thoughts.
I think it's saying ""how do i look more androgynous or visibly gender nonconforming?""
I agree! A lot of them mean “how to dress more androgynous” or even “how do I dress more queer” and I wish people would just ask that but I think many people might not know that is what they want. They want to dress in a way that affirms their gender and helps other people see them in the way that binary people can use the visual signifiers of gender to be seen and validated in society.

But also tbh gender nonconformity isn’t the only thing under the non-binary umbrella- people can be bigender or demigender or things that that. While I am and am most comfortable as an androgynous person, non-binary has a whole lot more under it.
I agree but ""wear whatever makes you happy"" isn’t a good response to people asking for fashion advice no matter their desired gender presentation. You might not like their framing but it’s still ok for them to ask for fashion advice that looks more androgynous and/or a less strictly-masc or strictly-femme gendered presentation
I had a similar mental issue, but then I remembered that I'm non-binary so everything I wear is ""dressing non-binary"" also clothes have no gender. Although I can relate to the question, when I dress as androgynous as I possibly can (binder, hoodie, whide jeans AND pronoun pin) and still get misgendered as a ""she"" and ""lady"" I wonder what I could have changed so people at least hesitate before calling me ""a girl"".
I agree with you.
I guess it's people looking for inspiration and the approval to dress a certain way they want. That can be helpful to get affirmation from the group.
The clothing that makes you feel comfortable being your true self is what counts. Acceptance by others will vary based on the gender specific mindsets of some people. I feel that blending colors and styles creates a look that is unique and personalized for that individual. 

Neutralizing the clothing divisions in the stores into a general marketplace of just clothing would lessen the so called gender divide. I would love a shopping experience where it just showcases beautiful clothing without the gender specific tags. 

Clothing to me is like a blank canvas to an artist. The first stroke of the brush comes from within your mind, and clothing is the same stroke. One stroke after another layers the blending of the colors, textures and the styles. 

Open your infinite mind to cover your blank canvas with whatever you desire to look and feel like.

Your post made me think about why it is so hard to be non binary and yet present as gender conforming. I don't like to wear clothes from the guys section because they are still gendered and the whole point to me is that we don't have to look a certain way to identify outside the gender binary. People say they struggle with my pronouns more because my appearance is in line with being AFAB but the point is that no one should assume someone's gender based on their appearance. All genders can wear makeup. All genders can wear skirts. Being nonbinary doesn't mean I have to look androgynous. At the same time, I totally respect and honor others' choices to dress androgynous because again all genders should be able to wear whatever they want. I see your point, but I would also like to point out this may be the only forum for people to ask for this kind of advice.
It really annoys me that people, including non-binary people, keep trying to put non binary into a binary. What to wear, how to look, how to act or feel, those are all binaries.
I just think it's a shorter way of asking ""how can I incorporate clothing not intended for my AGAB while still feeling comfortable/fashionable?"" People who have been compelled to wear certain types of clothing don't know how to ""just wear what they want."" It can be very uncomfortable at first, and there are issues of fit and style that can be confusing and awkward. There's no reason to think that they're implying there's one way to ""dress non-binary"" by asking the question, and there's no reason to be uncharitable in your interpretation of what they mean and jump straight into a post policing role. They want some advice on breaking out of gendered clothing expectations. That's it.
One option is to wear non-binary flag colors :)
trying to dress ""nonbinary"" just doesn't seem like a useful mindset imo? it could mean anything to anyone. when I came out and needed adjustments to my look i found it more helpful to identify aesthetics that I liked
i feel the same way. to me labeling yourself as non-binary gives you freedom to look however you won’t without worrying if you’re conforming to any standards.
however i can understand how someone would want to look as non-binary as it gets so that others can see it
See I feel the same, like dressing non-binary to me is taking the time to find a style that you vibe with. And thats literally any style. Imo they ask a question that can't be answer simply. My response would be to take time to figure out what you like to wear in General and wear it
Just wear the clothes that you wanna wear. If they mean more feminine then wear wtraditionally women's clothes. If they mean more masculine then wear traditionally male clothes. But the point is you dont fit into a specific gender role and you're just you. I wear traditionally male clothes but I do my best to appear enby in spite of that. There isnt one specific thing that really does it. If you have gender envy of someone else copy what they do it's okay to not be unique at first.
I just want to say that I’m very thankful for the discussion under this post. I’m struggling a lot with gender expression & presentation because of my natural appearance I’m just very obviously afab and androgyny how most people seem to view it is difficult for me to pull off. My comfort level fluctuates a lot, but seeing the arguments for both “sides” is just really reassuring for me rn, so thank you.
They want to know how to dress androgynous but they don't have the right words. 
I don't get super offended by it. 
Just tell them that they aren't using the right word.
For me, I used to ask questions like this because I wanted to revamp my style to conform to my gender but lacked inspiration. Didn’t work on account of there being INFINITE ways to be nonbinary, as you’ve already expressed.
I don't like that question either though I get why they ask it..I think sometimes it's a wording issue..like it may be less ""how can I fit in with this ideology so I look the way it's supposed to"" and more ""how can I dress the way I feel"" at least it is for me because I have a very outwardly female look so no matter what I wear people look at me and assume girl which I am not..it's frustrating..I just try to be understanding..also some people think nonbinary and androgyny are one in the same and they aren't..so lack of education also plays a part 🤷🏽‍♂️🤷🏽‍♂️

I just let people know that being nonbinary doesn't have to look a specific way as it's not a fashion statement (though I see how it could be perceived that way)

It can be confusing not knowing where you stand or fit and how to explain you're not a woman but you're also not a man to a society that only recognizes those 2 options..that can be difficult to convey and difficult to dress..I guess it's easier to just ask ""how do I look nonbinary??""

(Sorry that was a lot of thoughts all over the place 🤦🏽‍♂️🤦🏽‍♂️)
I totally agree with you tbh, it irks me too but I understand what most people mean by it
Not Gonna Lie, I Don't Think I've Seen Any Posts Like That, Here Atleast. But Yes, I Agree, To Dress Non-Binary Just Be Non-Binary And Dress However You Want To, You're Then Automagically Dressing Non-Binary By Virtue Of *Being* Non-Binary.
For me, being non-binary means I'm trying to relieve myself of the pressure the desire to present as a certain gender places on an individual choosing how to dress, speak, and act. My whole deal is doing what makes me feel comfortable whether that is what is traditionally masculine or feminine or neither. The point is not to look neutral, or some specific combination of masc and fem pieces, I'm trying to do what makes me the happiest. Without regard to worrying about what other people might think about whether or not it's ""gender appropriate"" based on my perceived physical characteristics. And I've got a binder to hide those more too, lol.
Hey, thank you for your explanation and sharing your thoughts on the matter - I was not aware that it was code for something else and may have been taking it too literally. Ergo, my question.
Completely agree with this interpretation. I’ve spent hours of my life googling ‘how to dress non-binary’ when what I mean is ‘how to present as less obviously female’.
That's an interesting and valid point regarding androgyny being a form of 'socially acceptable' way of presenting oneself.. I guess the phrasing is what has always irked me a little. Thanks for sharing your input :)

Edit: one word
It's interesting that you mention that, as I would argue that ""dressing androgynously"" and being gender non conforming are not the same thing - one is a style expression and the other is a gender - and by mixing these terms in an synonymous way one is actually doing more harm than good to the eNBy community.
As someone pointed out in the comments, when people are asking about how to ""look"" eNBy, what they may be searching for is an aesthetic that appeals to them which is an individual, subjective assessment. There also seems to be a conflation of the word eNBy with ""androgyny"", which in my opinion are two completely different things. A person who is their AGAB can still dress androgynously, as style has no affect on ones gender identity. I felt that the advice to ""wear whatever makes you happy"" is a good advice, as I think the most important thing is to feel comfortable.

I'm sure we have all experienced the situation where a person says ""you should wear XY it would look sooo good on you"" with the response being ""okay, but it doesn't make me feel good"" - meaning that the way we look to someone else should not override our own feelings while wearing it.
Thanks for sharing your thoughts, I was looking at it from a similar perspective, thinking ""you are non binary and therefore everything you wear is what a non binary person would wear"".
What surprised me in reading posts about people asking how to dress eNBy (which others have pointed out is referring to looking ""androgynous"") is that they are looking for a box / binary to put themselves in. And my knee-jerk reaction was / is simply ""why?""
I wasn't intentionally post-policing. I was irked by the question which I have read a lot on our sub and didn't understand it. Instead of judging and being hostile I made a post explaining my take and asked for outside input.
That's really good point, thanks for sharing! To look into what aesthetics appeal to them, which, I guess, is pretty much what most human beings, regardless of gender, do anyway: My agab friends also don't dress alike, they each have their own unique style / aesthetic. Why should it be any different for eNBy humans?
That's a valid point... Maybe what I overlooked was that a lot of people have only just become aware of / are out as being eNBy and therefore feel like they suddenly have gotten all options opened up to them without any idea of how to ""get started"" in expressing themselves through their clothes. 

When I was still my agab I was already wearing whatever I liked and felt suited my mood for the day. It was painfully obvious to everyone but myself that I was not within the binary spectrum. To me, being able to give a name to the feelings I have always had about myself was not an ""awakening"" but rather, a feeling of ""coming home""/""arriving"". My style has not changed at all.
I'm glad to hear that reading the replies and the overall discussion are helpful and giving  valuable insights, I am so glad to read everyones opinions and am learning a lot and am glad to hear other people's perspectives to this topic :)
it’s not really an official code, it’s just a question people ask because they feel it’s either more respectful or more relatable or more reasonable or just easier to ask than the generic “how do i be more non-binary”
I don't think I've ever posted for whatever reason but I think I can contribute here. I get your point re ""dressing androgynously"" vs being gender non conforming. I disagree that to dress in an androgynous way is a style expression and I believe ""gender non conforming"" is an umbrella term to describe many genders. I am AFAB but androgyny is is more like the way I would describe my gender. I agree with earlier posts that it is code, it's like asking if you're passing almost. I feel like I am expressing who I am when I am mistaken for a man briefly, not because I want to be one, but because I'm neither man nor woman and I hope that shows. But every non-binary person is different. I think mixing the terms does less harm than does referring to an androgynous enby dressing the way that shows who they are as a ""style"". 
I'm not trying to give you a hard time, but I thought it might be possible you hadn't conversed with someone whose androgyny is more than dress. I respect people who are asking questions.
Fair enough, but surely you can see how making a post about being annoyed by a common post made by other non-binary people, insinuating that there's something wrong or offensive about it, comes off pretty judgemental. You asked for input, this is my input. It's an innocent and perfectly understandable question, and this post comes off like the non-binary people asking it are doing non-binary-ness wrong.
I wonder if in that context people are really asking how to dress more androgynously?
I'm in the same boat!

I'm gender nonconforming (nonbinary) and androgyny is both a sense of style AND a part of my gender identity. 

I want to look androgynous because I AM androgynous, just like how a trans woman might want to dress femininely because she is feminine.
I said ""it irks me"" followed by an explanation of what I mean specifically, ""It confuses me"" then I express my take and my conclusion is ""what are your opinions on this?"" I did not say it annoys me. I was trying to understand.
Yes, quite often that’s exactly what people want, but usually their problem is that they see themselves as looking too much like their AGAB.
Sometimes that is the case because some people think they're essentially the same thing 🤷🏽‍♂️🤷🏽‍♂️
""Irks"" is a synonym for ""annoys,"" so I don't take your point. You also titled the post ""controversial take,"" so you obviously expected some pushback. Look, I don't think this is the right sub to post critiques of how other people understand being and presenting non-binary. It creates a bad atmosphere. I don't like your post about not liking other people's posts. Sorry you're taking it so hard.
Fair enough. English is not my first language. I was under the impression irks means ""to feel flustered""/confused."	qdx47l	NonBinary	242	0.97	2021-10-23 03:43:51
Came out as NB recently, then went thrift shopping for clothes that feel more like me. I’m loving it ❤️‍🔥		"That's an awesome outfit!
That shirt is sick !! I’m happy for you , best of luck to you.
You look amazing! Great outfit and your hair is on point
So gorgeous l love your outfit so much
Love that style!! I need to go thrift shopping again...
Thank you 🤩 it’s crazy how much of an impact clothing can have on your self esteem!
Thank you!! ❤️‍🔥

I feel extremely euphoric! What clothes make you feel this way?		"I loveeeee button down shirts, esp blue ones bc they match my eyes. They’re nice and baggy enough to hide my chest but still look nice and put together.
The way the stacked necklaces hang on you is literally my dream goal. You look amazing!
I love having button downs or shirts that are tight on my body, I feel like they look really good on me. Also I really like darkly colored clothing and occasionally white clothes as well. High waisted pants are also really good because I get really insecure about my weight.
Skirts, tights/pantyhose (also knee-high socks & thigh-high socks) and high-heels.
You're a demi-godling! Damn 🙇‍♀️

.

For me, it's *subtle* women's clothes. Like obvious enough that most people will recognize them as such, but that ignorant/oblivious people could overlook it as slimmer fit ""oddball"" fashion.

Sparkles & animal print are my bae 🥰

Styled chokers, dangle earrings, and light metallic eyeliner to round out the look.

I'm amab, He/They, and have a beard that I don't love but the hassle of keeping it gone isn't worth the fight. All the other stuff balances it out to where I'm feeling gooooood though ✨
The right T-Shirt always causes euphoria for me
Tunics (especially fitted button-ups & racerback tanks) & cargo shorts!
Sooo cute 🙈🙈
I have this bright orange leopard print pajama pants and I wear a Halloween cat in a witch hat stirring a cauldron Tshirt. It's a house outfit, I don't public in pajamas, but I love it
It’s most likely because this style fits your gender expression, so it makes you happy. You look mad good in those clothes too💕✨
I don't have a binder, but I do have some really nice racerback bras from TomboyX and they somehow make me feel fem and masc at the same time and it's just *chefs kiss*. I like to wear them with mid rise jeans or my more baggy pants, kinda like the camo ones you're wearing. Men's tanks and Flannels are also a must.
Other than that, I like to hide myself in large hoodies.
I felt similarly about my outfit today too! Button-ups do it for me. Cargo shorts too!
Really digging the first pic! 👍
AHHH yes! There's this underbust leather harness I put with a white button up its soi freaking awesome. For some reason I love white
Ack- stawppp one of the necklaces the reaper one I got off of shein and then the other is a obatala rosary
No because I feel as though button up shirts accentuate your flat chest while also not making the binder appear
Aiiii I see you 😂 if I'm wearing a binder me as well!
AHHH YOU ARE LITTERALY A SPARKILY GAY WIZARD. I completely adore you style Amab 💖 soon enough I'll begin to post more on this side of reddit and I'd love to receive tips
No way I have these pajama pants that have roses on skulls on them and then I adda Gothic Renaissance instantly I just l e v i t a t e
Sometimes the summer makes me feel extremely disphoric cause binders are SWEATY so ill try to get some tomboyx as well to fluctuate! Because I recently came out and began to explore my style and expression these things are important for me to feel valid 😭
Hahaha I’m afraid of white bc I’m too clumsy and I think I’ll wreck it somehow
Definitely get that, I totally recommend the brand!

It felt safer to learn how to make clothes than to go out and buy fem stuff. So here is my first skirt.		"That's a real nice skirt
That came out beautifully! Love the print you chose
If you would like a fuller skirt, try a full-circle, or even a two-circle skirt. That way there's extra skirt to go spinny! There are resources (including one that actually just does the math for you) on figuring out the center circle, and then you mark the length you want from that edge. It's super easy!

Your first skirt looks great, BTW. Getting the waist band neat and even can be a real struggle all its own!
That's so impressive! And also really a cute skirt :D
Awesome!!
very nice. You are quite skilled.
love the skirt!! it looks great on u <33
Looks great! 

I'm not much of a tailor so I can't offer advice there, but if you can find your sizes, online shopping has been an amazing boon to me trying to find things to help me dress more fem. I'm still mostly in the closet IRL aside from a few close friends/partners, and I'm not ready to walk into the women's sections in person, but I've built a pretty decent collection online - and it helps a LOT if you're a difficult size to fit by most standard women's sizes in stores (I'm 6'3"" and built fairly large, so in most stores my options have been pretty limited.)
It’s adorable! And I’m sorry you don’t feel safe to go out and buy the clothes you want. Our world is too senselessly hateful.
It’s so cute! I get a lot of spring vibes from it!

Also if you’re feeling anxious about buying fem clothes you could always take a female friend OR mention you’re shopping for a friend if you’re not ready for people to know it’s for you. 💕
you’re so talented and pretty! that skirt looks amazing!
I have plans to make a pleated skirt with a zipper next, but a full skirt is on the docket for sure. This material was stretchy so I definitely had some trouble getting it even, but was able to hide it well enough. I'm scared to try hemming the bottom but I'm going to give it a go when I get home.
I'll look around the store, but it's just scary. Everytime I talk to a clerk and say my sister, my friend, I always feel like they know immediately I'm lying.
The best advice I can give fo the hem, is to go slow, and keep it small. With the pleated skirt you should be fine, but anything that narrows as you go up will be harder to hem. If you're OK with it, hemming by hand might be easier to get a grasp of, since you have lots more control over how stretched the fabric is. If you'd like, I can make a video to show you how to hem by hand. It's time-consuming more than anything (and requires many pins to hold slick fabric), but can give a much smoother look.

I had a feeling it was stretchy, which makes your first skirt more impressive. Sewing machines aren't known for behaving with slick or stretchy fabrics.

You'll also get better with practice, so don't be afraid to try new things! Otherwise you'll always have dream projects that you never feel ready for.
Try not to let it get into your head too much. At the end of the day the majority of the world still see things gendered so if you say it’s for a friend most people will believe you just from what they’ve been taught. 

It’s nearing Christmas and right now is the perfect time to use the “it’s for a friend” excuse because everyone around the world is buying stuff for the opposite gender.

Make sure you take your measurements before you shop and maybe keep them in the notes section of your phone so you don’t forget. This way you won’t have to try anything on or worry about it being too small/big and having to return it “for a friend.”
Pinning it was the hardest part for me. It felt like if I pinned it flush at one side it always got away when I came back to it. Thank you so much for the kind words too. I wish I had people I could show it to in person, but baby steps.
You're very welcome! I've learned that the direction the pin is going can have an effect on how the fabric holds or moves too, so try different positions and see what works!

Learning to sew is definitely a journey, and there are lots of videos online for all sorts of sewing. Take your time, and don't forget to enjoy yourself."	qlt1pq	NonBinary	223	1.0	2021-11-03 12:08:49

I hate my family	"So as some my know/remember i outed my self to my family on christmas eve.  
I just had an conversation with my parents because i asked them if they could pick me up tomorrow because i will get the booster shot and just to make sure that i won't be alone should side effects occur. The chat went as follows:  


Me: Hey can you pick me up tomorrow after i get the booster?  
Mom: sure but please wear ""normal"" clothes and don't wear make up  
Me: i will be okay with ""norma"" clothes but i will definitly wear makeup, because i feel like myself like that and i won't let anyone controll me  
Mom:...  
Voice massage from dad: Don't you know what you are doing to us, what shall our neighbours and the rest of the family think.doyou know what this means.  
Me: What does it mean? Huh? You are basicaly telling me that you won't accept and tolerate me  
I give a SHIT what either you or other people think of me  
I feel well as i am and if this is so bad for you then don't ever text me again  
what it means is that i was open enough to show you my true self   
But either way i never even thought you would accapt me  
Mom: we can't choose to accept or not accept you we are your parents, but please be normal at ours  
Me: i am my ""normal"" not yours   
your normal is outdatet and doesn't fit in this century  
Mom: sorryhow it went, you know we love you but please be ""normal"" at ours  


They are pissing me of right now  


Sorry for long text just needed to rant about this"	"And now my father just texted me that my mom is crying because of me
And now my parents are texting me like nothing ever happend  
that's so typical for them
Awful behaviour. I'm guessing you're not a small child; any say your parents have about what you wear has long expired.
In case you need to hear it: you don't have to stay in contact with your family. It is optional.
🌟🎶 Emoooootional manipulaaaation. 🎶🌟
I'm so sorry they are treating you this way. The holidays are rough. 
I'm going to repeat old advice for you. Take it or leave it as you feel it applies to you. If you think there's a chance your folks will come around, and you want them to, give them some time to have a few tantrums, give them the resources to learn more about you, and ask a lot of questions. Be patient but firm about the boundaries you need. After say a year or so if they are still being cruel and disrespectful  then you can start lay down the hard boundaries of what kind of treatment you expect from them and tell them if they can't support you, you will distance yourself from them further. 
Good luck. I'm glad your gfs family is supportive.
Thanks for sharing your story OP. What even is “normal” and how can they claim they “don’t have the ability to choose to accept or not to accept” your self expression. As if it’s out of their hands. They really just lack basic communication skills and maturity.

At least you can choose though, choose to give yourself distance from them. Sending your heart a hug friend.
I'd this your first of the shots or did you have covid before?

Generally speaking, unless you have a major allergic reaction in the first 15 min, the worst the side effects get is about an hour after the shot you may run a fever, feel like shit, and some times develop a light cough. None of it is too bad.

I suspect dealing with your selfish parents is far worse than the common crummy side effects of the vax.

I fired members of my family for just being chronic rude assholes, before ever labeling what everyone has known since I was 5.

All I'm saying is, don't argue with them for acceptance, it's a waste of your energy and time. 

I've been in that cycle earlier in life. I get the pulling compulsion to somehow get a supportive family life, and that ""somehow maybe that can happen if you or they can just...""

If acceptance, apologies, and a change of heart are going to happen, they will and it will be on your parents' time table. You are not responsible for the opinions of others, rather only working to be a kind human with others as often as you can. 

You also have the right to defend/protect yourself emotionally/psychologically, and physically.  Boundaries are everything.

Look into non-violent communication. Practice it and hold firm boundaries with clear consequences. If the people around you currently temper tantrum and say and do violent things, you are free to fire them and find new tribe.

There is a lot of bullshit belief in the world. It's time to sort what beliefs others are putting on you and which you are willing to accept.

We in the arena salute you. This is tough work, but worth it because you are. You lovely human you.

Good Solstice to you, the longest night has passed and the light now steadily returns.
Jesus.. That Sucks.

As a mom of a young enby this makes me so angry and sad for you!!! Please accept internet mom hugs from me, and stay safe. ❤
Tell your dad you'll do his makeup in his sleep if he doesn't watch himself. Tell your mom you'll get your makeup tattooed if she doesn't stop twisting your arm. 

Threats are the only thing that make it to boomer ears sometimes
My family is just like that! Somthing that always makes me feel better and makes them stop is to give your mom a random male name and your dad a random female name and call that them until they respect you. Also, don't respond and ignore them if they don't call you by your pronouns and/or name name.
I can understand where you both are coming from. 
People always care what others think, the people that we don’t know. People judge people. I took me a long time to not worry about what my neighbours think. 
It takes time, you just dropped a bit of a bomb on your parents. You are years ahead of them. Give them time to catch up, educate them. 
There not rejecting you, they need time to adjust. 
But you are correct be true to yourself, be you. That is important.
For me being non-binary I don’t wear certain clothes and makeup around certain people in my family. 
I will wear jeans and a shirt. But no scoop neck shirts, no sweater dresses and no breast forms or enhancing and no wig.
Maybe a little mascara.
I’m still me, but I don’t get up every day and put makeup on and get full dressed anyways. So I don’t feel the need to make a point at family functions.
There so many gender neutral and womens clothes out there for me to wear that make me feel good and don’t make the older gen feel awkward.
Gaslighting at its finest! Free Enby-Hugs from me!!!
> because of me

This is manipulative bullshit. People are responsible for their own emotions and reactions. If you provided exactly the same behavior to a supportive parent, they'd be excited for you, not upset. And since your behavior is the same in either case, it's clearly *their choice* to be upset, not something they should blame you for. But they are, and they're doing so with the intent of manipulating you to change your behavior and claiming victimhood. That is despicable behavior.

Please protect yourself, OP. Maybe find someone else that can take you to your appointment, and distance yourself from toxic people in your life. You deserve better.
She's not crying because if you. She's because she's seemingly incapable of understanding outside herself. You're doing just fine, friend, I'm sorry you have yo deal with this.
god.. i fucking hate this.
like ooohhhh a boundary lemme cry about it.
someone asks for basic respect its not that fucking hard. especially your own kid, you owe them basic respect and necessities like food, housing, transport etc and you cant put restrictions on that like stupid dress codes.
i really hope you're okay and get away from them soon you deserve so much better.
Omg. I'm so sorry OP.
my dad does this too, he's trying to hurt you, he knows what he's doing and he's a piece of shit for it. I'm sorry you're going through this.
She should be crying for being an overcontrolling parent
yea i'm 21 and have rented a appartment with my girlfriend   
the thing is  
i don't realy care for my parents  
they just destroyed the confidence i had after my 6 yo brother called me a goddes  
i probably won't be able to see my siblings for a longer time as they are living at my parents and aren't old enough to move out  
and that i will be alone at new years
at it's finest  
but i'm not surprised  
they hit us as childs and when we criedbecause of it they threatend to do it again when we don't stop
i will distance me from them (for now)  
and what they meant with having no choice was meant like they only can accapt me  
what they actualy don't do
Thank you, friend
I will definitly look for ways to talk to my parents and try to get them to understand 
But if nothings working i will need to cut them out of my life

It's my 3rd shot
As a kid i had febrile seizure which for i was 4 days in the hospital until it finaly got down again
But since then every time i got a fever i have a temeratur of atleast 39.5°C and am basicaly lying almost dead in bed

That's why i need someone to look after me wehen ill

But i postpond my appointment until my gifriend come back
Sounds a lot like my parents. I'm sorry.
Awwww, thanks for the hugs
i'm also nonbinary but want to look more fem  
and i also don't always wear makeup and a dress   
mostlya bit of mascara and that's it   
but on new years i would want to put a bit more effort to it and on my moms birthday
Thank you very much appreciated
It'a not the problem of getting to the appointment and back it's the side effects that may occur

But yea i will definitly distant myself for now

I saw how supportiv parents would react 
The family of my girlfriend accapted me as i am and even support me on that

It's just sad that i won't have contact to my little siblings for now until hopefully something changes



And i already now that my parents are toxic, that's nothing new
I'm so sorry you're going through this. I'm sending you a big telepathic internet hug. Your brother knows what's up. ❤
Oh I see, like they have no choice but to accept you however “it’s difficult for them to do so”.
It's okay, now.  

Took me a few years to gain perspective.  I love them.  I just care about myself, more.
Basically yea

"One of the reasons I dress the way I do is because I want to finally destroy the myth that men are more ""visual"" than women. I've found when I dress in revealing clothes like women do, I get more positive attention from women, including compliments on the street and at stores."		"Ok is it an illusion created by the socks and “no pants” or how long are your legs 🥵?
Omg I have the same socks, sock twins :)
This gives me such y2k RPG MMO vibes like u can make your characters look exactly like you.
Wait what do you mean by visual? I don't understand it in this context.
If this has actually proven a point, that's amazing, and I fully support this!
This inspired me!! Gonna try wearing shorter shorts in public, lol
*scrolls through post history*

No, thanks.
When it comes to attraction, it's thought that men are mostly attracted to looks and women are mostly attracted to personality.
Basically the argument is that women's only purpose is to look good because that is what men want, while men's only purpose to work and to procreate with whatever women they find physically attractive. This misguided (and very sexist) misconception that men are more visual has thus been exploited for centuries in Western culture to objectify, sexualize, and commodify women for the sole benefit of men.

Women are similarly taught that they are not supposed to care about how a man looks, particularly for sexual reasons, but instead to be concerned that he is a good provider (has a job, has a car, etc.) This is all a mechanism designed to capitalize on the oppression of women and to perpetuate male hegemony and heterosexism.

My goal is to completely dismantle that system, because it is only way to truly move toward gender equity once people realize that a lot of these ""ideals"" are mostly social constructs, not a biological imperative.
Glad to help. Wear whatever makes you happy. You only get one life after all!
Well, that just seems unnecessary.
Ah okay. Now I get. Yeah that sucks and is totally untrue. Love your socks btw💕
Sorry, but walking around in public with clothes that purposefully show off bulges isn't okay.

No one consented to that. I don't care what the message is supposed to be. That's not even mentioning the images of public nudity that it looks like they either deleted or hid.
Well, a formless bulge is not the same as showing genitalia (though I did see a couple in that post history that cross that line). I don't think that should be considered a 'consent violation' since mens regular pants that can show basically the same thing. I'd be more worried about the penis-carriers that go commando in sweat pants.
That's the thing though; I've never seen a cis man purposefully dress like that.

OP is free to make a statement about gender as much as they want to, and more power to them, but this just isn't okay. 

It would make me deeply uncomfortable if I saw it in public, and that's coming from someone who's already apart of the community. If it bothers me, it's gonna make a whole lot of other people uncomfortable too.
\> That's the thing though; I've never seen a cis man purposefully dress like that.

Not really sure how that's relevant - just because something isn't seen by a given person, doesn't mean it never happens.

Anyway, my point is that people shouldn't be forced to be built like a Ken doll to wear what they want. In cases where genitalia **isn't** showing/outlined, it starts getting way too close to body shaming for my comfort level.
Look at their most recent post.

""The hygienist spent an extra long time cleaning my teeth, even though she said they were cleaner than usual. I think she was admiring my obvious bulge and LIKED WATCHING IT GROW.""

This is not about gender expression, it's about being a goddamn creep to people who did not consent to staring at their goddamn genitalia! Fuck them.
Yes? That's one of the posts crossing the line I already mentioned. That's not what am arguing for here. I think you may have slightly misread some of my comments."	p6hn8y	NonBinary	212	0.95	2021-08-18 01:55:14
Is... Something supposed to feel different?	"Hey, so I think i might qualify as nb, I'm amab and i feel... Idk, feminine for a guy but not to the extent that i feel I'd consider myself trans, i don't really experience dysphoria (i think) so don't figure that label really fits. I don't even know if nb fits either, because it feels... Pointless? Like, what's it matter if i call myself nb or just a feminine man? It feels like calling myself nb might be like... Too much? Or posing? Idk? Advice? Pls

Edit: i think i figured it out now, I'm test piloting she/her pronouns and some clothes. Gonna steal the other model's tires and if i like em I'll come back for the rest."	"Dysphoria isn't a requirement to be any gender, including transgender. Transgender means to experience a gender that doesn't solely and completely align with one's AGAB. Non-binary means not aligning with either of the two traditional western gender boxes solely and completely. Non-binary falls under the trans umbrella. So, if you feel like your experience of gender isn't solely and completely that of a man, non-binary is available for you to describe that experience. You're the only one who can decide if that label is right for you, because you're the only one who has lived that experience. If you feel it's accurate to you, then you get to use it. There's no other requirement.
It took me years to accept and be who I am. Sometimes people just know and sometimes we are unsure because of imposter syndrome and random gatekeeping. 
The fact you question it all shows you are looking and searching. That does imply you are on the edge of something.
Talk to someone you love and trust. Write a private journal to sort your thoughts.

Always remember you are valid whatever you decide. Nobody has claims on your gender ID or life.

Good luck!🏳️‍🌈😉
I don't have an answer for you, but you're not alone. I have very similar feelings about being AFAB and sometimes feeling like maybe I'm not actually a woman all the time. And yet, it would affect basically nothing whether I decide to identify as cis or NB. Neither option feels entirely right to me. I'm honestly very confused about what a gender actually is and how the heck I'm supposed to know I have one.
I'd say, call yourself nb if it makes you feel happy or feels helpful to you, call yourself a feminine guy if it makes you happy or feels helpful to you. All of these labels are not so much (or, actually, at all) about what someone qualifies as according to some definition (bc srsly, who would even have the authority to define those things?), but rather what words we can use to communicate things about ourselves to others - how we feel, how we want to be seen, how we want to be treated. It's all a very inexact science! It's about what WORKS, not about looking at a few preconceived categories and picking one to adhere to.

The way i figured out i was nb was by looking at groups of people and what they said about their experiences, and seeing whom i could relate to the most. Sure, i had some experiences and thoughts and feelings in common with some men and women, but over all, i felt the most comfortable being grouped with all the rest. I didn't relate 100% to what every nonbinary person said or did ever, but the overlap was larger than with any other group. In the end, it was just clear that if i told people i was nonbinary, then they got a pretty good idea of what kind of person i was, which experiences they could sort of expect me to have, what preferences i would be likely to have. At least it fit better than if i had claimed to be a woman or a man. Sometimes, it's not about finding a shoe that fits perfectly, but just one that fits better than the others you have tried! 

And in the end, if you've found some words to describe yourself that you're pretty comfortable with and that work for you, you can even decide what exactly those words mean TO YOU, and tell other people about that if you want. Like, for me being nonbinary might mean one thing, for a friend it might mean something a bit different. Just like being a man or a woman means slightly different things to those men and women. Again, inexact science! It's all a tool to help you describe yourself, never a box you need to fit yourself into. Good luck!
One recommendation I’ve seen that helped me think about gender is to imagine your brain floating in an empty void. Nothing else around. You’re not connected with your body or outward appearance. It’s just your thoughts and feelings.

In that context, if you had to name your gender, what would you name it? Are you male, female, man, woman, both, neither, do you go back and forth, etc.?

That’s your gender identity. What you feel like; who you innately “know” you are.

Also, it’s helpful to remember that your gender identity is separate from your gender expression. They can inform one another, but one doesn’t dictate the other.

Hope this helps!
I was in the same spot for a long while. the reason I claim nb now is because sometimes I'll be like ""ok if you're not, then you're a man"" and that just doesn't make sense when I think about it. like I have no attachment to that concept and it doesn't feel right calling myself one. any deviation outside the two binary genders makes you nb, if you want it to. yes there are probably a lot more people who would consider themselves nb if our society was better lol. from a practical standpoint, you don't need to go changing your legal gender or coming out to your parents or whatever. maybe share with a couple close friends, test drive some other pronouns and presentations and see what happens.
Check the word “qualify”.
Almost always, it carries the weight of societal judgement
You can just be a feminine man. Nothing wrong with that. You also don't have to pick a label. Just be yourself and vibe.
This sounds a lot like me tbh. At first I was unsure about the non-binary label, I felt weird with it but I knew I wanted to use he/they pronouns and ‘cis’ felt equally weird, albeit more familiar and comfortable. 

I used ‘genderqueer’ for a little bit, but sometimes non-binary was just easier and required less explanation, and I found that with use it lost its unfamiliarity and I really started to like it. Though it’s technically an umbrella term it suits me just fine on its own. I identify as a non-binary male, and those who care to know more specifically what that means for me can get to know me and learn for themselves. (:
You go with the label that feels comfy for you. If calling yourself nonbinary feels like ""too much, posing or pointless"", then you don't have to do it, you are 100% valid labelling yourself as a ""feminine man"" if that's what feels right for you.

It's different for everyone and a label like that always has do be self-prescribed instead of something you have to ""qualify for"" tbh. I'm an enby and even tho I'm amab (and not on HRT and not even presenting very 'queerly' most of the time), it feels uncomfortable as hell referring to myself as a man, even a ""feminine"" one. I tried that for years and the shoe just didn't fit.

If it does for you, congratulations, you found the label that's comfortable for you. That's what it's all about in the end imo.
I feel the same to an extent. I’m not sure if non-binary fits me either, I don’t get dysphoric, it doesn’t feel like a perfect label for me but it just feels… logical to use this term for me. It’s okay to use it if you don’t identify with it 100% even if it’s just until you find a label that fits you best and I don’t believe anything’s supposed to feel different, nothing felt different for me at least =]
If you're unsure whether you have dysphoria, try reading this - [https://genderdysphoria.fyi/en](https://genderdysphoria.fyi/en), it's a great resource for figuring things out.
That's how I felt. I didn't feel a great change, I just realized I had no particularly strong attachment to manhood or womanhood.
Being nonbinary/trans isn’t necessarily about dysphoria. It can just be about euphoria. If calling yourself by a certain label makes you feel better, then that’s something you might use! Honestly all it boils down to is what you want. Do you want to call yourself nonbinary? If so, then do it! The only people who will stop you are assholes. (I’m nonbinary btw and this is basically the thought process that lead me to accept that I was)
Ah, welcome my friend. The most important thing is you must understand, labels arent for everyone, the joys of life is you can be whoever and whatever you want. 

Now, a few things that helped me when I felt the same as you;

1. consider how you would feel about your gender, regardless of your physical body (thought experiment, what if you were born AFAB? would you still feel somewhere between man/woman?)
2. Rather than thinking about dysphoria, consider what counts as gender Euphoria, what makes you happy, and comfortable with your gender expression?
3. understand, that gender identity is something you can, and might change your mind on, life is long, and you dont need answers. 
4. consider what you mean by ""posing"". for me I felt like that because all examples of Enby people I could find where AFAB. Its an ongoing issue within the LGBT community that AMAB enby people are extremely underrepresented. 
5. Its ok to just be a feminine man! many people are! be whatever makes you comfortable <3. 

good luck
I understand your confusion. I am amab, identifying as nb for a while now. I have never presented my feminine side much, outside of nail polish.

 During the past week or so, maybe a bit more, I have wondered if I may be trans, as I have felt a surge of feminity in me.

At the same time, I like the masculine parts of me. I do have some female envy, but mostly regarding clothing. And I don't feel especially like a man, nor like a woman. That being said, I'm okay with people using him/he.

So yeah, really confused here too! But I think what I'm going through is a reaffirmation or a deepening of my non binariness, if you will. Or I'm more fully embracing it. 

I bought a few piece of women's clothing online, I am excited to try it on! I am looking forward to see how it feels and how I look. I'm also hoping it will help me figuring out what I am/confirm I am truly nb.
Based mostly on the posts I've seen here, the feelings you're describing are basically mandatory. Welcome to the collective :)
Hey! Maybe throw around the term ""gender non conforming"", because from your description, that seems to fit best to me. Obviously, you know yourself best, so do what you gotta do. 
Also, thinking you may be non binary, or trans, and then coming to the conclusion later that you're not is totally okay! Feel around and wiggle around in your gender performance and expression; try new things and see how they feel!
Have you looked into Cassgender? It describes someone who has a gender, but doesn’t necessarily feel that it’s important to their identity.
Or Nuetroi (I think I spelled that right). It’s kind of like agender, but more passive. Not nothing, just neutral.
I’m personally of the opinion that it would do most people some good to do some gender exploration and introspection. Even if you you end up deciding that yes, you actually are a cis man, that’s cool too! You’ll be approaching masculinity deliberately, and with more self-knowledge than before. But you don’t need dysphoria to be nonbinary. I don’t have much body dysphoria myself. I am agender- I have no strong ties to any particular gender. It doesn’t hurt me to be perceived as female as I often am, but there’s nothing inside of me that is “woman.”

My journey so far has been like this: I got interested in reading about trans experiences as I started meeting trans people, and as people I care about began to come out. I wanted to be as supportive, respectful, and generally kind as possible, so educating myself seemed like a good starting point. As I started thinking more about gender in the abstract, and gender as it applies to others, I also started thinking about gender as it applies to myself. Because I am AFAB, I started thinking about womanhood. I tried to define what womanhood actually is, and I realized that there really is no unifying trait or detail that *all women* AND *only women* experience. For every trait, behavior, or experience I could think of, I could also think of examples of women who *don’t* share or experience it, and also people who are not women who *do*. The only unifying aspect of womanhood that I could come up with was the strong internal sense that one is, in fact, a woman. And I don’t have that.

There’s a thought experiment I used to explain the concept of being transgender to my stepson when he asked. I led him through a series of questions about his relationship to his body (for example “if you didn’t have your left hand, would you still be male?” “Yes, I’d still be a guy” “what about if you didn’t have your legs, would you still be male?” “Yup, still male”) that led all the way to the conclusion of “Ok, what about if you were a disembodied mind- no brain, no body, no meat, just your consciousness- do you think you’d still be male?” “Yeah, I think I’d still be a guy”  “And if we put your mind into a robot body, would you be a boy robot?” “Yeah, I’d be a guy robot”. Basically to break down the idea of gender as separate from the body, and then introduce the concept of peoples’ genders not lining up with their physical bodies. 

So when I later started interrogating my own gender, I realized that my answers to the robot questions were different- if my consciousness was stuck in a robot body, I *wouldn’t* be a female robot, *because I do not have a strong internal sense of gender.* Once I realized that, it was like I’d unlocked a new perspective on so many details of my life that I had ignored in the past because I didn’t have the framework to understand it at the time. When I said I don’t have body dysphoria before that wasn’t 100% true- I do sometimes wish my breasts were just not there I sometimes, but surely every woman feels that way sometimes, right? And Freud said all that shit about penis envy, surely every woman wishes she had one of those sometimes, right? And *everyone* wishes they could grow a nice full beard, right? And didn’t every girl habitually steal her dad’s clothes? Well, no- that’s not a universal feminine experience. In hindsight, those were all early genderqueer signs that I just didn’t have the context to recognize and process yet.

And since I’ve been able to name this aspect of myself, I’ve also been able to recognize moments of gender *euphoria* too! Gender euphoria is such an important concept that doesn’t get talked about much outside of trans spaces. It’s the opposite of gender dysphoria; moments where you feel your gender intensely in a positive way. For a binary trans person, this could be moments where someone gives them gender-appropriate compliments- calling a trans woman glamorous and lovely, for example- moments where they pass, moments when they notice their bodies looking the way they want them to, that sort of thing. For a nonbinary person, this can be extremely varied, since nonbinary is an extremely broad and varied concept. But the point is, if something makes you feel especially masculine, or feminine, or ambiguous, etc- good in a very ‘gender-y’ way- that’s gender euphoria. My sideburns give me gender euphoria. My biceps give me gender euphoria. The one time I lifted a tree into a lady’s car and she called me a stud gave me such major gender euphoria I still think about it years later. Same with the time an old guy customer at work called me “boss” instead of “sweetheart.”

So anyway I don’t have advice, but I hope something here might help you on your gender journey. In my opinion, vocabulary and labels can be extremely helpful, but you don’t have to land on the one perfect term right out the bat. It’s ok to change your mind as you grow and change and learn more about yourself. It’s a never-ending process, and this is definitely one of those times when where you end up is less important than the journey to get there.
My experience is very similar to yours. I also felt like nb was overkill or like I was encroaching on something I didn't have the rights to. But then I slowly started dressing androgynously and told my friends that could use any pronouns for me since that made it easier to go back. 

And for a while I felt stupid. Like I was demanding to be part of something I was not. But after a while my imposter syndrome faded and now I more or less feel comfortable calling myself agender. I still don't have a sense of what gender is but conforming to being a specific gender has always felt kind of limiting? Like I wasn't allowed to do certain things or be certain ways because it didn't match my agab's stereotypes. 

But since I ditched dresses and ""being pretty"" I've felt so much more comfortable being me. I also recently cut my hair which was really nice. Don't get me wrong, I loved having long hair but short hair makes me feel like I can present completely genderlessly.

And a dead giveaway for me was also my life-long desire to confuse people to the max. Whether it be my gender, my speech or anything really. Confusion and chaos is my aesthetic so when I realised that also applied to my gender I had to accept that imposter syndrome is a bitch...

I also used to worry a lot about whether I was feminine enough and thought the other girls would make fun of my deep voice or broad shoulders. I now know this was me feeling pressured to look and act a certain way which cause me to feel very anxious...

Dunno if this helps at all but this is what I go off of...
Check into gender euphoria. Dysphoria isn't required to be trans/nonbinary. Sometimes people get excited to be read as a different gender than their agab. Some nonbinary folx see things the way you've described. For instance, I normally don't care what gender I'm read as. But, of course, it is perfectly fine to just feel like a feminine man. Dont feel like you have to put yourself into a box you don't feel fits.
Well I’m my experience men can be feminine without counting as nonbinary, it really just comes down to how it feels to you as difficult as that is. If you feel like you want to label yourself as nonbinary than you are nonbinary and if you don’t 
want to than you don’t have to just because you’re feminine
A point of confusion i have is: by that definition it feels like almost everybody would qualify as nb. Like, aren't most people at least a bit feminine and masculine? Where is the line? Not trying to discount anybody, just that's what my brain says, could be imposter syndrome or what have you but.
Exactly bro, I completely agree with that.
[removed]
This. Exactly this.
Same boat here! I don’t really feel like a woman but it also would impact basically nothing about my life to “come out” as enby? I’m fact I’m hesitant to “come out” bc the whole point is that I’m not clear on/comfortable with my gender identity so why would I make it a huge topic of conversation??? 

The big sticking point for me is that I’m very “curvy” which basically forces me to present fully “woman” (men’s clothes literally don’t fit) and take on all the societal bullshit that comes with that. So some dysphoria there…
Hmm, so, i guess here's something that may help you help me lol, in middle school i used to think to myself that maybe i was a lesbian in a boy's body, but like, okay with that? I never felt masculine at all. Nowadays, I'm really not sure, i don't know what's masculine or feminine beyond the super extreme examples that are frankly just examples of toxic masculinity or femininity. And i can't tell if I've just grown from back then and become more accepting of how i feel, or if i just got really used to the shell i put up to maybe get made fun of less for being sensitive and stuff
Oh this is a really interesting way to think of it, thank you. So... some people feel like their disembodied brain has a gender? That is... interesting. You have given me much to think on, I appreciate it.
That makes sense i spose, it's more just, i guess I'm struggling to figure out how much certain things matter to me, and what how much things might mean that i thought didn't mean anything lol
Well see, my issue is more, I'm struggling with figuring out how much certain things about it matter to me i guess?
I also identify as non-binary male! I’m not 100% sure since no one around me really uses the pronouns or name/nicknames that I put into place.
I think i struggle because i don't know if I'm comfortable, indifferent, or ignorant. Like I'm ok being called a man, but also I'd be fine being called a woman, I've been mistaken as one a few times and it did give me an interesting feeling, but I'm not sure if it was like, gender euphoria or just amusement at the fact i confused the people who did it lol. I enjoy defying the expectations people assign to gender, since i think the way most people perceive it is shitty, so seeing those people stumble over it is amusing. So i guess I'm just not sure how much if any of that amusement/happiness is like, relevant? I also don't know what euphoria might feel like. I think I'm general i just don't know what I'm looking for.
Oh, wowzers, thanks lol
See, for me, I think that until i started realizing, after seeing what others here said, maybe i had been writing euphoria i had experienced in the past off, i saw gender as more of a i guess tool to help others view you in a certain way. Now, i think maybe I'm starting to get it, still confused but
Best of luck figuring it out friend! I'm in a similar boat after hearing what people here said. Feel much more comfy in my nbness, gonna do some exploring, see what happens.
Do i get my Alphabet Mafia membership card now?
Gender isn't the same as personality or style. You're allowed to just be a feminine man and not put any other labels on it. If you're comfortable with the label then it's your label.
oh absolutely. i don't feel like anything and i thought i was cis for the longest time because every other cis person in my life also expressed not having a connection to their gender so i just thought gender was like- made up basically and i didnt understand non-binary folk, like how can you be both masculine and feminine when neither exist except as body types. yeah turns out i was pretty damn wrong oop. I really think a lot more cis people are trans than they realize just because it doesn't affect them. Never affected me either so I probably never would have known in any other environment. Does this make me de facto cis? Maybe. Does it diminish the fact that I don't feel like *any* gender at all? No. In the end the only way to judge this is just looking at yourself and asking if you feel like your agab, not based on other people or your idea of qualifying, but just what is *your* feeling?
Being a feminine man doesn’t make one non-binary. A feminine man is still a man. A masculine woman is still a woman. A person can be gender non conforming and still be cisgender. Being non-binary means falling somewhere outside of that man-woman binary. If you’re comfortable with being a man, even if a feminine one, you might not be non-binary. If you feel that ‘man’ doesn’t accurately describe your gender, then that’s another story.
I’m a trans man. I was born with a female body but I experience gender dysphoria around being perceived as female, and gender euphoria around being perceived as male. I have the symptoms of being trans such as feeling disconnected from my body, feeling sickened by the primary and secondary sex characteristics of my AGAB, and transitioning helps to treat these symptoms. This makes me trans.

**EDIT: NOT EVERYONE EXPERIENCES DYSPHORIA. Some people find gender EUPHORIA to be an easier indicator, as dysphoria can be hard to distinguish from other mental health issues. I do not suffer from anxiety, depression, or any other major mental health issues, so dysphoria is an easy indicator for me.**

This is going to be really simplified. People’s brains have gender, and those physical characteristics come in a spectrum. Most people have a binary male or female brain that aligns with their physical body. For some people, the brain develops gendered characteristics that differ from their body. This is how you get trans and non-binary people—dysphoria and euphoria are physical responses caused by whether or not the brain’s natural expectation (Gender A) lines up with perception of the body (Gender B).

However, I sometimes like to wear girl’s clothes (just like a cis femboy might). I think it’s fun to do makeup and paint my nails. I like wearing heels sometimes because being short sucks. This is a reflection of *personal style* rather than *gender identity*. 

Girls can be masculine. Boys can be feminine. **Unless they experience gender dysphoria or gender euphoria**, their preferences do not make them trans.

No one can tell you if you’re trans or enby. You have to figure that out for yourself—we can only share information. I recommend you do some reading on the LGBT and Gender wikis. You may learn about an identity that describes exactly what you are feeling.
You say that everybody could qualify as nb but that is a very nb way to think. Many people have very strong opinions on their assigned gender. Heck, look at toxic masculinity and the very perception of something as “girly.”
Gender is different than gender expression. If you were born and assigned male and consider yourself to be a man, you're cis. It doesn't matter if you like feminine things. If you identify with your agab you're cis. If so, congratulations! There's nothing wrong or lesser about being either cis or trans, they're just different. 

If you're looking for a label that fits you, maybe consider femboy? It literally means a boy who is feminine and doesn't inherently indicate being cis or trans.

I'm not saying definitively whether you are cis or not, it just sounds to me like you identify with your agab, but I am not you so I really can't say.
I think imposter syndrome might be at play here. If you’re at that level where you are beyond the gender binary in your thinking, you of course qualify but you can be whatever you want. Feminine men exist. Masculine women exist. But you’re here, maybe take a deep dive within to figure it out.
This is absolutely not true.
Not so. Being transgender just requires one to feel more comfortable as something other than one's AGAB. It doesn't require one to be uncomfortable with their AGAB. And that's an important distinction. Requiring discomfort to be trans pathologizes being trans, makes it a condition or a disorder or a disease. Being trans isn't a disorder, and requiring some negative experience in order to be trans means that being trans is something that must be managed, or treated, or cured. That's not ok. Trans people are valid in their identities, and don't need to be cured.
I'm glad we can be confused together; it feels validating. Here's hoping we both figure it out someday!
This may be something you just have to reflect on more. Gender is complex. And you don’t have to have an answer right away; even though it’d be really nice if it was that fast. It’s a journey to figure this stuff out. Don’t feel like you have to rush it. It can also help to talk with someone you trust and that will be supportive of you.
> ""maybe i was a lesbian in a boy's body, but like, okay with that""

OHMAIGAWD I THOUGHT THIS TOO! I'm afab and thought I was a gay guy in a girl's body but I never told anybody cuz it sounded like the stupidest thing in my own head. I'm not alone =TwT=

edit words
Omg in high school I used to feel like a gay flamboyant boy in a girl's body! Was also ok with that. No answers, I just completely relate to you in not feeling any connection to the concept of gender. I just can't understand it as separate by gender constructs or performance. It is def a completely individual experience. I'm not coming out yet, although I've been thinking of myself as gender fluid more and more, going from a cis type of identity to a more personal one. But no idea of what gender is or feels like ahah
I don’t know if anyone thinks of their gender in the context of their “disembodied brain“, but this thought exercise is useful in that it allows for thinking of your gender separately from your body and outward appearance. Your gender identity can be informed by your body and appearance, but your gender is it’s own thing. And it’s perfectly valid to feel like you don’t have a gender; that’s what being agender is. :)
well after torturing myself for like two years thinking about it all the time I found it helpful to just, stop. accept you don't know and that it doesn't really matter. I was like that for awhile, and then when I eventually revisited it I had more clarity.
That's completely valid. You don't have to know something right away, or ever. It's also okay if you'll never figure it out yk. Words are weird and the self is an even weirder thing. Don't overthink it too much or worry too much about, just so what makes you happy and comfortable
Euphoria is an intense feeling of happiness, some people describe it as being on “cloud 9.”

For example: every time I get called “androgynous” (very rare) or “sir” or a “man” I feel like I’m floating on clouds — I.e. I’m really really happy.

I think for you, you need to do some tests. Pick some pronouns that you think you might like and ask your closest friends if they would mind calling you those pronouns for a while —I’d say anywhere from a month to two months.

If at any time you don’t experience euphoria or if you experience dysphoria (the feeling of being in the wrong body, that you need to change your body to fit the pronouns, etc), then try out a different pair of pronouns.

Dysphoria isn’t the best indicator that it’s the right gender for you, in fact it can point to the opposite (I experienced dysphoria when I called myself “trans” — feeling as if that wasn’t the right gender/that my body didn’t fit that gender).

There is more than one type of non-binary pronouns than they/them so feel free to try any and all of them that sound/feel right to you.

Repeat this process until you find the pronouns that fit best for you.

If it’s he/him you could be either cis or non-binary.

If it’s they/them or a variation of they/them, you might be non-binary or somewhere under the agender umbrella.

If it’s she/her, you might be trans or non-binary.

If a combination of two or more of the above, you might be bigender, gender fluid, or non-binary with a specific gender (I’m a non-binary male for example).

Note: you don’t have to experience dysphoria to be trans.

Note 2: you can be non-binary but prefer specific pronouns (for example if you don’t fit in the gender binary but you prefer male or female pronouns).

Note 3: your gender expression has very little to do with your gender identity. An example is this: I’m non-binary male but I enjoy wearing dresses, makeup, and heels occasionally.

Feel free to choose whatever fits best for you and don’t forget to research. Read about the different labels and see if any describe what your feelings/comes close to what your feelings. That’s a good indicator that it might be a good fit for you.

I hope this helped!
You don’t have to know your exact gender. God knows I don’t (honestly I don’t really want to either. It’s just There). All I know is that I’m not a boy or girl, y’know? Whatever works for you works for you. Anyone who says something against it is being an asshole.
You nailed it!  Men can feminine without being non-binary or fluid. I would like to point out the music industry, Dave Navarro, Steven Tyler, Kirk Hammett all these masculine men have women’s flair in there style.
Heck, that really resonates, thanks, not sure where it leaves me since i have trouble *feeling* due to trauma, but at least i have an idea.
I think there's a distinction between how a cis person might feel like they're not really that strongly relating to their agab - because they're cis and it's just not a matter of contemplation for them, it's just their ""normal"" - and an agender person for example, who might feel very strongly about not being their agab because ""being their agab"" feels wrong to them.

""I really think a lot more cis people are trans than they realize"" is kind of a weird statement in that way. Because gender identity is self-prescribed. Someone's cis as long as they're saying they're cis tbh.
See, i don't know what comfortable versus uncomfortable in that regard would feel like
That makes alot of sense, i think i can safely say I'm nb. I'm... Curious with the trans label cuz, i have maybe experienced gender euphoria, i just dismissed it at the time possibly.

Also, I'm very confused on the topic of the term femboy, because i was under the impression it was kinda a slur towards trans folks, but that seems to be not the case, so... What constitutes a femboy i suppose?
See that's the thing, i figure there must be some other like, aspect of gender to relate to that isn't the toxic or extreme examples of each, but, i don't see them really?
This really resonates for me — I didn’t have the concept of trans/enby growing up but I just assumed that all AFAB people hated xyz feminine thing and were just being coerced into it by the patriarchy (dresses, makeup, heels, certain behaviors). So it was like, “I’m a woman and fuck the patriarchy”. As I’ve collected more life experience and interacted with more people I  realize that some people actually genuinely enjoy that stuff and started reflecting on my own gender and realized I’m enby (still fuck the patriarchy though)
I think the best way to say it, is i don't hate my agab, but i certainly don't think it's the best term to use, this whole thing has helped me figure out alot, like, i wouldn't really consider myself a man i don't think... But i don't know what I'd consider myself otherwise? Like, it's a weird concept to me, though i think I'm also not considering how I've changed my feelings about it recently too. I'm still very confused about gender being different from expression, like, what *is* it then, cuz if asked what gender i feel most like i guess I'd just shrug?
Do you have any kind of reasoning for that???
Same lol!
I KNEW I WASN'T THE ONLY ONE
Well, given everything that I've learned today, I'm more confident in the nb label, but I'm not sure quite what to do with that lol. Plan to experiment with some stuff though
It has helped a bit, i may try messing with pronouns, but I'm unsure how to bring it up, it feels like a weird ask
I just mean cis strictly in the sense that their gender is the same as their assigned one at birth, you can still *identify* as cis if that's not true. I mean yeah a cis person might not think about their gender but I mean like the cis(genderless) people that don't understand the concept of gender being not the same as sex because they don't know gender as a feeling. the cis(genderless) people who tell me they wouldn't care if they woke up a different gender. Or the cis(genderless) people that say they don't feel like a man or a woman. (yeah i thought this was the cissest shit ever lmao)
Well, I can only speak for myself, but when I have to do things like check a male/female box on a form, or when someone calls me a man or woman, or having to strictly identify myself as one or the other, it never felt right. It’s not always easy to explain what that feels like. If you’re cool with being a man, calling yourself such, being seen as such, etc. then you’re probably not non-binary. But where that line is, it can be different for everyone. Some people might be fine with it but still feel they are NB. But I think if it feels pointless to you, don’t feel you have to do it, either. You can be gender nonconformist, be a feminine man, etc, without being a different gender.
I felt a lot like yourself when I started this journey of self discovery I've been on. I've always felt quite comfortable in my masculinity, but I never had any attachment to my male-ness, if you will. Though that's not to say I was dissatisfied with it, quite the contrary. But the system of gender never made sense to me from a very early age for the same reasons you give in your original post. I think I understand how and why others identify with their genders but I personally just always felt somewhere outside. Could never reconcile it in my mind because I felt so comfortable in my skin. I'm not quite to the point of fully embracing my NBness. But something that helped me, that really gave me the push to move forward, was when I one day imagined friends using they/them pronouns for me. I've never in my life felt gender dysphoria, but in that moment, I think I experienced gender euphoria. If there can be such a thing. It's all still kinda scary to me and that's largely what holds me back. But I've decided who I want to be the first I specifically ask.

I hope that helps in some way.
Femboy is a slur if used to refer to a trans woman as a means of invalidating her gender.

Guys who enjoy crossdressing or intentionally dressing/doing makeup to look feminine, while still identifying as male, sometimes call themselves femboys, in which case it is not a slur.

Edit: In the first scenario it’s a slur because the person is telling a trans woman she falls under the second category—a man pretending to be a woman/feminine—when she *is* really a woman.
Not the person you were talking to, but most 30+ year old trans people I know say they don't have gender dysphoria.

Like this one lady who runs a p big trans meet group in Houston once told us: ""I don't have dysphoria, I wasn't uncomfortable with being a man, I just knew I wasn't one."" (Roughly translated from Spanish)
I mean this sub tends to throw the label nb at everyone and everything imo. Personally i also disagree with the whole ""you don't need dysphoria to be trans"" stuff cause it simply doesn't make sense in any way. Why would you want to be trans if you don't feel uncomfortable with your body or with how people percieve you? Men can be feminine/androgynous and women can be masculine/androgynous without being trans. You can like and dress however the fuck you want, use make up however you want etc without being trans. I feel like people start forgetting that it's okay to be cis. That's not a bad thing lol. You can be cis and still present however the fuck you want. You can even be cis and use a different name. 

The term trans is for people who transition imo... Not just through hormones n stuff but also socially - like changing your pronouns. But if you literally don't transition in any way, then you're not trans. Otherwise everyone would just be trans and then that word would loose it's meaning. 

I mean, i don't know how it's to be you and what exactly you experience. You gotta figure that out by yourself. But i think it's important to still keep that critical voice -- I'm not talking about the shitty voice that likes to tell us that we suck, i mean the critical voice that goes like ""wait, maybe there's more to this, maybe I'm wrong, maybe i should think this through again"". I'm constantly questioning myself tbh. I just don't like when people hear one thing that they like and then run with that without ever really reflecting if it makes even any sense. 

Like it's totally okay to think that you're trans and then realize that you're cis. Maybe I'm also just cis. I don't know. I just think it's annoying how everyone in this sub just encourages new people to identify as nb/trans when like -- that's not exactly a fun thing? It comes with a lot of problems. I don't know why anyone would want to be part of a discriminated minority... If you're perfectly comfortable with yourself and you just prefer stuff that's non-stereotypical for your AGAB thennn...congrats you're comfortable with yourself and know what you like! 

Sorry for this long rant, i just hope I'm getting my point across. I think self reflection is the key to a lot of problems we have cause sometimes we might see problems where none are, and maybe there's something completely different lying underneath that's actually causing us to feel unhappy with the way we are.
If they already know about the LGBTQ+ community, slowly bring it up in conversation with them. If not, introduce them to the concept patiently. They may have trouble accepting it at first, but they should come around.

That being said: if they frequently willfully use your dead name/pronouns despite you correcting them then they be transphobic and you need better a friend(s). Not everyone is like this so keep yourself safe and only come out to your friends if they are supportive of the LGBTQ+ community.

It may be awkward at first, but if you’re honest with yourself and them, then it should be fine and will get better and with time
I think i also struggle with the concept of the aspects of gender that are not based on presentation, like people are saying it's separate, but that confuses me because like, isn't the gender you identify as the one you would present? What other factors are there, not including comfort in one's body probably?
It does yes, like, i don't... Dislike my masculine traits, i will say with pronouns i feel even more off with it cuz like, i have trouble imagining anything other than being called he/him so idk if I'd like it, and i don't wanna change in case i don't, i hate certain things about my body that are from being male, but i don't dislike my genetalia really, i feel like I'm much more sensitive and soft than men are supposed to be but i don't really feel... feminine? Hope that made sense lol
Ahhh, so i was correct sorta lol
Well i just don't get why you would want to be part of a discriminated minority if you're not uncomfortable with the way things are. Why would you want to make things more complicated for yourself? 

The trans people i know experience really bad dysphoria and being alive is basically hell for them. They would literally kill themselves if they wouldn't be able to transition. They don't have the choice of just living as their AGAB. 

Also just because 30+ people say something doesn't make it more true. 30+ people can also be confused and wrong. Not necessarily saying that the person you mentioned is, because i don't know them, but to just believe whatever someone tells you without ever questioning it is extremely dangerous.
They makes sense, i feel comfortable considering myself nb at this point because 
A: in middle school when concerned about if i was gay (lol if only i knew), the best way i could find to describe how i felt was a lesbian who was okay with being in a male body. I've since found better ways to say that, but that still kinda rings true.
B: i have realized i think i have experienced euphoria on a few occasions when being mistaken for a woman, I'm uncertain for what reasons, i.e. if it was because they called me miss/ma'am and i want that or because i was thrilled at not being confined to my man box.
C: i think i may have been kinda writing off dysphoria i experience too, i don't have a problem with my genetalia, i am largely indifferent about my chest, at least i think, but i do HATE HATE HATE all of my hair except what's on top of my head
I trust they'd be supportive, it's more i struggle heavily with bring able to recognize my own feelings, so I'm scared of bothering people to make that change only to find that i didn't want it and have had them accommodate me for nothing. Which, i know is just my adhd/cptsd talking, but it's a hurdle I'll need to get over probably
I think ""presentation"" in general is complicated. Regardless of how I dress, I have wide hips and large breasts. So unless I want to go through the process of changing my silhouette I always ""present"" as cis female. Even though that thought makes me genuinely sad. Doesn't matter what clothes I wear. Best case scenario, people think I'm a tomboy or a butch lesbian. And personally I have neither the resources, nor the desire to do anything surgically, hormonally, or wear uncomfortable bindings. But sometimes when I'm getting dressed for the day I am full of existential dread about my presentation. At this point in my gender journey I call myself a femmeby or gender fluid, but sometimes I put on a dress and I'm FULLLLL of gender dysphoria and body dysmorphia. And I basically hesitate checking ant gender box on any form. I usually prefer to just tell people I'm queer-- and when they ask if I mean gender or sexual preference I just say ""yes"" lol
Honestly it sounds like you and I have similar but different experiences, but more or less same boat lol My whole life I've felt like I exist in a liminal space, like I'm made up of contradictions. I've always inhabitted this in-between-ness that was so in between it made me feel outside??
There's nothing wrong with asking people to try using different pronouns for you and deciding you prefer he/him (you can be nb and use he/him pronouns). I'm learning that it's very hard to know what you will enjoy until you give it a try.
Yeah, it’s all about context and intent
> want to be part of

I don't ""want"" anything. I am who I am. I didn't get to choose this, and it's not like I could choose *not* to be who I am.

> They would literally kill themselves if they wouldn't be able to transition

Why would suicidality be a requirement to be any gender? Why are cis people allowed to be cis without needing to feel suicidal?

> just believe whatever someone tells you without ever questioning it is extremely dangerous

On the contrary, listening to the experiences of other people is literally the only way to understand their experience of gender. It's not like height where you can measure it from the outside. It's like being hungry or left-handed or in love: it's an internal experience that requires the individual to self-identify and describe their own experience. There's no other way to understand someone else's gender experience other than to listen to them. The idea that we shouldn't listen to the experiences of others is absurd and, to use your word, dangerous. That's how discrimination happens for trans people: cis folks don't listen to the trans person's description of their experience.
> Well i just don't get why you would want to be part of a discriminated minority if you're not uncomfortable with the way things are. Why would you want to make things more complicated for yourself?

I feel this. I’m amab and I am somewhat uncomfortable with the gender binary, and feel non-binary, experience some dysphoria with my male presenting body, but I feel like I have to weigh my discomfort with the alternative of discrimination if I decide to change my presentation. Sigh
I used to think like this because I used to cry for hours about how much I hated my chest. I couldn't imagine how someone could go through the shit I was going through without feeling goddamn awful about it!

Getting on T alleviated a lot of that, and I started to see how suffering shouldn't be a requirement to know who you are.

And, for what it's worth,

The medical professionals who helped me, hell, not just them, but the entirety of Legacy, well known for specializing in the treatment of LGBTQ+ individuals, were accepting, and willing to help trans people without dysphoria.
Yeah so see, that's just exactly what I wanted you to do. Really think about it and question it and look at it from many perspectives. And turns out you do experience dysphoria. 

My intention was never to tell you you're not non binary. I also never said that. I just want to raise awareness that we can't just slap non binary onto anyone who simply doesn't confirm to gender stereotypes (which i feel like has become a trend in this community).
That does sound difficult. I’m sorta the same way, but if you just get it off your chest, then you might feel 100% better, even if it never goes anywhere 🤷‍♀️
Lol at that last bit, but, that makes sense, as someone who's never experimented with dressing feminine, i hadn't really considered the frustration of not looking the way you're trying to present cuz body doesn't work that way. I wasn't aware until a bit ago after posting this that dysphoria/euphoria/dysmorphia wasn't unique to being trans? So that also makes it make more sense
Yeah, also, as another person here put it, I'm so confused what a gender actually is idk how the heck I'm supposed to know i have one
>I don't ""want"" anything. I am who I am. I didn't get to choose this, and it's not like I could choose not to be who I am.

Then you are not who I'm talking about, are you? If you know who you are, then why do you feel attacked by my opinion?

>Why would suicidality be a requirement to be any gender? Why are cis people allowed to be cis without needing to feel suicidal?

You misunderstood. I wanted to portrait how much being trans can affect someone and that it's not just a quirky label you can use for yourself. It's obviously not a requirement, but something we should be aware of. 

>It's not like height where you can measure it from the outside.

If you would've read my comment properly you would've read that i don't know that persons experience so i can't judge them. All I'm saying is we should keep the meaning of the terms trans and non-binary and not just slap it onto anyone cause otherwise it'll just loose it's meaning. I'm trying to encourage people to reflect on their problems and identity and question themselves. That's the only way we can continue to grow as a person. Don't just accept something someone told you online or wherever. It's something you gotta figure out on your own by your own for yourself.
Yeah same in a way. I'm AFAB and presenting mostly androgynous but still on the feminine side so people just read me as lesbian or some bs because of stereotypes... I'm happy to have a supportive friend group but yah it's very strange. I don't think my dysphoria and struggles are as bad as the ones of binary trans people (judging by what I've seen my trans friends go through) so i always put their needs first. Society sadly won't just suddenly accept non-binary people. Not even cis women are treated the same as cis men. It's sad but we can't just be 3 steps ahead than the rest of society. Of course we should try to live our lives the way we want but at the end of the day we have to take care of sexism first and then the discrimination against binary trans people before society is ready to accept that there are also people outside the gender binary. I'll always fight for women and trans rights, but more because others need them.
Oh yeah, i get ya, didn't make me feel that way at all
True, and like someone else has reassured me, if they get mad for changing my mind later, that's on them, cuz it's not like i asked for that
I've specifically taken gender, women, and sexuality classes. I could give you a pretty detailed description of how academic spaces define gender but I personally still don't really get it. I might never, I think I just don't experience it lol but still have to navigate it
The best way for me was: what gives me euphoria? Talking about my experiences out of the gender binary gave me euphoria, and also a little fear. I kept exploring with pronouns, with labels (demigirl and genderfae were the ones that ""clicked"" for me) but yeah, there is no right or wrong way.

Also, some people are gender apathetic. Or agender. Humans are really varied and gender is an abstract way to experience yourself and your relation to society, how you would want to be perceived, called, etc ❤️
You might feel comfortable with us over in /r/agender. :)
> Then you are not who I'm talking about, are you?

My point is that *no one chooses their gender.* So, if you say it about *anyone*, you are wrong.

> why do you feel attacked by my opinion?

Because it actively harms transgender and non-binary people?

>  it's not just a quirky label you can use for yourself

Your argument is that being transgender is something so terrible that we shouldn't use it lightly because it will ""lose its meaning."" But it's meaning isn't terrible, so your assertion has no basis. If you recognize that being trans doesn't require any sort of discomfort, and that the discomfort some trans people experience is because of the society they live in rather than their identity, then you have to accept that the term being used for people who don't experience discomfort doesn't cause it to lose its meaning. 

If pain isn't part of the meaning, then using it for people who aren't in pain doesn't change its meaning.

> you would've read that i don't know that persons experience

Please. You were making generalized statements about people who are using the trangender label in a way you don't like. This was never about one specific individual. If you're going to make general statements about how people should label themselves, don't be surprised when someone responds about people in general.

> It's something you gotta figure out on your own by your own for yourself.

Exactly. It's up to the individual to decide if their experience is appropriately described by the label transgender. Ie, it's not up to *you*. You don't get to decide that people shouldn't call themselves trans, but that's what you've been doing this whole thread. If it's something we have to each figure out on our own, then it's not your place to dictate to someone else what words they use to describe their own experiences. Soooo, stop?
Okay good :)
Not the person you're replying to, but oh my god academic discussions of gender just absolutely melt my brain. I'm an anthropology student, and when we started talking about what gender is... well, I'm questioning my identity even more than previously because I just don't get it at all.
I'll be looking at it to see if it clicks better, got lots to research lol
I'm tired of explaining myself. You take fragments of my comment to interpret your perception of what I'm saying into them. Criticism is not something negative. It's okay to question people. It's okay wanting to make others think. What you forget is that people can also be confused and think they're trans when in reality they are not, but if no one ever is criticizing them and trying to look at what's really underneath their struggles they might become just even more confused and unhappy over time. Like of course we need to respect other people's experience, but sometimes their experience can also be fogged and they can't figure it out themselves. We shouldn't just encourage people to be trans. We should also actually question themselves. Cause surprise, cis people can be unhappy with their body or the way others percieve them too for multiple of reasons. This is so much more complex. There are so many layers and gender is just one of many. 

This is the last comment I'm writing on this thread. I've said everything i mean and idc if you continue to project this picture of the evil truscum onto me or whatever. If you only read what you want to read in my comments then it's not my fault that you can't think critical and view a topic from another standpoint. There is not just one truth or one right way to see a topic and if you want it or not, the opposite opinion to yours also has valid points that are worth to be considered.
>  idc if you continue to project this picture of the evil truscum onto me

The comment you've now deleted literally states that dysphoria is a requirement to be transgender, which is the single core component of the truscum point of view. I find it quite odd that you say you stand by everything you've written, but also deleted a comment you wrote.

Your position that we should restrict how people identify, and that dysphoria is a requirement to be trans, are both actively harmful to the transgender and non-binary population. It's entirely possible to encourage people to question themselves, and it's entirely possible for people to be cis despite having dysphoria, without gatekeeping our language or pathologizing our experience. I'm glad to hear that you won't be contributing such nonsense here anymore. Best of luck to you.

"Buying clothes on my vacation is so much fun! They ask me: ""For women or men?"". I ask, ""is there a difference?"". They laugh and show me whatever I want. And say ""People here are close minded and are not used to see that"". Goal achieved, normalizing NB in small towns."		"That is validating on several levels. How cool!

I'm happy that you had a nice experience.
It's great that they were just a little flustered rather than being hostile about it.
Omg that’s a gorgeous top! That’s an amazing find ❤️
You seem like a total ray of sunshine. Sending positivity to you ❤️
Ummm yeah I’m gonna need the name of this small town so I can get a cute top too ;) Looks great!

Up to now I haven't had a bad experience at a store. I guess that, as long as they sell, what do they care. Right?
Thank you!!
Thank you. The way my life is going, I'd be ungreatfull if I wasn't positive.
I'm on a roadtrip in the Yucatan Peninsula. From Tulum (near Cancun) , visiting beaches, colonial cities, magical towns, archeological zones, natural wonders and lots of people. As I indicated in another post, I was wary of people's reactions and didn't bring any andro or fem clothes. I was wrong. Some kids jiggle at my painted nails but more as a curiosity, and I've been asked if my brother is my partner :).

If you come here, I think you'll love the clothes. and the prices. (please don't bargain to the people selling in the markets and plazas, even the starting price will be lower than anything you can find in the US or Canada)
This top $11 USD. Had I bargained i couod have got it for $9 but $2 is not much for me but it's lots for them. I only bargain when the price is higher than what I can get in Canada (tourist prices) and it's usually at fancier places.
In this case it is San Cristobal de las Casas, Chiapas, Mexico. Check it out!
Thanks ;)

Staying up all night working on a large landscape design in my cozy clothes.		"Your cozy clothes are perfect.  So much appreciation for having safe little homes in which we can dress and speak and act exactly as we wish comfortably. 
That smile and eyes, you look delightfully cheeky!
your hair is fucking gorgeous. Mine does a similar thing, but it darkened years ago and I desperately wish I could get my anxiety-ridden butt to do the thing and lighten it already.
I LOVE your hair!! Both it and you are so pretty!
I spent thirty seconds trying to figure out where in your clothes the landscape design was, so. Whoops.

You do look great, though.
Thank you 😊
Thank you. 
Thank you! I super fucking love my hair! All natural color at this point although I'm wanting my stylist fiancee to do some balayage highlights. If you're in Asheville, which I'm sure you aren't, she could do anything you need. 
Thank you. I've wanted long hair my whole life but all the people around me always seemed to hate, not anymore!!! 
i'm not, but i'm not terribly far away from it! I'll keep that in mind next time I'm planning a visit! (which actually might be the 22nd, because Andrea Gibson is going to be there and her poetry is mind-blowing)

I could live in this jacket. What's your go-to gendercomfy clothing?		"Flannel and denim jackets, every time. I melt in the summer but these are the sacrifices we make for cuteness

Sidenote: ""gendercomfy"" is my new favourite term ever 
Metal hoodies, somehow :) my favorite is an Amon Amarth one
Oh I have one for this! Definitely one of my Japanese bomber jackets/""sukajan"" they make me feel like an 80s boy >:)
Joggers!!!!!! 
🎼Matt & Kim “Hoodie on”
Flannel and beanie!
big windbreakers or a super old sesame street varsity jacket hand-me-down. 
lookin' good, OP! for me, it's a pair of khaki cargo pants that fit well but are pretty ambiguous (and so utility!). and definitely tshirts from the boy's section of target :3
Best neutral clothes: skinny jeans, dark sweater, beanie, and sunglasses. It says ""Go the fuck away and don't ask me what's in my pants"" lmao

Also I SUPER love that jacket, it looks hella great on you! And your haircut is awesome too. You're just really beautiful!!
A “men’s” t-shirt and an unbuttoned Hawaiian or flannel shirt. 
Flannel, graphic tee shirt, and shorts/jeans
i like cut-off jeans with the ends cuffed and short sleeve button downs. big stepdad energy is my goal.
A skirt with soft fabric that flows/twirls nicely  plus a nerdy tee-shirt or hoodie. 
Black pants, big black tee, doc martens 
Oversized flannel and a band tee with skinny jeans and converse or vans and sometimes a beanie. That's pretty much my uniform.
Sports bra, jacket. 
That jacket is awesome and suits you! Nice hair too!


Loose polyester shirts, cargo pants, my binder, and boxer briefs. The first time I felt completely like myself :)
You’re super super gorgeous. 
Lmao mine is a really fancy dress I steal from my mom whenever I can 
My denim button up shirt!! Just a touch of classic masculinity that I like to go along with my androgynous look. I always take pictures in it lmao
Humongous tees perfect to swim in
This hooded tanktop: https://us.shoppressfashions.com/product/pullover-hooded-sweater-tank/

And this incredible velvet jumpsuit made by the same brand, that makes me feel like afab chubby David Bowie with tits. :p 
I love the term gendercomfy! For me it's big shirts and/or plaid/denim blouses :)
Denim jackets are life. Except they really limit shoulder mobility. You'd think in 2018 we'd have solved this.

:) Comfy makes everything better!
Fuck yeah 🤘 here for enby metalheads

Where do I get one of these :D obviously the internet
I'm glad we can all come together and say Target has a pretty great boy's section! And thanks!

can i be nonbinary transmasc without taking surgery or hormones?	"over the last year after a lot of questioning, i've come to the conclusion that i'm nonbinary transmasc (AFAB). i actually questioned if I was FTM as a teenager for 6 months  (down to cutting my hair and dressing like a boy and watching trans youtubers) but ultimately decided that being a binary trans guy wasn't for me. i spent most of the next ten years (from 14 to 24) bouncing back to the other binary and trying to be a cis woman but ultimately not being able to do so. two years ago i started to acknowledge my queer identity and explored my gender identity. about a year ago I realized that i'm definitely nonbinary transmasc. i'd say i'm more a boy than a girl but not completely a boy.

i don't think i want to take testosterone at least not now because i'm not sure i want all the effects. and while i definitely have significant chest dysphoria (my ideal body would have a flat/flat-ish chest) for now i don't want top surgery, because i'm able to lessen my dysphoria enough through clothing. am i still valid in considering myself nonbinary transmasc without taking any medical interventions? i've started to transition in other ways (ie. wear masculine clothing, stopped shaving my legs, prefer they/them pronouns although i'm not insisting on it)."	"[removed]
You can be whoever you want to be* and you don't need others' permission 😊

_*And that might change over time_
You can absolutely be so without HRT or surgery!
 I (AMAB) have been questioning quite a bit and for awhile thought I was transfem, but ultimately landed on just enby. 

I don't think I want to start HRT and I am currently not interested in surgery, but I absolutely consider myself trans non-binary.

I think about it like this non binary isn't just option 3 (after male/female) it is options 3 to infinity. It is everything that _isn't_ male or female. So if non-binary transmasc feels right and like it describes you, then it's 100% valid and awesome!
Hormones and surgery can help you feel more comfortable in your body, if that helps you feel more comfortable in your body. But they are nit required to be Trans of any flavor.
You could always start on a low low dose of testosterone and then go from there. I have a friend who is transmasc but had to go the slow route and they’re still getting a little of a beard and whatnot just slower. If you start taking it and it feels good and natural, then ask to go up.
Thanks, everyone for these comments. I'm not OP, but am going through similar struggles (never-ending wait times for HRT, it's been 2 years now), and I felt like I wasn't valid as a transmasc person, especially after seeing so many posts about people on hormones.

It was really affirming reading all this.
I am so damn glad the answers have been overwhelmingly positive. See, I think of myself as femme-leaning trans-nonbinary lesbian, but amab and not on medication/surgery. It's just the way I feel.
Yes. You don't have to transition in any way you don't want to
Yeah. Being transgender does not require any particular type of transition if that is not something you want.
yeah, I'm transmasc/nonbinary and in the same boat. Have questioned if I'm FTM, but don't fully feel that way and am not sure any kind of medical transition is for me. Sometimes get upset that being nonbinary is really not taken seriously by many people, but I know it's real for me. Even if some people see me as just a masc cis girl - the truth is my experience of gender is outside the norm regardless of what you wanna call it and IDing as nonbinary/transmasc feels most true to me. 

Gender is self-expression and self-exploration, and everyone should be able to determine what gendered things (clothes, pronouns, identities) they align with without having to prove themselves as valid. Gender norms & standards have always been something that is enforced, and gatekeeping trans-ness is an extension of that system. Being nonbinary is, for me, about rejecting that system completely.
You don’t need permission to be who you are
You should look up Ryan Cassata, he’s trans and has had top surgery but does not take T. Good role model :)
I think it's better than taking hormones or getting any other medical interventions done at all. I know that some people feel a lot better with affirming treatments, but gender is a social construct, right?

Just be a dude with a vagina. You're still a guy.

Sometimes I'm a woman with a penis. That's not invalid. Modifying my body is something I don't feel is necessary at all. This one works pretty damn well.
Aside from taking a couple of decades longer to come to the conclusion, I'm in the same place as you but opposite - AMAB, not wanting surgery or hormones, but asserting my gender choice in feminine clothing, starting to shave legs and preferring they/them over he/him but not really caring.

I'll never be, or look, binary feminine, and I chose not to be, or look most of the time, binary masculine, so I think that's a valid definition of being between the two, siding towards female gender, so non-binary transfemme would, I guess, describe me quite well (although just ""non-binary"" is probably sufficient) - and similarly non-binary transmasc sounds a perfectly acceptable box for you to sit in if you desire for a named box :-)
Yes. Ignore people who say you need to medically transition to be trans.
You are valid regardless of where you are in your transition or if you choose not to transition at all. 

You are valid regardless of how you dress, act, or talk.

 you are valid in the closet, you're valid if you're out. 

There is no requirement, you're trans if you feel trans.
You are in charge of how you identify/express your self! Read it again!!! 🫶
Yes! For me being nonbinary is a social thing. I don't want any surgeries or hormone therapy.
Yes
You don’t need to transition to be trans. You are 100% valid, if you feel like you’re trans, you’re trans.
Yes. Do your own thing. You define your own gender! Labels aren't made to be something restrictive that you need to conform yourself to.
You are valid as you are. I’m trans masc nonbinary. No hormones, sometimes I like my chest, sometimes it’s in the way and sometimes I’m indifferent. We’re both valid trans people
You can be anything you want to be, except for a rude person lol you owe no one anything, as long as you're happy, you win
Yes. You are who you are. Gender identity has one definition, how you perceive yourself, and ONLY how you see yourself. No one else can tell you who you are or make that decision for you and there are no requirements. I know it’s messy and anxiety riddled at times but don’t over think it. Just be your favorite you 🤷🏻
Yes!
yes you can <3
Simply, yes
Yup!
Whatever you feel and whatever you present yourself as, you are valid! Even if it doesn't fit into any boxes like we're used to. You are what you call yourself and nobody can change that.
Of course you can. I am
YES. BYE.
yep
you are just as trans as someone who does medically transition. i'm nonbinary transmasc and i'm on a SUUUPER low dose of T because i'm terrified of growing a beard. i'm still trans, and so are you :)
Trans and nonbinary are umbrella terms! You can use as you wish, as long as you identify different than your assigned gender at birth and don't fall within the ""binary"" of male vs female! Technically all nonbinary people are trans(I think / afaik) and you can identify however vague or precise as you like!
explaining isn't needed. it's always going to be yes
Yes.
What way you express yourself or identify yourself is yours. But if you feel unconfident about it I know this other non-binary whom is transfem.... They are more girly than the girls we all know. And as it stands they don't take any meds and just do that with clothes.
We need a bot that just responds to every post beginning with ""can i be non-binary if..."" with ""yes""
you can be whatever you want to be there are no rules except the ones you make for yourself
you are valid, you are you and only you can say who you are <3
is it okay to call myself trans? i definitely don't feel cis.
I reallyyyyyy vibe with your avatar and username lol
If it’s social what is the difference between non-binary and gnc?
are you going to take T for a predetermined time and then stop or cycle on/off? or just feel it out and see how it goes?
[removed]
Trans doesn't mean ""transitioned"". It means across, different from.

Most trans people transition either socially or medically in some way. But even if you don't transition at all, being nonbinary means you're ""across"" from the gender you were assigned at birth — you weren't assigned to be nonbinary at birth after all!
Definitely, yes!
Absolutely you can.
Trans included everyone who does not identify with their gender assigned at birth, so obviously including nonbinary people.

But I do get the feeling, cuz when cis people say trans they usually mean binary trans people (usually only those who fully transition sadly), so oftentimes I also feel like I don't fit into that description of trans, that cis ppl have started to understand and use.
I don't get complements all too often. And I've had this one pop into my head randomly at least once a day all week.

So, thank you.

Idk for me at least, I definitely have gender dysphoria even though I don't want (right now) hormones and surgery. Also, I feel nonbinary even if I'm wearing a dress or naked lol. I've never felt like a woman regardless of what I'm wearing or how I'm presenting. And I don't quite feel like a man either (though I think that feels more aligned than being a woman).

So socially transitioning (ie. clothing, pronouns, not shaving etc) helps lessen dysphoria and makes my gender presentation more aligned with my gender identity.  Hormones and surgery can also do that, but for now I don't know if it's necessary for me. Maybe down the road that'll change.
I don't know, I'm still discovering my identity and some of those terms are pretty new to me. For the most of my life I lived as gay intersex male, being nonbinary is recent and I'm sorry if I say something wrong or confusing about it.
my plan rn is to feel it out. since i’m on such a low dose changes will come slowly so ill have time to adjust to whatever does happen
thank you guys, this thread was extremely affirming!
Ah, so the way you've decided to transition is what's social then, not your identity. That makes sense.
That's ok. I just think it's really important (for everyone) to know that social roles and presentation are a very different thing from gender itself. Trans people can be GNC too, but it wouldn't make them cis, you know? They're completely separate, like orientation.
I know. I can speak just from my point of view, I'm not trying to make an assumption about the whole community. I have that problem that I'm not trans and cis either so it's hard for me to fit in some spaces.
Yeah, I get that"	10jeq7l	NonBinary	199	0.97	2023-01-23 15:12:09
So, I make clothing and sell them on Etsy... What do you think?		"I actually already had a few items favorited for later!
Are links aloud? Cause I want femboy clothing and wish for you to provide link.
The design is actually really good ngl, most Etsy or Threadless designs can just be notable for being off-putting, off-the-wall, or sticking out (in a bad way). This is very cool!
I absolutely LOVE this 🥲
I love it, you’re gorgeous, and it suits you (if I can say that?) ❤️
😍
It looks great! can i ask what material you use?
What’s the shop name? I’d love to take a look ^_^
That's so cool!!!
Very nice, I like the design
Looks great. I’m a bit too shy for such bodycon outfits though.
That's pretty dope tbh
Really?!
The link to my store is in my page. I keep getting more yelling at me for posting links.
Thank you!
There’s definitely 4-way lycra/spandex in there, probably blended with polyester/acrylic.
The link to my store is in my page. I keep getting more yelling at me for posting links.
I can create more clothes that hide a bit more of the body.
🥰
🥰
Yup. One of the bodysuits, and a skirt - could be more, but I don't necessarily align with all the identities represented.
This
Thanks. It might be something to look into when you’re widening the scope of your shop :)
Which do you align with? I'm constantly expanding categories.
I'm always growing my product catalog. My goal is to have at least 250 items available for purchase by the end of March.
Under some definitions, I could qualify as transgender, but I usually choose not to go with that label - I do love the associated colors though. 

Otherwise, I go by nonbinary for most things.
Awesome. Wishing you the best towards that! ✨
I do plan on releasing more non binary clothing"	11an4mh	NonBinary	195	0.97	2023-02-24 09:13:57
After around 2 years of being somewhat closeted, a couple of days ago, I came up with a new name for myself: Koi! I also cut off all my hair recently and am starting to replace my wardrobe with more affirming clothes. Life feels good when I stay true to myself. ♡		"Hi Koi!! What a beautiful chosen name! Keep staying true to you, it's so lovely to see people find happiness by choosing their own path. Much love to you!!
Happy for you Koi❤ 
Stay true to yourself. Wish you all the best for your future.
you look great, koi! wish you all the best in your further transition, my friend :)
Oh! Koi is a really nice name!
thank you so much! much love to you as well. ♡
thank you!!
aww, thanks!! :D
thanks! there were a lot of reasons i chose it, one of them being that it’s a Choctaw name and i have Choctaw roots. i also love fish and have one as a pet, which makes me feel very connected to the name! it only felt right :)
>thank you!!

You're welcome!
Oh! I didn't know that, thanks for telling me! I thought it was also a really nice name because it also means 'Love' in Japanese. What does your name in Choctaw mean?
In Choctaw it means panther!
That sounds really nice! It suits you well!"	tie52q	NonBinary	197	0.99	2022-03-20 05:31:41
So, I’ve finally lost enough weight to wear clothes from when I was a teenager (currently 24).		"Your outfit looks great but I honestly can't stop looking at your face, those are some sharp cheekbones damn ! I also love your hair. Any chance you could share more pictures of your hairstyle (sides and back) that I could show to my hairdresser ?
That’s cool! I love all the clothes I have from when I was a teen- I have some great things. It especially helps because I dressed more fem where I dress way more masc now, so I still have some options.
Thanks! I’ll see if I can find more pics of my hair. It was a number 2 fade originally, but it grew back. I’m actually growing it out to be able to wear a man bun haha.
Yeah! I usually dress masc because I lean more that way, but I’m kinda tip toeing back into some femme stuff again. I’m learning that it’s okay to have feminine traits."	jex5n9	NonBinary	196	0.98	2020-10-20 19:50:21
Tried shopping in the little boy’s section and found clothes that actually fit my string bean body. Baby’s first Enbie thirst trap.		"I love it! You look great 🥰
I love those boxer briefs.
You look great!
cute baby is cute
I find it reprehensible that enbies can't be thirst traps. I am not interested in sex, but I am interested in looking adorable and hot. You do you, and you look great. The allos from any gender will be interested.
Thank you bb!
Thank you! I’m quite shy so this took a lot of courage to share with strangers. Luckily, this community is full of kind and beautiful people so I felt safe.  <3
Thank you. I worry about that sometimes. I identify as pan and I worry that my look will push people I’m attracted to away, but honestly, fuck em. The right one will like me for me."	luypgz	NonBinary	190	1.0	2021-03-01 03:22:38
I do love being in feminine clothes but corgis are also kinda awesome lol		"awwwww cute corgis 🥰
I think you look *amazing* in both shots!
I wouldn’t say kinda awesome, I’d say totally awesome! (Also omg you look fantastic)

Some days I just go without any makeup and on the masc-presenting side. I get those negative thoughts that I’m not being true to myself. When I think that way I just have to remind myself: “it’s all about who you are within your soul. makeup, clothes, and hairstyles are just extra”		"Omg yes ❤️ this is what I needed to hear today (and honestly most days)
Right on!

I also know that feeling.
There is no right or wrong way to be true to yourself. The only person you need to be true to... is you. Don't let guilt or outside pressure stop you from being who you are. The only person who needs to be happy with you... is you. You owe nothing else to anyone. 

Truth is, there is no right way to be non-binary. Some folks feel the need to transition in some way and some don't. I myself am agender but still ""look"" mostly masculine as a AMAB. But, I am definitely agender. I honor myself in my own ways.

Forcing yourself to be something you are not is no different than yielding to general societal pressure to be a binary gender. 

So, I would hope you do you. Do what makes you happy. That is all that matters.

Best to you...
Whoa, this post really helped!! You're 100% right and you look awesome ☺️
I try to be happy with my identity as I lay in bed at night  when no one is judging me. Gender expression during the day always sucks, but I try to be happy with myself. I remember that I don't owe anyone else anything.
That is an excellent reminder! Thank you!"	lve862	NonBinary	194	1.0	2021-03-01 16:59:29

New clothes style - with or without the necklace		"With necklace, it’s too nice to not wear it <3
With!
With please I love the tooth necklace!!!! Where did you get it ? Love your style :)
The tooth. Always with the tooth. Make it your “thing” if it isn’t already. 

Random group of 2 passerby’s: “Yo that tooth necklace is sick” “Oh that’s (your name) they wear it all the time, suits them too!”
That 2005 Doctor Who backdrop pattern arose some serious nostalgia for me.
Wow I like your style! very dapper!
Definitely with!! Awesome outfit all round! The necklace is just the perfect finishing touch and the whole ensemble looks like it suits you very well 😎
You look great! This is exactly how I want to look once I get new clothes and cut my hair this year😃
100% with the necklace. It adds a nice flair. But you look great either way! Do what you think fits your aesthetic the best!
Both are cute!!! With or without. ALSO YOUR SO HANDSOME/GORGEOUS
Also Thank you so much guys, never expected so many people to reply and be so kind. Love you all!!!
With the necklace for sure
You look hella good, personally I would say without, as I'm not a big fan of tooth necklaces
Definitely with. Accessories are key.
With necklace
Thank you! I’m doing it as fuck you to my parents because deadnaming and mainly because i look hot in it

I just want to say this out loud and see how it feels.	"I am nonbinary.

I'm assigned male at birth. I'm in my mid 30s. I work in a very masculine field. I have a big beard and I wear masculine clothes.

But I am not a man. I never have been, and I've always known it. I have never felt like I really belong in masculine spaces. I have wondered if I was trans, but I'm definitely not a woman either. Only recently have I entertained the notion that the word ""nonbinary"" might describe me.

I don't care if other people see me as man or call me a man. But I think it might settle my soul a little to stare at this truth and give it a name.

I guess I would like to hear some folks who understand this better. What does this mean? What does it imply? If I ever decide to be out and open, what can I expect? Are there any resources for folks like me? Other subreddits?"	"I also came to the conclusion that non-binary applies to me in my mid thirties. It's never too late to understand yourself better. In terms of presentation, there's no way to ""look"" non-binary, and presentation isn't defined by gender anyway. You can be non-binary and rock that awesome beard, and a pretty dress. No rules in that regard. Gender is an *internal* experience, and isn't defined by the way we express it. :)
I'm also in my mid 30s. I realized I was nonbinary earlier this year.

I think you get to decide your own meaning/implications, but you're allowed to copy other people's homework if you like what they decided. For me, being nonbinary puts SO MUCH STUFF about me into a context that finally makes sense.
I hear you.

I'm AMAB as well, and a few days ago (right after my 27th birthday) I realized that I'm non-binary thanks to browsing this subreddit. Just saying it out loud to myself was so powerful and I'm the happiest I've been in my entire adult life. Even though the only thing that's really changed is how I perceive my gender, it feels like just admitting that truth changed EVERYTHING in my life and made it better. Like, I didn't realize how much dysphoria I was having until I had the gender euphoria that came with accepting an enby identity, and even though my body itself is still the same, living in it with this new understanding of my identity has made me enormously more comfortable. I can't really answer your last few questions as I'm out only to my bff and my partner of many years, but am planning on spending the next few weeks exploring how I want to express myself. But you're not alone in this! Hope this helps :)
Yes! Welcome, sibling! 🫂
You are telling my exact story homie. I see you. There are more people like you out there. I am 35, AMAB & came out 2 years ago, both to my partner and my family. It was very hard, but I have never felt happier and more whole. I now go by they/he pronouns, but working in a masculine/conservative field I still choose the spaces I am open & out in. This might change, but while this journey is so new for me, I feel like it’s okay for me to protect or prioritize my emotional safety for now as I build stronger ground beneath my feet. Whenever you decide to be out is okay, but you got a community here if you need
AFAB and 33. I had a very similar realization, although it happened differently. I had shaved my head a couple years ago and when my hair was short I kept getting misgendered as a man, and it didn't bother me. I actually liked the feeling of being seen as masculine instead of feminine. I know I'm not trans too, since I had my uterus and ovaries removed (for medical reasons) a lot of my dysphoria lifted, but I don't feel like I need to change any other parts of my body. 

Right now, I really don't care how people view me: man, woman, whatever. As long as I can wear a lot of men's clothes, lift weights, keep taking all my HRT, and live as authentically as I can, that's all that seems to matter to me at the end of the day.
I’m 47, I’m one of the best fly fishing guides on planet earth. Hahaha! At least that’s what everyone says! :) manly?! Nope but I did spent 5 years in the Alaskan wilderness with a gun on my back.  Oh yeah! Non-binary and proud AF
So... how did it feel? 😊

I was 39 the first time I wore a dress, tights, and motorcycle boots to Pride, while still sporting my beard. I loved it. Like you, I always knew I wasn't a man, but didn't really feel like I was a woman--there were *definitely* things I'd like to have been different about my body (and now I'm most of the way there). I used to also think I didn't mind being seen/treated as a man, turns out I was wrong on that count.

As far as what to expect when being out and open? Hard to say, I've stopped attempting to conform to societal expectations as of a couple years ago, the last time I attempted to ""boymode"" was when we got a car checked out at the mechanic last year. So even when I went from my highly-accepting area to Omaha NE for a week in May, all I really did was dial down my eye makeup a little, and I got looks, but no open harassment. Here where I live, I get looks, but I also get *so* many compliments.

It's not exactly hoppin' but there's also r/NonBinaryOver30
Are you autistic? This reads like an autistic experience of gender to me. /warm 

Of course, you don't have to be autistic to be non-binary but there are a lot of autistic people talking about their gender these days and it seems to have a lot in common with your description. Specifically the ""I don't care if people perceive me as a man, but I don't feel like one"". 

Just a thought. :) I could be totally wrong, but I wish someone had suggested autism to me a decade ago, so I'm just out here trying to be that person for other people.
I feel you. Wish you the best
I’m in the same boat as you I think. AMAB, 34, I have a masculine body and presentation, am fine with being seen as a man, but I don’t always see myself or identify as male, and definitely not as female. I know Demiboy is probably what I would fall under, but I am not really a fan of the term. It doesn’t have to mean or imply anything, only what you make of it. I’m pretty new to this as well, and while it’s on my mental list of things to think through more, I have more pressing life issues to handle first. Needless to say, welcome friend!
I’m the same, but AFAB and presenting femme. I don’t care how people perceive me, but it has helped immensely to identify as nonbinary because I never felt fully like a woman or a man. I’m just me and that’s somewhere outside of the binary.

My day-to-day looks pretty typical of someone in the binary, but I have found community in queer spaces and connection to people who allow themselves to freely be as complex as I feel on the inside. It’s wonderful. 

Sometimes I tell people that I am nonbinary and often have good and educational conversations about it. I have also experienced invalidating commentary, but I remind myself those people aren’t yet at a point in their life journey to see beyond themselves and that’s okay for now. We are all learning and growing.

I have a lot more confidence as an individual than I ever have in my life (I’m 31 now). I feel like I can move with more ease because I know who I am and it doesn’t matter how others think of me because they are almost always wrong anyway.

I’m proud of you for looking at your truth and being brave enough to embrace it. I hope it eases your soul the way it has mine.
I think I realized when I was 32 or so, I'm now 35. Like you, I have a big beard and I very much look like my AGAB, but to me it has nothing to do with masculinity, I just think I look better with a beard than without one and I've had a beard since I was 17 or so. Also like you, I don't feel like I fit in with masculine ideas and I know I'm not a woman either, so I usually use the term agender to describe me. I'm not a man, not a woman and nowhere in-between. I'm just me.
All your feelings are valid and you belong here. Welcome!
Ooooph.  The feels.  

I could have written that myself.  Thanks for posting, its validating hearing from other masc appearing, bearded, NB folks.
When I first realized, there was a time where nothing externally changed, but it was still a big deal. A bunch of mental white noise just disappeared as soon as I stopped comparing myself to the ""me as a man"" that just was never going to exist.

I stopped worrying about being called out over ""feminine"" body language. I stopped having to make excuses to myself about how men can do this or that ""woman's"" hobby, too. And the thing is, I was raised to _not_ believe in those gender stereotypes, but they still ate at me... until I let go of saying ""I'm a man, I guess.""

Your deep friends, the ones that see you as meaningful in their lives, you won't have problems. Everyone else... expect to be disbelieved fairly often, sometimes vocally. Ultimately though, they don't know you, and have just demonstrated their unwillingness to learn. On the other hand, if you do live openly, it seems like your sense of self is ideal for being an advocate for the fact that non-binary doesn't just mean ""quirky woman"". Well, that's my experience in my area, but I hope it helps!
Very brave. Welcome.
41, nonbinary trans guy, only figured out any of it during the pandemic. It's not too late. It's never too late. And finding yourself can be scary at times, but it's so completely worth it. Welcome to the crew!
Or OP could rock the beard, the masculine clothes, and any other masculine appearances that they want and use any pronouns that they want and still be non-binary too!
>For me, being nonbinary puts SO MUCH STUFF about me into a context that finally makes sense. 

You speak my mind with this. In order to love myself I have to know myself. And in order to know, myself I have to be honest with myself.
I fly fish too! Mostly little Appalachian brookies.
It feels good. I'm kind of nervous to talk to my partner about it even though I know she is going to be fine with it.

I already kind of dont always dress super masc. I live in a progressive college town in the middle of Appalachistan, so its a strange dynamic for me. In town I feel fine wearing short shorts and long pink socks, but out in the county I feel the need to be a little more masculine.
No. But I have adhd, so I'm not neurotypical. Thats interesting about gender and autism, the first NB friend I ever had is on the spectrum.
Yeah, I don’t know any masc appearing, bearded NB folks (at least, I think I don’t!) so I never truly considered I was NB until recently. Still figuring it all out, but reading other experiences close to mine helps!
This is really interesting! All the enby people I know personally use they/them and present differently now (either less masc or less femme than they used to). I’m 24 and questioning, but don’t feel like I’d be seen as a “real” enby since I’m unlikely to change up my style or appearance. The world would still see me as a man (which I’d feel ok with, like the op) but I still feel like I’d have to justify it to other people, esp the enby people irl who only know me as a cis man.
Fly fishing is extremely heterosexual white male. I spent 20 years as a professional before coming out. I was out in my private life mostly, but over time it just became harder and harder. Over time, I started to hate fly fishing. I was loving my life and having to be.........super masc guide bro! Was such a drag, it still is. :(.  I’m currently working to promote diversity in fly fishing and that makes me happy
Same.  I always assumed I couldn’t be enby, just cause I had a beard and had a more masc appearance… silly me.  

I’m still figuring it out as well, but so many things from my youth suddenly click if with the nb identity.     Like how I was upset as a kid I didn’t get “pretty” clothes like my sisters and certainly not really fitting in with super masc scenes.  I got damn good at faking it over the years tho, especially when I worked at a lumber mill when I was younger. 

Wish I had the vocabulary to recognize and discuss it back then, would have saved a ton in therapy bills 😝
If you don’t feel like a man, then you don’t have to identify as one, simple as that! You can be totally comfortable having a stereotypically masculine appearance and still be non-binary. Just like you don’t have to be a super masculine man to be a “real man”, you don’t have to be super androgynous to be a real non-binary person
I think the sport is changing.  Ive been enjoying a lot of small stream Tenkara lately.
I'd love to hear more about the things you're doing to promote diversity in fly fishing.

(20+ years later and I'm still mad that the Harrisburg Fly Fishers banquet wouldn't allow women fly fishers to attend. (Still don't? IDK.) (Oh, but they'd have Joan Wulff as a speaker!) Fucking boys club. You don't want your non-fishing wives there that night? FINE. I get it. But let non-male fly fishers in! You don't even have to change your god damned name.)
More flyfishers!

My dad guides & teaches fly fishing as his primary business! He also sells flies and gives presentations & seminars, too. (He used to teach at a camp when I was a kid.)

I (AFAB) grew up with him teaching me how to fly fish and tie flies. I was often the only non-man on the stream but it never bothered me. (Yet another example of me being most comfortable as ""one of the guys."") I don't really do it anymore but I'd love to talk it with people, as I have all of this knowledge and no outlet for it. (I think my partner is tired of me taking him to Bass Pro Shop and teaching him what all the stuff is. ;) )

I grew up in South-Central Pennsylvania, surrounded by heritage limestone (and freestone) trout streams like the Letort, Yellow Breeches, Big Spring, etc. (My dad literally moved there for the fishing.) I've fished the sulphur & whitefly hatches plenty of times. (I didn't say I was any GOOD at it, but... ;) )

I've fished steelhead runs on the Great Lake tributaries (Dad's about to go up to Erie for 2 weeks again to guide & fish). I've also saltwater fly fished before with my dad when we'd go to the beach as a kid. Ever caught a flounder on a fly rod? I have. It's fun! Stripers/rock fish, too.

In fact, my parents backyard (at the foot of an Appalachian mountain) has a little spring-fed creek in it and sometimes we can catch wild brookies in it.
>Harrisburg Fly Fishers banquet wouldn't allow women fly fishers to attend

That is some bullshit. When was this?
Nice! I learned to flyfish in saltwater in S Florida.  I moved north a couple years ago and started fly fishing around here, and I found I was having a lot more fun and catching more fish with a Tenkara rod.
The '90s. I have no idea if the banquet still happens, and if so, if it still has that policy. It may still, IDK.

afab enby feeling unwelcome in women’s spaces	"i started identifying as nonbinary 4 years ago and i’ve noticed a few changes over time. over the past year, a lot of subs on here and other platforms have doubled down on being “girls only” and “women only”. even some have stated in their rules that only women should make top level comments or posts. i got banned on my alt for commenting on a “girls only” flaired post about which fucking razors work the best. i wasn’t defensive about it at first but a mod and other users practically attacked me saying i’m not a girl so i can’t contribute. going as far to say they don’t do this in our subs so we shouldn’t do so in theirs. 

i’d be more than understanding if they just said it’s women only and i should respect that but attacking me and gatekeeping a question about razors? i’m sorry i didn’t know shaving the pearly bits was exclusively a woman thing. it’s frustrating because they worded their arguments as if their “girls only” questions pertained to anything about being a girl. it was just talks about crushes and where to buy cute clothes… but, women-only. so i digress. 

am i invading their spaces? should i not be there? i was brought up and socialized as a woman for 18 years (finally moved out hallelujah amen) so it’s not like my experiences are any different from a woman’s. i understand that i label myself differently now but that doesn’t erase the fact that i will always be perceived and treated as a woman. i’ll always have the same struggles, if not more, as a woman. but now i feel i shouldn’t be there nor am i wanted there. 

my conclusion is that i should respect their spaces just like they respect ours. it just hurts a little to realize i’m no longer accepted in those spaces anymore because of how i identify. running out of safe havens here lol

edit: i was made aware that saying “socialized as a woman” is terf rhetoric so in the future, i’ll stray away from that reasoning. i absolutely never wanna sound like i’m excluding trans women. thank you guys for the replies :) a lot of you came to the same conclusion that i did so i think i just have to work through my feelings on this and eventually create my own space for trans folk and femme allies"	"Sounds like a sub with immature children in it. I don't think you did anything wrong. It's sound more like TERF attitude to me.
Sounds a lot like some other subs recently. It's happening in many different places right now, even places that weren't meant for just women in the first place.

I'd say you didn't do anything wrong. We're just in a period in time where people are struggling, feeling alone and out of control. We latch onto anything that makes us feel heard and safe. If that means silencing someone else, so be it, unfortunately. No time to be empathic towards others when you're barely able to keep yourself together in the first place.
Do you identify as femme in some way? I mean I do understand the need for women to have spaces just for them, but if you're femme identifying that might leave more room for you. 

I actually have a very different view on this. I really dislike when people say ""women and enbies only"", because it reduces all non-binary identities to ""woman lite"". I was AFAB, but I definitely don't think I was socialized as a girl. I was so deeply unhappy being forced into the ""girl"" box. And I think it's good to be aware of that language, because TERFs love telling transwomen that they're not real women because 'they were socialized male' which isn't true.
That’s very upsetting. If they want their own space, I’m glad to stay far from it. People like that just can’t handle the fact that gender is a spectrum and that you can be femme and not a woman. Sorry you had to go through that. :(
Do you think they reacted the way they would have reacted if you were a man? Or was it some other type of way?

Because if their reaction would make sense in the context of a man commenting in a women’s-only sub then I feel like this might be an adjusting-to-what-being-AFAB-but-not-a-girl means in terms of the ways we interact with women. 

Privilege etc. isn’t a simple 1-1, so this topic can be tricky to talk about, especially online. But I’m AFAB, too, and rethinking my position within patriarchal hierarchies as well as the transition of woman to ally-to-women are things I’ve been thinking about a lot the last couple years.

If their reaction was transphobic or they don’t include trans women then, yeah sure, fuck them. 

But like, if you know the rules in a specific sub are women-only should make top level comments then it doesn’t really matter how well-intentioned you are, you’re not respecting a women’s-only space by commenting and women don’t owe you niceness about that.

It’s a headtrip to think about it in those terms because as nonbinary people we are not as privileged as, like, cis men. 

It can test your feminism, I think, to find yourself on the outside of the group “women,” esp. if feminism was ever a major part of your identity.

But the fact is that **not being a woman does mean you don’t get free access to women’s spaces, lmao.**
Yeah I used to be in a lot of sapphic spaces that made it overt that all genders were welcome and slowly one by one they all got widdled down to women's only lesbian spaces.

It comes with this rhetoric that ""intersectionality waters down women's specific issues"" but if you feminism is watered down by black women, queer women, disabled women, marginalized genders that have kinship with women and gendered discrimination then who the hell is it for?
I’m sorry you had to deal with this. This is obviously not cool and bordering on being kinda terf-y. They are reinforcing gender as this kind of bastion that has clearly defined lines, which is absolute rubbish. Personally I’m agender, but am afab and was socialised as a woman. Bc of this I find women’s spaces to be useful to me in a way that men’s spaces aren’t bc they align more with my life experience and the issues I deal with. That should be more than enough to justify the existence of ppl like us in those spaces. Marginalised identities should not be kicking downwards ffs.
I understand women wanting a space for themselves. I think, for all the bullshit they deal with and oppression they face, they deserve that. 

If they chose to let enbies into their space that's nice, but I'd be wary of them specifying AFAB enbies only because then it feels like they're just viewing us as women-lite and excluding AMAB enbies as 'secretly just men.' 

Maybe more generalised queer or LGBT spaces could be a better fit
Reminds me of askwomen. I got banned from there for pointing out that most of the answers on a question were transphobic. But mods say ""trans women are women!"" And ban only the most overtly obvious transphobia, so insinuating that they allow transphobia on the sub is *gasp, clutches pearls*  me trying to stir the pot and not indicative of a problem on their end. Pardon me, for pointing out the truth.

The sub is allegedly not exclusive but I got my comments removed or downvoted several times before I got banned just because I used the Nonbinary flair. No where was it a rule that non-women couldn't contribute. And the specific questions I was getting removed from weren't even asking *men* to sit out. I usually avoided those or the ones that said ""Ladies, how do you XYZ"". It was literally just targeting me for my flair

I think it's half cis women being aware that Nonbinary people are not women, which is good, and thinking the right thing to do is a hard seperation, which is ehhh, and half cis women being extremely enbyphobic, which is obviously not good.

LesbianActually also has this issue a lot. A thread will absolutely shit on Nonbinary Lesbians and then a mod will delete it because transphobia is against the rules. But the cis lesbians aren't hostile to trans *women* so they refuse to admit shitting on Nonbinary lesbians is transphobic, and keep rehashing the same ""why can't we have our own space"" rhetoric. (Own space away from what? Other lesbians??)
On the one hand I fully understand your struggles, on the other hand the only solution I can see would be to create a ""women and afab enbies"" space, which would itself create a ton of problems (should trans women be then excluded since they weren't ""socialized as a woman"" like you were?)
Terfs. Terfs everywhere
Okay, here's a question for you: would they treat an amab enby the same way? Should they?

A lot of ""women's spaces"" actually welcome anyone who is a woman *or afab.* As an amab enby, it's incredibly frustrating, because there are very few spaces where I'm welcome. It's pretty uncommon for a ""women's space"" to actually be exclusive to women. I know a lot of afab enbies are frustrated about this too, feeling like they get seen as ""woman lite"" and their gender isn't actually respected.

I guess what I'm wondering is, do you think this space *shouldn't* be exclusive to women? Or do you think that you should be counted as a woman? Or something else?
That really sucks. Tbh i read the rules of subs i join carefully for this reason. Im masc, so there are for example ftm subs I haven’t joined because they’re for binary trans men, and even though i share a lot of their experiences i will not feel comfortable there and i feel that if people are there to share in fellowship with other binary trans men, then they will not value my input on their experiences.  I would feel the same about womens’ spaces, if i were seeking them out. The way i see it, there ARE inclusive spaces for me, and the guys in a space like that who are interested in a broader perspective are likely in multiple subs like i am—but we go to different spaces for different purposes. Like, if i have a car question, if i ask about it in a home improvement sub i *might* get some answers cause there might be overlap in people who work on their houses and their cars, but i should really take that to the car sub, where people are there to intentionally talk about that. 

Obv the razors topic is an example of how a policy might seem unnecessary, but from the moderators’ perspective, if they can’t trust someone to follow the rules on such an uncontroversial topic, then they see the commenter as *very* unlikely to follow the rules in a more heated discussion. I think that’s probably the reason why it matters, not that your contribution is actually less valuable in that situation. Policies like ‘no main comments by x’ aren’t meant to exclude the perspectives of others, they are meant to *prioritize* the voices of the people the group is primarily meant for. As a guest, you are going to get less latitude in the rules than women are. 

It sounds like you were welcome there on the condition that you behaved as a guest, rather than a full member, and to me, that’s exclusionary yes but not wrongly so. For example trans and nb groups might allow allies who are respectful and there to learn, but not if they start to take up too much space or act like an authority because they’ve read a lot of other peoples’ perspectives here. Like, it’s very likely a woman would have been able to answer that question the same as you, so it is literally taking up space that should be left for women in that discussion—and if you had something to add that hadn’t been covered in multiple comments, that’s a great opportunity to add to the comments of someone else, like the rules say you should. 

But I understand why it hurts, regardless. In my case, I didn’t come out to myself or start to transition until i was nearly 28. I had spent decades trying to be a woman and failing. I identified as a lesbian, and a feminist, and now as a very masc enby i look like a…straight man suddenly and that’s like the opposite of my former identity lol. It can def feel alienating and lonely. I never felt like i would be accepted by men so the idea of being alienated by women was very frightening and emotional for me. That def made me very cautious about participating in any gendered spaces and I don’t go where im not welcome or likely to forget rules like that. But it is important that we recognize that we are not women and regardless of how we were raised, who we are as adults is—not women. As a child i responded differently to my socialization as being not a girl. As i envision my future is not as a woman’s future. Saying there is no difference is pretty invalidating to the identity of enbys and women alike. But it might not be very obvious to you at your age what those differences are. 

If you want to take this as a learning experience, one of the best things you can learn is that you need to explore what not being a woman means for you—and it could be that you are in fact bigender or genderfluid, and *are* a woman sometimes and that’s a factor in feeling rejected. But develop an idea of your own gender identity outside womanhood if you’re not a woman, and don’t expect womens spaces to be a place where you are privileged.
I'm an afab trans-masc person and I've hit a point where I can't tell whether I should respond to posts like ""hey ladies,"" or ""hey, guys,"" because I've got more experience for the former but identify better with the latter. Nobody has ever been mean to me, but it's been clear a few times on an alt that my input isn't particularly welcome in either situation
I feel like the way forward should be that > spaces *can* be MADE FOR a certain ""type"" of person, i.e. made for women, made for cat lovers, made for athletes > but they can't denote the ""type"" of person who is ALLOWED in the space.

As long as you follow the rules and allow the space to keep the ""MADE FOR X"" vibe then surely it's a non issue. And the mods can just stick to judging people based on their actions, and enforcing the rules, rather than judging people based on their perceived identity. 

Doesn't that make more sense then profiling people based on something as confusing as gender?
> should i not be there?

I personally don't like to associate with bigots. Using a razor isn't limited to 1 gender. Some people get tied into thinking about their us vs them club mentality and don't stop to consider what they're actually doing.
It is starting to feel like these woman only spaces are for cis women and not people who have experiences that align with womanhood and femininity. The world is diverse and experiences will differ. And they refuse to decolonize their views of gender. Razors are not a women only thing
Enby's:  *exist*

Terfs: ""but.. But... But...""

Or "" you've betrayed the order of the sisterhood™ 🦹‍♀️""
I definitely, definitely get your struggles. As someone who doesn't identify as femme, masc, or andro, but has... A LOT of experiences and similarities between both, I try to engage with just about anyone, and they either start calling me the wrong thing (he, she, whatever), or they say the same thing. I even had a lesbian yell at me for being amab one time. After I friended her. Nothing else. I'm pretty sure I had 'amab enby' in my bio and she took that and ran.

I mean, I get that they all have their spaces, but I think that, since there really isn't a big enough community of enbies (and the spectrum is way too big to have things like, 'agender only sub,' or 'polygender only sub') for us to have our own '--- only' spaces, they should at least let us exist. Like, however we identify, we could still be fem. Or masc. Or whatever we want. To be honest, I don't even agree with the idea of a '--- only' space, like, it could be a men's only space but a woman might have something that she wants to contribute, that could potentially be super insightful, or, in 'enby only' spaces there could be a trans guy who strictly identifies as male that wants to give an enby advice about what bathroom to use. I mean, I get 'safe spaces,' but that's different. Safe spaces are places where people can go to feel welcome, not places where they go to make other people feel unwelcome. They put a PRIORITY on something, but they don't usually exclude other things.

I dunno, maybe that's a sh*t take, but I just think the idea of excluding any kind of human from a community is dumb. Thank you for coming to my tedtalk.
I wonder would they also feel the same about someone like me. A She/they pronoun using, genderfluid AFAB person who is sometimes a Woman and sometimes non-binary/ gender neutral human.
How exactly are they defining women here? Is it just binary women only, in which case are binary trans women facing the same treatment?

AMAB genderqueer checking in for a little comedic foil! As someone who’s only really started shaving their legs and whose shins suffered a the consequences of cut-throat razor made for facial stubble, what razors WOULD you recommend. UK availability plz!
Ugh. This specific instance sounds pretty TERF-y, but also I wonder sometimes (okay okay all the time) if part of fully owning a non-binary identity involves letting go of (voluntary) AGAB affiliations. Like yes, politically and legally I am AFAB, and I stay involved in campaigns for reproductive choice, etc. But socially? I've found that ""women only"" spaces 1. Have never benefitted my mental health, because 2. At the beginning and end of the day, I'm not a woman.I feel like femme enbans who try to keep one foot in both communities contribute to truscum stereotypes of non-binary as a ""woman-lite"" category, which I fucking hate (it's bad enough I still look like a woman on the daily, I don't need an identity I've painstakingly moved to inhabit socially written off as some alt-womanhood ---- if I thought of myself that way I would be gnc, not non-binary).

Is it so bad to let others have their spaces that they define however they want? If their participation criteria is TERFy their discourse and behavior will be triggering af anyhow. Fuck that noise. And like you mentioned in another comment on this thread, OP, all of this could be resolved by starting a new space premised in less shitty definitions---- a femme space for shes, theys, and gays, whatever their gender identity. Brilliant. Would sub to both this and a masc space (altho I can't think of a cute matching rhyme for that one, damn).
I’ll no expert. But isn’t subs making rules like that against Reddit TOS? Not that I would expect Reddit to actually uphold their own TOS.
[deleted]
I never really got ""women and enbies only""-- is that just to create a space for marginalized genders only? As a trans guy/nonbinary trans guy it always felt kind of weird.
Exactly! Would they allow AMAB enbies? If not, it's probably not the space for us.
i see now. i’ll be more careful with my choice of words. last thing i wanna do is sound like a terf. thank you for pointing that out (this is literally why i came here. i knew yall would have this figured out a bit better than me lol). and yes i identify as femme!
I was downvoted for suggesting this, but yeah, wanting a space for women to include people ""socialized as women"" (afab people), rather than, well, women, sounds kinda TERF-y to me.
[removed]
Honestly, I’m AFAB genderfluid and I would be pissed if someone said that I don’t get to exist in women’s spaces because, regardless of how I identify, to me at least, being AFAB is a major part of my history and development. And a lot of non-binary people still recognize those spaces as their own. I know a lot of people will probably get mad at me for saying this, but I don’t think we can gatekeep non-cis genders and act their views are somehow invalid when we have no idea what their experiences are. An enby can know good razors, a trans woman can experience sexism- neither one of these is invading a space if their experiences relate to the topic at hand.
thank you, kind one <3 hopefully we all find somewhere to destress that isn’t so exclusionary to marginalized genders
I agree. Women deserve their own spaces. I'm not a woman anymore so if they want to exclude me I respect that. If they want to include me, they better be including AMAB enbies too otherwise they're viewing me as woman-lite which is kindof offensive.
i understand. just makes me a little sad cause i feel most comfortable in femme spaces. i have to rearrange myself under the scrutiny of gender oppression so that i know what’s acceptable and what’s not (all over again lol..). thank you for your thoughtful reply, stranger! <3
that leaves cis white non-disabled lesbians… now i gotta keep an eye out for a sapphic community of terfs… jeez. we’re walkin on landmines out here
I completely agree.
i absolutely agree. thank you for perfectly putting it into words ♡
askwomen is god awful at times. and yes, they definitely patrol the sub looking for enbies to attack. it’s really degrading at times so i stay away from those now. lol i’m just gonna start clutching my pearls before they get to clutch theirs. modern problems modern solutions
I think there's no problem with male/female/nb only spaces. But I do see a problem when razor blades or stuff like that are tagged as female only topic. They are artificially gendering things.
oh absolutely not. femmes are femmes. no matter what gender identity or biological sex. i enjoy being in femme spaces. being harmfully exclusionary will never be something that i do when trying to create a safe community. hell, plenty of trans men were socialized as women, as well, and their contributions would be appreciated, too! 

manifesting a terf free femme space for the shes, theys, and gays in the new year
i don’t wanna make suggestions about how they should regulate their space since they’re valid in their right to do. and i don’t think i should be counted as a woman either (i do not wanna be). 

now that i think about it, these spaces would not be so graceful about amab enbies so i think that’s my cue to book it out of there. lots of epiphanies from this thread
THE SISTERHOOD???!?? LMAOOO this sounds like the terf equivalent of antivaxxers calling themselves pureblood
i fear we’d suffer the same harsh treatment. this one girl i met got upset about me using so many parentheses when explaining my identity. they’re so threatened by small identifiers of anyone under the trans umbrella. it’s odd
Just wanted to say hi 👋 cause that’s how I describe myself and it’s not that common. I still ultimately identify as a woman (sometimes), never as a man, always as masculine, never as feminine, and if I do put on any femme looking traits (clothes or makeup) I do it as if I’m in drag, not trying to pass as a femme. I feel like I belong in womens spaces and trans/NB spaces. As much as I wish I felt like I belong in men’s spaces, I don’t really feel that I do. 

I say all of this to say that I think if a space is defined as “x only” then they have to allow people to self identify. I’d be offended to be kicked out of a womens space for not being “woman enough” because even though my gender is all over the place, I don’t feel like I’m a man and I feel too much of my life has been spent as a woman (both trying to fit onto expected norms and trying to defy them) to separate from that entirely. On the flip side, I’d want the space to accept someone who identifies as a woman even if they don’t present in a traditional feminine way. Like a AMAB trans person. I’ve known trans women who you wouldn’t have known (would have assumed cis guy) but if they identify as a woman, then they should belong in womens spaces.
They’d be transphobic to them is what they’d be.
[the joy razors work best for me :)](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Joy-Teal-One-Razor-Cartridges/dp/B07PQWLD2M) though it really varies depending on the individual though. they have a value pack that’s not as expensive as this singular one. also try men’s razors (they’re usually cheaper and much more efficient at removing stubble + not leaving razor bumps). i’ve heard extremely good things about gillette. invest in a good shaving cream, too!
> if part of fully owning a non-binary identity involves letting go of AGAB affiliations

my heart……. i have to internalize this and deconstruct the way i view myself. it sounds like i’ve been putting myself in this women-lite category everyone is speaking of which is why, subconsciously, i felt like i deserved access to these women-only spaces. now i understand that it’s a harmful rhetoric. thank you for your reply ♡ you’re very kind
i never suggested that.
If they want to include marginalized genders only, why not just say ""marginalized genders only""? Trans guys should be welcome there.

Most spaces I've seen that label themselves as ""women and enbies only"" actually mean ""tits and pussies only,"" and will begrudgingly welcome trans women or some amab enbies if they have to, but it's really obvious that it's just to avoid being called out and not because we're actually welcome in the space
Demigender non-binary people exist though, so some of us should be welcomed in a women's space. People really shouldn't make assumptions about our bodies, sexual characteristics, AGAB or how we've been socialised.
[removed]
This is factually incorrect. And if folks in NB spaces could stop reducing everything to AGAB/binaries, that would be great.
This is literally terf rhetoric
I do understand that it can be kind of a mindfuck to have to resituate oneself in the schematics of gender oppression, though. Cis is afforded more privilege than trans but masc beats femme. And then you have intersectionality fracturing and refracting the picture even more. 

It reminds me a bit of that convo I have with cis dudes sometimes tho. It’s not feminism that makes men’s liberation from patriarchy difficult, and it’s men who need to be spearheading men’s lib. It’s not women wanting safe spaces that leaves AFAB nonbinary or trans masc folks with few spaces to commune.
I was so worried you were gonna take what I said the wrong way. I think what you’re feeling is understandable and common. 

I recommend seeking out more trans masc voices/artists/writers/singers! And honestly plenty of trans femmes and trans women too. 

You do *have* community, even if it’s hard to find it sometimes 💜
I should mention that was in facebook groups so hopefully that's just facebook being trash and not a reflection of the larger sapphic community because that's, yanno, why the sapphic community was created and gained more traction as lesbian identity was watered down to ""cis woman loving cis woman"" so straight audiences could understand and stop sexually harassing them.
Allowing trans men in a women's only space makes it inherently not women's only
Out of curiosity, do you know what bothered you so much about this experience? Were they just really aggressive in policing their space? Or was it smth else?
Ahhh thanks for coming through!
i like this!! “marginalized genders only” is what i’m looking for. i don’t really feel all that comfy in spaces dominated by cis men so i think i’ll go on a search for this later. thank you, stranger!
Yeah, but if women's spaces become AFAB-centered instead of women-centered, that's just textbook transphobia
i take it all to heart but never in a bad way. it’s necessary for growth. i came here in need of feedback, good or bad. very enlightening, honestly. i wish i’d done it sooner. thank you for being so kind ♡
happy to be anti-facebook on this glorious afternoon. it’s so odd the way they allow so many hate groups proliferate like roaches on there. it’s concerning
Besides, as a trans guy, I really don't need to or want to feel welcome in ""women's spaces"". There may be subjects that I have relevant experience on, and I think outright hostility if I answer, for example, a question about experiences with sexism in medicine is absolutely unwarranted. 

But I think the ""socialized as a man/woman"" thing is totally terf rhetoric and I find it disconcerting to see it here. Don't try to force me into an AGAB box. I wasn't ""socialized as a woman"" because I'm not one. I have a lot of shared experiences with women and I was treated as one when I was a kid/teen, but my experience is still significantly different from a woman who was ""socialized as a woman.""

Misgendering with extra steps.
I think we need a term for 'everyone but cis men' bc that's what I want to feel safe a lot of the time.
oh i didn’t mean letting trans men into those terf spaces. i meant letting them into a femme space! does that make sense? i feel like i’m having a hard time sorting my thoughts about this
yes. it was the policing that upset me. and from that arose a lot of questions. they were so aggressively anti-enby as if the razor manufacturers had them on payroll. it was so trivial and yet transphobic. god forbid trans folks share experiences with cis women. but i think i gotta put my feelings aside on this one. it’s obvious i’m not welcomed there and neither are my fellow enbies so i’m actually glad i was practically exiled lol.
oh my god, this is exactly what i want. not even bullshitting LMAO they make me so uncomfortable
I don't think trans men are femmes, and I think most would be offended at being called such.
Still, not a fun experience. They could be gentle about it. I wonder if they thought you were amab 🤔
oh, sorry i didn’t wanna imply that all of them were femmes (definitely offensive and transphobic). some are more masc & some are more fem. that’s all i meant! jeez, i gotta be more careful with my wording
I understand! I'm a more feminine nonbinary transmasc guy myself, I'm sure there's a lot of people in the same kinda orbit as me in terms of gender expression that would be perfectly ID'ing as femmes. I guess I just meant to warn away from automatically including trans men in femme spaces, especially when transfemmmes aren't often included."	s18gb6	NonBinary	188	0.94	2022-01-11 08:45:25

Non-binary parents and non-binary baby	I’m a proud nb parent with an nb partner and a baby who we’ve never gendered. They wear whatever clothes because they’re cute, be it neutrals, pink flowers, blue dinos, bows, gnome hats, whatever in between. We’re planning to use they/them for them until they can talk, recalibrate from there, and maintain an open conversation about gender identity. Just wanted fellow nbs to know we’re out here :)	"Hello fellow queer parent! I'm NB, and my partners are a trans man and trans woman. We parent together and have a gender-neutral little one! 

I just wanted to say hello because I know how lonely it can be; most parenting spaces are super heavily gendered, and I'm so tired of being seen as a mother just because I'm the birthing parent.
Yoooo, this is so cool! Nice 👌🏻
Me (nb) and my wife (binary trans woman) are planning to do this. We both would have appreciated it so much why not give our child that opportunity? 

Even though they will most likely be cis its still healthier for the kid.
That's awesome! it's gonna get tougher once they go to school but I believe you would know what to do when such time comes. It would be good to get them a play-buddy when their old enough, that way you get more experienced on how to explain things and communicate with them on how they can be who they want to be even if their friends may seem way different. :D

I have never though on using neutral pronouns for a baby 🤔 that's not a bad idea
❤️❤️❤️ non-binary parent here too :) we were lucky enough to find a daycare that uses they/them for all the babies. We use he/they but keep their wardrobe non gendered and hella colorful. We also like to change all the pronouns when we read them books. One thing I'm curious about is what other parents go by. It felt like a big decision for me to pick my parental title and I haven't met any other nb parents. So happy to see your post!!!
YES! This is definitely how I am going to parent my child/children :)
Would love to do this if I have a baby! Awesome job you’re both doing!!
🥰🥰🥰
Hello hello!! I was also pregnant!! It was a wild ride and I’m also breastfeeding. Solidarity friend
And I love that your kid(s) could have experiences of themselves and others with a broader viewpoint of gender!
Same. Shame I'm aroace, I'll just marry my bestie and we'll adopt or something 😂
I absolutely LOVE the concept!! Let the kiddo tell us when they know & want to ;-)
I like Ren, short for parent. I’m leaning towards Momo, it’s cute and neutral and nods at Mom without feeling too gendered. It’s also Japanese for peach 🍑✨
OMG SAME. Am ace enby, would marry bestie for all of the emotional, social, and financial benefits. :-)"	qyxrkb	NonBinary	180	0.98	2021-11-21 15:52:27
My wife helped me to find some more feminine clothes, and we found some cute options for me! I love this skirt, it's so flowy!		"You pull off that look so well! Stunning!
I love the color combo! We stan a supportive partner as well ❤️
So I'll tell you this, check through my.posting history and you'll see how I've evolved. It's a long road to find your style. Irs a ton of trial and error. Finding clothes that fit your body type ideally. But it's such a nice start huh?
Just try spinning around!
Thank you, it felt really good to wear it!
She's the best! She keeps saying how proud she is of me for looking inside myself and working it out.
It spins super well!"	l49k0o	NonBinary	181	0.99	2021-01-24 22:40:08
Went out dancing recently in “ladies clothes” and felt like a princess, the theme was: fembot sex party (promise that cup’s full of water)		"that level of bravery is astonishing, I love it.

Still a ways to go, but my dear friend gave me some of her/their clothes and I’m feeling a lot better about myself :)		"Cute!! I like how stripes look on you!
I adore the top right sweater/shirt, it looks amazing, and comfy, but they all look perfect! It’s the best to have a friend who is a clothe’s size twin. 
You look great! Cozy sweaters can make anyone feel like they're smashing the binary, and you are definitely crushing it! 
P.s. I WISH I had such an awesome beard :o I've only been able to grow a (pretty sad) mustache.
You look like such a warm person, I wanna cuddle you asap 💖
Looking great!! ❤ :)
Thank you for posting! As a beardy not-sure-what-the-heck-my-gender-is this fills me with warmth. Also you are rocking it 
Aww! You are absolutely charming!
Thanks so much!! :)
Yes! I know I’m so fortunate to have someone like that in my life. They’ve been helping me so much with this and been so accepting.  And thank you!
Omg thank you so much!!! I actually just liked your post, you’re quite stunning as well if you don’t mind me saying so :D
Omg I wanna cuddle all of you tbh, I’m crying, such sweet people! 😭
Thank you!!! 😋
Hey it keeps my face warm at least! And y’all are keeping my heart warm ❤️. My beard used to really bother me tbh but I’m starting to accept, even love it :).

Ahh this is the most adorable thing! You look gorgeous 💕
Your gorgeous smile, cute hair, everything about your style... Fuck. Looking at this photo added 2 years to my lifespan.
thanks so much! i was really scared to wear it because i figured dresses would look too awkward on me so all this positivity is really validating and sweet ❤️ and i actually cut my own hair and my bf bleached it for me :3
thank you so much!! i cant take any credit for them tho, their just a result of me being latino ❤️
thank you so much! my transition goal is to be a soft boi and your comment is so validating ❤️❤️❤️
thank you! it was my bf's before he came out as trans-masc!
aw youre fine! yeah i am, ive been on them for 8 months and it was honestly the best decision i ever made for my mental health and dysphoria
thanks! i use a razor i got at CVS, its purple with 4 blades and a big yellow lotion strip at the top. i cant remember the name it tho, but if you want i can dm it to you when i get home! otherwise i exfoliate with a shower puff and body wash, shave with conditioner (dont press down with the razor, just let it slide up your legs otherwise youll get ingrowns), and then exfoliate again. this works for me even after not shaving for a month, and my leg hair is crazy thick when i dont shave :3
thank you so much! my gender euphoria went through the roof when i tried it on
love!! yeah i sometimes say that as a response when people say something to me and im like thanks its cuz im not white its the funniest shit

Me thinking about how I’ve lost 50 lbs and gotten sober, and all I’ve heard from my spouse is complaints about my masc hair cut and clothing choices 🙄		"you deserve better ❤️
Well allow me to say, great job! Losing weight is really hard and frought with self judgment and despair. Getting sober is a monumental task. You've accomplished what few people have the will to try..and... You look great.
Congratulations!! Celebrate yourself, you are amazing!! I'm sorry your spouse can't seem to handle the necessary changes you've made. I'm hoping your partner's love for you will help them overcome and appreciate you for the incredible person you are.
First...your spouse can gtfo with that crap! I went through it with mine as well so I do understand. Second..you are stunning and I'm proud AF of you for  getting sober and cutting weight! You are an awesome human who deserves to be loved for who they are regardless of how other people want or expect you to look or be.
Ew, bye ""spouse""
It sucks when you feel unsupported and validated by the ones you love, I'm sorry you're dealing with that. 

Good on you for working on bettering yourself! You're doing a great job, just keep reminding yourself that you are worth the effort, and that you are awesome!
Dump theeeeeeem! Lol no but if you've communicated to them these changes make you happier and the importance of bodily autonomy like...you deserve to be happy, and you deserve someone that wants what you want.
Unless they are wearing the clothes, it's really not up to them what you wear!  Anyway,  congrats on the sobriety and weight loss! It's  not easy, but it's so worth it!
Congrats on feeling better physically and maintaining sobriety! May you find peace of mind and heart.  Enjoy exploring your different sides, regardless of the people around you.
congrats fam!!! i'm sorry your partner isn't celebrating your wins with you- you deserve to uplift your successes
Im proud of you. Those are very impressive achievements! I hope that they see what amazing achievements you've made.
That sucks
Kick him out
He sounds abusive and bad
Divorce
Congratulations on your weight loss, that's an amazing accomplishment, not only do you look amazing, but your so much healthier.  Stay focused on all you accomplished, all you done and how good you look.  If people in your life, are not positive with you, support you, in all honestly, perhaps it's time for a friends and family reboot, cleanse out all those who are toxic and do nothing to bring you down. Look for people who see your beauty inside and outside and who support and encourage you.
Thank you so much! I feel like I’ve accomplished so much, but all my achievements always get pushed to the side. I wish I was worth more to people than whatever my presentation is.
 You are worthy of being seen, respected, and acknowledged for your amazing-ness. I have found that looking the people I love in the eyes and telling them that I want to be seen and acknowledged works. If it doesn't, then I find better people."	odqb46	NonBinary	170	1.0	2021-07-04 18:36:27
Called a Detransitioner	"Time for a long rant!

I started identifying as a nonbinary lesbian when I was 11 years old. I hadn’t ever heard of a nonbinary lesbian before but I figured that nonbinary literally means not-part-of-the-binary so why can’t a nonbinary person be a lesbian? Anyway, went through some shit, decided I was a trans man, only last year at the age of 16 realized I was right the first time, I really am just a nonbinary lesbian. Been a wild fucking ride.

The thing is…everyone says I detransitioned. I had gone full on masc because of how horrible my dysphoria was, binding every day despite my health issues and wearing only masculine clothing and keeping my hair cut super close, and now…now I decided that life is too fucking short to wear itchy fucking cargo pants in 90 degree weather. Now I’ve started wearing what I WANT TO WEAR. Not what I’m “supposed” to wear to be a “real” nonbinary person. Unfortunately what I want to wear is almost exclusively pink dresses. I’ve also decided boobies are hot and I don’t mind having them sometimes. I grew my hair out and dyed it bright pink. Basically I’m all around a lot happier being more feminine. But now everyone is saying I’m detrans. My family got super excited that I’m “going back to being a girl” and my friends completely abandoned any pronouns other than she/her for me. No one ever acknowledges me as anything other than a girl. And if I ever bring it up all I ever get is “come on, are YOU, of all people, REALLY nonbinary?” “You don’t even TRY to be androgynous“ “you’re just a fake nonbinary person” “it’s okay to detransition” even from other trans people. Even from other NONBINARY people.

It‘s like I have to choose between dressing how I like and being…who I am. The worst part is…I prefer he/him pronouns. I use all pronouns but he/him is my favorite. And *no one* calls me those. Not that they called me he/him when I identified as a trans man just…they even more don’t do that now. It feels horrible. My mom has even gotten so used to me being feminine that she’s upset I want to cut my hair. I’M 17 FUCKING YEARS OLD.

My therapist got pissed at me every time I referred to myself with he/him. I didn’t even ask her to, I just referred to myself that way but apparently I’m horrible for that. Perish. Wasn’t why I stopped going to sessions, but it definitely didn’t help.

Leave me alone. Let me be who I am, it’s literally not hurting you. I’m not even asking people to not call me she/her, I’m just asking people to STOP CALLING ME DETRANS. Is that so fucking hard?"	"at least for the trans/nonbinary people in your life it might be good to remind them that presentation does not equal gender
I wouldn't call you a detransitioner at all, and I think it's gross that other people are. You did some ""transition"" type stuff, but none of it was specifically and exclusively tied to transmen. Haircuts aren't genders, binders aren't just for transmen...or oven just for transpeople. Would it suddenly make me a detransitioner if I buzzed my hair and took off the jewelry and makeup. Hell no it wouldn't, because gender isn't just about playing Mr./Ms./Mx. Potato Head and LARPing as a different character than the one you were given at birth. You transitioned, thought you were going to transition further, and then realized you'd gone far enough. There's nothing ""detransition"" about that.
I present extremely feminine, but presentation isn't my whole story either. Thought I was trans for a couple decades, only learned about Nonbinary people last year. And I'm around 40. Sorry you're going through it, man.
“I accept you as a human and respect your right to fully inhabit your body according to the gender you feel and the way you choose to express it.”

I would like to print that out and give it to people and tell them that’s the price of admission to a relationship with me, be it friendship, family, or more.

NessiefromtheLake is perfect as he is!
Keep being you!
You're seventeen. You're still in highschool. You're still discovering yourself. Sounds like you have a picture though. That's great.

When I was in highschool I thought I was just a really fem gay guy. Turns out I'm also an enby lebzo instead. Fuck a guy or two but I mostly just wanna date women. But what do I look like? I got facial hair. I got long hair with a side cut. I wear as much goth/edgy clothes as possible. Pants and long sleeves in 80 degree weather. Would anybody expect me to be enby? Definitely not by looking at me. Theyre gonna see some random mid twenties white dude.

Family is... An issue that will be very difficult, if impossible, to tackle. I gave up, truthfully. I mostly just try to get them to say the right name.
Bruh get a new therapist wtf (if possible, I definitely would !)
The trans community is so toxic sometimes when it comes to sexuality. You can be gay and nonbinary you can be a lesbian and non binary. You can be whatever the fuck you feel you are and non binary.
You need to find a new therapist.
Im so sorry you’re dealing with this.

Transition isn’t a one way binary thing. Especially when you’re… non-binary. It sounds more like you’re continuing in your transition and figuring out what feels good and right for you.

Gender presentation and gender identity are separate things. The same way butch women are still women and femmey men are still men. Non-binary people are non-binary no matter how they choose to dress.

You deserve people in your life who see you for you and listen when you share with them about your own experience of yourself. I hope your friends and family continue to learn and get there soon. And if they don’t, then I hope you find some more respectful and affirming people to connect with 💕
gosh it’s awful people can’t recognize someone being comfortable in both their presentation and their identity. unfortunately i don’t have much advice for you, but you might find some support on r/FTMFemininity (welcome to all trans masc people, including nb people). i’m sorry you’re going through this <3
I’m sorry you’re going through that :/ I hope you don’t let them crush you and continue to be you
Hey, you are valid just as you are! YOU are the only person who has the right to declare your identity. And your identity and presentation are not at all the same. You can be a transmasc or transfem NB, and you can also be a fem presenting FTM. That is up to you and nobody else—not your therapist, or your parents, and not your friends, and of course not strangers. Honestly your therapist should know better. But they sound a bit uneducated in the area of identity. 

Just know you are valid. You are on a journey that may end up being lifelong. Where you are going doesn’t even matter. It may change over time. What matters is that you are at peace with yourself now. So enjoy where you are today. Anyway, you are leaps ahead of most people who never get that far in questioning or exploring who they really are, including those who are invalidating you. Sending good vibes and support.
Jesus, imagine thinking that a 17 year old needs to have everything in order all of the time. 

You're not detrans, you're just figuring shit out. 

I'm 34, I finally starting using the WORD nonbinary a few years ago, but until then, I didn't really know what it meant. But I've always been nonbinary. Even when I put pretty dresses on my AFAB body. Even when I wear make up. Even when people at work call me she/her. Still me, still nonbinary, even if I dont ""even try to be androgynous"" 

God, people need to chill. 

Also, OP is great and people should call him the right pronouns.
I have kinda the same thing, where I thought I was non-binary (at \~14) then came out to a few friends as a (non-binary) trans man and only wearing masculine clothes/haircut (at \~16) and now I'm 20 and much more confortable with the way I dress (I essentially dress androgynous / a little feminine) and I can totally understand your struggles.

Though my friends don't really mind I'm not always masculine (I even sometimes wear dresses and make-up) and I think they respect my name/pronouns  so yeah your friends kinda sucks I think ? I guess it's normal since you're all pretty young but still you can try to send them informative ressources on how gender expression can differ from gender identity ? Also if you move out to go to college or stuff like that you'll be able to meet more open people who'll understand better this kind of stuff :) (my queer uni group is very nice and respect my name/pronouns so there's that)
Even if you were a detransitioner I think its extremely rude for them to call that out when the person in question is not comfortable being called that. There are many people who use transition labels because they don't feel comfortable using the label they identify as or because they still have an internal struggle going on and people trying to call that out is so endlessly rude. Just generally, whether detrans, or not its noone else's business to decide on what you call yourself. If you use a label then people should respect that. People are so entitled and think they know everything better it really pisses me off sometimes. Sorry you have to struggle with that. I hope you get through to them somehow....
So you transitioned ONLY HARDER!!! 

Sorry people are being assholes, clothes don’t have gender wear whatever the heck you want to. The only person you have to live with for the rest of your life is yourself so do what makes you happy the rest of them be damned.
Just wanted to say, thank you to everyone who commented with their support! You’ve all made me feel so happy to call myself nonbinary! I made this post in the middle of the night after realizing that my parents had told my brother I detransitioned while he was at college (incorrect, I just grew my hair out lol). I was really frustrated. But if there’s one thing I realized it’s that the nonbinary community is always here for me! I don’t know that many nonbinary (or LGBTQ at all) people irl so this online community means so much to me. Thank you all!
That sucks so much, I’m so sorry. People can be super intolerant. Being nonbinary is still a type of trans!! And presentation does not equal gender.
Yo ima come over there and fight some of these people fam they are rude as hell, and don't know shit. Of course you can wear girly shit and be non binary you are valid af. You're still Trans just a different flavor of Trans. I'm sorry those people are being shitty.
Those people need to take a step back and chill.  


Who are they to judge you? They have no idea of the countless decisions and experiences that brought you to this point. Nobody's journey is the same.
Oh I'm so sorry that's happening. I'm younger than you, but I also had/have tons of trouble figuring out my gender and how I want to dress and present myself and what not. Nobody has the right to tell you who your are. Only you can really know. And if you change your label 100 times a day, just because it seems to fit better than the one you had before, or if you go back to one you had before, that's fine. It's complicated. 
Your family and the other people you mentioned are assholes. I know it's hard, but don't listen to them, don't make their words the only ones that matter.
I sometimes think of my 20’s & early 30’s as my detrans period. I’d only partly socially transitioned and hadn’t fully understood what I was doing was a social transition, but through mental health issues dove into the closet for a very long time. 

I’ve since spent the last couple of years rediscovering/finally discovering my gender and have gone from nonbinary to binary trans woman to nonbinary trans woman where I now sit. Not at all sure where I’ll end up outside of the confidence that I am medically transitioning to be able to move through the world largely as a woman. That does not and will never erase the nonbinary part of my identity and neither should it for you no matter how masc you present or what steps you take in your transition!

Edit to add: transitioning is not a straight line, though most binary people seem to think it is. I think this is why a lot of folk would think you’re detrans though nonbinary folk should know better than anyone how nonlinear our transitions can be. You are you, and it sounds like you’re evolving greater understanding of your gender and evolving new transition goals which is different than deteansitioning.
I'm in the same boat. When you're older you'll be more able to choose better friends, rather than just people at your school
This brings up an important point about presentation vs gender identity, and if I were you, I'd try to reiterate that. Anyone, regardless of gender identity can present however they want. Transmascs can wear dresses, *cismen* can wear dresses, transfems can wear suits. It all is just how you want to dress, but doesn't invalidate your experience just because of your expression.  


Btw, are you autistic too? I ask because you mention the ""itchiness"", and I know I have a similar problem. In my case, I'm transfem and I find sometimes I get really tired of skinny jeans irritating my shaved legs or even just the ""feeling"" of certain clothes. This is truly valid reason to change your wardrobe.

Also, the thing about being nonbinary is, that you can be anywhere on that spectrum of gender. If 100% fem is a ""1"" and 100% masc is a ""10"", maybe you're just a 4 or something too? I mean, being less male doesn't make you any less transmasc, but it's a journey and you need to find your place on it. Also, sometimes it takes time to find that slot. It may be a slightly different story but I went through something similar. For me I wasn't sure what I was, and ended up transitioning ""full fem"", but that wasn't right. I missed the more gender neutral things I had, and some perceived that as a de-transition too. It wasn't, I was just finding myself. I went ""too far"" and it turned out that's not where I want to be. Maybe you're evolving. But again, that never invalidates your enby gender identity. Every enby is different and has different goals and feelings. You are not ""obligated"" to look agender. In fact that's a stereotype and I'd be sure to point that out, because there's an infinite possibility of gender identities and gender expressions from the enby community.  


I also feel like this is an example of transmascs being treated as ""less than"" too. When a transfem bigender person switches between clothing, people usually question it less - but maybe you're inherently targeted because doing the same for a transmasc is treated differently.  


**You are valid just as you are, whereever your gender journey takes you**. Don't let anyone stop you from living your fullest life, and if the toxic non-accepting people don't smarten up by the time you're an adult, consider cutting them from your life. You have the right to be treated with dignity and respect.
Fuco them all honestly. No matter how many “feminine” things your gender is not determined by that. People love thinking of gender in terms of genitals and presentation because they were traumatized into thinking that that’s all they can be. Honestly, they are bigots for gaslighting you. I say you misgender all of these people and tell them that they are too stupid to really know their gender. I hope soon you can get away from all these horrible experiences.
Don’t let anyone label you shit! Let their labels just fall right off you baby. You’re going such a good job letting yourself explore and not limiting yourself to your own beliefs. If I were you, I’d go to the lgbt center and join a support group online or irl. I have been doing that myself recently and it helps!! Im 28 and im STILL figuring things out and likely will be for a long time. What you wear doesn’t change the journey you’re going on internally. It doesn’t mean anything!!! Men can be fully identified with being masculine and still choose to challenge what is considered masculine by wearing short shorts etc. there’s so many ways to be masc, femme, but it’s really all about having fun, and being open to seeing yourself for who you are with no holds barred.
Y'know I feel like I know the answer they'd give, but do they think genderfluid people are just fully invalid then? Femboys too? How about demiboys? Or hell- cis men who wear dresses. Total hypocracy.

That's what I'd call out the 'allies' on at least.
I would say the fact that all these people hardly used he/him for you even when you identified as a man and presented very masc proves that it isnt you being nonbinary ""wrong"", its that they wouldnt be supportive of you no matter what. Youre not the problem, their bigotry is. I wish i had some advice that would help other than to try and include these people in your life as little as is viable (obviously you cant cut your parents off until your independent if you even want to), but they arent willing to accept what makes you happy, theyd rather keep themselves comfortable. If you cant make them understand, take what happiness you get from being yourself and move on from the people who dont care when you can. There will be people who do and you can hopefully surround yourself with them in the near future. ""Im not detrans because im still not a girl"" should be enough for those who care about you for who you really are, and are willing to learn.
i’m sorry you have to go trough that, it sucks.

The problem here is clearly the other people in your life. It’s very much transphobic to say those kinds of things you mentioned. Bonding with people who understand you online is something i’d recommend if you want to do that. Just overall focus on being yourself and making YOU happy. Not anyone else. I know it’s hard and it sucks but that’s really important. Don’t let them bring you down. You can be proud that you have found out who you are and what makes you feel like yourself! Take care
I’m really sorry that you are going through this.  You might like the subreddit ftmfemininity.  It is enbie inclusive, and it has a lot of transmasculine people who have feminine gender expressions.  I am non-binary transmasculine, and I love purple and pink and some girly things, and I always have to weigh my fear of being misgendered with my desire to express myself.  You have the right to express yourself however you want to.  Your expression is not the same as your gender identity, and these people are straight up misgendering you by saying this.  I’m really sorry.  

Also definitely second people who said you need a new therapist.  Someone with that much power over your mental health who doesn’t support your transition is causing you trauma.  You also don’t need to validate friendships who don’t validate you.

Good luck, beautiful enbie 💛🤍💜🖤.
In a similar boat, non binary and for a while I was thinking about hrt and feminization.  Now I'm a lot more comfy with my masculinity and like to ride the line a lot more or just outright switch aesthetics now and again.  Kind of afraid to say something to my friends because Im afraid I'll get ""oh well how do you know? You said you wanted hrt before, now you don't? are you even sure you're nb?""
I'm so sorry to hear all that. You are who you say you are, and your friends, family, other trans/nonbinary folk and of ALL people your therapist should respect that! 

I'm AFAB nonbinary and present masc quite often but really enjoy wearing dresses and skirts a lot too. It's my first summer being out to people in my life and I'm so scared of being thought of as ""fake nonbinary""...when just as you say, nonbinary means not-part-of-the-binary and doesn't have to bear any relation on your presentation! 

Anyway, it looks like you're getting a lot of good advice from other folk, but I hope you can get more understanding and empathy from those around you.
im an afab lesbian enby and i feel you, im super feminite, im okay with my tiddies, i really wanna wear big frilly dresses and have super cutesy hair, but im just not okay with she/her pronouns, in terms of gender and how i feel its not too feminine but the way i express it says differently. i dont even aim yo be androdgynous or medically transition, i just want people to stop giving a shit about my existance
OP, I suggest following @ glitterandyelling on IG. He helped me a lot in coming to terms with who I am. Hope they do the same for you... & it goes without saying, but **you are nonbinary.** I see you, we see you, and you're not alone.
Honestly what bothers me most about the whole detransition conversation is that I feel like most detransitioners are actually non-binary. Transition doesn't have to correlate to gender reaffirming hormones or surgery, it never has. Of course some trans people are not going to feel comfortable with themselves by being forced to fit into a gender/sex binary. Your identity is valid!
I’m sorry you feel that way. You seem a bit confused since people are trying to force you to “pick” a gender. To me, it seems you’re genderfluid in the non-binary umbrella. But you should just do whatever you feel like. They shouldn’t try to force you something you don’t want
So many people think being nonbinary a fashion statement and it weirds me out.
If you ever make this a shirt on Tee public or something let me know, I will definitely buy one!
Yes. You are SEVENTEEN.  Adolescence is a time of trying things out to see what fits…and it’s going to change and keep changing because it’s supposed to be a delightfully experimental time. Try on different styles, different perceptions of yourself, different ideas…that’s what you’re supposed to be doing!  Folks saying this to you are pretending that who people are at 12, at 15, at 17, hell, at 22, are forever fixed at that spot in their personality…and that’s BS.  Ask some folks in their thirties or forties or sixties if they’re the same person and look at the world the same way as they did at 17 years old.  The answers are probably going to be, No Way! Because that’s such a tumultuous time of change and growth.  Not to mention that we continue to change and grow throughout our lifetimes, if we’re mentally and emotionally healthy.  Some things will sustain when you’re older, but many things about you will grow and change. And that’s wonderful.  I perceive myself and my gender differently than I did 10-20 years ago…at least in part because the ways of viewing gender that are available now didn’t exist in any context I had access to when I was younger.  And cultural conceptualizations about gender are really in flux right now…so the ways of viewing gender are going to continue to grow and change…and people are going to grow and change with that. And that’s lovely and to be celebrated. 

 TLDR: you’re perfect as you are, you’re perfect as you will be, take as much time to explore and grow in your self-perceptions as you need to without shaming yourself due to other’s judgements.
I'm going to elaborate. See, I'm AFAB nonbinary and I go through phases, sometimes a bit lengthy, where I want to express feminine or masculine or androgynous. My therapist, luckily, is also nonbinary. I mean, I own a few dresses and some mens clothes and wear what I want. I can relate. I'm actually going to be legally changing name to something androgynous and am anxious about backlash like this. I've actually avoided coming out so as not have to deal with this from people who don't understand. We don't owe the world androgyny and it sucks your environment seems to think that.
YES to all of this! but especially I want to hype up this bit: **Transition isn't a one-way binary thing.** Transition is not a linear process, especially in many non-binary cases. You were moving forward in your transition when you moved toward a masculine presentation, and you were moving forward in your transition when you moved toward more feminine presentation. Transition is about chasing what feels right; certainly for myself there has never been quite a specific end-goal as much as an absolute certainty that I need to shift in some direction from where I'm at.

Ugh, anyway, I too am so sorry you have to deal with this. I would try, if you have the energy and patience, to explain that concept to your friends/family. Transition is not a direct, linear path to a predetermined destination, and while it is okay to notice and ask about whether you feel like you are returning in any sense to identifying as a gender you did before, it is never okay to assume that shifting back in that direction implies that you are undoing any of your transition. It's all a forward-directional a path that has led you here, not to mention that gender presentation =/= gender. 😒 Basically, I think your humans need to be explicitly told that it is always okay to ask, but really isn't okay to use words for you that you don't use for yourself, and you very strongly do not consider yourself 'detransitioned'.
Yeah-- please know that the environment in uni is so much more supportive. You'll meet people who understand your transition because they've been there, or know someone who has been there. Nonbinary awareness is such a work in progress, but university is the place to be for peak acceptance and community!
Also, as a non binary boy who dresses very feminine at times just because he likes it: if you like it, go for it. It's you who has to run around like that all day, so your comfort should really be above others opinions.
You’re right, I am autistic and I have severe sensory issues with my legs, which is one of the reasons why I gave up pants. Love to see fellow autistics in the wild \^\^
See, totally relatable! So I called it right, lol. I know *exactly* what you are going through with the clothes, and I find the same issues with many kinds of pants/jeans/leggings, but with a dress or skirt, it's just freedom from that awful feeling! I think my sensory issues played a large role in why before transition I always wore severely bagging pants, because I couldn't find anything that felt okay to me, and it was the least itchy and sensory triggering.

As for autistics, you'd be surprised how many of us there are on here. I wouldn't call this ""the wild"" lol, because studies have shown 30% of autistics are trans of some kind, and there's some speculative evidence that autistics also tend to have a larger online presence than NTs.... So it's extremely likely a *huge swath* of this sub is autistic too! We are many here! 😊 ❤️

PS: So ultimately, having sensory issues and preferring dresses, regardless of your gender identity is *entirely* valid. You definitely don't need to ""justify"" your reasons to anyone else, but I do think if they can understand that part, maybe you'll have more luck explaining it to them. There are a lot of parents of cis autistic kids who buy dresses for their cisboys because of sensory issues, so it's more common than you think too."	upbz8f	NonBinary	173	0.99	2022-05-14 07:23:53

I've been looking for a skirt like that for years. I'm so jealous.

Sometimes I have to wear boy clothes for work, so I make sure to wear full face makeup to balance it out 😂🤣		"We need to gather up all the nonbinary musicians and make an enby symphony ahhh.

I’m questioning many things and very in the closet about all of them, but I felt kinda cute today, was wondering if people knew where to buy androgynous clothes. I love all of you <3		"Thrift stores are definitely the best, or something that can also be fun is going to estate sales and garage sales
I buy all of my clothes from thrift stores. There's usually a pretty good selection there. And btw, I love your outfit and especially the hat!
I like the hat
Thrifted clothes are definitely the best inexpensive route. If you can't get to a thrift store there are online options like Goodfair.

If you don't mind spending $$$ there are other online options for androgynous clothing like Dapper Boi and Nonbinary Outfitters.

<3
Apart from thrift stores, if you want options on options try asos.com which has everything from fairly cheap to expensive in a wide variety of styles and sizes. Plus, they usually always have a coupon floating around online. 

If you have a bit more money to work with, I would also try everlane.com because they have nice basic clothing options that seem to be more ethically sourced than other retailers. Though they can be a bit more expensive, many of their non-sale items give you the option to choose the price you pay so it’s a bit flexible.
love your button down! I’d say you’re doing an excellent job already, but I have decent luck with thrift stores and H&M.
It’s true that the majority of clothing will be *marketed* to men or women :/ 
To find out if something is androgynous, just put it on :)
Some supermarkets have a clothes aisle, sometimes there are some good finds!

Also, enby rolist ayyyy
Sib! Are you also into Dnd?
Uniqlo is my favorite!!
Thanks, I hadn’t thought of garage sales!
Thanks so much, it feels really good to know that I’m not weird for wanting to wear what I want. Where I live is not very accepting of people so I’m surrounded by people who I am afraid will judge me if I wear anything outside the norm. So thanks so much, for the advice and the compliment, you are awesome <3 and I hope you have a great night!
Thank you so much, I’ll defiantly be checking out the thrift stores, and dreaming of clothes from dapper boi <3

Feeling moody but happy to be able to wear my normal clothes after a week of work (they/them)		"Isn't it such a great feeling? I'm happy for you, friend!
Im absolutely in love with your jacket 
As a patch collector myself i wanna know if you stitched them on ?
Ugh MOOD!  Stupid work.
You’re mindblowing 🥺🥺🥺😍😍😍

The only problem with this outfit is that it’s a PlayStation shirt, not an Xbox shirt 😜 I joke, I joke
Yeah I stitch most of them on! There are some that are really thick so I haven’t gone all the way around them yet. I have this really cool silver thread that I used on some of them.
Oh that’s absolutely awesome! Im currently stitching mine to a new jacket cause my old one was pleather and it totally flaked off. I got a new actual leather from a thrift store (no supporting new leather in the world). But yeah I usually try to just use similar colors as the patch but the silver idea is absolutely awesome"	k2uso2	NonBinary	166	1.0	2020-11-28 20:17:37
My sister humiliated me at the store over me buying mens boxer briefs	I decided to get myself some men's boxer briefs while shopping with my sister the other day. I want to have more clothing that makes me feel good about myself and is gender affirming. However my sister yelled at me and scolded me in the men's underwear isle where there were other people. I'm so done with this particular sister's constant nagging and scolding. I get told off every other day for things like my name change, my attire, my hair, my flags, my pronouns and for voicing discomfort from her calling me the wrong name. I would've gone alone but my disabilities make it so I can't drive. I hate it when my other care takers can't drive me and I have to rely on her. When ever she scolds me or yells at me it leaves me disphoric and depressed for days. I will be moving in with my partner soon and honestly I am looking forward to having more space away from this sister.	"She sucks :( I'm glad to hear you'll be out of that situation soon hopefully.
Sending you good vibes. It’s very hard to live with hostile family members
As a person who wears boxers as well, your sister does not know the true freedom and comfort these bad boys bring. I'd take boxers over ladies underwear any day of the week!
That’s dreadful, I’m sorry that you have to put up with her intolerance. You deserve so much better, especially from a sibling who should be willing to see you as you are.
Leave that bih at home. I'll caretake you, where you at?!
Boo. 🍅 🍅 🍅 Wear whatever piece of cloth you want to strap over your human form. Don’t let her limited view impact your positive trajectory. 💛
Wish you the best of luck on getting space from this person in your life. Sending love and good vibes
I'm so sorry she stinks. She isn't respecting your autonomy at all
I'm sorry she behaves and is like this. You deserve better and mens boxers rule!
Out of all things, what a weird thing for her to be on about in public. My grandmother wore mens boxers cuz she thought they were more comfortable. Seems like your sisters just wants to pick fights with you and cause a scene. I’m sorry op. I hope you still bought the boxers tho.
What the hell is her problem? How does you wearing boxers affect her life in ANY way? Jeez. Sorry you had to go through this!!
Boxer briefs are the most comfortable thing ever and you deserve to buy them in peace. Perhaps in the future though you could purchase them online?

Sorry that happened, friend. Tell your sister your drawers are none of her business and enjoy your boxer freedom. :)
:( Glad you're getting out. When you're in a better place/have the wherewithal come up with a strategy to grey rock her so she can't have any more of your energy.

If she's used to screaming at you in public, know that plenty of the people hearing her know she's a POS.
My favorite saying is:  You can pick your friends but you can't pick your family.

You will always love family because they are family.
But you don't have to like them or hang out with them.  She obviously doesn't respect you.  Why would you want to hang out with someone who treats you like that?
She will always be your sister, but I think it's time to establish some boundries.
Best of luck with the move. I assume Uber or Lyft aren't an option where you live? Sorry you have to deal with this.
You can’t pick the roots from which your family tree grew but you can certainly cut yourself off from it and attach it to a healthier tree if the old one is dying.

I agree with establishing boundaries, but you can certainly pick your families, regardless of where your blood came from.
Oh fuck off, this is terrible advice. You're on a queer sub and you're advocating against found/chosen families? Get the fuck out and stop caping for abusers.

Edit: check this guys history, hes a chaser
Fuck everything about this. I do not love my given family, they don't love me. They would see me dead.

Your statement is the kind that enables abuse. Learn that some people suck and its best to protect yourself from them.

My child has come out as non-binary.	"Good morning, you lovely humans.  


My child has come out to me as non-binary. They are nine years old. They have opted not to tell their father (we are divorced) or my male significant other and are comfortable with both female and neutral pronouns.

&#x200B;

I am feeling extremely proud that my child felt confident enough to come out to me. I asked them if there were any other changes they would like to make such as cutting their hair, going by a different name, etc. They expressed that they feel comfortable with their appearance and name, so we're good there. A few months ago, they expressed their desire to wear masculine/neutral clothing styles, so we had already updated their wardrobe with their preferred styles.

&#x200B;

Is there anything else I can do for my child right now? I ordered an NB pride flag for them to hang in their bedroom. We just moved to a big house and they now have their own room and don't have to share with their little brother. :)

&#x200B;

Thank you for listening!"	"I think if there's anything, they'll let you know! School might be something to consider too, talking with their teacher if you/they feel that is something they need later down the road. Otherwise you're being an amazing parent, they're lucky to have you as a parent!
what wonderful parenting - you are doing your child the greatest service any parent could do by supporting them unconditionally. I think you’re doing everything right, my only suggestion would be to make it clear that if they change their mind about anything in the future (e.g. deciding they do want a different name, making another change to pronouns, changing another element of their appearance etc) that they can come to you anytime and let you know. also maybe let them know if they ever want to talk to a therapist about anything they should let you know, because even with the most supportive environment in the world gender can still be confusing and overwhelming and they might need help processing some things.

other than that please keep being an amazing parent and showing them all that love. you’re making more of a difference than you know.
Something no one else has mentioned yet: Puberty is coming for your kiddo soon. Try and be extra supportive during that phase and keep therapy and puberty blockers in the back of your mind if things start to get rough. Puberty can be really distressing for trans and nonbinary people and sometimes that's when dysphoria rears its ugly head for the first time. 

Other than that, it sounds like you're doing a stellar job!
The fact that you never slipped up once with their pronouns suggests that you are in the right headspace. Your child may deal with some more bullying at school because kids can be dicks about anything, so help them be ready. Also, let them know about non binary actors and musicians! I know that there are quite a few who are out and quite successful. It's important that they not feel alone.
I think you’re doing your best right now. I’d kill for a mom like you when I was nine. Hell, I’d kill for a mom like you now. Thanks for existing
Sounds like you're doing a baller job. Keep it up!
AAA!! im glad youre so supportive and to be even more so! that's awesome, and getting them a flag is a pretty great gift. id say you're already doing great, and i think you will in the future. just be sure to let them do things at their own pace, and listen to them about what they need, which it sounds like youve already got down

youre doing great, and the most important thing you can do for your kid (if it should ever come to it, i hope not but i know what the worlds like :/ so) is to stand up for them, and help them get through stuff. Like obvs that's something parents should be doing already, you've just got some new things you might have to deal with (like the school if your child decides to be out at school).

your second thing you might want to do is check out your library or the internet and learn a bit more. i don't really have any good resources offhand unfortunately, and there's certainly some bad actors out there in the world, but look for trans and nonbinary people talking about their own experiences.

&#x200B;

i think youll do a great job, and its so awesome that this kid knows who they are already and has such a wonderfully supportive parent!
I’m an adult but I wish you were my parent. Haha I just wanted to thank you for being an amazing parent and loving your child and taking care of them the way you are.
Sucks that my mom wouldn’t be supportive. :’( i wish I had a more supportive mom like you.
I think you're doing great! I think there might be a tough balance in the next couple years between supporting and encouraging your child and helping them make good decisions because being a teenager is tough. I think one of the hard things about being nonbinary is that it is not as clear what medical transition steps are appropriate as it is for binary trans people. It's going to be hard for you to walk the line between supporting them in medical transition and letting them know they can be themselves without it too. Honestly I'm 25 and have been thinking about it for years and I'm still confused by all of it - I can't imagine how hard it would be as a preteen! 

If you can expose them to a variety of nonbinary and trans adults and older teens who can serve as role models I think that could be one of the best things you could do, because it will show your child that there are so many different ways to be trans and not just a single path to follow.
this is all so great! The only thing I can think of is offering support and help communicating if they ever DO decide to share with your ex or current partner.
This made me very happy to read! You are a wlnderful parent and I'm sure your child knows that. Just keep showing them support and they'll let you know if they need anything!
Wow ! You sound like a first class parent ! I think you are doing a great job. Perhaps if your local library or bookstore has interesting resources about non-binary people or issues, that might be something your child would be interested in learning more about. Also , if your area has any LGBT youth organizations, it might be a good place for your child to meet other children like them. I know the LGBT youth group in my teenage years helped save my life. Best of luck you and your child, we all support you here!
You may consider helping them find a support group of some kind, or an LGBT center for teens in your area. Sounds like you are doing an awesome job already being a supportive parent!!

If you haven't already, you might want to discuss with them how you should refer to them in front of other people.  For example, do they want different pronouns in front of their father or your partner vs when just the two of you are alone together?
It's so nice to know that things are changing for nonbinary kids. I started trying to explain my gender around 3, but I didn't learn the language to describe it until I was in my twenties. 

My mom was supportive too- she even bought me little suits to wear to birthday parties- but it would've been so nice to know that there were words for what I was feeling, and that lots of other people felt that way too. 

It's good to hear that that moment of belonging is starting to come earlier.
You are a wonderful parent, thank you for being supportive of your child. I’m not sure if you already talked  with them about this, but it might be worth having a conversation about how your child would like you to describe them to other people. It sounds like they’ve made their preferences about their father and your SO, but do they want you to describe them as your child from now on? Or to use neutral pronouns when referring to them in front of friends or acquaintances? The interesting thing about pronouns is that we often never hear them because they are often not used in our presence. So a lot of the allying  that people do for NB people is often not in the presence of that person. That makes allying sort of a hidden action, and it sounds like you feel very comfortable in your support of your child which is wonderful. But I think it’s worth thinking about how that may land on you in certain moments, like recalling something that happened during the weekend to a coworker, and how you might Address that while also keeping your child’s preferences in mind. 

As a parent I am always astonished at the number of times that my child’s gender is somehow brought up or made relevant in the conversation even if it is not. I feel very comfortable telling people that I have a child, not a son or a daughter, because my child has not told me who they are yet. But as soon as my child makes a preference I’ll make sure to accommodate that, even if that preference is regarding protection of their preferences around certain people if that makes sense.
First, I really, really, really wish that I had a mom like you (both growing up and now). You are doing an amazing thing for your child that not many kids experience, nb or otherwise - youre accepting them for who they are and letting them be their own person, in charge of their own identity. My advice would be to just keep being an accepting supportive momma - you're their rock and they depend on you. Someday when they're on their own they're gonna thank you a million times over for being supportive of them. The flag is also a super great thing to get them, too 😊
This really made my day to see that a fellow NB has such a supportive parent in their life. Your kid has it good and you are doing good, so keep it up. Also keep in mind that gender can be fluid and their identity may or may not change as they get older. As long as you're as open and supportive as now, everything will be fine. Keep allowing your child to explore their identity and what it means to them.
you sound like such an amazing parent. wish my mum was supportive.💕
I'm not doin this any time soon lol my mom would hate me
Thank you for your kind words! They have one teacher who also identifies as NB, and I made sure they knew they could talk to them and seek their advice/help with school-related issues if needed.
That's a good idea, to let them know that changing their mind is normal. Hell, I change my mind daily about how I want to look/dress. I did give them the option to see my therapist with or without me, if they wanted! One of my therapist's specialties is gender and sexuality, so it would be perfect. :)
Thank you, puberty is something that is starting to happen already. They currently feel comfortable in their body and their anatomy, and I will continue to check in with them when the Big Changes start to happen.
Finding popular humans they can relate to is a great idea! We will work on that this weekend. :D
There's always room in my heart for more kids, so if you need a mom, I am here. :)
Thank you so much for the thoughtful, in-depth reply! I've got a good foundation, as I'm a little queer myself, so we will make a good team. I will advocate for them every step along the way, in school and in life, and I am thankful that we are now part of a society that is much more accepting of humans as they are, though I know there will be challenges.
Thank you for the kind words! Even adults need parents so you just let me know what kind of mothering you need and I'm here. :)
Maybe one of your friend's parents would be more supportive and you can trust them ?
Aw, I'm sorry your parents aren't supportive.
Oh that's so amazing!! I'm glad she has support in that way as well, she's going to have a great environment at school
If you watch Queer Eye on Netflix, Jonathan Van Ness just came out as non-binary. They also have a really good episode about a trans guy.
i wish every queer kid were this lucky!
I dunno. I have two very supportive friends, but idk about their parents. This is peak LGBTQ-phobic country, the Bible Belt.
yeah
That's a rough place to be! \*hugs\* If you need support, you can PM me any time and I will listen. <3
Thank you. Yeah it is really rough here. For how promising of an area the South is, it still has a long way to go. There’s still a lot of homophobia and transphobia, racism, and other negative mindsets. If you’re not Christian you’re in the vast minority. A lot of beer drinking and cigarette smoking, which I absolutely abhor. It just seems like change is coming much more slowly here, and it’ll still be a while until this region will really have a place for a person like me. An autistic, video game loving enby like me would be looked down upon here. Even my own uncle already hates my guts. We currently live with him and my aunt because we’re not in a good situation financially. I imagine he’d kick me out if he found out I identify nonbinary...

Sorry for the longish paragraph. I just felt the need to pour my heart out here.
Your feelings are valid and I thank you for sharing them with me. If your autistic, video game loving, enby self ever finds yourself up this way (Pacific NW), you'll have a hot meal, two 52"" LED TVs and Xboxs, and some super weird and open people to hang out with. :) I hope your living situation improves."	c25hbc	NonBinary	166	1.0	2019-06-18 17:56:55
First time going out (Target😂) in fem clothes. Crazy nervous. Wish me luck!		"Shirt twin! Looking good!

I really love that green shirt. I must have overlooked that one as a fellow target shopper. What's the brand? I'd like to look for it.
Looking fancy <3
I have that black shirt! The glow is hella strong and I'm thrilled!
Ngl... I really like that outfit...
Both tops are from Target!"	da5zuy	NonBinary	163	0.99	2019-09-27 20:23:25
Wear enough fucked up accessories and clothes and people won't assume yr gender they'll assume yr completely batshit		"That’s a very true statement 😂
Loving those earrings- where did u get them?
You've done it. You've cured my dysphoria.
Nice
You speak wise words
Good advice
Wacky person is definitely my preferred vibe. I’m a crazy old hippie/witch in training.
Yes!! Also useful so u can think ""people aren't giving me weird looks because I'm trans, it's because I'm dressed like a trinket store threw up on me""
Thank you!! They were a gift, but I think you can find similar ones if you search for acrylic or reflective knife earrings!
[beats your dysphoria to a pulp using wacky accessories]
Yes same!! I studied tarot and palmistry for the last three years to solidify the vibes
Very that
Thanks! Definitely gonna check it out :)"	ia5cti	NonBinary	157	0.99	2020-08-15 10:57:27
How I accidentally came out to my entire gym class, 4chan style	"- Be me
- Be agender
- they/them pronouns
- only ones who know are my friends 
- they call me my preferred name
- some popular girl hears and asks why they call me Ardyn
- i tell her why
- later in the locker room she asks if she can tell about my name
- thinks she means only her friends
- says yes
- she stands up on the locker room seats and announces that I'd like to be called Ardyn
- SHIT.jpeg
- people start asking questions about name changes and pronouns and stuff
- best friend pitches in to help explain
- popular girl says she supports me all the way
- other people call me Ardyn
- smiles big
- changes out of gym clothes and leaves
- mind blown"	"> popular girl says she supports me all the way

That's very heartening. Glad this turned out well for you!
5/7 would support

Fucking kids these days lol, being all accepting and shit.
They already knew. They were just giving you the push you needed to get out there. :-) 
Congrats!! Even though I'm sure it was nerve-wracking to accidentally come out, it'll probably benefit you in the long run, and it sounds like people were really good about it.

It is! It happened last Friday  (at the time of posting this!)

I’m excited for summer so I can wear fun clothes again (they/them)		"Love your shirt and hair, you look great! 🌼🧙‍♂️🌈

Thanks so much. I love sprinkling in a bit of my gothic influence where I can, I just have to be careful at my job. I didn’t get any comments when I wore it so hopefully that means I’m good to go. 😜
Thank you!

I'm so tired of being told I'm not trying hard enough!	"I'm so tired of having therapists and psychiatrists that I'm not even going to for trans issues telling me some variation of ""well you look cis to me"" or ""you dress like a girl"" and then ignoring my pronouns. My psychiatrist yesterday told me I was ""dressed just like all other girls these days"" because I was wearing a plaid button up shirt and ripped jeans.

1. All my clothes were from the men's section except for the pants.

2. IT DOESN'T MATTER HOW I'M DRESSED! I'M STILL NONBINARY

My regular therapist told me that I shouldn't be annoyed with her getting my pronouns wrong because I ""wasn't doing anything to minimize my female features."" Except that I was. I was binding, had given myself some mascara sideburns and was wearing all ""men's"" clothing. 

I'm just so tired of everyone telling me that I don't pass so they shouldn't have to bother with trying to use the correct name and pronouns."	"That sounds horrible!! You deserve to be referred to correctly, however you present.
Wow. It may be time to break up with your therapist.
oH sOrRy ThAt HoW yOu ViEw OuR bOdIeS dOeSn'T mAtCh OuR iDeNtItIeS. That's literally the definition of being trans. Sorry that people who should know better don't.
My cis son wears girls’ jeans (he likes tights, so I buy him skinny jeans), so I guess it’s ok for anyone to call him a girl, since he’s not trying to be masculine? How ridiculous.
Holy shit, that's fucked up.  I see there are no other local options - what about a skype/remote therapist who specializes in gender therapy? I don't know, it seems like the therapist you're seeing is going to do more harm than good.
Ugh, I can commiserate with being stuck on the “no matter what I do I look like a cis girl” boat. I hope you’ll be in a situation soon where you aren’t surrounded by transphobes ❤️
I was seeing a counsellor for a while and she really focused on self esteem problems (that definitely wasn’t my worst thing but what she focused on). I also wasn’t out to her. One day I came in with yesterday’s makeup on, probably the first time I had worn makeup in months. I didn’t usually wear makeup because I didn’t want people to get the wrong idea. But I walked in and she yelled and raved about how great I look and I think she assumed I was cured because suddenly I liked myself enough to do my makeup. But makeup isn’t a girl thing and I wasn’t doing my makeup before because of the time and so people wouldn’t think I was a girl but whatever
Dude, I think it's time  for YOU to tell THEM to try harder to use your pronouns. And not passing isn't a bad thing. I pass exclusively as female/woman/femme, but that doesn't invalidate me. Imagine you were a cross-dressing/drag-wearing cis person, or someone young who hasn't quite grown into their secondary characteristics. Can you picture these people being rude about that? Or would they apologize and use the right pronouns, no matter what the person looks like? These dudes are just being asses because they have something (conscious or subconscious) against your identity. And it isn't your job to fix them. So when they tell you to try harder, tell them to fuck off and try harder to not be asses. Cause they are the ones with a problem.
You need a new therapist. Bad therapists are the WORST and they often make you worse than before you came to them. The pronoun thing happens to me a lot as short hair us banned the AFAB people at my school and I'm too small to fit in a lot of masculine clothing, but no matter what people should respect your pronouns, especially your therapist of all people.
Sounds like you need a new therapist.
What the hell, I'm so sorry this is happening and you're stuck :( maybe try wearing your pronouns on pins and such?
Wow, it sounds like your therapist is really bad at their job and you should find a new one. I am so sorry you're dealing with that. You're not obligated to ""try"" to be your gender. You just are your gender.
Someone told me not all gender therapists are created equal, so I fired mine. She was basically useless.

It’s definitely not your only option, you can FaceTime with therapist or do you phone chats with therapists all around the states. Do a Google search and see what you can find. I would also suggest reporting this therapist to the board and weaving a yelp review so that someone can follow up with them on their practices and unprofessionalism
Could you possibly report them or tell them it makes you feel uncomfortable? And depending on your age and where you are getting treatment, if you are on a college campus, you can for sire report them
The only problem I see here is the therapist.  Apparently they do not understand what Non-Binary means and how just like everyone else non-binary people come in all sorts of gender presentations. I'm non-binary, I wear femme leaning clothing and present femme rather often. Sometimes when I'm super motivated I try for an androgynous look, though often its femme leaning androgynous. Dressing this way doesn't make me any less non-binary. My pronouns are They/Them all the time, no matter if I am dressed femme, masc, or androgynous. It does not seem like your therapist understands enough about non-binary people to be treating someone who is non-binary.
This is such garbage; those people really are ignorant and aren’t worth your time, but it’s certainly upsetting and distressing to have that happen.... you’re absolutely valid just as you are.... and I hope you can find better care at some point in the future. 

I agree with what others have said: a bad therapist can do more harm than no therapist, so strongly consider that

Best of luck; you deserve respect and happiness!
actually that's shitty therapy and idk how but there has to be a way to report that to something. these are not the things therapists should be saying.
Thank you. I think so too but to hear it from all the cis people where I live you wouldn't think so. I thought that medical professionals specializing in mental health would be better than that, but I guess not 🙃
I wish I had the option but I live in the armpit of Texas and this place is literally my only option.
Ugh I wish. But the issues that I need to go to the therapist for are the same ones keeping my from making any kind of income and that really limits my options. Plus I get my medication through the same organization and if I stop seeing one of their people, I stop getting my prescriptions covered. I only see the therapist once a month anyway. If it keeps going on after I get up the courage to talk about it, I may try to change people if at all possible.
I might try that. I've been considering pronoun pins for a while anyway.
Thank you. I think the worst part is that I'm not even her first trans client. She keeps comparing the two of us and expecting me to have the same reaction. (Expect that she gets the other client's pronouns correct all the time.) When I expressed distress about having to sign into the front desk with my deadname and asked if I could have them put a note or something in the system she basically told me that I shouldn't worry about it because she has so many clients that they wouldn't remember me, and also that her other trans client didn't care about their deadname being used. Like sure, that's fine for that woman. I'm happy it doesn't bother her, but she's not me.
There are a lot of things I expect mental health professionals to be better at.  I am routinely disappointed.

That really sucks.
I'm sorry. Please just keep reminding yourself that this is not your fault - it's the result of a really fucked up system and their own ignorance. I hope you are able to find a way to advocate for yourself here, but even if you can't, you are valid!
That really sucks. Would it be possible to stay away from the topic of gender completely when with them? Also, if you ever need anything we (and I) will be here for you!
Yes, can’t second this enough - you deserve a therapist that sees YOU. Not someone you’re not.
That almost made me happy cry. Thank you so much, I needed that.
I'm so glad it helped! It's the truth!"	bml3k0	NonBinary	156	1.0	2019-05-09 15:22:33
Today was my first day buying feminine clothing, clearly couldn't be more happy!		"Brilliant, I am so pleased for you. You can tell you are smiling behind the mask xx
