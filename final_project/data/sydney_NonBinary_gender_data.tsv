Freed from the gender binary! Age 51		"I bet you will get a million comments confirming this, but for younger enbies / nons like me it's always appreciated to see nonbinary people that are not just..... Twenty somethings with a sort of punkish looking style and I say that not to diss on under thirties with a punkish looking style because I AM ONE.

It's just always nice to see that, no matter what cishet people say, this is not a ""Stupid thing young folks get into because they want to be special and read it on the internet"" but a legitimate identity that people experience and actually LIVE with. 

It's a very ""We are here, we are queer, we are not gonna change just because you want us to change and we are gonna grow to be 200 years old and be happy and content with ourselves for ourselves but also just to spite you"" feeling.

...I would also like to say that you give of very gorgeous and positive vibes, couldn't fit that into my little soapbox speech up there but I could not quite fit it into it so it gets its own paragraph.:P
You look like an androgynous Bill Nye and I am in awe
Thank you for posting this! It is so inspiring to see older non binary people--it shows that we have always been around and that it's not just a ""trend"" 💜💛🖤
thank you for sharing this. You look idk, how to say this, healthy i guess like mentally. I’m sure you still have your struggles but you look like it’s going upwards and you know that. 

Gives me hope. I would call you a queen but considering this context imma just call you royalty.
Thank you for sharing! As others have said, it is really encouraging to see older (ie 40-50+) NB folks represented. It’s like, damn, I really can grow up to be nonbinary... I’ve never been able to see myself as an eventual old man or old woman, but without many adult NB role models, it’s hard to see a future for yourself as an NB youth. Thankfully I’m at a place now (23) where I feel pretty confident in my trans nonbinary identity, even though it continues to evolve. I’d like to be a role model for those younger than me, and it looks like you’re on a similar path. Sorry if that’s a ramble haha but again, thanks for sharing and existing. 💛

Also — ngl you’re giving “hot college professor” vibes and I am here for it ✨😳✨
This is so inspiring! It's not often I see an older LGBTQ+ person and it just fills me with joy every time. Makes me feel so much more secure in my identity. Keep rocking it bud!
Love this and love the bandana, I feel like accessorizing with a bandana in this way is very NB style (or maybe that’s just me lol)
It’s super awesome to see someone who isn’t 15-25 years old who is also nonbinary. Keep being awesome and fabulous! Also, I love your hair
Oh my god, this is so awesome and i can't stop smiling.
I'm so jealous of your hair. Absolute goals.
[The TL;DR version of my story](https://link.medium.com/k9w54jQ0xab)
I’m so completely shook, every time I see older LGBT+ people I’m just so fucking grateful. Thank you so much for sharing this and just idk, existing ? it’s crazy but completely true how just literally seeing older queer people being alive and happy is a huge deal to younger generations of queer people. you’re the best.
stunning!
Yes yes yes yes yes!!!!
awww youre so beautiful
I’m 35 and just started my journey. Trying to get top surgery on the books ASAP. I finally feel like I’m the person I’m meant to be and it just feels so good.
Im sure im not the first to tell you this, but thanks for taking the time to post here. We dont have many exemples of older nb people. I hope you know that by doing this simple action you have inspired many of us. Thanks for existing. Thanks for being you(you look really cool btw love your style)
Keep being great! 👍 and have a nice day
I know that you’re hearing a lot of this right now but, thank you.  As a younger person who has just finally embraced their identity as non-binary, it means so much to see people older and wiser who have the same feelings I do.  It’s the folks like you who show the world (and us!) that we’re not just a phase, that we are valid and we are beautiful and we are not leaving.  You give me a lot of hope and help me see myself as an adult. :)
what an amazing head of hair! i love your curls and how you’ve styled them. thank you for sharing🖤 you look peaceful and radiant.
You are absolutely gorgeous. I’m so glad your finally free!
Congrats you look great!
Congrats and welcome to the Older Enby Club. It's so liberating to know we're able to be ourselves no matter what our age may be. Sending you love!
i cant tell what gender you were assigned at birth #goals
Wow ! Welcome!!
THIS MAKES ME SO HAPPY!! YOUR EXISTENCE IS BEAUTIFUL
this makes me so happy!!! congrats to you friend! here’s to many more years of freedom and love and YOU~ 💜
Oh this heals my soul. I never thought I'd live to see the 23rd birthday I celebrated this year, let alone 51. But seeing you, I know I can do it. Do not underestimate the sheer power you have by just existing. I thank you for it.
Welcome to the family! I see such a kindness in your eyes 💛
 A fellow GenX!  You look so great.
You look amazing!!  Nice to see someone closer to my age here and out and being themselves. I’m the same, if I knew about they/them pronouns when I was younger I wouldn’t have struggled with my identity as much. 💛🤍💜🖤
My heart rn
Thank you for posting this, it gives me hope for the future
This image just proves to me that you never grow old to discover yourself 

You are 51, and are non-binary
That's just amazing 

Nobody is too old or too young to find themselves

You look amazing 

And from one enby to the other, I will support you till the dawn of time my ol fella

P.S I call everyone a fella so don't mind me
Iconic. I aspire.
YAY
It's always reassuring to see someone from my generation whose out of the closet! :3
Omg, yes! I love seeing Older Non-binary people (not that you’re that old lol, you look absolutely amazing). It gives me hope for not just my future but also the future for the rest of the community. I support you so much and I hope I can grow up and be proud just like you!
Omg yes!! It makes me so happy when I see older non-binary people (not that you’re that old, you look absolutely amazing). It not only gives me hope for my own future but the future for the community as a whole. Thank you for being yourself, and know that I support you! I hope I can grow up proud like you. 😊✨
You look like you give good hugs
Hell yes crongradulations!!
Welcome home!! 
Youre an inspiration and a half
No offense but you look like bill nye the science guy
So proud and you look so fucking cute!!!
this is how I want to be when I grow up
You are amazing. This makes me emotional. Best wishes, and here’s to a lovely freedom of authenticity!
Honestly I just feel like I'm going to echo everybody else in the comments, but it's incredible to see you so confident & beautiful. I was always told as a kid, and I think I believed it to some extent, that being nonbinary was something I was going to grow out of, that it was something to overcome. But now I realize that it is something that I can just BE, no if ands or buts, so thank you!
You look like someone I'd want to get to know! I'm so glad you posted. Like others have said, it's very validating to see someone older living their best enby life.
You look so cool!
I want you to be either my parent or my grandparent, I feel like you would be the most wholesome grandparent ever and give cookies to all the LGBTQIA+ kids
Senior enbies are always so cute 🥰💛🤍💜🖤
YES! Any time is a good time to be yourself. I’m glad to see more diverse rep.
Amazing! Thanks for sharing- live your best life 🎉
I love you! I am looking at you, I have adopted you. Hello Grandd.
Love your face
You look amazing for 51!
Can I hug you? Cuz I want to hug you :)  
You look like you give good hugs :D
It's really important for me to see older members of the community. Partially because it means we can stick it to those who say this a ""young person trend"" and ""you'll grow out of it,"" and partially because it gives a lot of hope for the younguns.

Also, you look like you're about to go riding a horse on your ranch. Just need the cowboy hat.
Wow I'm stunned by how mich of a natural and beautiful person you are!
You really give off the best vibes in this photo and so much inspiration for me. 
I was just thinking yesterday from something my mom told me, that she might be queer, too but that part of her was violently suppressed all her life. She is 54 now and I consider myself very lucky to have her and her being so open minded, when I came out just a few months ago.
This is an important reminder for me and probably a lot of other people, that this isn't something we will grow out of, getting too old for it or that it's okay to come out later in life and still be valid.

I hope the best for you and if you plan or already have come out to family and friends. <3
Welcome! You look so cool and cute might I add. You just proved yet again it’s never too late to open up or accept yourself as who you are, and by doing so, love yourself. A true inspiration you are, I’m sure there’s lurkers that might feel “too old” to join this community and even 51 is still young in my eyes. Welcome home! 😄
you're pretty
You look amazing and honestly, having adulty adults come out/present/live etc. As Nonbinary is a huge inspiration and makes me insanely happy 💖

Thank you for being you!!
you are beautiful!

You're an inspiration
GOALS
Only in your mind, not in real life. Sorry.
I feel so lucky to have lived long enough to realize all of this. I fervently yearn to be available to kids my kids’ ages who would benefit from me just walking around in the world. If the pronoun “they” had existed when I was 12, I wouldn’t have struggled for so long to discover myself.

Time for the old dog to learn new tricks! 😆
AHHHH HOLY SHIT I KNEW THEIR LOOK REMINDED ME OF SOMEONE LMAOOOO
That is honestly the best way someone could look.
Omg, I see it too.
I was getting David Byrne vibes too.
I see it now
I am too late, this was my thought immediately!
monarch is my fav nb term 😌
Regent 👑
😆😍 I haven’t felt attractive in years. It’s not a thing I associate with myself. Thank you for helping me conceptualize how I appear to someone with an open mind. ❤️
It’s very Covid in Portland, Oregon, to be sure!
Also, just today I realized why I have obsessed over the size of my butt all these years. I have no boobs, so my butt was the “girliest” part of me. It’s why I can’t gain weight. The fat goes in female places and I realize it makes me miserable for this reason. It’s why I could want to reduce my body fat even when I was barely a normal weight. 

Now, I can start trying to accept my body again! The next fifty years will look much differently! 🌓🥰
My shirt says “Nonbinary” with the elements in boxes, in rainbow colors. It’s 🔥
Honestly, your story made me tear up. I wish you all the best ♡
I'm SO happy for you!! I have always been mostly grateful that I was born with very little up top - especially as an athlete - but I feel that dysphoria, and if my top was bigger, I would have been more messed up than I already was. My heart is pulling for you to have the best possible experience because this is hard stuff!   


Younger folx have been my biggest inspiration! They are so brave, amiright?? And they get to live all those fun years as themselves! It's hard at any age, but I have so much happiness and respect for the people who figure it out young.   


It's so nice to have people closer to my age here, too! Thank you for posting. :)
Hey, 39 yr old
Thank you so much! NGL I asked for the length to be brushing my ears, but this is ok, too, I guess. It makes me laugh at how curly it is. It was so straight when it was long that people asked me where my curly-haired kid got his curls. Lol! 

I feel pretty naked! But that’s about right. Wiling to be vulnerable for the sake of clarity. 

I had long hair for 20 years!
How old does one need to be to join the Older Enby Club? Lol
Best comment ever!!! #Winning!
👀
I loved it!
Oh my goodness! I feel like if you are here, you have already succeeded! The rest of life is just time passing. If you get to experience it as your authentic self, you will be lightyears more confident than me, and you are an inspiration to others already!   


Shine on as your amazing true self and you are succeeding every second of every day!

Oh my gosh, as a five-year-old, I was so constantly dismayed at having to be a girl that I invented a world-view that would make life make sense for me. Halfway through one's life, one was able to switch what they were: girl-boy or boy-girl.... so you would know what you wanted to be in your next life. (My mom talked about reincarnation a lot - it was a way to encourage me to be a less troublesome child - ""If you keep bugging your sister, you will come back as a cockroach!"")   


Since I was 5, and that seemed really old at the time, I figured ""half way through a person's life"" was when you hit age 10. So I only had another five years to go as a girl.  


But over the years, as I thought about it and watched people, I very much wanted to be an old crotchety man someday. #LifeGoals LOL!
I'm super lucky, and wear my privilege on my body. I did Crossfit for 6 years, so nothing about me except my wrinkles and gray hairs say much about my real age. :)
I do love horses! Always did! I'm spending time nurturing people who have less than me as I wait for my divorce to go through. I have already succeeded in transitioning - the rest is just putting the parts and my life back together a new way. These are such exciting times!   


Being nonbinary is a natural state for me. Trying to fit into a binary system of gender never worked for me, and I'm sure it isn't working for a lot of people who are not even aware, like me, that they are ""allowed"" to question their gender identity.   


I hope to help those people too by being super visible. Today I have a shirt that says ""Genderqueer Rebel"" with the Star Wars Rebel symbol in purple, white, and green.

Oh gosh, thank you so much! My coming out was simultaneious with my understanding - it was all a public breakdown on social media in early August. It felt like my nonbinary self liberated itself once I was asked to leave the family and after having been denied for so many years. It was not something I *did*. It just .... was. 

Up until August of this year, I was wholly unaware that my gender was something that could be questioned. When it happened, the truth obvious. ""Aha! Now I understand why I've been such a PITA!"" 

So, I don't even think I consciously decided to ""come out."" I just did it without thinking about it very hard. I think that's a privilege of being an older, established person at the time. It felt like the decision was already made for me as soon as I understood it. 

It was instantaneous, loud, obnoxious, and messy. It was unplanned. Lol. It's as though I took a lightspeed ship to a genderqueer destination, but went too fast to see any of the history, meaning, or dangers of coming out. I have so much learning to catch up on now, and I managed to screw up my marriage pretty well. 
Moving forward, I'm trying to decide if I should get a degree in Gender/Queer theory so I can work in the field, or if I'm too old for more education and should just figure something else out that's more ad hoc and opportunistic. I don't know how to ""be"", or ""help"" but I want very much to do both! I don't feel qualified for anything ATM.
I could’ve used an inspiration like you when I was a kid. Thank you for being you!! 💜
Reading this made me teary 🥺😭 i’ve been struggling with my gender identity this year and as the other person said it’s nice to see older nonbinary people too 😭 thanks for being you 💖
I see ponyos dad
i tried to think of something but english isn’t my native language. Thanks i’m gonna use that in the future now.
Same, and also beings up mental images of monarch butterflies 🦋

Definitely hot professor vibes for me. Or the mysterious gardener in a romance novel who you meet while on vacation to the countryside and have a whirlwind affair with
Oh you’re so very welcome! I’m so glad to be able to confirm your attractiveness, and it looks like plenty of folks on this subreddit agree with me 😉🥰
Omg, i had the same problem, i'm amab and i got so unconfortable about weight cause it makes me look more masculine and i felt horrible about it. 
But I feel so happy about you, it's beatiful to see people finding ways to live a happier life 🥺🥺🥺
I cry every time I read it, too. It was such a difficult place to be. I have yet to explain it all to a marriage counselor, in a mandatory parenting class, and then figure out what my kids are going to make of it in order to move forward this year through what apears to be an inevitable impending (understandable) divorce.   


I have no idea what the future holds, but I know it is not yet written, and we have agency in the story of our lives! It's time to rise up and speak out!   


I am the author of my life, and my story is one of a person who keeps overcoming trauma, getting back up, and continuing to take swings at the binary system. Now I have a language for it! This is so amazing and freeing!

I don't know how I got to be this old, but now I can be the adult that I didn't have as a child!   


It's a different story than the one I was told I had to write, but mine is authentic, and that is always the right answer. Plus compassion. Compassion is always a good answer. :)
hey you got your bounce back :)
Lol, no clue. Myself, I'm 44. Been identifying as gender queer for about 17 years now. 💛
stalker
Sounds MMMMM
I love this! As a child I had no concept of what ""girls"" and ""boys"" because I just did what I wanted it wasn't until around when I was 9 did my parents start talking to my therapist about ""She acts like this one day and a boy another."" And I'm like ""confusing"" why do they act differently? And anyway I am going to be a old old cat man when I grow up with 70 cats and I will bake cookies for the neighborhood.
That really sounds messy and although parts of your coming out sound really harsh and bad, you seem liberated by this crash. But I can understand that, too, because when you can break free from something or someone that hold you back for a long time, then you also feel like a weight was lifted off you.
A lot of times I look at younger folks who are afraid of losing people they love when they come out and it always feels shallow to say: It's a shame you have to be someone else but yourself to be accepted by your family. But it really is important to have people supporting you and not hang to people who want you to be different than you actually are.
I hope you still have someone around that can celebrate your newly found identity.

And I really feel you on the matter of looking at all the things there are to learn. Just as an example: I knew for about 10 years now, that I'm pansexual and I was very interested in any queer topics and such. 4 years ago I identified as genderfluid but was pulled down by an ex of mine who prevented me from learning more. So it was only this year that I found out, that a non-binary identity can also be trans, that certain aspects of my psychological problems were actually dysphoria. So till this year I didn't know that transgender is not strictly binary, but there are still some people who would like to keep it that way. Keep an eye out for folks that try to invalidate your feelings.
As for your future: Do whatever you think would be good for you. I had a teacher who told us about going to study art after he would be done teaching with 63. And although you don't know how to ""be"" right now, just looking at this post, you already helped a lot of people by being visible. Visibility is always some sort of power. If there is no representation in the media or on social media, we feel small and unsure. I started watching a gender psychologist on YouTube, who talked about her experiences and that she also had a lot of people who realize and come out in their 40s and 50s. She helped me learn a lot more about myself again and now I started to look for someone specialized in gender in my own country. (Her name is DR Z PHD on YT)
Anyway I wish you all the good things for your journey! <3
royalty works just as well!! your English is great btw!
What about ""ruler"", or ""sovereign""? :D

Also, your English is already written better than some native speakers (but hey, people can't be good at everything!). What's your native language, if you don't mind me asking?
Would you take enthusiastic-if-burned-out-youth-soccer-coach, and PTO rabble-rouser who lost a good friend over the perceived necessity to tell kids to choose items from the “girl” side and the “boy” side of the Holiday Gift shop (for those special adults in their lives-it was a super cool idea-donations to the PTO that we let the kids pick and help wrap. Just WAY too gendered for my sanity. Like, I can’t think straight when people gender things unnecessarily. It makes me 🤬🤷🏼‍♀️
This!! It's a pretty specific Vibe but it's a good one
It sucks to have to go through all of that. Just remember that you have always been you, you just found a word for everything now, you finally found yourself. And thats awesome!
I'm 22 now and I also never felt like i fit in, i always wished i was a boy when i was younger, i always wished that my breasts wouldnt grow and once i got my period i cried like hell. It was like the biggest slap in my face telling me ""you are a woman"". When i was around 14/15 i started wearing make up and wearing more ""girly clothes"". I didn't really feel like myself but it was what was expected. When i was 18 i just said ""fuck all of this"". I stopped wearing make up and started wearing whatever makes me comfortable. But i still called myself a woman. I tried to convince myself that gender doesnt exist and i'm only referring to my sex. It was easier than telling people i'm non binary. It was easier than telling people i feel like a gender many people don't even believe exists. I was scared people wouldnt believe me. I didnt want to be called a ""snowflake"" for simply giving my experience a label. It takes courage to come out and stay true to yourself.
My parents got divorced as well, and i truly believe it was the best thing they could have done. I'd much rather have two happy seperate parents than two parents that are miserable together. Children can sense when something isn't right. I think as long as you give your kids time, they will understand. I always want to go into advice mode, but i also know that i can't really give much advice in this situation. I'll just let you know that if you want to talk about something, anything, just life in general, you can drop me a message! :)
From one sad non-binary queer to another-- I hope you continue to live, and that your life only improves with time. Be safe.
39 here, similar age. I came out at 16 and everyone laughed at me. Came out again at 23 when my older drag queen bf took me to my first pride parade, never looked back. Went on hormones at 32.
That’s what i do
good to know. Thanks.
ok genuine question? 
How the fuck do people like you 
always suddenly come out of the blue
on a post from 2002 
how long have you been scrolling?
🥵 yes
So happy you're happy!
go achieve validation
My transition was kinda shitty because my body was already mature. I still have a weird voice, but hey, better than being somebody else
I totally agree, it's better to be yourself no matter what.  And if you have a weird voice, maybe try using it to make money doing voice acting? My partner transitioned at 20 and his voice is still higher than he'd like it to be. He does vocal exercises to get the tone a bit lower. Too bad hormones only give, not take away."	ja20le	NonBinary	6860	1.0	2020-10-12 23:25:59
“What gender are you?” “Winning.”		"gender is a mortal concept. I am above it
Sadly putting my deadname and she/her pronouns cuz I’m not out
I am a disembodied voice in a hoodie online, and that is beautiful

I feel like it's almost criminal not to link to the tweet bc of one of the top replies: https://twitter.com/JosieKame/status/1313649836340572161?s=19
Honestly what a mood. On good days when I makes moves like that I’m just like “damn, I’m so authoritative- asserting my dominance all over the place by having people respect me” 😂
I am gender-gifted, gender-talented.
Ha I love it when you have your dead name and then they them pronouns on canvas but you’re the only one that put pronouns in your entire class so you go back on that because you look insane compared everyone else because it looks like you just add that instead of it being a function of you completing your profile.
Pain could describe it, because pain is the one who always hugs me and reminds me that I hate chronic pain
me with my genderfluid pronouns
fkn here for it
Me, rn! Except then someone else put a THEY. There’s two of us! 💜🤍💛🖤
Omg I feel seen. More than that, I've felt quite self-conscious about it, so I'll think about it like this from now on.
""Yeah but what's in your pants?""
""Victory""
I’m in the comments of that tweet 🥰
I want to do this so bad but we use WebEx which slices off parenthesis so it looks dumb, plus no one else does it.
I always do that. Sometimes I'll see someone else add pronouns to their zoom name after they see mine.
You know what this is a good way of thinking about it (as the only one consistently putting pronouns in my zoom name and still getting misgendered hell yeah)
I only went on online class once,and when I did I was watching RWBY(volume 4,it doesn’t help that the day before I made the fatal mistake of watching volume 3 in front of my parents)while the online class was on another tab. And then the teacher just starts talking OUT OF NOWHERE!
I DO THIS !
this is beautiful. i have looked at this for 5 hours now.
i prefer ne/bae
Pretty sure that has the opposite effect 💀
asserting dominance ""THEY/THEM YOU LOWLY CLASSMATES""
LITERALLY
Oh wow your soo cool
Gender is a prison and I've chewed through the bars.
The *Traditional Gender Binary System™* is similar to the ice caps.

They're both rapidly going away and people are pressed
You are loved. Stay cozy as you can in that closet until you're ready, I'll send blankets and cocoa!!!!
Your time will come! Stay strong in knowing who you are 💛💛💛
Hi can I join? I have White cheddar cheese its and a big rabbit.
Am I allowed to keep you company? I can bring my dog
I started using my chosen name and still the wrong pronouns at work, I didn’t have to come out but it feels slightly more comfortable and a lot of people accidentally gender me correctly via email b/c they don’t know me. 10/10 recommend.
Hello. I am in da closet too. I have a cozy blanket if you'd like to share. I also have Netflix, Hulu, and Disney plus on my phone. I also put one foot outside the closet to grab some candy. Let's get through this together :3
Not out but still seen and valid ❤️
Can I join? I have a chiweenie and sushi.
Constantly filling a duraluminmind while on zoom like
Oy, yeah, I don't love how it handles in-session name changes. It should really just ask like with video.
I'm in Eng. Most people I know are respectful at least, haven't heard any transphobia from them. I know one NB in engineering and everyone who knows they're nb makes sure to get the right pronouns.

I am gender-deficent, lol.
I can relate
Gender is cheesy and I'm lactose intolerant
Except with the ice caps it's a bad thing
Ahhhhh yes with marshmallows plz
Ooh cheezits
Why have many cheese its, when you can have one *cheese  t h e m*
Aw hell yea, I might steal ur dog if it’s cute tho
Hey, if we’re all hanging out... could I come? I also have puppies. I can bring snacks.
Ahhhh yes blanket blanket blanket
💛🤍💜🖤
Ofc, but I’ve actually since come out lol
Didn’t expect a Sanderson reference on this sub, but yep
I find it so arbitrary what it asks for before meetings. I think I've had it ask for my name and video different times but so rarely
That implies you need more gender. Want some of mine?
Little tiny marshmallows! Here ya go!
I wouldn't recomd doing that, my dogs not the only one who bites
I had my friendo (who is out of the closet) grab us more blankets. We can make a blanket fort!
I just saw the username and had to :D
Hahaaaaa nvm can I just take ur dog home for a few days then? 👉👈
ooh yay! have them bring a campfire too (ignore the fire hazard ;))
That’s what I thought.
Sure, but she does bite a bit. Not in a mean way, she just likes to play

It's true I have no idea how to sit in a chair
I’m more of a Frank-N-Furter type of nby.
On certain days I will present as Yzma or Edward Scissorhands.
That’s how I’d explain my gender
My goals are to become machine. strong. unburdened by the weight of human limits. immortal.
I do wish there was a version of HRT for androgyny, like instead of going MtF or FtM, it just slides your masculine-feminine character creator bar right into the middle.
You remind me of the babe
Y'all should also check out Dorian Electra if Bowie is gender goals for you :) their music is awesome too!
I mean goals
I told my therapist a couple weeks ago that I identify with David Bowie in terms of gender presentation!! I like glitter and makeup. Sending her this meme lol
so gender
Jareth is always the goal.
my transition lol

→ Egg in men's athleisure 

→ r/MTFButch in men's streetwear (w/ notes of goblin)
Can confirm my wife looks like Jennifer Connely and she is obsessed with this movie.

My hair is shorter now, but it used to be goblin style for a long time, LOL!
Labryinth is literally one of my favorite movies so this tracks for me
It is so stereotypical but heck isn't the bottom pic goals
David Bowie is very gender
The sheer accuracy is astounding
‘There is indeed a kind [...] neither male nor female, a thing of the neuter gender, lately started up among us. It is called a **macaroni**. It talks without meaning, it smiles without pleasantry, it eats without appetite, it rides without exercise, it wenches without lust.’

I've never felt more attacked by anything in my life.

@me wrapped up in a snuggie, one leg on the couch arm and the other on the top of the couch,  leaning against a pile of cushions
This is killin me bc me and my friends jokingly refer to my enby partner as a goblin all the time lmfao
agree i cant sit normally on a chair
No cuz the gender envy from that character bro, like bish idc if I'm half boy I will look like them
I’m deceased😂
Then there's me, forever wearing black on black lounge wear with absolutely no patience to accesorize, style, or plan.

It sounds sad but I really like the lax, comfy, genderlessness.
😂😂i cant even express how on point this is. I’m still genderly confused sometimes i want to be masculine sometimes feminin, sometimes i dont want to choose and just be a thing. I really dont know what i am tbh
we do be havin unhinged haircuts
It's the sweet spot.

Check out Neil Gaimans Sandman, and the character art for Lucifer. 

Bowie is the All-padre.
Is it bad that I haven’t really transitioned and don’t have plans to currently? I do kinda want to experiment with more “androgynous” clothes but idk how and I’m afab with really long hair and I love makeup so I’ll always look like a woman and I’m not out to everyone in my life so I basically cosplay a woman everyday and I don’t mind it because I still feel really connected to femininity. Am I still valid?
I love seeing memes I made in the wild
I mean as a trans guy, I badly wanna be the third pic. I wanna be a beautiful yet handsome fantasy prince
I will so gladly be David Bowie as the goblin king! I used to watch this movie every 3 - 4 months for years!
What about Ludo or the Fireys?
:)
the goblin king
ten thousand percent
Goals.... 😆
LMAAAAOOOO i love this
Goblin King and Sephiroth are my Nb fantasy icons.
Fukk ya
This is the truest thing I’ve ever seen, lol
i’ve never felt so seen (-,:
I have never felt so seen! Goblin King is my exact aesthetic and that is precisely how I sit in a chair! Woo! Goblin King!
This makes me euphoric
You are not wrong
Honestly me
Ok but why do you have to be so right
Oh this is accurate
The other day I was asked to describe my gender and the only thing I could think of was “I AM The Goblin King!!” Without even meaning to reference this haha
yeah basically
YESSS jareth is perfect goals!!!
OMG YAAAAAAAAASSSSSSSSS! That's what I always wanted to beeeeeee.

But, shouldn't it be, ""The Goblin Ruler"" or maybe ""The Goblin Dictator"". Goblin Boss. Goblin Master. Goblin Tyrant. King is too damn gendered.
BOWIE SUPREMACY ⚡️
I mean, who wouldn't want to look like David Bowie in the Labyrinth? Shit, he's got hottest androgyny ever created!
I had no idea this would be so popular so I'd like to say that I'm not the original creator of this meme. I don't know who originally made it to credit them but yeah I'm just reposting it. I don't know how to pin comments to the top if that's even possible but just wanted to say it
😻
*David Bowie owes me his gender /hj*
Naw, I'm not a child raping fascist
Nah, this ain't right

I'm a girl but I'd still pull off that Jareth vibe
This is so extremely stereotypical. The irony of this being r/pointlesslygendered
Ong
Lol okay that's very cool
I will be stealing the phrase themperor/thempress cause that is genius
This coinage is fire, might I also suggest the addendum Themprex for the discerning agender Sovereign?
Guess what? I'm a quing >:3
Disagree. Bowie knows *exactly* how to sit on that chair
Same 😂
*what is chair*
But look at that chair, I looks made to sit like that. Lol
so basically... ""Disaster Stab"" ?
It's a chaotic explanation but I can picture it
Same
Good goals 😌
Transhumanism is the way
Same
I want an exoskeleton.
*children of the omnissiah faintly plays*
There kind of is. People do take small doses of it sometimes to just shift.
Maybe look at micro dosing? That's what I'm planning on using, just to get some of the effects of hrt
What babe?
Oh will do. Just looking at photos I'm so jealous of their style. I need to improve my makeup game Stat.
Do it!
Absolutely 😌
Wenches?
Sameeee
I know right!
Everyone's gender expression is valid. 

Androgynous, mix of masc/fem features, going the opposite from what you were assigned at birth, alternating depending on what you feel like, or just not changing much about your looks but still feeling enby on the inside. It all goes.
Oh my god thank you for making this meme! I did try and add a comment to say I didn't create the meme but idk how many people saw it
The fireys creep me out a lil but ludo is amazing. In terms of matching their aesthetics... Yes just yes those are definitely envy aesthetics
Context?
It’s arguable. I mean, he was made from her thoughts/mind.  But of course, the movie was written by adult men. Soooooo….

But yeah while I love some aspects of the whole Labyrinth phenomenon, Jareth is the most problematic and troubling aspect. Sarah was so young. And so many sexual (and idk, bdsm?) overtones.
Thank you, I came up with it a bit ago as an alternative to king/queen
Even better, lets continue with the inclusion :)
I say quing or princette (sounds kinda fem but oh well)!!
Not chair, throne
That’s… surprisingly effective imagery
I cant wait for cybernetic implants. Eyes that can see full spectrum light. Enhanced muscles that can crush and I-beam. Yehhhhh that would be nice. Allways loved Cyberpunk cos thats the world i want to live in. Neon lights, drugs, implants that allow you to plug in and hack like in Neuromancer. That sounds really noice
The babe with the power
Done!!! 

Back when I told her I vibe with Bowie she was like, ""David Bowie sounds like a valid gender identity to me"" (jokingly not in a phobic way)
Used here as a verb. https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/wench
Sorry I’m late but thank you for this. My gender is no one’s business but my own and I just need to remind myself that I can express it however I want to.
They are little creeps but the ability to detach parts at whim seems cool. I would be a Ludo in a heart beat, or like Wendigomon from Digimon: the movie. Similar very large loud repetitive beasts.
You don't wanna chilly down with Fire Gang?
David Bowie was a fascist who raped children.
Have you watched the movie? Honest question.
Theyre talking about david bowie
Bdsm? How?
That's awesome 😁
most would say monarch, but you are wiser
I am also stealing said phrase.
i'm still gonna drape myself over it in pansenbyxual confusion
As soon as someone sits on a chair like that it becomes a throne
this is my smug grin
I always liked the idea of cyberpunk mixed with solar punk. You get the sustainability of humanity and that allows people the freedom and flexibility to make massive improvements to the human form
What power?
Hell yeah! You've got a good therapist 😌
Oh my 🫢 thanks for the definition link.
I think you'd also like grimlock from transformers (he's a big dinobot)
Nah they're cool and I'm sure they're lovely but I'd be worried they'd try to take my head off 😂😅
No, I have not. I don’t even know what movie it is I haven’t watched.
Oh
Power-exchange? Dominance and submission?
I guess these are more explicitly nonbinary which is nice for those who want it.
Do it, let's make it part of the standard lingo
pansenbysexual. I like that. I'm gonna refer to myself with that now haha
Idk theres so much i hate about my body. The idea of removing bits and getting new cybernetic implants just seems cool. It will never happen but i can dream :)
Never heard of solar punk?! Thats cool. I allways loved diesel punk too. Thats like bioshock. 

I just got deep into cyberpunk fiction and philip k dicks stuff. His later stuff like scanner darkly and VALIS is good too but its more metaphysical and philosophical
The power of voodoo!
Some of us therapists are also enby. ;D
Love grimlock, as a kid watching Beast Wars, I learned how to do the Waspinator voice and as an adult, I know for a fact I annoy the hell out of people yelling ""Waspinators Ready!""
But the movie is mostly a fantasy that happens within Sarah’s mind. So Jareth is really just her thoughts. And she ends up rejecting him and his fantasy kingdom anyway.
It’s the Jim Henson movie Labyrinth. Very 80s—I think 1985. The Goblin King was (probably?) an adult male pursuing a …13 or 14 year old I think?
I guess it just seemed like some fae shit to me Idk
I get that. Been wanting some robot legs for a minute. They just need to be way better than the stock model
Who do?
My therapist is they/him enby <3
That's not annoying that'd fucking coooool! I'll be honest I haven't watch beastwars, only got into transformers properly a few month ago cause of my bf 😅
Thanks.
Yeh. For That shouldn’t be hard…

Anything would be better than stock rn
You do
You do.
Thehimby
Enjoy the journey of discovering Transformers! Ratrap and Dinobot are two lovable aholes, and Black Arachnia is fantastic...honestly, everything about Beast Wars was good, but if you want a cgi acid trip watch Beast Machines.
Do what?
Thankyouuu. I've seen clips from both and the animation is certainly something 😂 I do wanna watch them someday thou
Remind me of the babe!
I saw my baby
Crying hard as babe could cry
Crying hard as babe could cry
What could I doooooo
My baby's love had gone
And left my babae bluuuuuuuuue

Well, you’re really rocking that forever style! **❤️**

Oooo!!

I gotta figure out women's to men's size conversion - though I know it's always different between each fashion house

Ooh sounds great, there’s always a need for more enby representation! Lmk when whatever you’re writing comes out, I’d love to read it"	klsjbs	NonBinary	4319	1.0	2020-12-28 15:31:01
Sooo yesterday was my bday, and a rarely ever dress up, but these pictures gave me the biggest wave of gender euphoria. Heckin im so happy		"Your hair is absolutely amazing!
First off I love your hair. Second you look absolutely amazing in these pictures. And third there is just this sense of euphoria that I got from these pictures just looking at them before reading your title (the first one I saw before I read it but then looked through them) that I just wanted to give you a big celebratory hug for the happiness you were giving off. It always makes me so happy to see others happy to be themselves. Happy birthday. I hope you’re able to have more days of this gender euphoria.
Hey so I saw a thing asking how I did my hair, so I used artic fox dye first. I used electric paradise, ultra violet, poseidon, and aquamarine. And just added each to a part of my hair and kinda mixed it together with my hands. Thank you all for being so kind and loving its made the feeling even better.
Happy birthday!
Happy belated birthday!! You look amazing! I love your outfit and hair!
You BELONG in a bow tie, skirt, and thigh high socks, my friend. What a look!

If gender euphoria was a drug, this suit would be my fix 👌👌		"you look SO GOOD i am dying!!! damn!!! where did you get your suit??
I showed this to my girlfriend, who called it delightful and suggested I get a similar outfit. 😊
Lookin' so sharp somebody might bleed after touching you.
Hell yes!

Local or online and if so, where?
Lookin sharp. Nice bass too
Loving the tie design. Purple is my favorite color and the shades used in the suit are awesome
oh my god neil cicierega (i am sorry)

O my, you look amazing!!! 🥰
I looks great on you!
You look JUST LIKE MY FRIEND!
Can I say, and I mean this in the best possible way, you exude extreme Brian David Gilbert energy.
SoooooobAwsome!!! I kinda mumbled to myself ""bro that's lit"" and then I was like oh wait right nb. I use bro too much. On females too. It annoys ME.
Good heckin suit dang
Wow that suit is FRESH! May I ask where you got it from?
It SUITS you so well!!
OMFG??? You look STUNNING!!!!! like marry me plz

Trans people all play bass
Of course you play bass.
Bass, BASS, BASSIST! ...based
Looking hella dapper. Nice bass as well!
I'd slapp dat bass!
All you’re missing is a police box
bass
Gosh! You look so gorgeous in it! I wish I could buy a man suit but I live with my parents and my mother don't like when I pronounce ""he"" about myself. In my native language every verb show the gender (for example: сделал (""he"" made) - сделала (""she"" made)). That's why I like to use eng language as an agender. And I even can't imagine what happens if she will see me in a man suit
This is giving me some strong Brian David Gilbert vibes and I'm a fan
How does everyone on here look amazing in a suit? I need to go get one for myself 😂😂
Every aspect of this look is incredibly stylish

Lmao		"""nice gender identity, wanna fuck?""
the best possible phrase to show support after you sent that lol
Hey, at least Carson isn’t bigoted with his agenda
""thanks for the info let's have sex"" based
Ah yes, the only logical follow up question
Legit just checking ""is this someone who will potentially want to fuck""

""Ok, wanna fuck?""
I posted this in r/tinder and everyone is just being enby-phobic lmao


Edit: I was downvoted as hell for explaining in the comments and the trans phobes where upvoted, but now that it’s getting to the top or r/tinder people are downvoting the enby-phobes and calling them out. Actually shows that the general population of Reddit is more accepting then the people who sort by new on r/tinder

Edit: it’s now on the front page of Reddit, I have only gotten multiple death threat dms, and have been called disgusting, gross, trashy, degenerate, and that people like me and my two partners are destroying our society at least 300 times in the comments. I have about 100s of notifications of attack helicopter Style jokes, people telling that I’m mentally ill, I’m getting spammed by Reddit’s suicide watch alert, and my ex girlfriend told me that people from Reddit are stalking their instagram because they reversed imaged search an image I posted of us 4 years ago. Queer, poly, and enby, a combination that all the neck beards hate.
A true ally! /hj
Carsons are bro-y, but low key based I feel
Genuinely? The only good response
Unfathomably based
Same energy as ""damn your ass is fat, what's your pronouns?""
That's basically my boyfriend when we first got togetherXD

I was like ""I need to let you know I am not cis"" and explained non-binary to him. 
First reaction of him was to ask me if I want to get to know his NB friend. Second one was ""so what, you're still hot""
Carson is here to fuck, but he's also happy to learn.
I almost want to give this a wholesome award.
I mean, NO, but I appreciate Carson's apparent reading comprehension skills and ability to roll with new information. 😂
Gotta respect it LOL
As an autistic pansexual enby the allyship and directness is appreciated. Conversations would go much more smoothly for me if people were always this clear about their intent lol
Respectful and straight to the point. Probably not straight in any other way tho.
Mans is here to get jiggy and nothing is gonna stop him
eyyy imo pansexual and nonbinary is one of the best combos around 💖💛💙💜🖤🤍💛
I think I’ve said yes in this same conversation on Grindr before 😵‍💫
This thread is full of Carson simps smh my head
Wasted no time
I'd love to get this from a guy! 😂
True ally
LMAO well at least they’re not transphobic I guess?
Chad mentality.
Honestly this is what I hope for
Based
Gigachad
i mean at least he supports?
At least they are honest
He's got the spirit
carson fucks
Quick thing: things like this makes people assume that bisexuality is confined to only man or woman when it really isn’t. It’s more attraction to characteristics often put into two separate groups, hence bi, but they don’t have to be within those two groups to be attractive. For example, someone who’s non-binary is still attractive, just like a cis person. And it’s not called “manwomansexual” for a reason, it’s not only those two. I, for example, define my bi label as being attracted to men and non-women. You get what I’m saying? Basically bisexuality is inclusive of non-binary people.
ally!
Honesty and respect for another's being and time, rare in these trying times
I mean, it’s a better reaction than most people have when I explain it, honestly I’d go for it that guy seems cool
What did you answer with
This is pretty funny
take notes, everyone
Homie is straight to the fucking point.
absolute chad
THIS WAS LITERALLY HOW IT WENT MY FIRSY TIME LMAO
He was cis and kinda bi? And yet he was the only one to call me by my name and using neutral pronouns and adjectives via text (in my native language there's no they them).
So, to be called by my name I just have to fuck everyone? Cool, I like it
It really do be like that
Well that took a turn real quick.
Amazing lmao
YEEEAAAAH
Honesty. I like it lmao
Carson agenda is to fuck, nothing more and nothing less
Don't let them hangen, did ya fuck xD
Simple and to the point. I'd fuck em.
“I’m very proud of you for learning who you are and what you identify as :) now wanna have sex?”
I've never met a Carson that I didn't like. Usually 50% stoner and 50% puppy
I could only hope for this kind of candor
damn not even using the right definition of non binary :(
a true ally
Fuck Carson. By which I mean, don’t fuck Carson.
[deleted]
It might just be but that feels gross (I don't use dating apps I have no idea of this is the norm)

But based, bro wants to fuck AND he respects gender identities
LMAO
Chad
Hahaa love this
I swear I’ve had this exact conversation before, about twenty million times. It’s exhausting 😂
Ah dating apps
Not a bigot, open to being educated, honest about his intentions. I respect that, honestly
Man's straight forward gotta give him that
based?
OP, did you fuck 🤣
'I showed u my gender identity pls respond'
imma have to use this
nice gender, nerd
Identify a woman
""Cool beans, sex now?""

Just lol. Kinda refreshing. Carson is a tall drink of water by definition.
😂
His agenda is to fuck
The only true ally.
Horny is horny is horney
😂
sigh lol everyone on that sub is mostly cis white reddit men so it’s expected at this point
Hey, I'd like to invite you to a sub that will definitely have support for you and your partners, and will happily have your back. It's the best safe space I've found on Reddit besides this sub. 

Please, all my enby family, feel free to join us over at r/witchesvspatriarchy where you do not need to identify as a woman to be a witch, and the sub has repeatedly shown love and support for enby/trans people.
ah, the ""what is gender"" combo
:D
Heck yes! Might as well be a Goliath in DnD with all of the lack of fucks given around all things gender.
It's true, every enby gets weak in the knees when Carson says those gentle words. 

*""...Wanna fuck?""*
We cannot confirm or deny if Carson does fuck.
Yeah the tinder convo is from my gf and how they described it not me. I have been explaining to a few people that etymology doesn’t alway equal definition on r/tinder

I often link to this video I made a while back https://www.tiktok.com/t/ZTRaV5Mmj/
Yeah, I get cheesed when ""bisexual"" is called out for being exclusionary of NB folks when ""hetero"" and ""homo"" are not. ""Homosexual"" means ""attracted to people whose gender is the same as mine"" (thereby dividing the world into two categories) and ""heterosexual"" means ""attracted to people whose gender is different from mine."" The ""bi"" in bisexual is hetero+homo, not men+women.

Different monosexuals can even have different criteria for what counts as the same/different gender; bisexuals may or may not have such distinctions, but in practice it doesn't really matter.

I identify as bisexual even though I'm nonbinary, because (1) it's the right word, see above, and (2) people tend to interpret ""pansexual"" as ""attracted to everybody"" and then get butthurt when my demisexual ass doesn't wanna go.
But not straight in any other way
This was a convo from my ex gf so it wasn’t my definition
It sounds like it is their definition for themself. We aren’t all “in between”, but they are and that’s what their potential sexual partner really wanted to know about.
Sorry you got so many downvotes
I don't see the issue with this, it's scummy if they have sex with you while making you think they plan on having a future with you, not if they are upfront about wanting casual sex.
Why is this being downvoted? Did I miss something?
Where'd you get your gender? Your mommy pick it out for you?
A simple and time-honored agenda.
Honestly I would rather have someone say that than give me that sappy crap about “oh I’m so happy you get to live as your authentic self”. Just fucking say you’re not interested.
respectable, he tryna get laid
Carson is agender?
Now that it’s getting to the top of r/tinder people are being more accepting which is nice!
Thx love, I occasionally visit the sub already :)
Here is a recent sample post to help let you all know you are welcome there too [welcome to the coven, friends ](https://www.reddit.com/r/WitchesVsPatriarchy/comments/xle0a1/i_know_i_dont_really_fit_the_look_here_but_i_came/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share)
Would pansexual and genderfluid people get this achievement? :D

💓💛💙💓🤍💜🖤💙
Yeah, exactly, that’s what I was saying just badly worded lol
AMAZING
There's a pun somewhere here about honor and horny
get out
That's encouraging. I'm glad to hear that
I really hope so since I meet both criteria. I feel the ultimate ""What is gender?"" would be novosexual + genderfluid though.
No I think u worded it pretty good!

A couple outfits that have made me feel very ~gender~ lately		"Not fair quit hogging all the gender!!
I, transmasc, want to look how you do on the right. My girlfriend, transfem, wants to look how you do on the left. You literally gave us both gender envy, be very proud
You look awesome those outfits suit you so well
Both outfits are super awesome! Im a big fan of the pink jacket. Which outfit did you like most?
the two sides of gender i wish i could pull off.

SAVE SOME FOR THE REST OF US
wowsa! those outfits look absolutely amazing! both on you, and in general! very coordinated, and very very gender
oh my godddd you are absolutely serving in both of these. somehow getting gender envy in both directions. and i want to steal those cargos!!
They're both so good!
How do you have so many kickass outfits? I'm so jealous
1. you have immaculate styling, id pay you to style outfits for me ngl
2. hot
✨amazing✨
wow
Wow !! Amazing tbh
God I'm envious of you rn
Great fashion sense! Are you wearing a wig in one of them or did you dye your hair?
I swear I never saw a pictures describing my gender more clearly.
1. You look amazing
2. How did you get the light pink heart
cool : )
I want both of those outfits! You look stunning!
Ah yes, you are looking Exceptionally Gender™️, very well done
👌🏻😄
Both are gorgeous! Power to you 😎
Gender envy is real. I wish I can do this. You look fantastic!
I am INCREDIBLY jealous of ur fashion sense
You look INCREDIBLE in both!!! Your vibes are immaculate.
Did anyone else think of the pink house next to the black house? No? Just me?

But anyways, these are awesome outfits!! Glad they made you feel very gender 👍
Oh, a fellow shapeshifter! :)
I love the black outfit so much! I wish I looked that super cute in that super cute black outfit!
actually my two dream styles holy shit give me some pointers
omg are you a stylist or costume designer?

honestly amazing work.
Both cute
You look very cool in both!  


Where did you get those boots tho
Go off, matriarch <33
Omg I love your hair!! I want to get mine cut like that soon. You look so good in both pics 🥹
Very very good aesthetic tastes. I too would wear both of those outfits.
I also love switching between alt and femme its really great 🥰 you look excellent in both of course
Does the shirt have just straight cuts on the sleeves ? And how did you find/get that... thigh belt ?
This post confuses me. It says couples outfits but to me this looks like the same person wearing very different clothes. And how do you feel “very gender“?
These are both very gender and frankly I am jealous. Absolutely stunning, pinnacle of gender, simply freaking AMAZING
My high school self wishes they could dress like you on the right. Oh my god.

My high school self wishes they dated  someone who dresses like you on the left. 

👍 Props for excellent attire and presentation.
Both are 💯💯💯
[deleted]
My my, aren't you looking rather gender today?  The genderest, even
both outfits look like they’re from [this meme](https://www.reddit.com/r/GatekeepingYuri/comments/ugn13m/fashion_company_gfs/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf)
Stop stealing all the gender!!
The right one is extremely, amazing but like, more
So, goals I guess
I like the left one too, I'm just kinda fascinated
Gember!!
Omg yesss
Omg yesss
I envy your hairstyle in the second pic
Ahhh I love it! They look awesome on u
I've never seen two outfits that encapsulates my favorite aesthetics so damn well; either all pink kawaii or all black goth. You look amazing!
Goals tbh. Love your looks so much! 😍
These are the characters I’d play as in a King of Fighters game.
*gender envy intensifies*
you look like ""he was a punk, she did ballet"" meme in the best way possible
I'm also getting gender envy from you.... can I have some gender pls? 🥺👉👈
I love them both
Very cool style 💜
The gender envy is strong with this one
ur so stunning!
That one on the right... LOVE
Absolutely immaculate
Those outfits are very gender, I wish I had enough money to put together some outfits like that ☹️
I’m going to steal your gender

That was very gender of you
YO GIMMIE SOME OF YOUR FASHION TASTE 😩
I like the outfits
Pack it up bubblegum and Marceline 🙄 /pos
I love this!! I wish I had style like this I only ever wear sweatpants and t shirts lmao. Can’t get over how good it looks!
I love the second look. The pants look cool!
Two sides of the same coin
so much gender envy 😩 you look so amazing in both of the outfits, i love the right one is especially ❤️
gender am i rite
edit:spell
Woahh you're so gender
>:(( NOT FAIRR WHY CANT I PULL THIS OFF
Both outfits are amazing, wow...
This pic looks like those couple trophies with the pink soft one and the edgy dark one, idk how you can be both, teach me your ways lol
How do I become you?
Hell yes!! To both!!!
Oh my goodness I feel this. Some days I want to wear all black. Other days colors! Colors everywhere! But my colors tend to be mixed. 😅🤣
I wish I could pull those outfits off (THIS SOUNDS SEXUAL BUT I ACTUALLY JUST WISH I COULD DRESS LIKE EITHER IF THOSE)
That is amazing. You rock both 💖🖤
This pleases my genderfluid soul
You are so stylish!  I love both of these outfits!  You win all the gender.
How do samurais kill non binary people



They slash them
Thanks for giving me my new go to finger heart bestie 🖤💖
“Mom says it’s my turn with the gender!”
Oh god that’s incredibly flattering, thank you!!
Thanks so much!
Thank you!! I’m more proud of the styling of the pink outfit, but the black one definitely feels more “me”, so it’s hard to choose haha!
Thank you so much!!
Thank you!! The cargos are from Jack & Jones, they’re great!
Way too much time and money spent on my wardrobe over the years haha
Ahhh thank you very much!!
The pink one is a wig!!
Thanks! I use the app PicsArt to edit my photos, it has a light pink heart sticker
Indeed haha, shapeshifting with fashion is one of my favourite hobbies!
General pointers: make lots of Pinterest boards/photo albums with style inspiration and analyze what you like about the outfits, shop at thrift and vintage stores (go often cause they always have new stuff!), invest in a few nice statement pieces (like the Demonia boots on the right or the suede jacket on the left) that’ll go with lots of different things and will elevate any outfit! If you have any specific questions about anything feel free to ask!
I’m not but that’s very flattering!! Thank you!
The boots are from the brand Demonia, the style is Damned-225 I believe!
Thank you!! I’m in the process of growing it out into a longer mullet sort of thing but I really like the current length too
It’s so fun to wear multiple styles!!
Yep the shirt is just a plain black tshirt that I made a bunch of parallel cuts in on the sleeves, and the thigh belt is from an old regular belt (similar to the one I’m wearing on the right) that I cut up because it broke!
You’re right, both pictures are me! I meant to say “a couple of outfits”, meaning two outfits haha! And “very gender” was just a silly way of me saying both of these outfits made me feel gender euphoria in different ways 😊
Thank you so much!!
Honestly, I’m still in the long process of figuring out my identity, so I’m not sure I can entirely answer that, sorry! Every person’s relationship with gender is different, at the end of the day I say just wear what you want to wear and ask people to call you what feels comfortable to you (if you can do that safely of course)  :)
the gender at home: :c
No one has ever given me a turn with the gender and I’m destined to be masc forever😔
""But you had a turn all day I should get to play too!""
Do what I do, combine them. I have a few black and pink alt/goth outfits.

Also I really like those pants in the black outfit! (I want those pants)
Alright, I think I can do that eventually
Np. I hope you never stop gendering.
It looks really natural! Great job styling it!
Thank you 😊
I always see really good stuff at thrift stores but they're always too small for me :( Any good websites?
I’m sure that’ll look really good too! Your style is amazing. I aspire to look as good as you!!
Thanks.
chortling loudly, ty
Fantastic idea, I totally want to do a black and pink outfit now!! And the pants are from Jack & Jones, they’re amazing and I own them in three colours
What's chortling? Ik I could obviously Google it, but I like hearing it from actual people
I got inspired to do it when I bought a pair of pink boots that have black chains, spikes, and pentagrams on them. I realized I had nothing that went with them but solid black clothing. So naturally I had to buy a bunch of black and pink clothes haha.
One word: cryogoth!
snorting and laughing at the same time basically.

if you dont know what snorting is, its the sound pigs make.

and if you dont know what a pig is, ok you prolly know what a pig is lol

First off, that chimera/griffon looking tattoo is 🔥. Secondly, dusty hoes need to stay out yo business; they know this, we know this, but they’re boring, so they try their best to get the attention of people who look interesting.

You’re so cute!!

You are valid.

Either way you're gorgeous. Keep smiling like the sexy heartbreaker you are!

Fuck them haters, they mean nothing to you. Own that shit and don’t let them get the satisfaction of their comment getting to you! 💛💛

You know what you have? Some damn fine tattoos 😁
You look stunning!
cute? you mean... hot?
Fuck transphobes. Btw you look like Ripley <3
Guys who look better than most guys will always have haters because most guys would want to be as good looking (half of them would if they just did more than shower lol)
I'm currently on a weight loss journey and you are just... Goals!
You look adorable!! Where'd you get the crop top?
Somehow looks like Nathaniel Drew. Lol.

A comic about my own Gender Dysphoria (TW). Hope it resonates with someone ❤️		"Very well made. Do you want to talk about your dysphoria? I am here to listen :)
This means more to me than u can know! Thank you for sharing 🥰
*angry dysphoria noises*
I can relate with this too hard. Going through a lot with my amab body right now
Your comics are so sweet, and for what it’s worth, I don’t think anyone sees you as critically as you see yourself. At least not here :) keep being you 💛
:<

Thank you for posting this, but also damn this made me sad.
Wow this made me cry.  Thanks for sharing it hits home.
Saw myself in this, thank you for sharing
Lowkey made me tear up
This resonates… way to much with me.
What a beautiful way to express yourself, there’s loads of mtf people out there who feel exactly like that, (myself being one of them). Well done! 😘
I feel like the odd person out with comics like these. I don't have dysphoria so much as I just don't feel attached to myself. Just an odd ""yeah that's me"" and a weird hatred that things I enjoy aren't made for me or in a me size.
This is very relatable. My body hair basically starts to come back the day after I shave it, face usually waits a full 24hours at least. It makes me so sad and dysphoric :(
I feel this so much 💖
Ahhh, yeah, I can relate. I hate shaving so, so much more than I hate my facial and body hair - but now I’m facing my dysphoria instead of hiding it I just can’t let it grow. A good hot shower is my favourite way to distract from the pain, I hope HRT starts reducing how much I need to shave. That, or I’ll just have to save up for a *lot* of electrolysis. 

It’s weird though, none of my recent partners did much about their body hair. I don’t know why my own bothers me so much when I didn’t care about theirs at all.
I feel you, except afab. I wish I could just transform sometimes, don’t you?
This resonates a little well rn
Damn this is beautiful in a sad way
I can relate to this.
This does resonate with me, I was born at 25 weeks gestation in 1982, always liked saunas,  steam rooms as well as hot showers for my lungs, now I look back and it was also to try and open things up, to get rid of the imbalance which was testosterone in my system that caused issues with my body (night sweats, hot flashes, apnea and depression) from age 6/7 or so, 

Since starting hrt I don't need the shower that hot and all the menopausal symptoms have gone as well as my past 22 year want for booze pot and tobacco have disappeared too
This really resonates with me, it’s so awesome that you shared this because it really helps me (and hopefully others) feel much less alone. hugs 💜
Totally relatable. As a former male, I'm so sick of feeling and looking masculine.
This is honestly super beautiful. I’ve been heavily struggling to listen and hear myself on where I stand with my gender identity and reading this resonated so well for me that I know the steps I’m taking are the right ones
Can u be non-binary if u don't have gender dysphoria. I'm not sure. Help
I feel this.
This is really beautiful but also I like the implication that trans women have a dangerous feminine energy constantly trying to emerge from the human shell. You goddesses scare me sometimes. 

have some affirmation: she, her, girl, woman, women, girlypop, feminine, sis
Epilate! 
And yeah, thousands of dollars and years later & still need to shave facial hair daily.
To have ask the questions: it's pretty common for Dysphoric people, whatever their AGAB or their gender to have this habit,

If the person also do self harm it's not always a good idea though as the line between too hot and a real burn is close .

(Talking from experience)
I love this and I completely relate its insane
That’s how I feel so much
Seeing this coming out of the shower myself hits too hard
F-Word. This is resonating with me.
Fuck…this hurts because it’s so true
Fuuuuuuuuuuck me this hits way too close
Relatable but I have it the opposite way around.
Are you in my brain? This is so me.
God this is how I feel every day.
I felt that..
That hit me hard. Thanks for this 💛
OMFG this hits me so deeply 😭😭😭❤️❤️❤️
Thank you for this. It's exactly what I needed as a reminder I'm not alone in this.
Relatable as fuck.
I used to love baths because of the warmth and quiet. Now that I stopped ignoring my feelings my dysphoria is raging and is the worst in showers, I feel like my comfort was stolen from me by it. :(
I relate to this a lot despite being transmasc, your not alone, hopefully we will both be happy one day :)
Yep me too this resonates alot 💜
I feel this but I'm also confused about my body like I'm AFAB but feel more masculine like my face looks more masculine my voice in my opinion is masculine. There's times I feel masculine af then other days i feel feminine and it's just all confusing
Fuck I love this. I have to shave my face everyday and still have stubble :(
This is beautiful but also so deeply relatable. I'm AFAB and some days the dysphoria is so bad I see myself and want to puke. Just a deep feeling of... wrongness.
Beautiful comic and beautiful message. Thank you
Hey that's me. That's litterally me...
Thank you for this comic now I can use it to explain to my psychologist how I feel
i feel this but for my femininity (so basically the opposite)
I was 5 or 6 when I my thought of not wanting body hair popped in my head. Being AMAB, I have accepted defeat.
That's sad but... poetic. I feel you though, hang in there sis.
If I (amab) could choose, I would have no breasts, but feminine curves and no body hair. This is pretty much impossible, (expect maybe some laser hair removal stuff) but I guess I’ll just stick to regular shaving
Wow, what a beautiful comic. I half relate, half don’t. Instead of shaving my chest I’m holding it flat or covering it or trying to make it look masculine somehow. I’ve always showered with my arms across my chest for as long as I can remember.
I feel you. Just want to be free from the chains of gender
damn kinda reminds me of myself
fuck i relate so much, but its the other way around   
kinda makes me teary
I can connect with that, my parents question on why I want to shave my body hair and facial hair because a man must be that way. Lucky I convince them but I really want my body hair to go away. I also trying skin cream   and find it very pleasant for me. Hopefully when I out of my parents house I can finally do these things freely.
I can relate to this, even though I'm  afab trans and GQ. Testosterone caused great things but also gave me way more body hair that I'm self conscious about and is hell to shave/wax. I try to remind myself that our ancestors all used to be hairy af, even the females.
I have a lot of scars in my legs, in my neck and my face, thanks all the gods in don't have chest hair because they would be awful. I want to start HRT as soon as possible to thin my body hair.
Thank you for making and sharing this. I've been working with trying to make heads and tails of my dysphoria, and I've really strived with how to explain it, and it's just refreshing to see those feels in print.
Razor bumps are the worst :( Something that might help is waxing. You can get home kits pretty cheap and if that worries you, there’s the natural alternative called sugaring. It’s also an exfoliant. Wishing you the best and sending you love ♥️
This was an immediate save as it describes exactly how I feel. Thank you so much as I wasn't able to put this into words before
Thanks for sharing this. Yesterday today I've been feeling this SUPER hard.
Noo don't burn yourself you'll get infected
Omg- that hit different bro…
Nair works great for razor bumps
I found Nair works well to remove hair without leaving razor bumps, You just put it on like a lotion let it sit and then scrub with a loofa in the shower
Ouch ouch oof :(
Know the feeling. Love to have bigger Breasts
This is beautiful. TBH I've never done this with dysphoria, but I have done *literally the same thing* with the parts of my body that were giving me chronic pain (now thankfully resolved).
Maybe not fully resonating, but this definitely finds something close to a harmonic frequency some of the time.
Cis guy here, I can actually kind of relate to this in regards to hair and curves in places. Like, I go through the motions of exercising and shaving but I know that I can't change those things about myself which bothers me at times.
Thank you! I actually made this comic a few months ago and I’m feeling a lot better about my body now 😊 thought I’d share in case anyone else can relate to it!
So glad it connected with you ❤️😊
Thank you ❤️❤️
I’m so sorry! Don’t be sad :0 If it helps I’m feeling much more gender euphoric and happy with my body now! I hope you’re in a good place too!
That means a lot! Thanks so much ❤️❤️❤️
Would you look at that, all of the words in your comment are in alphabetical order.

I have checked 1,011,745,721 comments, and only 200,827 of them were in alphabetical order.
Thank you SO much! I’m very glad it resonates with you 😊
I’m glad you don’t have to deal with dysphoria so much! I have several non-binary friends who don’t deal with dysphoria, and it’s totally valid too! Just sharing my own personal experience!
Same, usually I'm just living in a state of Depersonalisation, just very rarely do I have like, active discomfort
Black hair on white skin! It feels smooth but I can still see it all!
Thanks for sharing your experience! 
Body hair’s a pain. And also same! I don’t care about body hair on a partner... kinda funny. may we someday have the same grace for our own bodies as we do for others’ ❤️
There's so many tips and tricks for shaving that should make it a lot less painful. I have really sensitive skin and now even I don't get any pain from it. I can share some info if you want?
If only!
I’m so glad it made you feel seen ❤️ this comic has served it’s purpose 😊
This means a lot to read!! I’m so glad this comic made a difference in affirming your own personal journey 🥰
Absolutely!! I have a few non-binary friends who don’t experience gender dysphoria, and it’s a wonderful thing if you don’t have that. It’s so valid to be comfortable in your skin and body, and still exist outside the gender binary!
Yes, I would never condone self harm!! It was more metaphorical than literal.
I’m so glad ❤️
I’m so sorry you’re going through that. I hope you can feel reconnected with your body and enjoy those experiences again someday ❤️
I made this comic a few months ago and I’m a lot happier with my body now! :)
I’m so sorry you have to deal with that :( I hope you can find ways to become more comfortable with your body!
❤️ Thanks for the kind words!
I’m so glad! 😊
Thank you for sharing ❤️ gender dysphoria sucks in whatever form it takes...
❤️❤️❤️ You’re so welcome!!
Thank you! I’ll definitely look into those options! Tbh I have pretty sensitive skin which is why I’ve been hesitant to try them out, but I think it’ll be worth it to at least try!
❤️ Glad it captured your experience!!
Glad it connected with you 💜
Totally, I would never actually burn myself for real.! Just want to make it clear that this was more metaphorical!
I am glad to hear you are feeling better! I can somewhat relate but I kinda have the opposite problem. Can't wait for top surgery...
so glad you're feeling better.
As a I! Trust me this was something I needed to read growing up. Sorry for earlier reply, I was commenting on something else I saw. All seriousness though, it definitely brightened my day that u were able illustrate this perfectly!
Thank you. I too have been feeling more comfortable with my body over time. I honestly consider my body rather perfect. But the body hair is hell. I'll definitely try to find a way to get rid of it as long as possible. Hopefully indefinitely.
It certainly does! 😘
I get ya. I guess I can be counted as lucky. 

Won't deny as someone who shaves...10/10 would love a permanent option that could be easily done though!
I have been reading a lot about absurdist philosophy lately, it’s definitely helped me come to terms with glaring contradictions like that! But you’re right, the journey is about coming to love ourselves, and I hope that happens for you sooner than you dare hope ❤️
That would be lovely, thank you!
The dream 😔
I don't even know what I am yet. Why is it so confusing.
I understand, it was just to invite some of us with this habit to caution on some case.

Tw : harm.

>!it's just that, recently, I have slipped from taking a very hot shower to needing a trip to my general practitioner because a bad burn on the back.!<

>!When a tidal wave of dysphoria hit, I have in the recent past cross this line , so I just want to warn other people to be prudent about something they may inflict to themselves when their mental health is in a particularly low state!<
I'm hope so too, I really miss them and I'm so done hating myself. We'll get there one day <3 thank you
That's good :D
Oh for sure
You could always do a patch test! Just on a small part of your skin and then follow up with aloe! Let me know if you end up trying it out!
Yeah. I've actually wanted to send it to people to help them understand how I feel
Ah true lol I'm not a very metaphorical person lol
Thank you for sharing ❤️ that’s gotta be hard. I hope that comes soon and that it gives you all the gender euphoria!! I know there’s a lot of transfemme enby representation in this sub and not enough transmasc representation. You are seen!! ❤️
Same. Just got my date... July 2023. A long way off but it will be here before I know it!
Thank you so much ❤️❤️❤️
Is laser removal not easily done? Too expensive?
I wrote a heaps in depth response and then accidently deleted it! So tldr version with my preferences in brckets:

- exfoliate skin (Italy towel -once a week) helps prevent ingrown hairs
- type of shaver used (safety razor, 1 sharp blade = less irritation)
- technique: keep wrist straight, optimal angle of blade on skin, short downward strokes = effective shave and less need to go over area again = less irritation
- dry blade after use or in rubbing alcohol = stops rust and bacteria = less irritation
- After care: don't towel dry, air dry, if possible, which let's skin absorb water, then apply moisturizer. Also witchhazel can help. 

This is my way, and I've found it works for me anyway, I actually kind of like shaving now since it doesn't hurt and afterwards I have less dysphoria.
It’s okay ❤️ it takes time to figure things out. Labels are unimportant, get to know yourself and and explore how you want to dress/present 😊 it’s okay to try things out—clothes, pronouns, hair and makeup looks etc if that’s your thing. I’m rooting for you!
I’m so sorry, I had no idea. I will try to be more sensitive in my future comics! I have never done self harm, and strongly encourage others to not hurt themselves either! I am in therapy and think therapy is a great idea for anyone who experiences gender dysphoria.
I thought the representation was pretty 50/50, no? Thank you for the kind words! I just have to wait 4 months! Which is pretty doable. Especially because it is getting colder so I can wear more layers.
Yay! So happy for you. I'm underage and my parents are not quite the type to sign off on me getting top surgery so I'ma have to wait a couple of years :/ Excited for when I do get to though. Hope it goes awesome for you! :)
My pleasure 🥰🥰🥰
Depending on how much body hair you have and where you live, it can be quite expensive.

If I wanted to get rid of my complete unwanted body hair, I would have to pay ~5000€.
Expensive and awkward to do for a body job. Few years back I looked into it. 2-4 sessions with a healing period between  them to get my torso, pits, back, legs done. 

I don't have the urge to look it up again. Got one of those Philips one blades. Kicks ass for shaving large areas fast
Thank you so much! I shall try this ASAP! 😊
Thank you 😊
No need to be more sensitive, you can't take care of everyone, and have every corner covered.
You will always have people more fragile than anticipated.

And for what it worth, your work really resonate with me, and until recently, I will haved not have warn anyone about it .

The hot shower is really a good thing that really help numb the dysphoria usually....

It's not a matter of encouraging or discouraging in my case, it just ""happen"", and I just need to be aware about it.

Than for therapy, it's one of my problem: I'm on the free healthcare system of my country, and it doesn't go well (I detect Freudian BS coming from my psychologist....), So I have literally no help on the mental health side atm...(this not help).
Aw okay. I don’t spend a lot of time on this sub and saw a meme from an afab enby saying they felt unrepresented. Anyways! Glad you have that milestone to look forward to!! Very exciting :)
Oh shit I didn't take the body hair into account. That really adds up.
Oneblades are great, but personally that's not enough. I didn't think about body hair, but facial hair is a pain for me. I use a razor, even smoother than a oneblade, and it's still visible. It also grows back within a day. 

Other options like epilating and waxing require it to grow longer than I'm willing to walk around with, so I'm holding my hopes up for laser once I saved up enough.
Good luck!
Yup. I'd wanna get rid of everything below my head, and I've got relatively much hair growth literally everywhere. It really does add up quickly.
Yeah facial hair is such a lose lose if your trying to go without.

For me, I don't hate my face unless I am doing makeup. But my body hair is politely put....fucking thick ass public hair like strands on 90% of my front and 30% of my lower back"	x2i0lw	NonBinary	3468	1.0	2022-08-31 16:31:04

Wow that’s really cool! Great idea :) you look lovely
This is some RP(Ph)DR shit
the glass of (oj?) is the best part 😂❤️
Is that every single page of your thesis? How many pages was your thesis?
*This* is what you do with a thesis.
I absolutely love this🙌🏻
OOOO ABSOLUTE ROYALTY! That dress is so cool and you look amazing in it!
Best reason to get a PhD.
I defend my thesis in 2 days and I'm a dressmaker, so to me, this is THE ULTIMATE AESTHETIC. Also, congratulations!
Wow, what an amazing way to celebrate your accomplishment! I'm astounded by the fact that you were able to put that together and make it work so well in less than a day. It really shows how dedicated & talented you are, and that tiara up top lends an extra majestic aura to your highly educated radiance. Congrats and I hope you end up having a very successful career, enby fam. 🥳
Ms? No.
Mr? Hell no.
Dr? Yes please.
this is so amazing 🤩
This made me so happy! Very belated congratulations :-)
I’ll try my best if anyone  in fashion is hiring 😅
I know you can get shirts and skirts that function as coding cheat sheets. Unfortunately, it appears that most of the skirts are not spinny.
Thanks! It took me a while 😅
Engineers and art majors rejoice, humanities majors who feel passionate about preserving books start crying
You have to present your thesis while wearing your thesis.
Instead of the viva 😛
Will do this when I get my PhD!

You are giving me ideas...

'Legal Pluralism in Early Modern England'—I look at how people resolved disputes amongst themselves, how those processes reflected the legal system, and how people avoided using the courts and government backed legal system. And the implications of all this for law, state, society, etc
Good luck! :D
Great news! Its a really enjoyable process, but don't worry if you find it tough at times—everyone does and nobody tells you that at the start 😅
3.5 years to write the thing, about a day to stick to myself using cellotape and staples 😅
YES! I just watched that episode the other day and was thinking the same thing
I'm a historian! The thesis is on how people avoided using the law in early modern (1500–1750, ish) England and what this means for our theories of the state and the law in the period.
I don't know who that is 🤣
Thanks 😊😛
It's a mimosa 😅
It's not all of it, and it was 448 pages double spaced including the bibliography.
Skirt no spinny?! Dang, that's no fun. There are admittedly some skirts that I like that barely spin, but the spinny is so central to skirt design, so any skirt that lacks the spin doesn't really feel like a skirt at all, as far as I'm concerned.
I bet! Still really cool
4 years,  right? 😄
You are welcome. What is your PHD for?
Okay that actually sounds pretty interesting dr. xbarsigma
That is a serious amount of dedication and potential injuries!!
Awesome! When you say law you mean written law? I studied history for a bit!
She was the teacher on an old American-canadian kids educational show called Magic School Bus. She was known for always wearing these really cool dresses that were themed to the lesson of that day. 
(More on the show: https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Magic_School_Bus_(TV_series) 
Some of the iconic dresses:

EVEN BETTER!
That's a lot of dedication, my final project paper was bad enough for BS in Computer Engineering. That was enough for me, schools not my thing. Although I did enjoy many of my classes as most had a lab component. Did well in lab, not so much in theory/test based classes.

Congrats on your dedication to such a monumental accomplishment.
3.5 😛
History. I look at how people avoided the legal system and resolved disputes themselves in early modern (c.1500–c.1750) England and what this means for our understanding of the legal system and the state in the period :)
Yeah like the courts and any of the official
legal system. So I’m particularly looking at how people resolved  disputes between themselves when they could have  prosecuted  the case
Oh awesome! I’ll have a look. I’m British so probs why I’m out of the loop
Sounds complex.
Oh I studied that in 16th century France (how people resolved disputes)!
Most of the records I use are people from London calling each other names and accusing people of sleeping with their husbands 😅
Oh cool! I use a lot of Natalie Zemon Davies and John Arnold’s work to inform my methods/ways of reading sources 😛

"Biden adds ""X"" as a gender marker on passports to signify non-binary"		"I wish we would just remove the gender marker all together. I don't need strangers with authority knowing my gender
Meanwhile in TERF Island they're refusing to even process my passport.
i wish they’d make it easier to just change it, period.  i don’t like having to jump through forty fucking legal hoops to change a single letter on a document
They're also getting rid of the gender-based TSA screening system that falsely flags a lot of trans people because of... private areas
How are ya’ll weighing the pros and cons of getting the ‘x’ marker on a document that will be seen internationally? I want it in order to accurately represent myself but what happens when traveling to countries that don’t recognize the ‘x’? Is it safer to stick with F or M even if I’m not either, or is the answer to not travel to countries that are more likely to give us a hard time about it (seems like most countries…)?
Be careful out there friends. It can be unsafe to travel with a different gender marker. My state offers an X marker on licenses, but if I get pulled over in a neighboring conservative state, it could impact how I’m treated by police. Same goes for international travel.
wow that's amazing, now maybe he should address the wave of fascist transphobic laws in like literally half the country. ""*i'Ve GoT yOuR bAcK""* but only when it's the most basic fucking shit

I’m truly terrified to change my gender on anything. What happens if there’s an actually successful coup? I don’t want there being a paper trail for them to use against me.  It’s always the same story with these authoritarian assholes, they use old olive branches just so they can pull you within stabbing distance.
This is neat but, wouldn't federal protection of the medical rights of trans ppl, particularly kids be more meaningful?
*glares at Boris*
DUDE IM SO EXCITED I CAN-- I CAN HAVE MY ACTUAL GENDER ON MY PASSPORT WOOOOO IM LIKE ALMOST CRYING
This wasn't Biden, this was the courts (prior to Biden taking office). This was already supposed to be implemented and they've been slow rolling the shit out of it.
There's no way I'm taking advantage of that until the rest of the world also gets on board. For one thing- airport security requires your gender on your plane ticket to match your gender on your passport, so if the airline doesn't have a non-binary option you can't fly with them. For another- there are a whole lot of countries that I want to go to that wouldn't react well to a non-binary passport. Better to keep faking the binary where the government is concerned imo.
I thought this was already a thing? Or am I thinking of other countries. Either way this is awesome
So is this going into effect immediately? I'm looking at getting a new passport in about 6 months and I was hoping to get an X if it was available. 

The state I'm moving to already has the X for drivers licenses, but I'm hesitant to get it cuz I don't know how that would effect my passport & social security gender markers if they don't do the X yet.

Does anyone know if you have an X on a state ID if you can pick M or F on your federal documents, or if they make you keep your birth marker?
And if you could ACTUALLY do something to protect us from all these anti-trans laws, too, that’d be great…
Omg this made me cry
I don't want to go through the hassle of updating my passport again 😓
That's great, maybe he could address some of the transphobic bills being passed in many states at some point?
I thought they did this months ago. Also why do we need gender markers at all?
Cool now how about fixing a broken healthcare system you stupid old fuck!

Edit: For the inconsiderate idiot questioning my intelligence or anyone elsewho thinks like them.  

My primary goal in life is raising money to provide gender affirming healthcare to trans people. Currently getting the government out of decision making in healthcare and allowing trans kids to live their lives without being taken away because they are getting lifesaving healthcare is a lot more important to me than an ""x"" on a passport.

Yes this should happen. No it should not be a news story. This should be a footnote.
Hes still bombing the middle east for oil, while many of the southern states continue passing more aggressive anti-trans bills that criminalizes trans youth and anyone that helps them. like, biden is not a figure of social progress
Nice! Now I wish I waited 2 years to renew my passport, having just discovered being agender last year (and considering the COVID-induced delays having sent my papers in 2020).
For anyone that wants more information I found the official FAQ and it seems to be fully updated with the new policies: https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/passports/need-passport/selecting-your-gender-marker.html
Ayyyyyyyyyyyyyyy

Les go!
I want to be excited about this but New York State promised us nonbinary markers by late last year and still nothing. They keep saying that the systems need to be updated, which seems like bullshit to me. I'll be very interested to see how fast they implement this. Staying hopeful.
At least he recognized how X-treme we are.
The future is looking blind to gender roles, stereotypes, and expectations. Noice.
*Sheaths NB Katana*
I hope they allow drivers licenses ans ID cards to do the same eventually
I just recently got my first state I.D., I was ecstatic that I could choose to put X on it instead of just m or f
And I just got a passport, too! If only I'd waited a few weeks.
Now i just wish that the uk will follow suit😔
Wow! That’s amazing news.
The thing is, it says sex on the passport... And I'm not intersex so it doesn't feel right to me to put X. I don't dis anyone else who wants to but I don't get it personally
I may hate Biden but sometimes he does good things
Holy hell yes I didn't think these things would happen as soon as they did
Poggers, might just get a passport rather than changing my ID and use that as my primary identification.
i JUST got my passport last month 😭dammit
seems like a fantastic way to get harassed by border officials
That’s great I hope he removes my student loans next
you wont be able to transition in florida without cps being called on your parents but at least you can add x on your passport if you EVER travel !!
Finally, my paperwork will all be the same
If only they could do this for Serbia lmfao
It’s nice to have a potus who cares
Baby steps I suppose. For me, while it adds risk, it reduces disphoria a lot and that's pretty important as well.
I wish state endorsement wasn’t heralded as a win. But cool, go awfffff about outing yourself to TSA.
This is a terrible idea. I don't want to give cops and tsa agents more reasons to target me. There's no reason to have gender on those documents anyway!
can we just have rights first? like i would love community recognition and access to medical care first. excellent virtue signaling, “here’s something that, in practice, makes absolutely no difference in the QoL for trans people. but hey, now you can out yourself with an X on your passport!”

because obviously gender is a trinary now and the genders are male, female, and X /s
This is so dangerous - trans liberation activists have said for years that removing the gender marker is the better move and instead they just do the lib thing and add the X. So annoying.
Word of warning, but I would hold off on getting a passport with that. Feel like it may restrict travel. Just something to consider.
A great first step!

It is a first step, right?
Makes it easier to round us all up later
There’s something to be said about there shouldn’t be any gender markers at all bc it’s not necessary, and that having an X can be dangerous for those who seek us out to do us harm, but also I’ll be damned before I have a fucking F on my ID again. I know I’m privileged to live in CA so it’s not as dangerous for me, but I just want my goddamn X marker.
All he’s done is acknowledge our existence once a year and this performative act, he doesn’t actually care. Where was he when Texas and florida were passing their wildly transphobic bills?
Need to move to the US apparently
Not gonna get that until every form in the government has one. The form you have to fill to buy a gun requires that your ID match what you write down, and they do not have a place to mark your other gender.
this is insulting. an x? really? with all the harmful lgbt laws we are supposed to celebrate an “x”?
I don't think this is at top issue during the current state of affairs. Why don't they focus their efforts around the war events and exacerbating economy?
YOOOOOOOO
I was hoping this would happen this year!!! I'm so happy <3
anyone know of current airlines offering the option for X on your gender? for future references
Would this become a problem if my license is still F?
Close, now add birth certificates and driver's licenses.
Yes now if they could overrride my state’s ridiculous authorization requirements for changing it on an ID and the ban on changing it on birth certificates that would be grand!
the same post was just above this one on r/ainbow. coincidence? i think not
Oh wow!
Amazing! I will have to renew my passport now!
Awesome! Now make states do it.
Waiting for this to happen in my country.
I have been waiting so long
It sure is a great thing that ""non binary "" is totally made up and people are falling for it.
Oh wow, that's good
That's what the Netherlands are doing!
This! It is dangerous to give strangers with authority this information!
Yes, so happy to provide information to fascists so they can use it against me.
And just as bad: requiring workers checking IDs to determine if your gender matches that letter on your ID based on .. what, how you look? How you’re dressed? You’re voice? That shouldn’t be part of anyone’s job, but technically it is when gender is considered necessary for identification purposes.
Unfortunately the language here is gendered so knowing your gender is necessary for communication
Baby steps, baby steps.
Totally agree!
I'm assuming you're UK-based, but I could so easily ask, ""Which one?"".
i didn’t disclose the fact that i was trans when i applied for mine.  even if a country “supports” it, it takes even longer because they have to correspond with all sorts of questions and it was much easier to just put down my legal information.
iirc Changing your gender on your passport is fairly easy. All you have to do is check what box you what and that’s it. 

This is from the Travel.gov website: 
>”You can select the gender marker you would like printed on your U.S. passport. The gender you select does not need to match the gender on your supporting documentation such as a birth certificate, previous passport, or state ID. We no longer require medical documentation to change the gender marker on your U.S. passport.”
I really hope they do, I just recently had to use them. Thankfully I was in the Portland OR airport (and just-so-happened to have an understanding TSA member). 

It’s disgusting how as someone wearing a single piece of silicone or binder (or having a part they don’t think you should have) should be the bases for patting someone down 3 TIMES! Plus long ended questions about stuff they don’t need to know about you!
That’s awesome! Where did you find that info?
Wait whaa? Is that why I'm always pulled aside?
Wtf… I’ve never been in an airport. Why would that even be necessary??? My goodness people are weird
This is what I'm considering rn too. I like the idea of the X cuz it fits more of my actual vibe, but I'm really hesitant to give bad actors an easy way to identify me on official documents.

My thinking is going for the binary marker you want to present as is probably safer, but might be just as much of an issue if you don't meet a state / country standard of being ""trans enough"" to be trans. 

Like if I decide to switch to an F but don't get any bottom surgery I might be better in some cases in a transphobic country, but it might also be just as bad if they don't see my trans-ness as valid.

So I guess is it better to be mostly passing as cis, or not at all is my thinking.
For me this was the only thing holding me back. But I am either read as transmasc or butch lesbian, so the x marker wouldn’t really be making much different for me in countries where being lgbtq is dangerous. And I plan on avoiding them as much as possible.
Maybe we can get two? Like an X and a binary symbol for counties that Don accept X as a marker, they can just use the binary one?

I'm so excited for this change but I do agree that it'll make customs tricky in other countries.
this is how i feel especially when i see the tiny “pride” displays that are in stores for exactly a month before being marked down 90% on July 1.  like yaaaay you can capitalize on our existence, now how about a pay raise
The House already passed the Equality Act which he endorsed but the Republicans filibustered it in the Senate
Isn't he trying to? I know he did something about the Texas thing but it took a while to do right.
There’s this thing called “federalism” and “separation of powers”. Unfortunately (or fortunately, when fascists are in office), the President can’t directly stop state laws. He already said he was gonna sign the Equality Act when the senate stops fucking around. “The most basic fucking shit” like ending the Trans military ban and making it as easy as possible for federal IDs to stop misgendering me are the only things Biden has the power to do.
Same! But at the same time I think I wouldn’t bother to make the change, I prefer to avoid the extra attention and most of the time I’m pretty indifferent about being seen as a woman by strangers. I just want the option to exist so other people could benefit from it.
Im sorry to tell you but the UK is known by many trans people as TERF island, I don’t know what was expected
Yes, that's what I was going to say, it's cute how the Biden admin is taking credit for the result of Dana Zzyym's lawsuit. Oh wait, not cute, irritating.

https://www.npr.org/2021/10/27/1049690803/state-department-first-passport-with-nonbinary-gender-x-option
I wasn't aware of airlines not allowing people with X passports to fly. Do you know if this also effects people using an X driver's license as their form of flying ID?

Also, I'm curious on what you think of a question I've been pondering. Do you think it's better to have a binary marker and be non-passing in a transphobic area or go have an X?
At least in the US, looks like TSA has changed as well 

Streamlining identity validation: In February 2022, TSA updated its checkpoint SOP to remove gender considerations when validating a traveler’s identification at airport security checkpoints. When travelers appear at the travel document checker podium for identity verification, gender information is irrelevant in determining that a traveler may proceed into the screening area.

https://www.tsa.gov/news/press/releases/2022/03/31/tsa-announces-measures-implement-gender-neutral-screening-its
it's a thing on drivers licenses and other forms of ID i believe
Replying only to remind myself to check and see if anyone has the answer later.

I just changed my birth certificate to use the X and I’m changing my license soon too because my state also accepts it. I honestly was just going to fight them over email and phone if there was a problem lol
[deleted]
The policy changes should take effect soon, but the TSA body scanner software update will be rolled out over the next 6 months.

[Source](https://www.tsa.gov/news/press/releases/2022/03/31/tsa-announces-measures-implement-gender-neutral-screening-its).
April 11 is when it goes into effect, and as far as I know gender markers mismatching on different forms isn’t really a problem.
What does that have to do with this post? We can still celebrate this.
Do you understand how democracy works?
You're correct, but we're still allowed to be happy about positive steps forward like this. Let people be happy.

Edit: People like this are why I don't participate in LGBTQ communities much anymore. Literally the worst. 

Two things can exist at once. Anti-trans laws in Florida and Utah can exist AND the passport gender marker updates can exist. You can still be happy about one thing just because another thing is bad. You learn this in therapy, please seek it.
Thank you
Same
Oh, it's very likely that it'll cause you to be denied entry to every *even vaguely homophobic* country in existence.
It *definitely* will restrict travel. You can't even buy a plane ticket with some airlines if you have an X marker, though that's currently changing due to discrimination suits.
It's a crumb.

Offered during a time when a Mississippi candidate openly started that trans people should be executed by firing squad.

It's not nothing, but it's hard not to feel insulted by the difference in scale.
I live in a state in the US that allowed me to put X on my license. I see an X as a ""no"" ""both"" or ""neither."" Personally, I'm happy with that. The best option would be to remove all the boxes, but we know damn well that's not going to happen.
What else would you purpose? Does it really need to be more specific if it's not really anyones business what my gender is anyway?

Edit:  Obviously, if you are a trans person who uses either f or m and you are forced to use x, I will have a problem with that. But I don't think that's the case.
Oh, no! The gov't did an extremely easy & quick thing which would benefit many people while having basically zero negative consequences! How dare they???
god forbid the president signs a paper in 30 that benefits any minority
We are?

Just last year I heard we got the X gender marker option, but I haven’t heard of ditching it entirely. Do you have a source for me to check out?
We are doing this shit right for once? Color me shocked

Now trans healthcare please? :(
I see what you mean but I still think the people who see your passport don't need to know. They aren't going to be talking about me very much if at all, imo it's better to risk some stranger misgendering me than a transphobic TSA agent making me go through extra security measures, misgendering me on PURPOSE, making a big deal over which gender has to pat me down, etc. Plus an X doesn't tell them what pronouns you use, they/them is probably the most common but a lot of nb ppl also use other pronouns so it's not like it's always helpful in that regard anyways.
And in hindsight I wish I'd just let them put Mr.

Still got to do the name change though.
We're still waiting for them to add another gender box to the ds-11 form. I just checked, it's supposed to happen this year.
Second this. I’m an American living in Japan, and changing my passport’s gender was as simple as going to the embassy, submitting a normal passport application, and paying the standard fee. 
It has made my life so much better here as I was then able to easily update my Japanese ID as well.

EDIT: this was January of this year, and was still for a binary gender (F->M), bc although I’d like to get non-binary ID, Japan doesn’t recognize anything outside of F or M.
that is news to me.  was that recently updated?  i didn’t see that when i applied

eta: i also wasn’t sure how applying as an out trans person would affect the rest of the process.  i had to have a health screening done before my WHV could be granted and i’d have had to let them know i was trans, too.  it was just easier to put my current legal info, it’s not like the Department of Home Affairs is gonna be sliding into my DMs or arguing with me on twitter or being an overly chatty cashier lol
Really?! Holy hell that's a dope revelation.
[Source](https://www.tsa.gov/news/press/releases/2022/03/31/tsa-announces-measures-implement-gender-neutral-screening-its).

Basically, they're going to start deploying a software update for the body scanners so that there's only one ""mode"", which can handle both presence and absence of dick (instead of the operator having to select ""alert if dick"" or ""alert if not dick"")
[This article](https://www.lgbtqnation.com/2022/03/biden-admin-adds-x-gender-marker-passports-tsa-will-change-scanner-machines-remove-gender/) :)
It was a “preventative screening measure” (probably instated after 9/11?) to try to stop potential terrorists and smugglers from bringing drugs or explosives/weapons on planes. Most of the flagged “anomalies” were just peoples breasts or penises where they werent expected to be and ended up w a lot of violating pat downs and sexual harassment/assault. I even saw a comment from a redditor the other week who said she was flagged as a child and patted down bc of an anomaly with her chest - it was just her breasts. She was 11. TSA scans suck.
Right? A friend of mine is FtM and was flagged by security for having ""extra fabric"" under their clothes which was suspicious. They were wearing men's boxers but apparently looked too femme for that to be believable
yeah lol
It sure would be nice if they had *any* principles to appeal to rather than just being a party of hatred and theft.
It's almost like they should have ended the filibuster or something

Man, it'd sure be disappointing if they'd had that opportunity and wasted it
Yeah I was already aware the UK is way behind the rest of the world in terms of trans rights 🥲
Yeah, I just wanted to clarify it wasn't (exclusively) Biden holding this change up. Likely, the previous administration was hoping it'd be overturned by a higher court. The original case was in 2017, with the ruling in 2018

https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dana_Zzyym
My comment was based on this incident:

https://www.google.com/amp/s/amp.usatoday.com/amp/9168185002

Sounds like TSA has since updated their guidelines to say that the gender on your ticket doesn't have to match the gender on your ID, so that's a good step. 

As for your other question, I imagine it would be safer to have the binary marker and just kind of attempt to pass. At least for myself- I can pass as my gender assigned at birth very easily, and I only really need to worry about it long enough to get past immigration. For me, that's a worthwhile sacrifice, but I can understand that it may not be possible or acceptable for other people.
This is good to know! I wonder if that changed because of this incident, which was how I was made aware of the issue:

https://www.google.com/amp/s/amp.usatoday.com/amp/9168185002
Kinda hate that he hasn't mandated X be permitted on all state docs and whatnot, because it seems a little fucked up when you know how it'll be used against people tbh
In case you missed my edit allow me to clarify.  
My primary goal in life is raising money to provide gender affirming healthcare to trans people. Currently getting the government out of decision making in healthcare and allowing trans kids to live their lives without being taken away because they are getting lifesaving healthcare is a lot more important to me than an ""x"" on a passport.  
Yes this should happen. No it should not be a news story. This should be a footnote.
I'm gonna guess that the vast majority of the US population supports improvements to the healthcare system & single payer if executed well
There are things that he campaigned on doing and i understand how much effort has gone into fixing the broken things and it is not enough.

I will not be content with breadcrumbs and I will not listen to some dumbass who tells me i should.

If you want to get into things, yes I too watched schoolhouse rock and i understand the process.

There is not enough noise from our president and his spineless party considering the cacophony coming from the Republicans that is trying to kill us or get us killed.

But you keep arguing semantics.

Go fuck yourself.
when the ""positive steps forward"" are accompanied by passing laws that literally criminalize and bar trans people from simply living, i dont see the point of celebration. democrats take 10 steps back, slap a pride sticker on their campaign and call it progress, and people keep falling for it.
Then I can be nb and debt free
Oh no, the head of a proto-fascist nation is being performatively progressive. How shocking.
How does that benefit anyone?
How does that benefit the trans community? They may be in serious trouble when abroad.
https://www.hrw.org/news/2020/07/08/netherlands-sees-no-role-gender-marker-id-documents
Weird, in Germany we got the D.
It's still gonna take a few years, it's scheduled for around 2024 or 2025 when the design of our ID cards are up for modification.
I worry about seeking visas in other countries. I have a job where I can work anywhere in the world, but I have no idea how other countries will handle x gender or if they will flat out deny any of us entry. I would rather not take the risk.
Oh you wish, they talk way too much. And also we don't have neutrality and the academy (who is legally responsible to the language) confirmed there will never be gender neutrality.
April 11th!
>as I was then able to easily update my Japanese ID as well.

It's the same process for me as a Brit in Germany. But sadly, even though Germany *does* recognize non-binary gender - as a non-citizen I can only change gender by changing my passport, and the UK does not. So, I could in theory have an 'X' German ID card but the UK is preventing me...
I was so worried about this when I went. I'm on T and have a fairly androgenous body shape + am tall. I decided to not bind and wear a not baggy shirt  to make sure I got flagged as my AGAB for the screening to avoid getting pat down. This is great news
This would be great. I got screened a few weeks ago because I was wearing two pairs of pants (it was still cold winter land) 🙄

And what about packers then?? Like, I don't fly with one bc it's too much of a hassle for me personally but I can only imagine how that would go over.
Let's be 100% honest. The lawmakers in question do hate transpeople, but they don't actually give a fuck about us. They don't think we should exist, but The TransesTM hold a utility value. Rally people around culture war issues and hating something they don't understand and they can't be distracted by things like ""receiving Russian government funding for years"" or ""wanting Biden to make the Ukraine sit objectively worse"" or ""supporting oil and gas companies and building shit infrastructure and cutting funding for kids' school lunches"" so on and so forth. If you're busy worried about the evil scary trans people that want to ruin your society, you don't have time or energy to care about the people ruining it.
a fair few amount of people i know run on Republican tickets because there’s no real party competition, and the Democrat choice is a shit show.  i knew one person who was a queer trans sex worker and ran as a Republican for city council - they almost got it, too, but the lukewarm lefties pushed them out.  it really depends on the individual, and judging from my personal anecdotes, everyday Republicans are getting kinda tired of their party’s shit
Yeah I mean Biden came out in favor of abolishing the filibuster but it required 51 votes to pass and Manchin and Sinema came out against it and the vote failed 52-48
Sorry I disagree. This is huge for me because it federally, legally recognizes nonbinary trans people after so much discrimination and disenfranchisement. This should definitely be news. I’m really happy it was done because I recently changed my birth certificate marker and don’t have to be judged purely by my sex assigned at birth. Other people feel the same way from what I’ve seen.

I don’t disagree with what you said about providing affirming healthcare and stopping this fascist republican bullshit, but that’s going to take a long time and more than just Biden stepping in.
That’s a fact. Doesn’t imply the president can just unilaterally decide how healthcare works.
Ok got it, you don’t understand how democracy works.
Lmao right, but noooo that’s too hard
It's depressing how many people in this thread don't seem to understand that.
Ah, you're just trolling the sub I see.
depends on the county, and most ppl aren’t gonna see their id or passport. It benefits them bc they are able to have a proper gender marker. And not transgender. The word you’re looking for here is Non binary. thank you.
America gets the D all the time
In Germany it stands for “Divers” right?
no offense but i do not care about or respect ""the academy"" lol. no one is in actually charge of language, it's going to change and evolve regardless of what they say. Honestly I'm surprised you do considering you use they/them? It would benefit you if we didn't respect them and just used neutral language anyways.

I also still think it's more important to protect trans/GNC people from potential harassment or violence than getting misgendered. Especially when traveling abroad to countries with less acceptance
People create the language, so even if somethig is now being considered officialy a mistake, can later evolve to be the norm. The language is somethig that always changes, so if we make a change, it might change.
Ugh that must be SO very frustrating :/ I hope the UK gets on top of their shit ASAP
I can't speak to the details of the software update. I think it's a safe bet to assume they half-assed it though, so I'm keeping my expectations low for how well it'll detect prostheses.
Why the fuck don't they kick those two out of the party?
To add, we should be encouraged to celebrate every small victory we can get right now.
I agree. It would be nice, though, if our politicians didn't keep unilaterally deciding to let the current shit system stand (because their donors wouldn't allow it)
Really? Do you think that a firm finger wagging was enough when abortion was outlawed in texas a few weeks ago? Or when they started trying to take trans kids from their parents? or any of the over 100 anti trans bills have been written and are going to lawmakers.  
I point out that the president is not being loud enough about issues effecting my community and costing us lives and your response is to question my intelligence?
Not me taking forever to realise ""divers"" wasn't meant as in ""someone who dives""😅😂
I use they/them online but not in real life since they is always plural here. And they have the legal right to no allow things like this.
Not if you ask them. The academy is legally responsible for these changes so don't get caught if you want to be different.
We all hated the last guy, but I can guarantee that if two members of his party were obstructing his agenda, he would be on Fox News nightly, publicly smearing them until they caved or lost their next election. Biden has just thrown his hands up with regards to these two as if he doesn’t hold the most powerful platform in the world and can’t do a goddamn thing about it.
Because then they would lose control of the Senate. It's tied 50-50
These are all very valid points. I apologize for coming across as dismissive and I agree we should be celebrating our victories but it is not enough and it is not quick enough.   

This feels like ""domestic unions"" sure they see we are here but that just means they see us suffering and dying and just don't actually care.    
    
Recognition is a double edged sword.    
     
When someone doesn't see the transgender community then I can dismiss inaction as ignorance. When someone clearly sees the transgender community and does nothing to help that is just evil. With all of the trans visibility we see more and more people exposed as evil.
All you’re doing is directing your anger at the wrong person, and that will have the opposite effect of what you’re trying to achieve. You’re working right into the hands of the people who are your actual enemies. That is, Republicans. Get mad at them, not at people who are on your side. Including me.
I realized someone who doesn’t know German might interpret my comment that way right after I sent it and was waiting for this lol
You have the right to have your pronouns respected. You don't have to repress parts of yourself just because of some made up rules created by people who don't care about trans people. Be the change you want to see. Things can change but if you just roll over and accept defeat before even trying then you're just setting yourself up for failure. I genuinely hope you can gain the confidence to use whatever pronouns you want regardless of what other people say
They/them has always been both singular and plural. It's in the dictionary. ""The academy"" can suck my dick.
Right. Biden has no spine, because as it turns out, neolibs don't have an agenda beyond preserving the status quo.
*They already don't control the Senate because of Manchin and Sinema*
No worries about your other comments. It does kinda feel performative when there’s so many laws stacked against us right now, but at least it’s one good thing finished. My heart goes out to all the vulnerable trans kids in republican states that had major anti T legislation right now (Idaho, Florida, Texas)
You are not on my side. you are in the way telling me to be quiet.
I could but since I wasn't talking about English the language is gendered
I think they're referring to the Hebrew academy, which has actually stated that they don't want to make the language gender neutral at all, but either way it's stupid, it's not like change can't still happen on a social level before it happens on an official level.
As awful as they are, the democrats being at least partially in the majority has led to hundreds of critical federal judicial appointments, losing control of the Senate would be devastating
Yeah whatever.
Non-binary hebrew speakers are already coming up with idea for gender neutral language, just google ""hebrew gender neutral"" or ""hebrew they/them"" and you'll find articles talking about it. Just because hebrew it gendered now doesn't mean it always has to be. The change starts with the people first, the official changes come later. A similar thing is happening with Spanish. Don't let the academy hold you back
Exactly.
Many people I know are extremely dedicated to their orders and I'm scared that I'll make them angry. The Hebrew language academy are known to be hostile for changes.
I know it's scary to challenge transphobic authorities, I don't expect you to single handedly reform the hebrew language or anything, just don't let the current bigoted system stop you from pushing towards a more accepting future. After all, eventually everyone who's currently a part of the academy will die/retire and new people will join, things aren't set in stone. When your generation ends up in charge maybe they'll be more open to change. Just don't give up is all I'm saying. You can start the changes now even if there's not an official change
Unfortunately language is just one barrier. If you are non binary you are not considered Trans here. So you can't get hormones, dysphoria diagnosis or surgeries. And a diagnosis from a different country isn't accepted
That's how it was every where at some point. It takes a lot of activism and hard work but society *can* change. There was also a time when any and all LGBT people were seen as mentally ill criminals who needed to be locked up to killed, and there are still places and people who think like that. Change is still possible even if it's hard."	tszkyk	NonBinary	3386	0.99	2022-03-31 13:19:04
In case anyone needs affirmation, here’s a comic reminding you that your interests aren’t gendered. Like what you like! ✨		"Exactly. If cis people’s gender isn’t defined by their interests, why should that be the case for trans people? 💛
This was so needed today. I stopped wearing makeup for a few months after I started using they/them pronouns so I could get “taken seriously”. As it turns out…I love wearing makeup with traditionally masc looks! True gender euphoria for me is a combination of both.
I needed this, and honestly at this point I don't consider myself ""trans-anything"" except maybe ""trans-myself,"" but the ""trans"" label still doesn't feel right as I'm not ""transitioning,"" rather just allowing myself to be myself.  A concept which I struggled with for several months before finally figuring it out and accepting it 🤷‍♂️🤷
Gender is an all-you-can-eat buffet.  Take the stuff you like, leave the stuff you don't.  Want to mix ice cream, mashed potatoes, and peas?  Cool.
I needed this, TY!
Gendering hobbies is such bullshit. I've been discredited my whole life in things I enjoy as an AFAB because they're traditionally 'masculine'. Whatever the hell that means.

It's a huge reason why I'm done with gendering anything and everyone unless they specifically ask for it. Why would I judge anyone's capabilities or interests by their gender?
This. So much. The gender is still in our heads even as we try to walk the other way. But really it's only a label attached by society
I really struggle with this - I'm a nonbinary trans man with a lot of 'feminine' interests and hobbies - and it's so daft. a cis dude wouldn't be less of a dude for liking soft toys, why am I beating myself up for it? thank you for this comic <3
We need to normalize this for people of every gender/sexual identity - whether they're trans, cis, nonbinary, gay, straight, etc...

Society will be a lot happier (and hopefully a lot less bigoted) once we stop asking ourselves ""oh, is it okay for me as \[insert gender/sexuality here\] to like this thing?""
Yup. I cycle through pretty much every stage in this comic on repeat. It can be frustrating but I try to remember it's just part of how I'm growing and learning about how I prefer to present.
Yeah... That's about where I am right now. Lil genderflux trans girl just having a meltdown every time I find myself being ""too masculine"". It's really eating at me. I think this is why even though I LOVE being a girl I also quite love the idea of being non binary. It feels liberating. Again though, this is flawed: just because I specifically feel very happy being exclusively she/her doesn't mean I have to limit myself and avoid supposedly ""manly things"". 

Anyway... I wish I could abandon my toxic thinking faster.
I'm still working on deconstructing this mindset. I find it really easy to get caught up in what is feminine and masculine, even when it doesn't pertain to gender in fears that people will question my ""transness"". It was a weird realisation moment for me that these things don't matter, when I started to receive compliments that I had associated as being directed at women such as pretty and beautiful (I'm transmasc), but were followed up with bro/man. It made me realise that people could still see me as a guy despite my ""femininity"" and in fact, it made no difference. Realising this made me far more confident in expressing the parts of myself that I had preciously deemed as ""feminine"".
This, 100%! I’m a trans man, and I’m so glad I’ve finally gained some confidence in who I am. It was really rough being young and self-conscious about my interests. I am a grown man and if I want crochet and grow flowers and teach my niece to style her hair, then I am going to fucking do it. 

No such thing as gendered interests.
Thank you! I've been recently able to explore what I used to see as feminine interests and likes and it's been so nice. I used to try to force out anything remotely feminine all my life. It's so nice to not feel guilty for enjoying nice things, I'm really trying to savour that feeling. Love your comics <3
An important part of it for me was realizing that the important part wasn’t that I still enjoyed dresses despite being agender—it was that those things didn’t make me _feel feminine._

I like makeup because I’m an artist, not because it makes me feel feminine.
I feel so grateful that the first trans person I knew was a trans woman with the world's most 'masculine' degree, job AND hobbies. It helped me understand early on that those things don't have anything to do with anything.
Exactly! I love sewing and cooking, and I had my favorite dolls when I was a child, but I also loved playing with my brother's and friends' building toys, and I am proud of my skill in fixing things in the house.
Yes, this. All of this.
I know I'm still working on that. I love makeup as just a form of art, I love painting on myself, it just so happens most of my practice is in really dramatic fem makeup . I know it's fine to be masc and like fem makeup but It still reminds me of all the years in the closet where that was my normal. I kinda have to think of it like drag or being a gay femboy (both of which is kinda true) but I hope some day it can just be self expression. I just need more time I think.
The panel with the alcoholic drinks makes a good point. Beer is often seen as masculine, and other fruity or sweet drinks are seen as feminine. But the real, objective, ungendered truth is that beer is ass and fruity/sweet drinks are the best.
Thank you. This really is a beautiful comic. That's been me with interests on and off. It's clothing choices at the moment.
As a transfem person I’ve recently taken up a couple of stereotypically masculine interests such as car maintenance. If you’re interested in something, don’t let how it’s gendered stop you
Love thiss! Amazing work.
I appreciate this 🏳️‍🌈❤️🔥
I'm some kinda masc gender but I totally did the same thing,
I tried hiding all my ""feminine"" likes and even the way I spoke or walked because I felt like no one would take me seriously other wise since ""that's not how boys / guys do stuff""

Made me feel worse but kept going till I hit a point that I didn't even feel like myself anymore or anything I'd like to transition to. 

Finally quit trying so hard and feel a lot better. 
I am myself, nothing more or less.
Exactly, I have came out as Non-binary after 2-3 years now And recognized that I can do whatever I want without worrying about my Gender because what I like or what I do is separated from my Gender identity
Your art style is super pretty..
Love this! Good job tackling a difficult subject in do few words! Comics are hard
Edit: so few*
I have a few Barbie dolls and I wear masculine clothes. I have masculine manga and anime interests (who said enbies can't like Dragon Ball?).
What a beautiful post. Thank you.
omg thank you for this, as someone who loves ""girly"" stuff like squishmallows, makeup, decorating my apartment, skincare, I always felt like I had to tone it down but this is adorable
this is something I'm still working on bc I went through something similar when I started questioning my identity, just from the opposite starting point as OP. it's good to see not only that I'm not alone in that struggle, but that there's a light at the end of the tunnel :)
I love historical working class dresses. I feel good and myself in them. It doesn't make me less NB for it. Hell given some the the odd shapes of the underpinnings it is very non-binary esc. (I'm a sucker for the shape stays give my body lol).
I find this interesting! Ever since coming out I have started to learn how to use tools and do typical “masculine” things like woodwork, maintenance, etc which when I identified as Cis seemed far from a task that interested me, probably due to me hiding from myself that I didn’t want to be a male
# #genderabolition
Damn this hits 😩💯
Damn this hits 😩💯
Damn this hits 😩💯
I see you.
This is so true, and idk if anyone else experienced something similar. I initially fought to be super masculine to ""suppress"" the feminine portions of myself, until just like the comic completely flipped to be affirmed as a woman. Although now, and I'm unsure if others here feel the same, now ""I am me"" pretty well defines who I am. Not male, not female, not any gender in particular, in fact. Just another person with trauma trying to move on in life and enjoy whatever I find enjoyable, dress however I choose to dress and see the forest for the trees so to speak. 
And idk if this will bring about condemnation in this thread, but I'm now beyond caring what gender I am (or anyone is, for that matter. It may be controversial, but I find it liberating. People are just people, not men and women, not trans men and trans women, not enbies and agender, just people. We seem so focused on learning all we can about the world around us and naming and categorising life as a whole. We forget that those ""categories"" are just figments of society. They may be someone's personal truth, but that's the great thing about personal truths they are yours to believe, and no one can change that. If you choose those ""truths"" are untrue, then simply choose different truths.
I struggle with this a lot. Mostly I don't care but I do have a problem with my parents in law and what they will think. Especially since I'm not out to them and never will and I'm AFAB. I'm afraid to like feminine things because everytime I come dressed in a skirt or a dress or put makeup on, they see me more as a woman and are happy (I usually dress very masculine) because it's the stupid society expectation. I don't blame them - they aren't exactly involved with ""politics"", they tend to keep their distance and I'm sure if they knew how I feel when they react to me being more *stereotypically* feminine, they would stop. They are good people. I came out to them as bisexual 2 years ago and they didn't say anything wrong. They took their time to accept this piece of info but their behaviour towards me didn't change one bit. I can't come out as nb or whatever I am (constantly questioning) so I can't exactly tell them not to be happy when I ""dress like a girl"". And I love skirts on occassion!
I have a shop with a car lift where I build jeeps and classic cars.  Not once, in any shop, have I seen someone effectively turn a wrench on a vehicle with their penis.

Love what you do and let the haters choke on their bigotry.
To be fair I think a fair amount of cis people only have interests because it is something stereotypically associated with their gender.
same, but the other way around.  i thought having to get up early enough to put on a full face would be my undoing, but really what i've learned is that i just love doing my eyes up, and the rest of my face really doesn't bother me so much anymore.  so i'll throw on some mascara and liner for most days, masc or femme, and if i'm feeling REALLY fancy then i'll break out the pallettes, lol.
Same! It feels good to be doing my makeup for myself now instead of feeling like I shouldn’t wear it because I’m enby or that I was wearing it because it is societally expected of AFAB people.
I want do start doing makeup that way. Do you have any tips? I haven't done any makeup in so long..
Is there a word for vicarious gender euphoria
Trans actually doesn't refer to transition at all. It is  Latin word root that before describing gender was used in chemestry to describe molicule configurations. Trans mean across / on the other side of and cis means on the same side as. For gender it only means that someone's gender is anything different than what was assigned to them at birth. No transition is needed at all for someone to be trans and unless they are fluid or something most trans people feel they have always been their gender from the day they were born but were just labeled wrong.

This is not however saying you should use a label you don't feel connected to. Just explaining the label in case that helps.
Same and it feels good reading someone that feels the same way 🥰
I feel this so much, like yes I'm technically transgender by definition (I don't agree with being afab)
However even if I transition I feel like I'm just being me. 
I don't know, I cycle through gender identitys, one day one thing will sound good then the next day it doesn't, so I've pretty much just gave up trying to pin it down and focus on being happy / figuring out what I want to do transition wise.
My thoughts exactly!
This is incredibly wholesome to see, I love it
>Gender is an all-you-can-eat buffet.

I like to say gender presentation is a stage show and you get to pick your costume and props, but I like this too!
Wasabi peas and ice cream sounds kinda good
Yes!

My mother isn't what you'd call an LGBTQ ally, but she's usually pretty supportive of me. I came out as nonbinary to her and she asked me to explain what it meant. By the time I finished she scoffed and said ""that just sounds like a bunch of stupid labels people made up. Just be yourself."" She's supportive in her own way.

Of course, I later tested the waters about clothing by telling her about F1NN5TER and talking about how a lot of conventionally fem clothes were originally popularized as men's fashion in the past. She made it very clear that she finds men wearing women's clothing disgusting and she hopes I never do that.

So I keep that stuff in the closet for now. Baby steps.
Society does not define who we are. If it did trans people wouldn’t exist. Society is often wrong
My late husband was a cis man whose Second Life avator was a beautiful female fairy, and he loved making jewelry, but also building and repairing machinery and things around the house.
Love this for you. Never feel invalidated or insecure about your interests and hobbies! They’re wonderful and don’t add or remove anything from your gender identity.
Teddy bears are the most manly thing ever - it's a wild, dangerous animal and you've gotten a miniature, inanimate one and are keeping it in your home.
It takes time, just be gentle with yourself! I hope in time you’ll be able to accept all parts of yourself and see the validity of that :)
>even though I LOVE being a girl I also quite love the idea of being non binary. It feels liberating.

AFAB here who feels the exact same way sometimes. Of every gender identity out there ""woman"" feels the least wrong but it's not quite right either, and I like the concept of gender as a fluctuating point on a spectrum, not a static setting on a binary switch.
That’s awesome! Yes, just let yourself enjoy things ✨
What are the most masculine hobbies?
Thank you so much 💕
Thank you for acknowledging this! One of the hardest parts of making these comics is fitting big ideas (often complex emotions or social issues!) into 4 short panels with as few words as possible…it’s a lot harder than the artwork itself lol!
Those are all wonderful things that have no gender! Squishmallows are for all people, never deprive yourself of that joy! 😄
This is such a cool interest/hobby! Now I want to look into this and try one on!
Gender abolition is trans abolition, FYI. People are allowed to have genders, it’s part of nature. Don’t ever confuse stereotypes with gender. That’s exactly what the comic is about
Mobile bug lol
Yes many don’t even realize how they’ve been duped by companies. I can’t telll you the number of people who bite back at me when I say women only shave their legs and Pitts now because of marketing from The BIC razor company. It’s literally invented by a razor company to sell more razors and the “meaning” of diamonds it’s by a diamond company to sell more diamonds! It’s all marketing BS. Companies gender things to sell twice as much of their product for no reason.
My makeup routine tends to be pretty simple (I sweat easily lol), but I usually like a simple glitter on the eyes, a soft winged eyeliner, and a bold lipstick! Simplicity tends to make an outfit pop in my opinion.
I guess I've been reading too much transmed stuff in a desperate attempt to invalidate myself 🥺😥
I'm saving this comment, excellently written!
110%
I am so sorry for your loss, thank you for sharing this though it's really lovely
I don't want to be too specific, but engineering and mechanics-y things.

I am definitely not saying those things OUGHT to be male-coded, but they are.
right!! squishmallows are the best
It's a **very** expensive hobby to get into. I learned sewing and dyeing just to be able to afford it lol. I dye my own muslin (because it's a tough as nails fabric and well suited for working class clothes).
Depends on what exactly you mean by ""gender abolition"". There are certainly some people who mean ""homogenize everyone into the same 'mix of everything' gender"", but, at least in my experience, they're less common than the ones who, like myself, mean something more like ""knock gender down to a trait that people are no more divided into groups by than, say, eye color"".
>Companies gender things to sell twice as much of their product for no reason.

Gender was invented by bathroom companies to sell twice as many bathrooms! 

And knowing women only shave their body hair because of razor company marketing makes me feel a lot better as an AFAB person who chooses not to shave mine, not for gender reasons but just because it costs spoons I don't have and it's more annoying when it's growing back after shaving it than it is if I leave it alone.
Nice! That sounds awesome 🙂
I'm sorry you're dealing with that.
Thank you.
Amazing!! That’s so cool!
Yes you found the meme I was referencing! lol and I agree it’s like why would anyone shave if it was unnecessary? It’s okay if you shave because you like to but it’s stupid to shame people for not doing it when the stuff literally grows on your body.

Big brain time:		"Yessssssss hard same. Or how close it is. My boss is *extremely invested* in me having access to a gender neutral restroom, and it’s like…a 5 minute walk away, in another building. Is the single stall women’s room literally right outside our office generally unoccupied and clean? Yes? I’ll be using that, thanks.
one day i shall reach a level of androgyny that will let me unlock this ability (safely)
I wish I could just do that. I mean, theoretically I absolutely could, but I'm awkward af and I also don't want to go the the women's restroom as a visibly AMAB person to not fuel the ""men declare themselves as non-men to be creepy on cis women"" narrative. I never thought me taking a piss could be politicized, yet here we are.
I also base it on if the cleaning person is there or not lmao
YES.

Once i was going to ""women"" restroom and a guy stopped me telling me ""it was women's""...so i said i'm non binary, thus i can go there too.
wait

i can do that?

holy shit *i can do that*
Or when you do match the sign on the door, just not the way they wanted you to match the sign on the door.  ""Oh, the choices are jacket or dress?  Guess we're jacket tonight.""
In school, it's always women's restroom then 😅

The men's restroom literally has *missing doors*

Gotta love the future of my country
Honestly I just use whichever bathroom has a urinal.
using the (completely abandoned, as in no one ever uses it) disabled toilet because gender has been disabled
I always look for the single stalled bathrooms. Not because I'm uncomfortable using a gendered bathroom, it's because I hate using the bathroom in an unfamiliar space with strangers, especially because in the US, the stalls are basically see through
Me at work. We only have 3 stalls in the whole building (a cafe) . 2 in the ""women's room"" one in the ""mens"" if the women's are full, I try the men's and hope nobody is there cus sadly I lack the equipment to use a urinal.
the multi-stall ladies room in my uni library has had a clogged toilet and spilled water for at least a month now. idk why they aren’t cleaning it up. it stinks.

anyway, usually i go to ladies’ rooms because i pass as that, and they’re usually closer than gender-inclusive bathrooms. but on god i’m going to the gender-inclusive one whenever i’m in the library lol.
The issue I have is while I’m mostly masculine leaning in also a germophobe and men’s bathrooms tend to be messier no? Also I don’t want to walk into a place with urinals and end up seeing someone’s parts I don’t want to see either sex’s parts no thank you. So that kinda puts me in a dilemma
I wish I felt comfortable doing this
More like using the restroom where I'm least likely attacked. For me at least...
The gender neutral bathrooms at my school are kind of hidden so a lot of people don't use them (especially underclassmen), so those are the only bathrooms that always have paper towels available. I use girls locker rooms because they're closer to my after school sports. I call it transgender privilege around my friends lmao
Me when I chop off my chest occupiers
I have a close relationship with my college authorities (mainly because my activism), and always when I find them I ask them about the gender neutral bathrooms they promised to do. Idk if they know I'm enby, but they surely are suspecting it considering how insistent I am
We really need a pee room and a poop room.  That's how they should be separated
I used to do that, but now in my state, I can be arrested and charged for using my unassigned gender bathroom 😭
I can't when im in school because my horrible state just passed bathroom bills

The US is just sooo great /s
If only people saw me as a boy
sadly for some reason a port-a-potty with no gender attached to it feels better than a clean restroom that says men or women
I understant the need for gendered toilets in the sense that women have sometimes a need to change period pads and touch up make up etc. so womens toilets create more biowaste and possible smells related.

In a perfect world everyone would get along but us Non-Binary and Trans persons are hated and attacked over mostly harmless self-expression.
lmao
Literally me
Or just not going to where its basically a health risk
real
I remember I did this at my old job,there was no toilet paper so I went into the men's bathroom and I was so amazed at how cleaned it was. Not only did I feel comfortable being in there,I wish I was allowed to go in more often and a few times I even snuck in there. It was so nice!
i go to any bathroom .  the men's br line is always shorter & I need to go .  do not care who is there .
Aka, using the men’s restroom
I vote to make all the nasty gross bathroom users use the same bathroom
Or which one is available right now.
I wish I could do that. I present too masc.
This all day
The moral dilemma of which Starbucks restroom to use. Men’s room is typically open and has no line, but I’ve worked at a cafe or two so like. Not the cleanest by anyone’s stretch of imagination. 

Honestly it’s still worth the looks on men’s faces when I exit. Homie, it’s for pissing, not hanging out half naked with the boys.
I went into the men's room for the first time ever this weekend and I don't know why it's taken me this long. It was cleaner and there was no line! I'm never going back 😆
👌🏻👌🏻👌🏻
Or if there is one: Handicap toilet cause its genderless 🤷
So true bestie
Honestly I always use girls or neutral because I’m worried about certain /fluids/ in the men’s room
I go into mens room pee half my piss and then go into womens room and pee the rest of my piss
Huge competitive advantage imo
Galaxy brain shit
I use the one I’m not gonna get assaulted or have the police called on me in. I am very much not ok. 🥲
I remember one time a few years ago, when I went into the bathroom at a small restaurant that I had never been to. I went in, did my business, and came out. To exit the bathroom, I had to walk down a short and narrow hallway that contained a few doors and opened up into the dining area. On the way out, I passed by a man that looked very confused and maybe a bit shocked. I thought nothing of it, until my friend (who's a cis woman) exited the *women's* bathroom... which wasn't the one I went into. Oops! I then understood why the man had that look on his face, and I thought about how silly it was that the bathrooms were gendered even though they were just tiny rooms with a toilet and sink.
If I’m having a gastric emergency, you better believe I’m heading for the shortest line.
I feel like there's somebody somewhere who is furious from this post😅
Aka using the women's room when the men's room smells weird,

and using the men's room when the women's room is too hot and stuffy from having the window perpetually closed
Meee. I have to go so quickly it’s wherever there is a toilet tbh. Yay for gastro problems? XD
Living in conservative, closed-minded towns my whole life has made me just choose the family restroom if there is one, or the one that I always went to growing up
I don't get why single stalled bathrooms are ever gendered anyways
I'm rooting for you!
I wish ;(
Same but more fluidity just being able to lean more fem or masc as usefull 

Or, in other words, utility gender
I came here to.say basically this exact thing. I will always pass as a cis man, and I've seen even women + trans spaces feel uncomfortable with my presence.
I'll go in the single stall woman's bathroom if the men's is locked (gendered single stall bathrooms are one of humanities worst inventions)
when I was in middle school, during practice I would go to the boys bathroom when no one else was looking. I can't believe i still thought I was cis. Completely unrelated to your comment, but I thought it was funny.
Yup, I would like to use the women's bathroom because I don't like feeling like a man, but I have facial hair so that's out the window.
Me too! They get so angry if they catch me going in their bucket, but I just run into the other bathroom and finish.
I hear this too and I’m just like, are there toilets in there? Then that’s the place I’m looking for.
Since people pee differently depending on their genitalia, it'd have to be a urinal room and a toilet bowl room. The only ones who would benefit are people with penises who just have to pee.
bathroom bills? /gen
I'm sorry but what would prevent women from changing pads and doing makeup if there were men and nbs around? I regularly touch up my makeup in men's restrooms.
Well yes, but so do masc-presenting AFABs and people of any gender/sex who do makeup.
Why are multi stalled bathrooms gendered? It's a room where you deposit your bodily waste, it's awkward regardless
Building codes. Back when women first joined the workforce in large numbers, lots of employers literally refused to provide adequate restrooms for employees who weren't men, and so most places set a legal quota for restrooms that had to be designated for men and women based on building capacity, etc. At the time, this was a step forward in terms of inclusivity and equality. 

Unfortunately, the laws haven't caught up with modern understandings of gender and accessibility for gender diverse people.
Because of some men not sitting down.
Just like that ahah
As an AFAB, I'm kind of ignorant on this matter, but is there a difference between peeing into a urinal and peeing into a toilet bowl. Like, some public places and all houses I've seen only provide toilet bowls, and people with penises seem to be able to pee just fine?

If there isn't much of a difference, I'd argue for only toilet bowls.
There appears to be a notion that cis men can't handle periods of any kind at all.

When I'm at home, I'm discouraged from talking about my periods or vaginal discharge around my dad. And back when I first got my period, my mom used to tell me to change my pad regularly because men aren't used to the smell and thus might think I smell weird.

And some men are just misogynists who believe periods are disgusting or that it's just the same thing as peeing. But that's a different story.
I am glad to hear that your experiences have been positive.

I thought that I live in a pretty liberal country but every time I've gone out as fem, I get verbally or physically attacked.

I am jaded so I was projecting a little. Maybe you can forgive me?
Yeah it's dumb anyway, but single-stall bathrooms are even more dumb since there's literally nobody there to object.
Urinals! So many issues are caused by urinals
Peeing into a toilet bowl is no problem at all. Urinals are just smaller, cheaper, faster to use, and use less water. They definitely keep traffic moving faster, as you see by the lines anywhere that has separated bathrooms. Unisex bathrooms with both bowls and urinals but with stalls that are completely closed top to bottom would be my ideal because I know there are creepers out there.
Agree! \^\^ And where I live, Ontario, some kind of law changed it so single stall public washrooms are supposed to be all neutral now....or something along those lines. It isn't everywhere, but the government ones appear to have converted at least.
Honestly they wouldn't cause issues if they just put dividers up, frankly it's weird that that usually don't have them. Or the trough urinals 🤮
The lines honestly have less to do with the bowl vs urinal difference, imo. AFABs have to walk in, sit down (additionally complicated if they’re wearing a dress or other one-piece outfit), and do their business, potentially changing period products while they’re at it. They also always wash their hands. AMABs just have to walk in and do their business, and apparently don’t wash their hands? Heard this from JammiDodger.

Have you ever encountered toilet stalls with gaps between the door and the frame?
The w h a t urinals
True, it's not much slower to just walk into a stall and pee standing up, though it would also result in even more pee getting splashed around on areas that other patrons sit.

> AMABs just have to walk in and do their business, and apparently don’t wash their hands?

In my experience, most at least do a quick rinse under the tap, but there are always gonna be some gross people who don't even do that.

> Have you ever encountered toilet stalls with gaps between the door and the frame?

Absolutely, and it wouldn't be that hard for a dedicated creeper to look above or below the door, either, with the huge-ass gaps American stalls have there.
Imagine the boys all going for a pee, but in the same toilet..."	12h3oxa	NonBinary	3309	1.0	2023-04-10 02:07:19

i made a pair of pants! now i don’t have to deal with gendered clothing nonsense		"You’re telling me people can just *make* their own pants?
Damn that's good! Well done 

And fck gendered clothing. For me men's sizes are too large and women's clothing has built-in hips and boobs which I don't have. So I just randomly go around buying both of them but actually why can't we just measure sizes in cm or inch instead of gender because ughhghg
Holy hell what incredible pants. I’m actually obsessed. This is the right move, stores don’t sell the shit we want, might as well make it!!!
these are such good pants
What pattern did you use?
That outfit looks 🔥🔥🔥 wow!
So much power in one picture
They look so fire ‎️‍🔥 ‎️‍🔥 can we peep the pattern you used?
Those are great! 😲🖤🖤🖤
[deleted]
Oohhh, those look neat. Did you use a pattern?
They look amazing 🔥
YOU LOOK SO COOL AAAH <3
Cool!
Those pants are awesome!!!!
This outfit is amazing, I'd love to wear it
They look amazing! What pattern did you use?
I want the same pants tbh
Those are amazing! The fit is so good. I've been looking into making my own clothes myself but my sewing machine broke down a while ago and having to buy a new one is so daunting because there are SO MANY to choose from. This is giving me serious inspiration through... might just have to for it! Great job!
Bro you are my goals in so many ways... Your entire vibe but also the fact that you make your own clothes. I just got a sewing machine and I've been looking into how to do it so I can make long sleeved crop tops for flat, way too tall me. And pants. And shirts. And everything else. Your pants look AMAZING and I hope I will someday become as good as you <3
They look so cool. One question though, how big are the pockets?
Goddamn I want this whole outfit
They are so good! Your look is amazing also!!! Super cute,,,🥺🥺
These are amazing
They look amazing! Maybe I should try that!
Omg those are so cute and honestly are my *goals* for making clothing 🥰
These are rad!!
Oh god you are totally goals. I'm going to have to try my hand at those pants of yours. High waisted pants are the one aspect of femme fashion I'm loathe to give up, and these are perfect--high waisted but not immediately gendered!
That's our plan as well! You look fabulous. Well done!
Omg this is so fire. I will literally buy a pair if you were making more.
Aaaaaa 🔥🔥🔥🔥🥺
They look so good! You did such a wonderful job!
Those are the most non binary pants I’ve ever seen and I need a pair
They look incredible and so do you!!
What a fab fit well done you :D
Wow outstanding job, they look fantastic, your very talented... I totally agree in clothing not being gendered..
Bro you look so fucking slick :3
Omg plaid pants twin
Wow amazing job!! They look great on you
Yay, it got pockets! That's some grade A stuff you got right there!
damn you did an awesome job at those :D everytime i make some they turn out to be a lot too wide aroung my waist XD
also really cool pattern :)
Literal goals.
[deleted]
Remind me of 1920s Oxford trousers
You've reached the genderless peak.
i wish i was you
Outfit is looking pretty sweet
Oh my god these pants are glorious and I want 5 pairs 💛🥺✨
Everything about this is splendid.
Fuck yeah. I've hear pants are hard you must be talented af
omg can you share the pattern please!?
And they have POCKETS! You are living the dream.
how deep are the pockets, could they fit a family-sized bag of takis, or even a nintendo switch?
They fit so great!!! I love them on you
Looks fantastic.
Amazing! Did you use a pattern? I love them!
Out of curiosity what fabric did you use (weight and material)?
i wouldnt believe it if i hadnt done it myself, still blows my mind.
can't agree more. mens clothes are often too big on me, or my hips are too large. since top surgery womens tops arent fitted for me, and are also to big on me. pants have always been ridiculous on both sides. im just gonna make my own and not deal with it anymore !
You'd still have to account for proportions of the underlying body. In yon olden days you could fake proportions with undergarment structure (for women's clothing, at least), but we don't do that anymore.
seriously! i spend so much time window shopping and never buying anything because it doesnt fit or isnt quite what i want. all my shopping money is becoming fabric money and i am remaking my closet

actually quite big! can comfortably fit my whole hand and phone
i want to get some more practice in, but i totally could see myself making clothes for others eventually !

i just tested them, they can actually fit a nintendo switch ! it's tight though. unsure about the takis.

Very impressive, and they look fantastic on you.

Dope, thanks!
Thanks!
Thank you :)

Thanks, once I find my mums old machine I'll see if I can make something wearable, you did a great job btw.

*screams in gender confusion*		"Ugh, yeah. It's worse because I'm not out to some people so I hear myself referred to in gendered terms and that gets into my head.
If it makes anyone feel better, this is almost assuredly just force of habit. You have probably identified as your AGAB within your own thoughts for a lot longer than you have identified as non-binary so it's only natural. If anything it allows me to respect people that can't just auto switch up pronouns and stuff like that. If even I can't get it all the time then how could I expect others to right away as well.
Yeah this happens way too much but I think that it happens because I'm not out and everyone calls me he.
I am my own biggest misgenderer ngl
Ugh yes. All the flipping time. How many times do I have to tell you brain, I am not *rejected Binary gender* I am non-binary/transmasc/genderqueer, I am valid, and I f'ing love me.
Omg I fucking get so upset with myself when I misgender myself. What I hate even more is when I dead name myself in my head. A great habit though that I am forming is only using my name with positive thoughts and all of the old habits of shaming myself is using my dead name. It's great to recognize that behavior because that person is dead to me and not who I really am.
me when others misgender me: \*doesnt care\*

me when i misgender myself: \*BREAKS DOWN\*
I feel seen
Me who uses all pronouns: I don't have such weaknesses
Me when I misgender myself: oh look i got the real tron™ card now

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

/unjoke please help i need someone to she/they me right now
My big thing is sometimes other pronouns besides they/them fit me but it’s so inconsistent that I’m never gonna tell anyone else that because one minute “she” is fine in my head and then someone says it outloud and I’m like “eeehhhhh misgendered”. Not trying to set my friends up for failure cuz it’s so inconsistent lol. They/them is always comfy 24/7 tho.
this is such a hecking mood
Me having impostor syndrome because I’m closeted af but don’t care at all how people refer to me and refer to myself as female in legal documents, constantly telling myself that my identity is for me and me only but, ya know 🙃
Same
i do this out of blind habit and i hate it so much
I take solace in the fact the it required major surgery and a few years of HRT before I was comfortable enough in my body to even consider exploring my assigned gender to validate my non-cis reality.
I’m finally out of that stage but my dreams haven’t caught up😤
I have no idea how to refer to my past self. He was definitely a guy, I think. But only in presentation and desire to fit in. Shedding the obligation of the gender binary has done a lot for me but one thing it's taken is connection to my past self. 

A lot of my identity surrounded being a ""guy"" because that's what was impressed upon me. It only now seems so obvious that it was never right from the beginning. But I miss him, he was proud of himself, he believed in himself, if only for the wrong reasons.
i feel validated in this post
I call myself a her in uncertain environments.. when in safety..

Just don’t call me a woman or a man.. no boy/boi ether.. no he/him…

Girl, chick, dude, guy, gal, her, she, they, them, the like.. yesssssss

May occasionally like masculine type compliments… but I’ll dress the part for that..

But… I think we all tend to do it for protection and as a bad habit..  I’m NB myself and I still sometimes mis gender even my closest friend too.. quick to correct myself, but always feel like an absolute dick.. only person I regularly talk to that prefers They/Them.. so habits are rough.. 

Hoping my kiddos generation won’t have the bad habit to break
I feel called out. Maybe I am cis
at this point I don't even know if I'm agender or just cis
I’m in a weird place where I just go “yeah whatever” to whatever I’m referred to as, internally or externally … no idea where I’m at on this spectrum
SAME
I have this issue bc I write female characters and prefer a third-person limited POV...
STEALING. THIS.
exactly
If this isn’t me idk what is.
Omg yes, I recently discovered I am genderqueer and even more recently changed to using they/them pronouns. And even then I still find myself saying “this is her/she” on phone calls or referring to myself with she/her/hers pronouns still

Two things happen when I'm beyond tired: I toe inward and I misgender myself. 

That's when my SO stops everything, takes on any necessary tasks and sends me to bed
I have to think really hard when I refer to myself otherwise this happens
This happens to me all the time, but then I immediately realise I don't even remember what it meant to me to be cis.  
It's like I got on a plane and left my country and halfway through my journey I started feeling as if we haven't taken off yet, but then I look out the window and it's just clouds. It can get really confusing sometimes.
stop calling me out bestie i get it
I used to misgender myself when I was angry at myself, when I was first coming to terms with being trans 'enough'.
I constantly misgender and deadname myself when speaking in the third person
I'm not a boy, but I'm like a Boi, yknow?
Me who's always making jokes about being gay (actually pan) because women are hot and I'm a simp, but I'm nonbinary so it confuses the hell outta people
😂🙌🏻🤣. I feel ya!!
Yep! Not out at work (or on most of reddit lol) so I have the same problem.
same lol
FR
Brain: hmm good point, you know I might’ve been wrong… you are *DEFINITELY REJECTED BINARY GENDER*. (Brains fucking suck)
My therapist suggested when I do that, it's me referring to my child self. You didn't know all of you when you were little and that part of you always sticks with you. I stopped using the term dead name, for me, it's just my little internal child's name, and my inner child is for me and me ONLY.
Yes! I fucking hate this. Nothing messes with me more than misgendering myself, even worse if people i'm out to hear it.
I also use all pronouns but…
You heard what they said people, let’s help her out.
TheDarkStar05 has a cool and mysterious username, I bet they are an awesome person. She has a cute icon too!
Hey non cis sis, I am glad you are here. 

Hey friends I’m glad you are also here helping her feel seen and her’d. They came to the right place to have folx give them that good good gender euphoria.
thank you all so much 🥰 <3
Yeah, kinda same with me. I genuinely don’t care what pronouns are used for me, even if it is me referring to myself.

But I think mine is because I grew up speaking a language that doesn’t have pronouns, so I’m more used to not using them.
Of course, would never refuse to help out a fellow trans person like her! I also wish them a very pleasant day!"	swbuxo	NonBinary	2713	1.0	2022-02-19 14:56:32
I've identified outside of the gender binary for 9 years now. Tomorrow I will take my 3rd testosterone injection. 😌💚		"you know that feeling where you think, ""do I want to be them or just think they're hot?"" that's me rn
Your eyebrows are my transition goals
Your aesthetic is so awesome! Congrats on T
Awesome!! I'm non-binary and I'm on the wait list to get an appointment to start T. I'm so excited but also nervous.
Are you on a lower dose of T to try and get a more enby/andro look as opposed to like.. Just guy?
That's what I want to do
you’re stunning + your body mods are huge goals! I’m waiting for my septum to heal so I can stretch it, and my lobes are only at a 10g, but I hope I look as badass as you someday!
You're back! I remember seeing a pic of you like half a year ago and being completely astonished by your aesthetic!
Is that a Treasure Planet tattoo??
You look just like my friend Ryley omg
Damn you’re hot
Hell fuck and shit yeah!!!!!! Congrations!!!!!! You look *chefs kiss* and I hope you feel that way too!!
Yoooo nice shirt! Great band
You are a gorgeous human being.
You look fantastic Noble person. :)
very cute :3 love your tattoos and your eyes
I think ur cute ! Can we date ? :)
Oh wow 🏳️‍🌈
congrats!!! also ur eyes r beautiful
Sounds like you had to wait a long time to get that first one since you’ve been wanting it—congratulations on getting here! You look amazing 😄
Hey! I follow you on Insta. You look great as always
Not to be weird but I'd cum if you chocked me.
Oh my god this is amazing and you’re so pretty howmst
You look amazing 😍😘
Holy fuuuuuccccckkk
congratulations!!!
hell yea bro
Very cool. You look great!
Those are some swell gains!!
Wish I looked that good lmao!

You're mind-shatteringly beautiful ❤️
Holy heck! 😍 So fine!
Wee woo wee wooo hottie alert!!!
Looking goood over there
yknow what?

i'd like to hold your hand, please, i'll wash my hands really well.
You look so cool !
ur so hamsum 🥺💕
😮😍
I love the hair! Looking great.
😍😍😍
Same lol
exactly my thoughts, is this my goal to date or to transition?
Exactly! Both I think.
Same
Thank you!! I couldn't be more excited.
I will be yes. Right now I'm on an ""average"" dose but when I go back in a month and have my testosterone levels checked adjustments will be made if needed. My doctor is going to keep me at a lower level if that make sense, as opposed to just a lower dosage.
Thank you! My septum is still very small, 12g I think. Lobes are 16mm (5/8). What's your goal for your ears?
Yeah life's been a bit too crazy for reddit lately. I missed you guys though. ☺
Yes it is :)
Hahah thank you!!
Hell yeah!
Hey! Thank you! ☺
I just got that arm band tattoo so some of the ""swell"" is from that 😅
Yeah that makes sense, thank you ☺️
this is gonna sound buckwild but I don’t actually have one? I figure I’ll just keep going until it feels right lol, at least a 00 I think.
I love it!"	jn0ynl	NonBinary	2713	1.0	2020-11-03 01:23:57
Are you a boy or girl . Me stares off into the distance		"i always say i’m neither and both at the same time and i will not elaborate further
I'm a man in the same way a bagel is a sandwich. Which is to say kinda but not really.
And some of us are * rolls D20, gets a 3* ""maybe""
I miss when ""moo"" was still current in programmer culture.

It basically meant ""I cannot answer your question because it is based on unfounded assumptions.”
Best I can manage is ""Cisn't""
At this point I'm convinced my gender is just based on my mood and how I'm feeling at the time😭
Me: “My gender the swirling of stardust in the void, the end of stars and the beginning of planets, it is the kn- gosh darn it, it just changed.”
someone: ""Are you a man or a woman?""

me: ""not really... but I guess...""

someone: ""Come on, tell me, are you a boy or a girl?""

me: ""Oh yeah, definitely.""

(adulting is hard and I interpret ""or"" in the boolean sense)
My gender is ‘something that has taken the form of a woman and you’d better hope it keeps that form’.
""Have you ever had ice cream, and it tastes like a flavor you know, but also not really? Like rather then the normal strawberry flavor, or real strawberries...its almost like it tastes pink. That's my relationship with gender. The normal isn't what I  experiencing, but Its in the same flavor""
my gender is a hard pass tbh
My gender is made of stardust and angst, like a unicorn that’s been in multiple wars.
My gender is 'a dude with long hair from LoTR/RoP who can camouflage in a forest but also not rly'
My gender is very “none pizza with left gender” and no I will not elaborate
When people ask what my gender is I tell them I've unsubscribed and all further inquiries will be marked as spam.
I'm neither, I'm \*pulls up PowerPoint presentation*
My strategy:
""Are you a boy or a girl?"" ""Potato""
""Yeah but what's in your pants?"" ""butterflies""
My gender is like when you put your earphones into your bag. Just drop them. And then you fish them out and they're a mess. That's my gender.
somehow i'm both of these at once.
My gender is water bottle and blanket and hoodie and dude but not really
\*slides it back\* oh, no thank you
or both of those at the same time xD
I don’t want to not be girl, but I hate when people see me and their first thought is girl. I like when people see boy, but don’t want to exclusively be seen as boy.

Can people just not perceive me so I can exist in a world where I occasionally get called sir but still have natures stress ball chesticles and hella cake? Maybe with a detachable optional dong?
i like to say my gender is the way devo sounds :o)
Mine is none left beef
My gender is just a thing I never think about. I’m non-binary but I don’t know how and don’t care
My gender is both Jesse and James from Team Rocket on an irregular cycle
I just tell them I’m kinda like gollum but not really but kinda
The post i saw just before this was this exact one  but on lgbt sub
My gender is Commitment Issues.
I'm kinda a boy kinda a girl but mostly I'm just chaotic hot
My gender is ""what is gonna cause the most chaos to the cis""

And sometimes ""dude but not really"" does the trick.
Haha I think I might be bigender
My gender begins where my fingers end, but it's also not there.
I'm definitely something.
i’m a guy in the way every a frog you see on the sidewalk is “a handsome fellow”
If girl is strawberry, then my gender is strawberry flavored sparkling water. Tastes and smells like girl but is something fundamentally different. Girl inspired gender(s).
My gender is in the middle. I am the Bendu.
One of my friends had a great description of their gender: ""I'm not a woman, but I do caucus with women.""
My gender is me! If you know me then you know my gender. I’m me. That’s all folks
Im totally in the camp of ""im a dude but WAY more than that.""  But in the end really what is gender.....
✨*I’m an experience* ✨
I would say, ""My gender is like Darkman. Dark man is everyone but he is no one. He is Darkman.""
Best I can do is local, incomprehensible cryptid.
And some of us just ask to not be perceived!
I usually say, it's whatever. ""What are your pronouns though!?"" Whatever ya want bruh. Just point or wave or somethin... Use the royal plural even.
And then there's my gender, which is just chaos incarnate.
There is this Ren and Stimpy episode (Ren's Bitter Half) where Ren is split into his two sides, his evil side, and his indifferent side.

I feel like that about gender. I have my femme side... and my indifferent side.
This is so validating. I'm a girl, but like not really.
Ok but also some of us are both depending on who's asking. I'm not revealing my secret identity to the cishets
I showed this to my husband and immediately he said “you’re the second one”.

He gets me.
Someone: Are you a boy or a girl?

Me: No.
mah gender: m crab
Hey I'm a dude but not really! Lol

I like to say that I wouldn't be upset if I lost my genitalia in an unfortunate smelting accident, but at the same time I don't feel like I'm not a dude.
im both
My gender is meh...
My gender... a transboy feeling like a woman.

(Born of ""female"" sex, not actually a transboy)
Used to be the bottom one now I’m the top
OOOH I JUST THOUGHT OF ANOTHER GOOD ONE. Start looking around like you were looking for your keys or something. Then you go ""AW SHIT, I HAD IT HERE A MINUTE AGO, I JUST LOST IT AGAIN"".
r/me_irlgbt maybe?
I am simply *~that bitch~*.
My gender is ""sure, whatever""
Yeah I'm the latter. I'm just a person. Sometimes I feel like I could be a gender but the next day that has changed and then another day I could be another gender. I gave up on trying and just say I'm genderfluid. And sometimes genderdry with no gender xD
I am the latter kinda but the opposite
If any of you guys are interested in the supernatural persona alternative to gender try r/voidpunk it's a great little supportive community and it's full of fun stuff!
""so, are you a boy or a girl?""

""i never really thought about it, since i'm a robot.""

-K1-BO
Why am I the second one😭🤣
I am equipped with a dick, and an empty holster.

I'm a rootin tootin cowcow.
I just say “uhhhhhh hello my name is airy and welcome to my competition called one”
I threw my gender into The Void, and now we're both happy. 😊

Alternatively, I'm a dude [in the Good Burger sense. ](https://youtu.be/xSs7J7O_fl4)
I am [REDACTED]
That second part hit me. Really sparked my emotions and resonated with me. The first one is just a mood.
I am me, simply led to be just “me”. How free, the ways to see, a world where all those believe themselves to be “me”. If some come to desire, be called by name, like “wind” or “fire”, it’d be all the same to me, no need for additional inquire. I shall only see thee, the you that believes “I am me”. As there are no others, just us living free, no need for miserable requires. I shall sound out, in waves and through patterns, those you crave to be hard, acting as lanterns to see the you that believes is “me”.

A person may change their name as too they may change as a person, in mind and in body. Even if these changes may seem small at times, I’d like to just say, we are change everyday. Some days we learn something new, some days we figure out new ways to view. Other days we may end up feeling blue. But it’s also true to say, soon enough you’ll change, into a brand new you.
And then there's me: eh.
I'm a woman sometimes, but others I'm neutral and just barely woman-adjacent.
im def the second one, emphasis on not rly
My gender is cryptid. You think you know what I am but you've also never seen me so it's also all guessing and assumptions.
i just say i’m nothing but not agender just nothing
my flair
A couple weeks back I was in an elevator with a guy and his daughter and she straight up asked me if I was a boy or girl 😸

That's the million dollar question kiddo.
I am an Ethereal being the likes of which your human mind cannot possibly comprehend.
I’m either, neither, or both.


But the local pastor says I’m a Reptilian.
I'm the material that nightmares are made of.
My gender is pretty simple. I don't have one.
Im just
I'm neither and both-- and a bird by the dumpster screaming for taco bell.
If the binary genders are orange juice and black current squash, then I'm orange squash
My gender is simply put the Mac meme from it’s always sunny” I’m playing both sides so that I always come out on top “
me I'm like slime. I slide but not really. Ehh who cares f*ck gender
Im Boygirl liquid
I also feel like neither and both at the same time.
Everything and nothing and both and neither, all at the same time.
That's pretty close actually
Yes me too!
yeah I’m neither and both as well!!! but also like- fluid-ish?? idk man
Me too!
I hear this. I’m a girl if you rounded up. More like girl* where the asterisk requires a foot note for clarification.
This is my favorite description EVER.
I will steal this to explain myself!
Feel that.
And some days we get a modifier so even a d20 doesn't help us decide lol
That's fine! May be Gender fluid?
That sounds absolutely beautiful! you should check our r/voidpunk !
> I interpret ""or"" in the boolean sense)

As someone who spends most his free time coding for fun, I had a good chuckle at this, I'll keep this on the top of my head when the next person asks me.
That's surprisingly relatable. Makes sense to me
My ice cream gender flavour is if everyone got a choice between chocolate and vanilla, I unexpectedly got boysenberry.
If you have to ask me my gender... you've failed.
There's a webtoon comic-
Mine is young mischievious hobbit of 40 something years old.
Same.
Yesssssss
WHOA, I COULD BE V FROM VENDETTA. THANK YOU.
I'm like male and non-existent at the same time.
That just doesn't make sense
it’s like fluid but also not fluid at the same time? like some days i wanna be masc and some days i wanna be fem but even then i feel like the NB experience of masc and fem are wayyy different than cis masc and fem
Possibly! Right now I'm comfortable with the Enby label though :)
Yup, not my idea/explanation though. I just use it. Friend who is basically permanently in the closet used it and I loved it.
Lol! I feel bad for the Gelato and froyo crowds too
I am A Dwarf and I’m digging a hole
Yeah i’m constantly confused
Feel the closet 😭
I've come out to my immediate family and like 2 friends but that aside I'm deeeep in the closet
Diggy diggy hole!

"Me: ""I'm very subtle about my sexual orientation and gender identity."" Also me: *pride shoelaces go brr*"		"Omg those are so good & also the exact way Id expose my orientation (also those are my flags too  🤝)
Yoooo, they're so cool!!!! Did you get them from somewhere or make them?!?!?! These are my exact flags too
*waves at you w/ pan / enby solidarity* 
 
:D
 
very pretty!!!
Oh me goooosh, we share the same flags!
I wear a rainbow mask and have two different pronoun pins attached to my jacket lol 

I wanna get even more, like an ace ring and something for me being a lesbian
Hey, I like your shoelaces 👀
Dude, I JUST got both of these!!
Guuuh they're so fucking cute
Omg. I need to get those, i got rainbow laces from wish but they where not the greatest quality.
woah, where did you get these? i want them too
omg where the same
I have converse shoes and I put pride flags on the little bits on the toes. It’s funny I put the same flags on and on the same shoes.
if they had the asexual flag would they be shoe aces?
omg I adore this
clown shoes?
I'm convinced that pride shoelaces are the pinnacle of gender
Is nobody else gonna ask why they look like clown shoes?
Those are class 👊
HA Ha Ha, I can relate as well XD.
those are so cute!
love these!!
These are soooo so pretty!  I’m guessing these are from Etsy or somewhere? They have tons of cute Pride accessories. Admittedly I too try to be super subtle about “pride-signaling” (lol) out of safety, usually just with flags that most people wouldn’t recognize.

For example, I found these cute enamel pins on Etsy that are desserts based off various Pride flags. I bought three that fit my identity/orientation I don’t think any patron who wasn’t also LGBTQ noticed them. https://www.etsy.com/listing/550861186/pastry-pride-enamel-pins-sets-individual?ref=shop_home_active_4
My child will want those shoelaces. I hope there’s a link lol
I need these ! 
Where did you find it ?
Omg I wanna buy the enby ones
Yeaaahhh!!!
Enby pans, untie!

...I mean, UNITE!
OMG YESSS!!!!
Also I need that as well like really bad
You’re just like me
Okay. Those shoes look really comfy. Please tell me what they are. O.O
This literally screams ‘gender is but a social construct’ lol
Those are great!!
I got these flags as keychains on my backpack! Cool to see you!
Oh awesome! I have a bunch of pride items, but I never thought about shoe laces. I'll definitely check out the links you posted in the replies, since I too am enby pan, also vegan (cool shoes BTW.)
We share the same flags
Nothing about these shoes or laces is subtle about your gender or sexual identity.
My 1st thought: clown shoes
I need these
Welcome to the club!   
Nobody in my country probably knows the flags, except the people that have these flags, so not exposed. :D
Mine too!
Same flags tooo 💟
Nonbinary pansexual here too!
They're from etsy. Just search for -whatever lgbtqia+ term- pride shoelaces on there.
*\*Waves back\**

Thank u.
That's cool!
op stole them from the president
Thank u.
I've got them from etsy. :D
Etsy, just search for -lgbtqia+ term you want the flag of- pride shoelaces.
Thank u.
Nope?
Agreeable. -And oversized hoodies.-
Someone already asked. These are barefoot shoes (simulate barefoot walk that is proven to be healthier for feet if you have correct way of walking), so they have more space for toes, otherwise it would defy the purpose.
Yeah, they are from etsy. *I've written that in responses like 20 times already.* :D

I love pins, but I don't have where to put them, so I rather buy clothes nobody's gonna get if I'm not out to them.

There's somewhere link in a comment response, so you can check it out.
I've got them from etsy. Pride shoelaces, if you wanna check.
Does that mean we're sibs now? :D
It's Ahinsa vegan-leather barefoot shoes and the shoelaces are from etsy.
Some kind of barefoot shoe I think - maybe Vivobarefoot - and I want them and the laces, those are my flags too.
Thank u.
Yeah... that's... kinda the point of the joke I made?
They are barefoot shoes. They stimulate barefoot walking without having to make your legs dirty.
Haha, Ive been in the club for the past decade! ✨And yeah I feel ya. Country Im originally from (but not residing in now) is the same. It is in fact dangerous to be recognized as queer over there.
ayy same flags here too
Hooray for nb pans ✨🤝
Which president? :D
Finally the response I'm looking for 👀
Boooooooo
the wide toe made me think of clown shoes
Thanks !
Yeah
Nice! 🤘 The material looks pretty flexible, are they comfy? Hello fellow vegan pan enby! ☺️ Currently rocking vegan barefoot five-toe Vibrams, sooo comfy. ✊
Nice! They all look really great - how to choose?  Hmm...
They're Ahinsa brand and the laces are from etsy.
You're very welcome. 👍
Oh nice
Sounds like my country's eastern neighborhood.
🖖🏽
That makes sense. They're barefoot shoes, so they wouldn't have that effect if they were narrower.
They are the comfiest I've ever had if I don't count actually walking without shoes. :D Glad to find a fellow vegan pan enby here!
ohhhh i’ve never heard of those
Welp, now you have. :D
I’ve been wearing barefoot shoes daily for 2 years now and I absolutely love them! What company are those from?
Ahinsa, they make awesome and very comfortable vegan-leather shoes.

Just wanted to share this pic that gives me Androgynous Gender Euphoria 💚		"[deleted]
I love the patterned shirt! Where did you get it from?
Has anyone ever told you that you look like Klaus from The Umbrella Academy? At least when hes sober that is. Hes pan
you have such good taste in accessories! i wish i had your confidence and styling skills!
You look amazing!!!
You kinda remind me of the leaning tower of cheesa dude from a goofy movie (not an insult)
gender envy
Oh my goodness you look great!! Hopefully, at one point I can look as androgynous as you. Also, that’s a perfect spot for photos. Underrated spot in the city for pictures by far.
The Golden Gate, the mohawk/mullet, the vaporwave aesthetic shirt... Absolute goals.
Gotta say I love that shirt outfit combo!
BIG Klaus Hargreeves energy
Dude yesssss, you are definitely a goal!
this is level 100 enby
hot dang, it aint easy pulling off facial hair while still looking androgynous... but you did a good job!
Dope af
Wow, so casually a boss. This is priceless.
Ayeee you look stunning
Yessss I adore your style!!! 🖤
You look so good, definitely the sort of androgynous that I want to be some day!!
Androgyny looks so good on you 🥰🥰🥰
I get gender envy from this...
Bruh, we got the same hair. Mullets for life!!
KILLIN IT 🤟💚
you look so rad!!! :D
Yeeee!!! This gives ME gender euphoria!!! Thank you for sharing!
I wish I could look that good 🥺
I've been reconsidering how I want to present myself to the world and honestly you nailed the look. You look fantastic!
Pleeeeease tell me where you got your shirt. I absolutely love it
Yooo, there's some SF sunshine! The last few days have been so gloomy in the city but you look so rad here I wouldn't be surprised if you made the sun come out.
You give off so much powerful energy aaaaahhh
Honestly that is better than anything I could have asked for!!!!! I’m a member of the SF queers that have been able to move back in to the city because all the tech bros moved out of the city, driving the prices down enough that the gays could return! Make SF Queer again!
Honestly it’s from Walmart haha! Only $9!
I’ll def take that compliment! Thank you!
Yes! Klaus is so dreamy
This was also my thought!
I also came to the comments to say this lol
You’re so sweet! I cut and color my own hair so it’s all me, So that means so much! Had a lot of time in Corona to master it haha. Just be yourself, fuck all the rest ❤️🧡💛💚💙💜
Thank you!
I am not in the least offended. That is one of the best comparisons I’ve gotten. The hair is identical!
came to say this
Omg! No need to envy. We can all be andro together 🤝
Right! Everybody be crossing the bridge for a good view when there’s so many perfect spots at Presidio! And a nude beach to boot. What more do you need?
Also I’m sure you will!
Thank you!
Thank you! It took so long to develop substantial facial hair once I started T that Never want to give it up! But my androgyny powers are stronger. Gotta represents all the androgynous/NB fam with facial hair.
I had to do a double take because it blends in so well.
Mullets for life! I love it!
You’re too sweet! Thank you!
I’m sure you do 💖💖
I’m glad I can prove some inspiration. 💖Def took me a while to find and get to this look! Thank you. You’re beautiful.
Walmart of all places! I was walking through to buy some houseplants and it called out to me.
Taken a lil over a week ago, sadly I’ve not yet transcended to weather control...yet. Although I can’t say I don’t enjoy looking at the fog creeping over the hills From my window.
Aaaaah, This is an amazing compliment!
Yay! Fellow SF queer here
It was a compliment
hes also a cult leader

You’re welcome :)
I think there may be a misunderstanding of [the term](https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=Gender%20Envy)

Not to thrust the label of ""stunning"" onto you, but you're absolutely stunning
Getting major Negasonic Teenage Warhead vibes.
Awesome, human!
Bruh I thought this was a drawing so I guess that means I found your gender and it’s pencil
Hot!!!
Maybe I'm just emotional from that time of the month, but this picture got me choked up. You are so gorgeous
Stunning!
You are fabulous ✨✨✨✨✨✨✨✨
Gender-free, only hot and striking!
this is giving me Zara fashion realness🤍
Im all the labels
Well now I have gender envy
We need more B&W posts, I’m a slut for B&W photography 🤤
You are a fucking ICON OMG. I am in awe of your whole look.
Gender identity: swag af
1 - omgggg you're so goals

2 - your hand blended into the background so well that i first thought your head was coming out of a leather boot
There are humans that are just beautifull.
Uhm excuse me. How can you possibly be this gorgeous?? This should be illegal
Fabulous. End of.
As it should be 😌
Goals 😻
you are so beautiful handsome gorgeous stunning like words cannot describe your beauty! (i’m not the best with gender neutral terms i’m sorry if this isnt appropriate?)
You are straddling the line so well that I think you've transcended it!
Not gonna lie, kinda jealous. You're absolutely killing it! It's really hard to compliment you because I can't pick between handsome and gorgeous because you're both simultaneously.
Damn, that's a great look right there. Definitely one of the sexiest shaved heads I've seen, that's for sure. I mean, wow! 🔥
Oh boo 🥺💕
Haha I just winged it//thanks babe

Comic I made about how freeing it can feel to be non-binary. You’re perfect, in case you forgot 💜		"This is beautiful! Thanks for sharing. I've been through the same feelings, you know? I wanna grow my hair (but what if I don't pass as male anymore?) I wanna bind with a sports bra (but isn't using a bra a purely female thing?) It's a neverending struggle! And it doesn't need to be. I'm trying to accept myself for who I am and understand that, as a gender fluid NB, sometimes I will be androgynous, sometimes fem, masc, or none. It's just me, baby! Thanks for the good vibes <3
As an AMAB enby this was the breath of fresh air I needed desperately
This comment is more of a discussion of NB-ness in general and not a critique of the comic (which is beautiful) in any way.

It's not that I don't live up to the standards of masculinity in immaterial ways. I am tall, I'm naturally pretty strong, and I grow hair like it's my job. It's that I don't like being categorized by a coin flip that occurred at my conception. I'm not my sexual organs. I'm my own person. I resent that the arbitrary qualities of masculinity should be seen as an ideal, especially with how many of them I find outright repulsive. I reject that everyone should just *know* what's in your pants based on how long your hair is or if you have visible breasts, especially with how binary individuals can be so intrusive and disrespectful whenever it's not clear.

Non-binary identity to me is freedom, but not in a quantitative way. I don't want to ""live up to"" any standards of identity other than my own.
I 100% feel this! I was always a more feminine build, had no facial or body hair overall, and couldn't put muscle in to save my life. I was always content with just me as I was but everyone else had to demean you to some degree because you didn't fit their standard...
I feel this soo hard.  

I never felt like I was a very attractive woman.  And I never really understood why all of these character traits were attached to gender.  

I'm not a strange woman.  

I'm a super hot person.  I'm a fun loving person and a good friend.
#THIS!
Gender is a prison. All your thoughts, feelings, behaviours, as well as your entire body, are evaluated according to gender. 

I've dealt with a couple of transphobic binary trans women in the past few months, so I'm really grateful for your post, OP. It reminds me not all of us demand that people fit into tight, oppressive roles.
image description:

NON-BINARY IS FREEDOM

A person is being wrapped in a measuring tape:

Our culture bombards us with ‘perfect’ standards for men and women and demands that we conform to them.

The person is being restrained by the tape:

I never measured up to society’s standards for masculinity. I just didn't feel like a man.

on the same panel, the things that restrict the person: ""not tall enough, not muscular enough, not aggressive enough""

The person is falling down from and the tape is falling with them, seemingly cut:

It always felt unnatural and fake to try. But being a woman didn't fit either. I've come to see my body as one unbound by binary ideas of gender.

The person is sitting down, we see them from the back and the tape is falling down, they are at peace:

My body doesn't have to be more masculine or feminine. Now I'm just… me. and I am enough.

@ alienby.comics
I love these comics :) and while I'm certain the artist and many others in this sub have already done so, I would highly suggest reading the graphic novel Gender Queer by Maia Kobabe
This is exactly how I feel about being nonbinary, too, except opposite agab.
I love this! So true. It's like being released from a performance that's been going on since before I can remember.
I rock my pretty hair and beard like a champ
Thank you for making a representation of how we struggle from society standards and how we should embrace ourselves 💛🤍💜🖤🥰
YESSSSSSSSSS!!!!!… This. This right here is the shit.
This is beautiful! 💖💖💖
Damn, super relatable
The problem with society is that conformity holds such a strong power over us that we see we were born as one thing and follow the example of others. I was born AFAB, therefore I thought it was necessary to dress a certain way to ""fit in"" and show off my feminine beauty. It wasn't until I was at a school club in college that I just felt like an imposter. Who was I trying to impress? was this something I would have really worn if it wasn't for gender norms? I used to dress fem to impress people and fit in but later on I realized that that simply wasn't who I was. (Don't get me wrong I had already always dressed pretty acrogenously my whole life it wasn't until recently I started to conform to female fashion). It felt like I was lying to myself and I felt like a fake. Now I dress however the fuck I feel like, and I don't care what the world thinks about that! It's ridiculous to have to plan your whole life around your genitals.  You are who you are and neither your sex nor societal roles determine that. Dress how you feel!
Bruh I wish I could fully accept myself lol
Stoooop this is amazing 😭💚💚
For some reason this made me feel more valid
Love this!
This is very close to my experience. Beautiful comic!
This is perfect! Thank Thank for making this
Love it.
Yep, same for me!
Thanks for making this :)
I love this so much.

This made my day to read cccc:

it's beautiful
This is SO how I feel! I always hated gender roles. Thanks for sharing. Love the art style. Thanks for calling me perfect! You too!
Nice take❤️
Plenty of males have long hair. Style it the same as them. It is a different style. You’re nb, you can wear a sports bra too and will anyone notice? Go ahead and be you. Since you’re fluid, you are allowed to do different things at different times.
Breathe deep, friend 💜 glad this helped!
Totally agree! Cis people shouldn’t have to conform to those norms either. They shouldn’t define us
I feel the same way. I want to be my own person, not a ""real man"" (whatever that means).
Yes, beautifully put.
Yes this ^
That’s awesome that you were content. Don’t let them define you. You define yourself!
Heck yes you are 🔥
Fuck yeah you are. I too have never understood that. Gender (as seen by the cis-tem) is just this arbitrary thing forced on us that tries to warp our true selves. People are awesome. I too like being just a 'person.' But personally, I like being strange🌺
thank you op
I love that graphic novel!! Maia Kobabe just followed me on Instagram this morning and I’m flipping out 🤯
😌 you’re welcome! We totally should!
Thank you 🥂
So true!! I’m glad you’ve come to that place of fashion freedom 😌
We all do. It’s a lifelong journey! This is just me on a good day haha

"I'm giving my first national academic presentation tonight since ""coming out"" about both my gender identity and my struggle with my mental health! This is my zoom outfit (the bottom half will obvi be PJs)"		"[deleted]
For all your r/QueerStem nerds hanging around, I'm going to be talking about the molecular mechanism of CBD for mental health disorders. 

I'm going to go over both traditional pharmacology (receptor pharmacodynamics and enzyme inhibition) and a more novel theory that's gaining traction that involves structural modifications of the plasma membrane contributing to receptor pharmacodynamics.

Here's the abstact:

The link between Cannabis sativa and mental health disorders is complicated; both the neurochemical pathology of individual patients and the neuropharmacology of plant extracts are highly variable conditions that are impossible to replicate in the laboratory or across large sample populations in clinical settings. As a result, there is conflicting evidence for Cannabis sativa as both a potential therapeutic and a potential aggravator of mental health disorders including schizophrenia, anxiety, depression, bipolar, and autism spectrum disorder. However, there is theoretical precedence for the efficacy for Cannabis as an antidepressant, anxiolytic, and atypical antipsychotic. The proposed molecular mechanisms for these effects have been investigated in animal and human models from the early conception of endocannabinoid system (ECS) research. More recently, the identification of the biosynthetic and metabolic ECS enzymes have added to these findings. Activation of the ECS by direct interaction with receptors or inhibition of metabolic enzymes has been shown to modulate the serotoninergic and dopaminergic systems – the traditional pharmacological targets for mental health disorders. Furthermore the ECS is a critical regulator of social reward and metabolism, both of which can be contributing factors to mental health disorders. Through synergistic interactions with ECS receptors and enzymes, specific formulations of multiple cannabinoids present in modified hemp extracts were capable of aborting/preventing panic attacks, decreasing baseline anxiety, reducing suicidal ideations, reducing hyperesthesia, and reducing auditory hallucinations in a patient formerly diagnosed with co-morbid mental health disorders. Reported is the detailed methodology for titrating the minimum therapeutic dosage and determining a dose-schedule; and the proposed mechanism for chemodiverse cannabinoid formulations that have increased therapeutic efficacy with decreased risk of negative side effects and abuse potential.

You look very sharp! Best of luck on your presentation, and congrats! ☺👌

You look so happy!! I'm so glad for you :)
absolutely beaming!! you look amazing!!!
Now this is some incredible gender euphoria!!
Hell yes!! Thank you for the bravery and representation!
thats awesome, congrats!! i hope the presentation goes well, im rooting for ya
I really love the outfit. Very sharp and professional. I would really like to dress like that. Is the vest from a men's shop? I always wondered how it would fit me but I never found one in the ladies section.
That is a stunning look. Jealous 😜
wish i had your hands & arms wow
You look stunning! Go knock them dead with your knowledge and experiances!! 🖤🌈🖤
You look great!! Break a leg!
Slay Your Eminence!
You look sick, love the vibe! Fellow academic NB here :) You're pretty damn aspirational.
Late to the party, I just wanted to say your smile made my day! It really is contagious. You seem to be just so honestly happy, I love it.
You look great and also so darn happy!
Aww yay! I'm not really out at work - not universally at least - so it's great to hear it went well! Hope the talk was a smash hit 😄
You look absolutely stunning. Best of luck for the presentation!
You look both so dope and so happy! :D
You sooo pretty! I wish you the best with your mental health and i hooe that all your future endavours go well!
-im dutch so if i fucked up any spelling/grammar im sorry
Fun fact: you're amazing <3

Good to see fellow NB people in academia!
You're awesome!
You're a badass! Thank you for your amazing work
I'm so glad! When I came out to my business partner it went so well that it actually gave me the confidence to have those conversations with my family and then eventually change my pronouns officially professionally... It's funny how a domino effect can be created!
You are so cool. Thank you for doing this amazing and important research for those of us with mental health disorders who use cannabis, and congratulations on your presentation. Thank you for being your authentic self. ❤️
NEAT!
Thank you! I'm such a fan of the vest look, but haven't had anywhere to wear it. Mostly cause I can get away with not wearing a binder, which unfortunately pops my ribs out of place.
Hahaha! I am going to use this joke I like it
Thank you!!
Thank you! I am way happier dressed this way than in a dress and heels (which was my former conference attire).
Thank you for being part of this awesome community! I lurked on here for a really, really long time before I got the courage to come out. This sub is so awesome.
I am pretty sure it’s from a boys section - I’m pretty short so it was advice from this sub to look in boys!
Hey thanks - it's funny, I have hated my arms/shoulders for my entire life and it turns out that it wasn't really about my body, but about the fact that I was rejecting the non-feminine look of my body.. I'm not sure if I'm explaining it well, but when I figured out I was an enby, all of a sudden a significant amount of my body dysmorphia/dysphoria went away.
Yay for fellow NB pushing boundaries in higher ed! Also thank you, I like to think I am ""aspie""-rational as well :)
Thank you! It's been interesting. I am constantly catching myself misgendering myself because it's so ingrained in me especially in formal professional settings. But every time someone gets it right it really makes my day!
Thanks so much for listening and for feedback!
You are very welcome and thank you for your support! I think it’s an important topic because people who struggle with mental health are more vulnerable to negative side effects from any drug... I know there were times in my life when I wasn’t helping myself but was just seeking escape. Then when I learned in depth about the delicate balance of our brains and our ability to use drugs as tools for improving quality of life, perspective, etc, I knew I wanted to try to impart that knowledge to everyone. Because the reality is that people do find relief, but they could also let it get out of hand or perhaps they could improve quality of life even more from just a bit more knowledge!
Thanks! Feel free to AMA cannabis/endocannabinoid system related!
Ooh that's a very good idea. I think I'll steal it, thanks.
yes! because it’s about reclaiming your gender and feeling comfy and confident in it and in that process, redefining your body and how you express yourself in it!

I made a comic about how my religious upbringing kept me from starting my gender identity discovery (TW religious trauma). Can anyone relate?		"“If you’re really non-binary, why didn’t you start questioning your gender a long time ago?” This is a question that I ask myself a lot... and honestly, I think I was in a place where I just couldn’t. Growing up in the church and a conservative religious school environment most of my life, I was always told who I was and was told not to listen to my own thoughts and feelings about who I am. I look back and see this big part of me peeking through in all sorts of places, but it was never allowed to be free. It wasn’t until I left this environment that I was able to connect to myself and be who I want to be, my authentic self✌️
It does sound kinda like a take on comphet :) 

""Of course I'm straight and cisgender, that's what I'm supposed to be, and being any other way would be wicked, and I'm not wicked, and I don't want to be wicked"", thus one can't begin to question their internal feelings because anything else would be ""wrong"".
I think it's funny that in one's 20s is now considered to be a ""late bloomer"" when it comes to figuring these things out, when, a generation before mine (oldest Millennial), 20s was considered either EARLY or on time.

Many people didn't do it until after marriages and children, after decades had gone past, when they just couldn't lie to themselves anymore. 30s, 40s, 50s. (Heck, my bestie is a genderqueer trans woman (different one from the one I mentioned elsewhere in the thread) and she didn't start transitioning until she was in her 60s and was my housemate.)
I didn't figure it out until I was *forty*. Narcissistic father gaslit me into the same feelings. It took me a long time to break my head out of that, and then everything else started falling into place.
I 100% relate to this. I didn't start questioning my gender until I moved out of my house to go to school. I think my body knew it wouldn't have been safe to be myself while living at home. I grew up in the Christian faith as well and my family is unaccepting of my sexuality/gender identity. I like to think of it as my body protecting me. I'm just glad to finally be able to be me :)
OH YES. I **absolutely** would NOT have realized it if I had remained in my religion. And YES it is 100% gaslighting and **HEAVY** denial. My parents would squelch ANYTHING that even remotely stepped into something resembling a thought that they didn't understand. Had a therapist one time notice 15 year old me struggling with identity and feeling trapped and my parents, to this day, think this was a sign he was trying to groom me...instead of, you know, a sign that their child is hurting and needs help.

I fully left my religion 2 years ago, and until June of this year I've been on heavy overtime at work. THE VERY MONTH I got off overtime and could spend time to just **breath** and *feel myself* I started cracking. I stumbled into a video that explained gender in a way I hadn't ever heard and it sparked my curiosity. It didn't even take a week and I knew I wasn't male. A week later and 29 years of pent up gender dysphoria comes crashing into my face (I've felt dysphoria my whole life, but this is the first time I understood it and didn't simply repress it or bury it under a mountain of religious dogma & bigotry). 

Looking back there are SO MANY SIGNS, but there is so much in my life pushing me away from it: the religion I was raised in and the area being so saturated with that made it nearly impossible to FIND MYSELF. I mean, my old religion **very much** denies the existence of anything not in the binary and strongly CONDEMNS any relationship not strictly cis and hetero. 

So yeah, TLDR, I'm 29 and up until VERY recently religion **heavily** buried me underneath its foot and denied MANY parts of my personality and self from existing: especially my gender. 

(rant over...)
Yes I can relate. I didn't really figure out I wasn't cis until I was 24 because of this, even though all the signs were there.
Relatable! I was 40 when I figured it out because I never let myself look inward for anything but sexual orientation. The religious trauma is real. r/exvangelical
[***cries in realizing at 36 during {whatever the last decade has been}***]
I didn't start questioning my gender until I moved out of my mom's house and in with my partner. Extra points because I ended up moving to a different state at the same time. And that's when I started questioning a lot of things. 

When I was a kid, I started questioning whether I was bi. I told my sister and she flipped. I went so far back in the closet, I convinced myself I was straight for years. After I moved in with my partner, and he gave me a safe space to be myself, I accepted that I'm pan and eventually realized I'm nonbinary in my mid 20s. 

I think, besides possibly not being safe, a lot of nonbianry people in particular don't realize they're nonbinary until they're older because most of us don't have anything to compare our experience of gender against. I knew most of my life that something about me was different,  I just didn't have the language or understanding to figure out what.
Damn, I was raised by atheist liberals and it still took me 30 years to even think about it. 23 doesn't seem remotely ""late"" to me.
I think something has to break your faith that the people around you know what's best for you before you can even consider the possibility that you might be trans. The time before that doesn't really count. The clock measuring how long it takes you to question starts running at the moment you're capable of giving fair consideration to the idea, and not a moment before.
I relate, though not because of religious trauma. I grew up in an abusive home with abusive family, and that meant I could really only be myself to an accepted point, and anything beyond that would be dealt with harshly. This not only affected my gender identity - I was stupid enough to bring it up to my mother (who yes had taught me to tell her everything no matter what) who told me the great thing about being a girl is I could dress like a boy and get away with it so I must just want to dress that way. It didn't mean anything else. It also affected knowing I was autistic. The behaviors were always there, but I masked so hard and was so afraid to show those around family who had rebuked me for it, I didn't get diagnosed until 31 years old. I didn't figure out my gender identity until a year before the autism, either, at 30 - I'd shelved it for years as just being GNC but female. 

With both of these, it would have been dangerous to reveal to my family in various ways. But even so, if I had checked in with myself sooner it would have caused me so many less problems. Knowing at this age means it is harder to get HRT, and get treatment for the autism, as on both fronts treatment works best the earlier you get it. All I can do is do the best I can, now, to make up for lost time.
Wow this is beautiful
Oh yeah, now I think about it, I only really questioned my gender and realized I was trans *after* I became an atheist
Absolutely! I was raised catholic by strict, over-protective parents and a grandmother with outdated attitudes. I tried to fit how they wanted me to be and I did what they wanted me to do in life, but that didn't erase all of the times I cried in the shower because I didn't feel like a real woman or the times I sobbed myself to sleep because my body was wrong. I was 35 when I finally connected that feeling to being non-binary.

I had come to terms with my bisexuality much sooner, like as early as high school, but I didn't have a word for it until my early 20s.
This aspect of religion, heck religion in general is just plain sickening. I'm sorry you've had to deal with that religious propaganda shit.
Yes. I always was against the church and openly speak out about it due to the hypocrisy and how against the LGBTQ/POC community.
Hi, how dare you take a thought directly from my brain and turn it into a relatable comic.
I knew when I was young, but I also squashed it and didn't tell anyone until was over 30. I also took in all the masculinity bs and worked super hard to be as masculine as possible. It wasn't good for me and it wasn't good for those around me.
I can so relate to your story! I think many of us have had these barriers! I am glad you have found your true self :)
This is so real. Thanks for making it
100% same, I still fall into doubting myself around family, it's perfectly normal even if it really sucks
I didn't hatch til 44, and this was a large part of the reason why. Proverbs 3.5-6 was one of ""my"" verses that hung over my head for a long time
Very much so,currently in a religion that made a special sermon that denounced each letter of the LGBTQ+
I can relate. I used to be transphobic because of it, too
I live in a very religious state but I stopped believing in the church I grew up in when I was 12. Throughout my teenage years, I questioned my identity, but I stopped myself because I was afraid of what people would think of me if they found out. It was last year that I realized that I’m genderfluid.
Yes yes and yes!!!!!! My parents were not strictly religious, however I went to a church school OF MY OWN VOLITION (I emphasize that bcuz I don't want ppl to think my parents forced me) and they taught me to be scared of God, as well as lots of homophobic+misogynistic ideals. This made me incredibly fearful of being human. It didn't help that my mom didn't like me trying to be masculine in anyway... I'm proud to say I overcame that. Now as a 21 year old, I can proudly say that I'm nonbinary/xenogender. I can be a boy whenever I want to, and I can be a girl whenever I want to. I can be both, and neither all at once. I can feel connected to space and the stars if I wish. I can do whatever the hell I want because it's MY body. No one has the right to dictate what I do with myself.
This comic really captures growing the specific brand of Christian that doesn't let you question anything (let alone gender) so well.

For me it took a solid two years after moving out of my religious family's home to set off the gender crisis. Knowing you're safe now is powerful stuff.
I’m not religious but this is really cool! I’m still figuring myself out but my parents were transphobic and still don’t understand entirely but they try. I keep this part of me walled off to them because you either are a girl or a boy in their opinion, basically
I questioned about once a year, like clockwork. I still didn't figure it out until a year ago, because my questions weren't taken seriously, I was taught that being trans was a terrible choice ans a sin, and that there were only men and women. All because of Christianity.

I effectively had a broken arm and kept being told bones couldn't break.
I also relate and love your comic. I’m newly out in my late 20s and despite being surrounded by nb and trans folks throughout college, it still took years for me to undo the religious upbringing and mindset that kept me closeted for so long, to even myself. 

Not sure where you sit in terms of religion/faith/spirituality, but your comic shares the same name as a song by Semler and I found her music to be especially therapeutic and relatable.
“maybe you weren’t able to come out earlier because your body knew it wasn’t safe” hit different fuck bro. years of trauma, years of maturing and putting myself back together every time i was broken, years of slowly reaching my conservative family that white cishet christians aren’t the only kind of people who deserve respect and basic human decency…. and finally i was safe enough to look inward and find myself
This is so accurate actually, now that I think about it. I've really only began questioning my gender (and orientation) after I became more distant from the church and more exposed to LGBTQ+ knowledge. At the moment the nonbinary spectrum and the bi/pan/omni spectrum are looking mighty appealing.
Your question made me wonder....

Personally, I always knew I was not a ""typical"" representative of my assigned gender. And I agree that religious upbringing or society forces you to pick a box and stay within it or ""else."" 

However, thinking about this more in my case personally ""sex"" and ""gender"" were basically synonymous, so since biologically I was one, I must have been that...when I learned about those two being disassociated from one another it became clear I identified as non-binary. It just fit and was ""right""

For me it was more there not being another choice, than religion or culture. Although, the religious teaching and notion of moral behaviors definitely increased the internal (and external) conflict during the process.
i definitely feel this
I do.
Damn
I'm shook. 
Thank you.
I relate to this so much.  I was raised in a fundie cult.
This is so relatable
This is amazing. Thank you. 🥺
I can relate to this too. 24 when I finally gave space to everything I’d been thinking and feeling
Sadly relatable :(
This is really profound. Thank you for creating this art and sharing it, because I see myself reflected in your experience. Sending you so much love and I hope you have a safe space and community now ❤️❤️❤️
Woahhhhh........
fuckin SAME lol
My partner and I were literally just talking about this today, plus their autism and severe dissociation from family trauma stuff.
Same for me, except 32, and after my mom died as well because she was strict af and I subconsciously knew she wouldn’t accept me.
My experience is very similar
Same, tbh - JW family.
I was like this till by bestie started pointing out inconsistencies with me. I’m glad I figured out myself really early (I’m 17 now) but now I’m depressed cuz I’m not accepted by family. I wish to change how I look but I can’t do that safely or easily due to the fact I still live with them and I’m not old enough or have enough funds to do so. Each day is a pain, but I’m ever grateful I found myself. I always knew something was wrong deep down, I just didn’t know what.
i feel this so hard

college was the first time i had a chance to really explore who i was outside my family and upbringing—i learned so much and some of it hurts but ultimately i am myself now and that’s so valuable
This hits way too close to home
I was in my 30s when the pieces started falling into place for me but I grew up in a home where I was forced to go to church or face punishment until I was 16. People at school called me queer and gay all the time, guess they knew before I did lmao.
30 here! Idk if I would ever have gotten to this point of self-awareness, if my courageous wife hadn’t come out herself just a few years ago. Apparently it was the shock to my system that I needed. I’m a little sad I couldn’t have started figuring this stuff out earlier, but I am also just really grateful that I ended up in such a safe place that I am figuring it out now.
Yeaaaah....

I knew about nb and the rest but never really understood it or thought much about it. I just... assumed I was female because thats what I was told. And like you, my religious upbringing discouraged thinking about it all.

I got a haircut where my head is shaved except the top floof. I felt euphoria and it was incredible and bizarre all at once. I started reflecting and felt maybe I wasn't female.

For awhile, I leaned to the other extreme of wanting to be a male and very masc presenting. I got a binder and looked at packers and everything. Sometimes I still feel like that but its not as often anymore.

For the most part, I don't feel I have a gender. I just... exist. I don't like being perceived as female. I wish I could be seen as androgynous. I often ""jokingly"" say I identify as an art goblin because I'm always in pj pants and a hoodie and often curled in a ball drawing or writing. In reality, I say it because i don't really know what to call me. My friend suggested agender but i haven't looked more into it yet (yay college homework lol)
I grew up very catholic. By the time I found out that I and people like me existed the religious trauma was so ingrained that I was a dirty sinful abomination. That took a lot of time and work to undo and honestly I still question whether I'm ""really non-binary"" or just confused or going through a phase or trying to be different.

It's constant work. Especially when you are still in daily contact with those people (I love my family, they are mostly rad, it makes it somewhat complicated 🤣) but I'm way less confused living as my badass nb self and a whole lot happier.

Thank you for this! Love the comic
Yup, make that 29 for me.
Omg that is me thankyou for making that comic it's amazing
A lot of my childhood was getting told “you don’t want that, that’s for girls”.

I found out 5 months ago that I was, in fact, supposed to be a girl. Still closeted tho.
Literally same. Which flavor of Christianity did you get brainwashed by?
holy fuck this is too relatable
Wow I love this
This is my story exactly. Grew up in church and went to religious school my whole life. Under the surface I always new something was up, but I never believed myself and kept trying to be a good Christian girl. At age 23 I had finally broken down enough of my religious trauma to begin exploring my gender. Now I’m 25 and living as non-binary. It’s still difficult sometimes, but I feel so much happier now. 🖤🤍💜💛
I went to a single sex school and I think that plus my actual gender identity being closest to agender is why I never really questioned it until recently. With hindsight there were signs, but everyone around me was female so obvs I was too and it never came up in day to day life because there was no-one around really to differentiate myself from. But I knew I didn't fit in, and I knew I was an oddball.
Same, love the cómic.
I didn't have the language to question my gender. I'm 38 and grew up in age where it was illegal for staff to even mention queers in school. I was just a bit of a tomboy. In my twenties, I was desperately performing the cis-het woman for the brownie points. 

I only really _felt_ my gender when I put myself in a deliberately gender ambiguous mode to go on a hitchhiking trip, which seemed safer than going as a woman. And I felt so good out of my feminine clothing, I still remember looking at myself in the mirror, like I'd put down a ten tonne weight. I was 34.

By then I had the language to describe the feeling and things started to fall into place. So relieved I don't have to play that old game anymore.
I didn't know till 28. I had an extremely religious family and soon after graduating high school joined a fraternity in college. I live in Idaho also which didn't help either. It wasn't until I decided to leave my family and friends in Idaho that I even considered what gender I wanted to be. I'm 30 now and transitioning was the best idea I've ever had hands down. Though I lament constantly the time it took me to realize I know that for the great majority of my life I never even knew Non-bianary was an option and once I knew I had only fear towards the realization I might be trans. Be kind to your past selves. It's a pretty extreme journey at any age, under any circumstances but your gut will tell you when it's time.
this makes a lot of sense. im trans and also grew up in a religious home, i didnt even think or worry about gender until senior year of high school. i feel robbed of my childhood and what could have been if i couldve just lived the life i wanted and be who i am. your art is beautiful i love it! thank you for this :) <33
I was 34!
Yup, DEFINITELY can relate. I'm 28 and realized 2 years ago, and it's only because the church I'd been a part of had imploded from scandals and the remainder was online only for the pandemic. Because I wasn't constantly stuck with a friendgroup of toxic, bullying men who were 4-10 years older than me, I was finally able to start being myself. It's ironic, though
Yeah I dissociated hard from religion because the people around me didn’t want what was best for the world, only themselves
growing up in a fundamentalist muslim family did that to me. growing up being told i need to be hyper feminine but also being punished for it made for a really good combo. being “highly encouraged” to wear a hijab, and to “embrace modesty” which really means make yourself as small and invisible as possible. that stuff sucks to unlearn
I was about 35-36…
Thank you so much for making this. I’ve never been able to put it into words ♡
Thanks for making this, it really captures my own story/feelings on my own coming out.
I actually needed to read this one today haha. I'm in a similar predicament only truly questioning my gender at 22 and finding out who I want to be. Grew up in a pretty toxic environment caused by both religion and just bad parenting. Gender dysphoria or even just trying to figure out how I wanted to identify were the least of my problems. It's only once I gained independence that I started to realise what those feelings actually meant. The fact that it took so long to realise that I am trans/non-binary always makes me doubt that I am despite all the evidence to the contrary but reading this makes me feel a little more assured in myself. 

Thanks for sharing your experience.
My cousin made a comic similar! I’m proud of them for finding themselves despite their religious upbringing, and I’m proud of you too :)
That sucks. That… oof. Those verses are meant to be seen as “humans can’t know everything, can we?” but so many people turn it into “don’t trust any of your feelings and listen to what *I* have to say because *I* definitely am not falling prey to those exact same vices”
Jesus is the way. You've been deceived
I'm 32 and figured out last year that I'm not cis. I figured out this past Wednesday (it's Friday now) that I'm a trans nonbinary man. I know someone who is 70 and who came out in her 50s. *It's never ""too late"" to figure this stuff out/come out.*

When I was a kid I corrected people who mistook me for a boy. I played with My Little Pony toys and wanted fancy Barbies just like my older sister had. In highschool I really enjoyed full circle skirts (twirling for the win!) and wanted to have corsets. I enjoyed wearing feminine clothes that I looked good in. *How you acted as a kid doesn't always indicate your actual gender.*

In my 20s I had a skirt with more inserts so it was actually beyond ""full circle"" (all the twirls!) and had one corset and one corset dress. Being able to buy my own clothes meant even more clothes that actually looked really good on me, being able to better accentuate my body shape, and being able to move towards being the gothic queen I wanted to be. My goal was to be ""the Lady of the house"" and things that didn't fit just served as proof of where I grew up (like being able to change a tire and not worrying about getting dirty). *Your gender doesn't have to be static, it's ok for it to change.*

Funny aside: but no, I totally can't relate to this /s Seriously tho, it took a long time for me to feel safe enough to accept that I'm not a cis woman, and it took being around people who weren't cis for me to even start questioning things
I have felt from experience that the heart is truly deceitful and wicked... That said, I don't believe my gender identity comes from the heart. I don't know how to explain but... I just am. And I know, personally, that God understands.
I can't relate, I'm actually still Christian, but I am glad you were able to get through it and in touch with yourself. I was a late bloomer because I never met or even knew about trans people until I was in Grad school. At that point I started considering it.
""was already 23""
I wish I was 23, lol
Don't even have to grow up in a religious family to be affected by it. I can't fully relate to being stuck in a religious house, my parents dropped religion when we were small kids and that's a whole different thing. But you could never just be friends with anyone. Then you think you might have a friend only for their parent to tell you, you can't come over anymore because you don't ""act right"" or they only allow their kid to play with kids from their church. I was accused of being gay a lot as kid because I didn't act like my assigned gender. I just wanted to be myself and refused to fake it. It was very lonely for a long time. Didn't have the word for enby until more recently, and no one talks about that to kids growing up so you miss any chance to get to be yourself earlier on
""told who I was...was told not to listen to my own thoughts and feelings about who I am."" I relate to this SO much. Also ""never allowed to be free"" looking back on how restrictive my upbringing was is baffling. 

lol, my brother teases me for being on reddit, but I love hearing stories of others finding themselves. I'm thick in the middle of finding myself too, but it makes me so happy to hear others getting through it.
we have similar stories. I was 27 when I came out. Reflecting back there were signs, but I didn't have the categories or language until I had first moved out of the religious community I grew up in, and as you said, was finally safe and secure enough.
Forgive me if this isn’t exactly the same. But, at the age of 51 I have finally come out to my councilor that I am Bisexual. Throughout my life I hated myself. I hid my feelings. And your illustrations basically answered to me again why I hid my true feelings. I want to thank you for creating this. This may help me when I try to explain to my friends why I have decided to come out now.
As someone who was sent to a Calvinist school from primary school to high school diploma, I know how this feels. I also had the feeling that something ""isn't right"", that I wasn't ""supposed to"" feel this way. And now that I've been outta there for 3 years, almost 4, I could finally start asking questions to myself and think about what I really feel, like ""Why do I not feel like the gender I was assigned at birth?"" ""Why do I have butterflies in my stomach when a classmate is nice to me, regardless of gender?"" And what these answers showed me other than why I feel this way is that I am actually not alone. And now that I think back to everything I did and was told as a  childhood story, it all clicked. It all checked out. The signs were there this whole time and everyone played it off as child being adventurous or kids will be kids.
I had a similar situation, but less tied to religion. When I was much younger, I used to stim a lot, and hyperfixate/obsess over things I found interesting. Over time I’ve inadvertently masked it so much, that I can barely connect with that part of myself anymore. I want it to be free, but rather than society or religion being the culprit, it’s me keeping it bound. Sure, it was society who influenced it (the dirty looks when I stimmed, the hateful comments when I acted “weird”) but now that I’m an adult I shouldn’t have that pressure. It’s hard to let yourself be free after so long of being tied up.
I relate to this so much! Thanks for sharing.
I came out in my 30s. Because I was independent, and in the safety of that independence, I felt safe finding myself.
Absolutely. Comphet doesn't only come in that religious flavor of ""you're going to hell, if ..."", but also in a vague, general way of society showing you every day that there's cis-het-allo and nothing else. My parents are pretty accepting, but that constant low level societal background noise of ""you're a boy, boys grow into men, men marry women"" is enough to block out questions. At least I think that's the main reason why I only started actively thinking about my sexuality in my 20s and about gender in my 30s.
This exactly.

In my personal experience, this also tied together with repressed sexuality which overcompensated into hypersexuality. While I've moved past that stage, I still feel uncomfortable coming out, especially to my parents.
Thanks for sharing that! That’s good to know. For me that’s how it felt, but I know that’s not the case. I know there’s no real timeline to how this stuff happens, everyone finds out in their own time!
I feel that too (youngest millennial crowd). It was not at all the norm for kids or teens to be out when I was growing up. I usually just hear cis folks say that they expect you to have ""signs"" from your childhood, not necessarily that you should have been out.
Yea in the UK we had section 28, which meant we couldn't learn about all the variations of Queer as it was banned in school, because of that underrepresented in media. So there's people in their late 20s-30s upwards who just didn't know certain labels existed / were possible.

But woop for working it out against the odds 💜
As a younger millennial, same. All the signs were absolutely there for me from a young age, but I didn't start figuring it out until my late 20s, simply because I had no idea anything beyond the binary existed. And my parents are atheist and pretty accepting. No age is too late to start questioning and exploring your gender, but I'm really glad that so many more young people are getting access to the words they need to describe themselves.

When I started to question, I had a lot of doubts that I was a ""real"" NB person, so I'll tell you what my older genderqueer friend told me at the time: if you feel that way, and you want to call yourself that, you are. Your opinion on that is the only one that matters.
Yes, I was going to say, I had the same problem but because of familial gaslighting (with a touch of church) because I'm disabled & have psychiatric challenges, and they basically taught me I couldn't trust myself, I had to just believe them (or anyone else who wasn't me) on everything because I was """"""crazy"""""" and """"""wasn't thinking straight"""""".
Yeah I figured it out at 38. 

Really bad religious trauma from growing up super conservative town and family. Wasn’t safe. 

The mind is funny, when it’s trying to protect you like this. I was literally driving across town every morning to go to this one Starbucks that had this like 30 year old punk emo guy. He was super pretty, wore eye shadow and girl jeans. He was gorgeous. I wanted to both be him and be with him. Then I’d drive off and it was like snow on warm pavement. Poof! Totally straight. 

Until I bolted upright at two am when I finally got therapy for the abuse and was like ‘holy fuck I repressed all this!’
Yeah, I’m 36 and just recently came out. I’ve been questioning for about a year, but looking back, I realize I’ve thought about it since I was a kid, but I didn’t have the terminology back then.
[deleted]
30 here! Turns out it’s still worth it.
Thank you so much for sharing! I def think we had some similar experiences ❤️ glad you’re in a better place now
^(Disclaimer: I'm speaking only of my personal experience and not condemning religion as a whole...ok, disclaimer over.)
Yeah I think I had this idea that you’re just supposed to know since adolescence, but I know that’s just untrue in many cases
Yes. This all the way. Without an external trigger I would have gone my whole life assuming I was cis. It took me just over three years from that moment of “awakening” to start questioning. It’s hard for me to even count the “before” time until that point.
Thank you!
Christianity is not a monolith and there's absolutely denominations (or groups within a denomination) that hardcore SUPPORT the LGBTQ/POC communities and are working hard for justice. (Example: I have a friend who's a genderqueer trans woman. She's a minister in the United Church of Christ. Absolutely out and proud at work (a chaplain to a troubled youth home as well as leads a congregation) and to the denomination, and they support her. She doesn't pass (doesn't necessarily want to) and she wears dresses to work and the whole nine yards.)

Not saying your pain is invalid at all (I've got my pain from it, but mine's more about the ableism I experienced), or you shouldn't call out bullshit where there's bullshit (because there's definitely a lot, and it absolutely should be called out), but a lot of people see one part of Christianity (esp. Evangelical Christianity) (whether from the outside or from their own experiences) and extrapolate/act like it's all like that, when it absolutely covers a vast, VAST range of beliefs and actions. (For example, compare Evangelical Protestantism with Roman Catholicism with the Religious Society of Friends/Quakers. Not that RC is spotless by any means, but it's very different from Evangelical Protestantism.)

And there's a lot of people who really hurt because they think they have to choose between their faith and their gender/orientation, and it harms them when we act like they're all the same and they're not exposed to the fact that they don't have to choose, that it's not ALL like that, that there's options. That they can be whatever faith they are AND LGBTQIA+. I'm glad that's an option.

FWIW, I'm not even a Christian (anymore), or from one of the ones who's really good about LGBTQ. I just think it's important to be fair about these things, ESPECIALLY if they haven't been fair to/about us.
;)
It really sucks when people don't know the true meaning of ""fear God"" and use it to scare people ☹️
Thank you for sharing ❤️ sounds like you had a very similar experience! And I’ll have to check that artist out!!
Thank you so much! I appreciate that a lot. Glad you were able to connect with this!
Autistim, queerness, and religious trauma is a rough combo, I know 😅
I’m sorry they went through that.
Sending hugs ❤️❤️❤️ there’s really no easy time to come out... I hope you can find support in others and confidence in your own identity!
Thank you for sharing that ❤️❤️ I totally get where you’re coming from. Ugh, it’s so much stuff to work through. (I’m really glad I’m seeing a therapist about it all) I’m glad you have some more clarity and happiness about your gender now!!
13 years of a very evangelical non-denominational Protestant school (K-12), 8 years of Presbyterian church followed by 10 years of free Methodist church, and 4 years of Nazarene university. So, quite a cocktail 😅 hbu?
Awesome!! 💙
Thank you for sharing. I actually have been thinking about making a comic about just that—being kind to your past selves. It can be really hard sometimes! Def something I’ve been talking with my therapist about.
Isn’t it strange how common scandals are? I’ve seen 4 pastors in my lifetime leave church and/or school because of abuse of power (3 of which were sexual) and that’s just my own church experience! Why is this so normal? 
Glad you got out too:
That sounds really hard ❤️ I hope you’ve found freedom in where you are now!
I’d love to see it! Please dm me the details of their art :)
Yes, I would agree. Sadly, so many teachers, pastors, and other people of influence in my life growing up twisted and manipulated verses of the Bible out of context to say whatever they wanted it to say. Most of what I grew up hearing I don’t actually believe is consistent with the Bible’s teachings. However, I am no longer a Christian so I leave those arguments for other people to make.
That’s awesome! Glad you’ve been on that journey of self discovery
That’s amazing!! I’m also bisexual, and it wasn’t an easy revelation by any means. I’m so glad my art resonated with you in such a big way ❤️❤️❤️
Yeah, I'm 40 years old in the USA (grew up in rural Pennsylvania) and we definitely didn't learn ANYTHING about LGBTQ+ stuff in school, either public or parochial/Catholic.
Yeah, part of my problem has always been the right words (or words closer to right) weren't in high usage yet so I didn't know about them. This is why I personally identified as bigender, and then genderfluid, and then eventually nonbinary. Because nonbinary didn't ""exist"" when I started questioning. It wouldn't really exist for another decade. (I have an enby friend who's literally my age who had the same experience... identified as butch for a long time (like over a decade) but it wasn't quite right for them. The discovery & availability of the word ""nonbinary"" changed their life.)

(And, I don't remember if anyone remembers this or not, but back in the day (mid-2000s), at least where I was, genderqueer (which did exist) had such a specific look and overall vibe with it that it kept some people from using it. I always said when I tried to dress genderqueer that I just looked mismatched and wasn't able to pull it off.)

I remember the day I found genderfluid in a book at my work (I worked at an LGBT bookstore at the time) and I remember saying to my coworkers ""I just found the word for my gender"".

But, yeah, I don't think enough people talk about what it's like when the word for your gender doesn't even EXIST yet. It's SO much better now with all of these new labels.
Sorry, didn’t mean to make you feel behind or excluded! Just an expression of how I’ve been feeling
Lol, it took me until 18 just to come to terms with the fact that I liked guys. My brain is a labyrinth of contradictions and denial.
Oh I know. But I’ve been abused so much by my parents beliefs that it’s to the point where I dislike most denominations.
I’m aware, and I have several friends who are queer affirming Christians. I struggled for a while trying to hold onto my faith, but was unable to. I’ve just been hurt and controlled too much by the church to go back, even to an affirming place. And I’ve been so hardwired to be anti-lgbt by my religious upbringing that being religious AND queer just felt wrong, like trying to push two same-side magnets together. I envy those who are able to hold onto both when I couldn’t!
It's seriously such an intense combo. But im so thankful they have access to therapy now, and a validating therapist they trust. I had no idea what all went into it until we talked about it today. I can never relate bc even tho I grew up in a church, I was not indoctrinated as deeply as they were. And the way they used religion to mask their autism for so long, it's just fucking insane. I feel like we need one of those giant conspiracy boards with the red lines going everywhere.
Ohhh a specificly strict evangelical style split from old Mormonism before Mr Smith started marrying minors called the church of christ
...How in-depth of a response do you want to that? Cause I'm prepped and ready with my personal take, but I also understand if that was meant to be a rhetorical question
Were it not for having that friend I mentioned before, I would probably be in the same camp as you, in the sense of believing that the Bible is being misinterpreted but not wanting to be in the discussion anymore. It’s only cuz of her that I still feel like I have some “chips in play” with the idea of Christianity despite growing apart from my own family and upbringing (which thankfully was a lot more… tame than this)
Catholic school since 5yo so yea the odds were against us (I'm 37 now).
One thing's for sure, the world sure has changed since I was in *my* twenties.
Mood
even denominations aren’t monolithic! american christianity can be a hell of a drug for some people who care more about rugged individualism than community, but there are people in every domination that are more like you than different. i’m a nonbinary lesbian *and* a catholic. i understand the harm the institutional church has done/continues to do in ways and there’s no denying many catholics still hold problematic views on gender, abortion, etc that should be called out and challenged. but i hope people who do feel connection to religion or spiritual expression know that there *is* room for you in the traditions that speak to you and there are people like me who want to help make that room. 

i’m deeply sorry to you and everyone else in this thread who were hurt and made to feel lesser because of religion, but i promise that each and every one of you is *divine* no matter what hateful bigots say.
Oh, I wasn't replying to you, I was replying to Loki'sStray. I don't want you to think you have to justify yourself at all, OP. (I really love your comic, btw.)

But yeah, that happens to a lot of folks. The pain is HELLA real. Some folks eventually make (some) peace with it and decide they want to find their way back in some capacity, either fully, or just for parts they miss. Other folks, that's not the case & have no desire to. Both are a-ok. 👍
Share away!
I thought I was in /r/exvangelical , and nothing about this comment made sense until I realized my error.
I think there are several coinciding factors that make pastors more likely to commit abuse.

The first has to do with church attendees and evangelism. Contemporary evangelism is often directed towards people in vulnerable emotional situations as a way for them to gain relief from their pain or circumstances. This biases congregations towards those already in or escaping from abusive relationships.

The second has to do with the culture of contemporary churches. A majority of churches in the US have been slowly leaning towards fundamentalist teachings. This drift seems to stem from a few places (especially right-wing politics), but it consistently reinforces patriarchal and authoritarian hierarchies under the guise of traditional, righteous dogma. I doubt I need to explain why that kind of hierarchy makes abuse and coverups easier, but let me know.

The third has to do with the requirements for being a pastor. Generally speaking, they need to be charismatic, approachable, and invested in maintaining the traditions and culture of a church. That combination makes for pastors who are likely to continue and reinforce abusive cultural practices from the previous pastor, even if unintentionally. With that said, I think many who seek that kind of authoritarian power over a congregation are already abusers or are easily swayed into abusive acts.

Considering all these factors, it's a wonder that so few church scandals have even come to light, in my opinion. Traditional American Evangelicalism is ripe with the intersectionality required foe abuse.
Incredibly insightful. Thanks for sharing this. You’re so so right."	xmad4k	NonBinary	2504	1.0	2022-09-23 21:50:49

Happy Tuesday, fellow gender explorers xx		"Gorgeous! I love that necklace
You look fantastic!!! Love the matching jewelry/top! 😍
[deleted]
I love the term gender explorers! It makes me feel like a dashing adventurer!

That necklace looks great on you! It brings out your eyes. ❤
You officially own the color red, it looks so good on you!!
The eyebrows are \*perfection\*. <3
Gendernauts
You look great! Love the red 💗
How are you so goals?

Can you like, adopt me and be my parent or something🥺😭
The colour suits you! You look lovely!!
you are so groovy
I love the term gender explorer
Amazing look! And your eyebrows are mad sleek
Gender explorer is such an amazing term xD
[removed]
That pattern looks great on you!
You a happy tuesday too! Looking gorgeous 😍 love your style
You are stunning!!! With the jewlery matching the top and everything i love it
Hello, darling! You are looking lovely today ❤️
I have some beads like the ones on your necklace laying around! I think one is being used as a fake ruby in a display in my room. 

Edit: The ones I have are more faceted though.
You look so fabulous! I love that term “gender explorers” lol
You look both delighted and delightful!
You have such a delightfully devious look here. Love the jewelry!
That outfit is absolutely gorgeous! I aspire to that level of style!
I really love that shirt!!
Your eyebrows are EVERYTHING.
You make me think of Jason Isaacs. I think it's the smile. You look smashing!
You look fierce!!!
The necklace really ties the whole look together.
Thanks! I like me a chunky necklace (this one was pinched from Mrs peaceful ferret 😁)
Thanks....I liked it so much I pinched it off my other half 😆
Thank you! Amazing actual science fact: it takes more muscles to run a marathon than it does to smile. So just smile, and don't run a marathon.
Thanks so much! It's nice to make us feel more adventurous. Someone on here coined 'gender spelunkers' which is awesome, with the bonus of sounding rude even though it isn't. 😁
Thanks so much!
Thanks so much! I haven't had them done for a while as we are in lockdown in the UK. I've been trying to tend them myself like a big boy. 🤣
Amazing, I'm using that!
Oh, thank you! It felt like a reddy pink kind of day 😁
Haha! Well I'm sure we would be able to arrange weekend custody access 😆. I don't think my own kids think I am so goals, probably because they actually know me!
Thank you...I think liver is my colour!
Groovy baby, like austin powers!
Me too!
Thanks so much! I'm kind of used to them now, but they used to be such a massive monobrow 😁
Thanks so much, have a great day yourself!
Fanks! 😁
Thank you!
Thanks a lot Donald, I hope you are enjoying your retirement, even though melania is about to divorce you 😁
Well, that's very kind...have a lovely day xx
He has pinched my necklace. He is very naughty. But we don't really mind because we all love him. He is a beautiful person and a super kind soul with a lovely smile
Shock and awe, baby 🤣
You are spot on, I am very devious! 🤣
Well, thank you so much!
Thanks so much! I'm not telling where its from, but if you follow drag race uk, ru's explosion at joe black will give you a clue! If that's over your head, I'm sorry 😁
Thanks so much....I wish you could have seen the old bushy version for comparison!
Thats very kind! Malfoy 😆
Grrrrrrrr. Thanks!
Thanks so much, it's nice to have an other half you can pinch from!
Mission accomplished. Excellent arch!
A monobrow is definitely a statement 😂
Lmaooo im not the real one my Brothers pickwd it as a joke, i dont think trump would support us enbies
You too! x
Hear that! My partner is a master lacquerista (since quarantine at least). Helps me stay pretty vs. my heavy hands.
A tribrow if you will...but those days are gone!
Whaaat? I was so sure Trump would spend his post twitter days browsing trans and non binary sub reddits, posting kind words of peace and understanding.  He always seems such a kind and gentle soul 🤣
Brilliant! The couple that manicures together, stays together 😁
Yes definetly. So respective towards women. He would definetly support lgbtq+ people and treat dark skinned people the same. Just like how he did NOT called up the trumpets to storm the capitol 😂😂😂. Such a good person."	ll2sum	NonBinary	2465	1.0	2021-02-16 12:28:27

Aww your smile is soo contagious!
is that a tattoo on your leg i see?? 👀✨ what's it of, a teabag??? what's your meaning behind it?? (i'm sorry if i seem overwhelming, i'm just curious lol) please don't feel like you have to answer, if you're uncomfy abt the questions, don't worry abt it, just pls reply to my comment if you're all g w/ answering my questions <33
This! I'll spend my free award on this op! 💗🥰💗🥰💗
Actually very pog.
Its new and you can see the wrinkles, the clips are just there to straighten it out ^^
If you mean my hair, the dye is from directions and its called flamingo, although its far from the flamingos I know
And it even makes total sense if you ask me ^^
Try to be the most honest version of yourself and you will get something similiar charismatic, it will probably look different but still amazing :)
The skirt is from seven sisters, bought at WE fashion :)
The skirt is from seven sisters, bought at WE fashion and the coat is from a second hand store, believe it or not it was actually free
Thank you :)
Oh that's smart
Ironic you want the flag to straighten out
There exists an inexpensive appliance that was specifically designed to do just that (get creases out of clothes/fabrics) and much quicker 😆

Clips seem like they'd take ages to achieve that, if it even works (I'm imagining they'd work somewhat, but not completely). I thought they were to weight it down to stop it flapping about so much for general movement past it which is a neat idea
I was referring to both the hair and the exact shade lol.
You got a point though
I guess I could iron it, but that seems like much more work, plus it is somehow satisfying to see the flag straighten out over time haha
Ah that's fair enough lol! 

I do like how the clips all match each other, looks like tassles at first glance, and that is pleasing to see, looks nice as well as serving a purpose!"	sp950t	NonBinary	2453	0.99	2022-02-10 15:27:37

jokes aside u look great and i LOVE your vibes!!
UGH gender envy!!!  
You look so handsome, and I love that vest!

You look swashbuckling!

Wow wow wow....love your style, so beautiful!
Binder always!!!! Makes me feel out of this world !! U look smashing
Everytime I see facial hair coupled with makeup, I just adore it! I wish more people did this, whether nonbinary or no.
Can I ask for advice on the tinting lip hair thing? I've tried a few things and it seems to go wrong for me

You look great though, super gender look XD
You look SO BEAUTIFUL OH MY GAWD
And why in the world would you do that?
Oh yeah, cause YOU LOOK FUCKING AMAZING! 👏🏽☺️

how does one learn this power
omg thank you so much 😭
thank you so much! i have been feeling soooo dysphoric recently so that rly means a lot 🥰 i’ve never been called handsome before!!
I’m not kidding this is the nicest compliment I’ve ever received. I legitimately teared up. So, so affirming. Thank you so much :’)
that is a first!! i love it 🥰 thank you!
i used “just for men” beard dye to tint initially. i use it on my eyebrows too! it stains your lip easily though so be careful (i learned the hard way 🥲). after i used the nyx brow gel to thicken the hairs a bit!
thank you! 🥰
thank you! 💐
thank you 🥺
thank you so much! 🥰💐
omg just looked at your profile, your style is also impeccable!! very cute and handsome 🥰
yes!!! it really is the best :’)
thank you so much! right though?? i always love it too but thought i wouldn’t be able to pull it off. so happy i tried, never going back!!
Thank you! This is my first time doing it and I definitely stained my upper lip pretty intensely. After quite a bit of scrubbing and some eyebrow gel this is what I achieved. I used “just for men” beard dye to darken the hair and I have a nyx brow gel that I used to create more fullness. Did you have any specific questions?
thank you so much!!! ❤️❤️
i’m blushing thank you 🥰
thank you so much! 🌷
your support is giving me life!! thank you 🥰
ignore my initial response, got the reference now!! LOVE THAT thank you 🙏
I adore you!!! Thank you ❤️
thank you! truly ftw, nothing beats it 🥰
thank you so much 🫂
I had that issue as well 😭 Still figuring it out but I found that after I was able to remove the stain I was able to achieve a more defined look by using some brow gel! I used the nyx brow gel specifically but I’m sure any brow gel would do!
Are you lost?
you seem to be the only one who thinks that 🤷‍♀️
You are so more than welcome, you deserve it!

You should be called handsome everyday, cause you are ✨
Any tricks to not stain your skin with it?
Always
Aw, thank you 🥰
Is the dye long lasting? I'm not really in a situation where I can have visibly darker lip hair. But thank you for your response~
You are welcome!!!!!
Great job being yourself!
Ahahaha I didn't see it so no worries C: 

Have a good day
[removed]
not yet, unfortunately! i actually did it for the first time today in an effort to combat my dysphoria. my hair is super fine so i don’t know if it’s possible to avoid the staining 🤷‍♀️ i could have also kept the dye on too long because i was excited and wanted to make sure it showed up :’)
For something temporary I’d recommend trying a tinted eyebrow gel ☺️ It will add darkness and definition without the commitment. I hope that helps!
It is a tint so it will last a while!
hahaha i was asking if you meant an actual sea hawk because the reference initially went over my head 🥲
unsure of why you think your opinion matters in a sub clearly not meant for you ☺️
Thanks!  I never thought of dying lip hair before but I kinda want to try it now!
Thank you!"	osq8dh	NonBinary	2463	1.0	2021-07-27 16:30:07

it’s more optional than most ppl make it out to be :)
aw thanks y’all!!
It looks great!
Underrated lol
Ok, ngl (again), I wasn’t \*entirely\* convinced before, but i am now.
I would if I had hair on the top of my head XD
👀*wow*
Ohhh Oki thank you! How do you get your hsir so wavy though its majestic and I must master it
heck yea! it's the laces too. totally reminding me of old boxing stuff
Yeah, I mean, Im a gender abolitionist (as in, I think the idea of having names with specific attributed characteristics and roles does more harm than good) but for some reason in my mind its as if for now, even NBs have gender. I guess I see gender as something that society sees in you, rather than something one assumes... which is kinda true but I also think one’s self identity is valid an important.
Bottom line, I’m a gender abolitionist but discussing gender is interesting af. Its like this real life lore ahah
i don’t rly do anything to it, it just looks like that haha
totally with you! yeah, certainly on a societal level it feels a lot more inescapable. gotta do what we can i suppose!

Not sure where I fit on the gender spectrum anymore. Got my first fishnets and I’m feeling cute.		"Big sweater and fishnets is such a *chefkiss* combination I swear, looks good on everyone. (A con is that you'll prolly always feel like you are showing too much butt should one decide to go out in public like that. Catch me patting my ass every five minutes just to see if it hasn't risen up too high)
Really hoping to make friends I can talk to about all of this. I just feel so confused recently in my self discovery.
This is a brilliant outfit, you look both cute and cool
You look mad cute!! & you don't have to have a name for what your enbyness is, we all welcome you anyway
Dayum! Thick thighs, sib!
Yes! Adorable! Gender is a construct!
Hot damn do more people of all genders and gender expressions need to wear fishnets. Glad you’re feeling cute because you are cute.
you’re looking cute!!! i love your outfit so much oh my goodness
Not sure is a-ok! It can be a lot of fun to explore with clothing and accessories, like your super sexy fishnets. Personally I love a big cozy sweater with a pair of super short cutoffs and tights or fishnets on all genders. Add some sassy boots and I am swooning, lol.
you look really cool! thanks for sharing😄
Nice modular in the background, too ~~ 🤘
Fishnets are fun. Enjoy!
Love that sweater on you!!!
hold on is this a photo of me from the future??
Not that the fishnets aren't great but I'm coveting the knitwear tbh
I love this!!! Welcome <3
You’re! so cuuutttee!!!!
go easy on yourself. it’s ok to not be sure where you stand on the spectrum and i feel like pinpointing it isn’t that necessary for us nb people.
Pretty sure cute is a gender
Wherever you are on the spectrum, you. Are. Adorable!!!
Gender is a social construct, and fuck social constructs. You are you, that's all that matters!
love this outfit, really suits the style of your glasses too
Before scrolling down fully, I thought you were talking about the sweater, and I was wondering how to break it to you that that sweater is not what would be considered fishnet. 

But that is a *fantastic* look
You look so good!!! Omg!!
You could kill homophobes with those legs just one  cachow and you poked thier eyes out
Killing it. That’s an amazing look!
Oh my god!!! So adorable😭😭😍
Looking super cute too!!!!!!! ✨💖
looking so cool and comfortable. proud of you friend💓
tbh just as a pattern combo this outfit is it
this is such a fantastic look. i like your sweater & your face
you look mad rad!
Ooooh yes
being cute\* not just feeling cute
Yoooo that's a look 👀
you're the cutest!

welcome to the wonderful world of gender variance! exploring your gender identity can be magical :)
Looking fabulous darling!
If you’re looking for something to wear under might I recommend some shorts and stocking w the fishnets? Even tho the löök is already 💋👌 for me personally
Giant sweaters are the best
I wish I could look this good with a beard, lol
HELL yeah
You are absolutely rocking this fit! You, my fine human, are very good looking!
Yesssssss
I stan this whole picture
You are certainly a CATCH in those fishnets!

Also, please take your journey at your own pace, and congrats for being self-aware enough to start it. Yay for you!
ur super cute!!! that sweater looks great on u :)
Loving those fishnets!
Can we please be BFFs because I’m literally in the same position
oh my gosh 😍
You are super cute!
A whole mood
i adore that combo. need it in my life
this is suuuch a look
Niceeee. It suits you really well.
Adorable!
 You do be cute
Okay cute af but let’s talk about that gear in the background. Modular synths?
Adding fishnets to the list of cute things to buy once the checks start coming in from my new job
Do ittttt and share!
It’s such a beautiful experience. It’s like having a living creature in your studio. My entire perspective on electricity as a life force changed after getting into modular. Sometimes it really does feel spiritual.
<3
Goodwill sweater shopping! :)
I don’t think I’d be comfortable going out in it. I would like to find some way to go out comfortably in fish nets while also remaining stylish though. I’ve got some tight black short shorts that I do now, but I feel like a jogger in them. Lol
Honestly I came here to say this. OP you are crushing the fishnets-sweater vibes.
What? You're into Synths, NIN and Fishnets? I feel like we're friends already! PM me anytime
Ik it's not the same as having someone close to talk to (both in knowledge and distance), but if you ever wanna share your feelings/talk with a kindred spirit feel free to pm me! I'm slow to respond but still love to talk gender :)
Feel free to PM me(about whatever, doesnt have to be gender)!  Open to making friends(I'm a  hermit tho 🤣)
just so u know, my dms are open :) you don't have to know where you are on the gender spectrum as long as you just feel comfortable with yourself. you can always just say you're queer ✨
Thank you. I’m currently in the process of a wardrobe overhaul.
Thank you so much <3
:) Thanks!
I’m noticing that more and more the older I get. Absolutely agree.
<333
You’re cuter ^___^ Thank you so much!!!
I do have some sassy red boots. Sassy black boots are high on my list right now.
:O I was wondering if anyone would know what it was <3
Yes, and be prepared to be very socially anxious.
Thank you so so much. Y’all are too kind. <3
Thanks. The support I’ve gotten from you all is so kind and helpful.
<33333 Thank you. Every beard is special. I say give it a go!
Thank you so much 🖤
Thank you very much <3 This picture stan you.
Of course DM me! :)
Haha. Yeah. It’s a eurorack system.
Ripped jeans/pants. Wear em underneath. Get different colors too. 💕🥰
I was thinking maybe add leg warmers? That way it breaks up the fishnets a little more. This look seems so unique to you and I LOVE that. Keep rocking it 🥰
Same! I love synths and am also pretty new to all of this.
I feel that! Goodwill is a gift to this world. Also I have to agree, this is a good look
already there 👉😎👉
Uhg, I wish but way too much dysphoria. I want to to be able to stealth one day.
Talk nerdy to me baby.
Thanks for the recommendation!
That’s also a good idea! I shall look into leg warmer options.
I just got done patching various LFOs into my E352 FM and wavetable parameters, all of which was being mixed by my Maths V2, and ran that through a morgasmatron dual filter, one on high pass, one on low pass, then I took the mix output and put it into a mixer with attenuators being cv controlled by my pingable envelope generator, all of which is running through a 16 step tap sequencer delay module.
If you’re comfy with it, please show the outfit when you get leg warmers :)
Being that the only analog elements in my studio are cables and mics, this tickles my fancy so much. I have a lot of respect for people who use analog synths. It’s not easy and what you record is what you record."	i81h4m	NonBinary	2458	1.0	2020-08-11 22:18:23

"The ""what gender do you assume I am?"" posts NEED TO STOP!"	"I get some of yall are looking for some form of validation, but for most of us, these posts are triggering (not to mention they are generally harmful to the poster, essentially a form of gender-""checking"", similar to people with eating disorders who ""check"" themselves). Like, we're on the nonbonary subreddit for Talos sake, most of us come here to escape gender binary bullshit/assuming genders, etc etc etc. Like, why don't yall just make your own subreddit at this point instead of flooding this sub with those posts? Cause yeah, it feels like those sort of posts are all I see from this subreddit on my feed anymore. And for those that just want to post a picture of themselves and get compliments...THATS NOT A BAD THING! Just post your pic and go without the call for other people to assume/check your gender.

EDIT: Mods, look at the numbers on this post, look at the comments. It's time to actually do something about this issue."	"I agree with you, the only way I can assume anyone's gender is by binary standards (unless there's a pride flag in the pic or something), and I'm trying to unlearn those instead of enforcing them. I can either answer with the binary gender my brain automatically categorizes the poster in (again, trying to unlearn that) and thereby probably misgender them, or I can choose the opposite binary gender of that, which 1. Would be dishonest, 2. is making the assumption that they will like that 3. Is enforcing binary standards and 4. Probably still misgenders them, or I can just make a random guess (because really you can't tell someone's gender by how the look) which is just kinda pointless. So yeah, not a fan at all. 
For people who feel like they really need to know if they pass as whatever, there's a transpassing subreddit.
Other subreddits have a rule against ""gender guessing"" posts. This subreddit should have a similar rule.
Yeah, I just feel like they perpetuate the idea that genders are supposed to “look” a certain way and I’m tired of that. The truth is you can’t tell someone’s gender just by looking at them.
Yeah, as someone who's masc-leaning in gender and femme leaning in presentation, those posts really kind of get to me. It's like ""Oh. Okay. So we're going with the ""nonbinary people have to be androgynous/confusing"" thing? Great. Just ducky.""  

I struggle so, so much with how I look, because I get misgendered because of my presentation, and worse, I'm misgendered as my birth gender. I hate it. And those posts are just a reminder that I will never be ""acceptably"" nonbinary. I get that it can be validating, but this isn't the place for it because it really is triggering for a lot of us. Please stop the ""gender-check"" posts. For those of us who it hurts, please just stop.
also lets be real no matter what the person looks like not a single soul here will say anything but androgynous so it’s a pointless post anyway
Right? This is the same line of thinking as someone asking ""Do you think I'm fat?"". I am NOT playing that game.
To me, those questions are always uncomfortable to ask, because I don't know what the person is expecting. What if I say something they didnt want to hear and I'm just gonna make them feel worse?
Yep! I don't care for them at all. Some people look lovely and I'm more than happy to support people when they're feeling good about their appearance but if you're outside the binary who cares?

Also sometimes it feels a little bit like braggadocio.
AGREED!! This question belongs FAR from the non binary subreddit
It’s extremely triggering for me to see these on my home page. It feels very invalidating to who I am & what I look like when other folks in our community are still insisting that gender has a “look”, and is the antithesis to what we should be fighting for— wide-scale acceptance that appearance =/= gender, and it isn’t a fucking binary or 3-category “middle”.
I completely agree with this. It's not possible to assume any gender, given that you are in any sense gender-aware. My reply would have to be 'I don't make assumptions', especially given that any simple assumption about my own gender based on my appearance would be depressingly wrong.
Honestly, couldn't agree more, every time I've seen one of these types of posts I've wanted to type ""none because I don't assume gender"" but it got to the point where whenever I come on Reddit I see a new one, the sub description is ""for people of every stripe who feel that they don't fit into a preference-binary or gender-binary culture."" if you want to have a face full of makeup and a beard and you ID as non-binary then you go do that, checking your gender imo shouldn't be the focus here, it should be positivity no matter what you look like, and just to finish off, passing is subjective having been on HRT for nearly 10 years and been in the LGBTQ community for much longer than that I still couldn't tell for 100% that I could clock every trans or enby person and get their assigned sex at birth correct, you could be the most trans femme person in the world and someone could still clock you, focus less on passing and more on embracing the parts of yourself  that you love, cos it doesn't matter what some joe nobody thinks for the 5 seconds their are in your life as you pass them on the street, and online even less
Yea I don’t get why they’d like their gender to be assumed. Especially in a non-binary subreddit, like, we’re all just gonna see u as u
Mod team will review this issue
while some ""what name do i look like"" posts are kinda coming from a genuine place, others are def this kinda post with an extra step.
I agree! I hate seeing them and every time I refuse to click on the post. I don't want to guess your agab or anything based on looks or otherwise. We are breaking down those walls not reinforcing them.
i agree. i used to want to know how people would gender me, and i just constantly got misgendered, and internalised it, and it was horrible. 

the real opinions to care about are from those who ask your gender or pronouns no matter how you present, and those who are quick to change when they get it wrong. i remember the first time i was just asked my pronouns, and it felt so good and validating, i suddenly didn't care how i looked.
i cant handle them either, im still trying to unlearn the binary, and those posts force me back into it when its aleeady so hard to unlearn due to social pressure, masking, and the fun way my brain works. beyond the fact that i will never be seen as androgynous and it comes off as invalidating to people who cant reach that. its just beauty standards all over again.
OH MANNNNN! So I wasn’t the only one who was like “I feel like folks are just looking for binary gender validation and it’s ironic as buying an ENBY shirt labeled ‘for men or woman’ on Amazon“ 

Didn’t wanna be an ass since I genuinely support everyone, but it’s kind of relieving someone pointed out the irony
Honestly I would 100% support mods banning these types of posts. As OP explained - It’s at best copium and at worst demoralizing for both OP and lurkers/commenters alike.

Edit: also r/transpassing would gladly take these types of posts if you really need to post them.
Yes. It feels so uncomfortable and weird. Like, you are on the NB subreddit, obviously your gender is NB. Unless you're asking me to guess your assigned gender at birth?! Why would you do that? Try instead: any tips to look more androgynous/fem/masc? Or something among those lines.
Please. PLEASE.
This! Thank you for saying this out loud because there are so many post like that. Like I feel like it's still contributing to the binary system and defeats the whole purpose. I wish this subreddit had a rule against that to create a safe space here.

And the ""does these clothes look non-binary enough?"" really infuriates me too because we know clothes have no gender and doesn't determine gender identity? Like I've been told that I'm not androgynous enough even from enby people, and it feels a bit triggering. I choose clothes that makes me happy.
This post uses stronger wording than I would personally choose, but I do agree with the sentiment. I've seen a lot of these posts (very much not singling out any one person here, there've been a lot of them), and I've scrolled by because i don't want to bring negativity to any individual's post, especially when they're clearly looking for validation and affirmation. But it makes me feel kinda sad and kinda bad, and I've been wondering if I should just unsub over it.

If i could suggest an alternative lifted from a different unrelated group I'm in: perhaps we could build a community culture where, when we want a little validation we can share a selfie and include mention of any gendered compliments we'd like to receive or wouldn't enjoy getting in response? Something like ""feeling cute today, all gendered responses welcome!"" or ""nongendered responses only please!"" and so on. That way it would be framed less as ""am i [x] enough?"" and more like ""I am [x], let's celebrare that"".
When i see posts like that, i sence a trap
THANK YOU

It's like ""hey, can you lean into the internalized enbyphobia/transphobia we're all working so hard to unlearn?"" I see it on a lot of trans related subreddits, not just this one, and it's super harmful...
For TALOS!!
r/transpassing go there.
Unfortunately we’ll never be able to stop people from posting what they want but I do agree they need to make their own subreddit.. I don’t know how people have the guts to comment either because what if you say their actual AGAB and then they get dysphoric or upset at it?
Also ""what name suits me"" posts, while not harmful, similarly flood the sub and don't encourage conversation at all. 

But maybe that's just me. I've never thought a name suited or didn't suit a person and I can't look at a stranger and think ""they should be named x."" So maybe I just don't understand
It's especially frustrating to constantly see androgyny presented as the only authentic form of non-binary presentation, and androgyny being an extremely narrow (pun intended) range of options that are COMPLETELY unachievable for most enbies. It's always just more thin, pretty white people.
Yeah, I feel those kinds of posts should just be auto-banned. I get that they can come from a place of innocence, but they really do enforce the idea that we owe others androgyny.
These posts have almost made me leave this subreddit. Not that it’s a triggering thing for me, I just find them super annoying.
Upvoted for Talos but also agree
There is a healthy and unhealthy way to seek validation. 

The form that caries a big risk of being invalidated is a setup for emotional harm. It also comes with a strong possibility of causing others to feel invalidated - in a community that is largely invalidated in wider society. 

Saying things like ""I feel so confident today"" maybe with ""in the way I look like this part of my identity; my pronouns are/today I like compliments that sound like [x, y, or z]/ please don't use [these terms]"" or ""I'm feeling very invalidated today; My pronouns are.../[these words] are validating/what I need to hear today/feel bad"" (as generic examples) helps everyone. It sets the tone, let's other people know what feels good, and is personalized rather than generically binary. It's also a great (and safe) way to practice externally asserting your gender.

If all else fails though tags that can be filtered are always helpful in situations with a wide range of legit perspectives that include triggering content.
THANK YOU FOR SAYING WHAT WE WERE ALL THINKING!
thank you!! or like ""what do you think my AGAB is?"" makes me so uncomfortable. For me especially because I know I look very much like my AGAB and people always think I'm my AGAB and yeah it's just a shitty feeling like.. being invalidated because you have secondary sex characteristics associated with your AGAB.
I assume that since they are posting on this sub that they are looking for gender interpretations outside the binary. So if I comment I’ll use their pic as inspiration for spinning a tale of cosmic forces being bound into a neat package that elude mortal perception. 

Is their gender the season of autumn when leaves crumble under foot or a sonnet that was written by long dead lovers in the time of superstition and the sword?

Is their gender the quickly expanding spacetime that contains the universe or the liminal spaces between quantum particles where reality changes because it’s been perceived?
I agree. I understand people wanting to know how people perceive them, but a non-binary sub doesn't seem a smart place to do it because generally speaking we don't want to assume gender based on appearances, you know? For me it's like reinforcing gender roles or expectations of gender and appearances. And if that's what an individual likes then cool, do what makes you happy. But putting it in a sub like this seems uncool. It'd be different if it was worded as ""Would you say I look like a typical \[insert gender here\]?"" because the wording is less on assumptions, but eh.
I love seeing pretty people but I never comment on those posts. I’m not going to guess and write a binary gender down and then make u feel crap bc it’s not the one you wanted to pass as. Like this is a NONBINARY subreddit.
Makes sense tbh. Also noting the distinctions between

1. ""what gender do you see when you see me"" → maybe go to r/transpassing or something?
2. ""guess what gender *I* identify as"" → not quite answerable, and eventually is a form of self affirmation, which by itself is not wrong, but (1) is always in hot demand and (2) exists in this sub and dilutes other content. And eventually it's most likely a variant of nonbinary, which will be something that not everyone knows. Maybe another sub will do? A sub that focuses on microgender guessing games? (sounds pointless somewhat)
Thank god. That was getting so damn annoying. Please stop the “what gender am I” posts.
MODS, for real you gotta put an end to these posts
u/javatimes and other mods, this post is important
I had a disagreement with a binary trans woman on r/trans recently bc she said it makes her dysphoric when people just ASK FOR HER PRONOUNS, because she said it makes her feel like people are “clocking” her, and said that she wishes complete strangers would just assume her gender instead, literally said it’s “not inclusive” to “refuse to assume” SOME peoples gender if that’s what THEY want.  🤦 

Somehow she expects complete strangers, including cis people, to KNOW in advance not to ask for her pronouns (which is literally what we’ve all been trying to normalize this whole time)  but instead, that she would prefer you assume her gender, because she is convinced that your outward appearance dictates your gender/pronouns. 

She kept saying “I pass better than most cis women so I get offended when people think my pronouns would be anything other than she/her based SOLELY on how I look” 😒

And like, idk, her feelings are valid. She’s allowed to feel that dysphoria. I can’t tell her that’s wrong 

BUT. 

I can’t help but feel, as a non-binary person, that a lot of binary trans people are still very much stuck clinging to outdated, stereotypical gender roles. This woman didn’t seem to understand that many of us DON’T pass, that many of us aren’t binary, that, for many of us, our appearance/presentation does not equal our identity, and to assume so is ignorant and oppressive. 

We NEED everyone to start asking, including cis people, so that it’s normalized across the board and people STOP ASSUMING. If EVERYONE asked EVERYONE ELSE for pronouns, then it’s not a trans-only thing where you have to feel like you’re getting clocked. She didn’t want to understand this. 

Idk that whole conversation just felt icky to me. Most of us are doing very hard work to unlearn rigid binary ideals and assumptions, but there are some binary trans people out there who want to stop that progress for the rest of us because of their own trauma. 

Like, I’m a pre-HRT transmasc non-binary person living in the Deep South. I am CONSTANTLY misgendered everywhere I go. EVERYONE assumes I’m a girl. I am fucking sick of strangers assuming and misgendering me, and this person didn’t seem to care about people like me, she just kept saying how oppressive it was to “force” someone to tell you their pronouns 🤦

And then said some very ableist things to me, for saying that bc I’m autistic so therefor I need straightforward and blunt communication, which is why I will always ASK for pronouns bc I do not wanna misgender or “assume” wrong. 
She told me that that wasn’t true and that “autistic doesn’t mean mentally incompetent” 😒
""Hey so I'm just looking for honest feedback, what gender do you assume I am? Keep in mind that if you say the wrong thing I'm going to be destroyed and use it to emotionally self harm, but if you give me the answer I want to hear I'll never actually believe you.""
Thank you so much for posting this!!
I kind of had this thought today. I think you're nonbinary, that's why you're here, do you want to be masc or femme? Androgynous? Something else? Then just ask if you look your preferred mode of representation.
i think you’re spot on with the “check” comparison.   it makes me sad but i understand that when you’re trained to think of yourself in certain terms it’s hard to not police yourself on them and even try to validate urself by making other participate in it
THANK YOU! I've been thinking this for so long! This sub would be so much more welcoming, more safe, and more \*interesting\* if those posts were banned. I understand that it could be hard to implement, but I think it's worth it 100%.
I agree, it just doesn’t fit to have posts asking for people to put somebody into the binary on the nonbinary subreddit. that’s like the antithesis of the subreddit lol
My response to ""what gender am I"" is either ""I don't know"" or ""i don't care"" depending how snarky I'm feeling.
I'm glad someone is saying it. They make me really uncomfortable out of concern for the poster, it's a recipe for dysphoria if anyone doesn't see them the way they are wanting and is honest about it. I hope that type of post is not permitted in the future. 

They also reinforce gendered clothing/features. The answers people give are always going to be influenced by perceived masculinity/femininity of the clothing/hair and natural facial features of the poster.
The whole reason I identify as non-binary in the first place is because masculine and feminine have such arbitrary meanings that have no real basis in reality. Nothing is inherently masculine or feminine and it can be so personal to each individual. So I agree with you that those posts feel like they want us to box them in the binary or something and it makes me uncomfy. Just be the most authentic version of yourself, ya know?
There's no good way to engage with them. I could tell you what I assume your agab was, but I don't want to do that and that's not the answer you want anyway. Should I slap you with the binary gender you look most like? The binary gender you look least like in an attempt to be ""nice""? Nonbinary is an umbrella and I couldn't hope to ever name every specific gender under it. What does Androgyne, or genderfluid, etc, even look like? The only way I feel comfortable answering is with an adjective. That brings up questions about adjective-genders. The whole thing is just a mess.
Glad somebody said it. These posts just reinforce a masc/fem binary and continue the falsehood that gender looks a certain way.
THANK YOU 😭
Yeah, that perpetuates the idea that a specific gender or identity of any kind SHOULD LOOK a certain way and so many people in our queer community still have this backwards thinking and posts like that may only worsen that. 

I get maybe some OPs ask with the thought that it can help “affirm” who they are but we should definitely be more focused on people being who they are. Period.
Thank you for saying this. I'm not enby but I really like this forum for just the sheer diversity of what being non-binary looks like and what it means to people, so seeing the selfies and discussions on here just makes me happy. As a cis person, I think it's even more akward to sit here and try to judge and guess than it would be other non-binary people. I can have my own immediate thoughts first but that shouldn't matter at all and everyone here saying it can be a SH tool is very legitimate. I really don't like this content and glad a lot of people seem to agree.
What gender do you assume I am... Checks sub reddit. uh... Non binary?
Thanks for being upfront about this issue.
Every few months these start popping up more and more then we get one of these posts and they stop for a while...it's a tiresome cycle and I'm not sure why there isn't better moderation about those kinds of posts not being allowed.

But this is the same place where a mod yelled at me a few years ago for telling someone there's no such thing as looking nonbinary so 🤷‍♂️
THANK YOU. I understand the desire for validation, but it’s not the right approach to take.
Genuinely curious, do you feel the same towards posts asking how androgynous one looks? because that's my main goal and because of body dysmorphia it's hard to tell myself.
Translation: 
Hey, stranger. Evaluate me upon which way seems more appropriate to u about my genital formation

I understand it's cool to mess with and confuse people, there's fun into that thing of breaking societal and cultural standards, but it's never okay to ""check someone's pants"", it's just wrong. This is a thing for life, not just for people here. Gender is a social construct of personal identity for group classification, but the key is still *personal*. If someone is who they are, being cis, trans, non-binary or whatever else they simply are, no one else can validate that and it is their choise to how they want when it comes to who they are. Stablishing looks on this kind of things is elitistic bullshit, segregating people and forming stereotypes, it's really bad. If you don't know someone's gender, don't ask and if you don't want someone to guess yours that's cool, but androgyny is not a toy and how you act upon it has consequences that can hurt people. Living outisde the binary, or outside anything the S.Q. dictates, is hard enough as it is, let's please try to make it less instead of more difficult. 

I stand with you, OP. Putting human beings into that kind of idiotic boxes is a thing for cis people. Ewww
i hate those posts so much.  ""whats my agab??"" ""what gender do you think i am??"" shut upppp do that somewhere else please
Heavily agree
Is this post also targeting people who are looking for terms to look into? Because I've made posts asking for like advice for the feelings I've been having towards my gender n I really don't want to be offending anyone....
Yes. This is actively harmful and I strongly suspect some of those posts are made by cis people with malicious intentions.
I honestly dislike any posts that ask for ""feedback"" on how they would be gendered bc photos can be misleading and ppl online can be dishonest or arbitrarily overcritical. You're better off just going out in the world and seeing how people gender you. I get gendered female unfortunately a LOT of the time even though I have been on T almost 3 years now and I'm trying hard to pass as male (I am transmasc), but every once in a while I get gendered male. Certain clothes help me get gendered male more often and my voice outs me a lot, esp on the phone. So I have been trying to wear certain things and do voice therapy. Real life reactions from people give you a lot more accurate information, even though it feels shitty to be misgendered. Ofc not everyone is interested in passing or even is able to pass if they want to be treated as nonbinary. I think wanting to pass is valid but seeking validation on the internet is not really healthy or helpful in any way
I hate those posts and never answer them.  Fully support the effort to have a rule made against them, but do not support Talos worship.
A staple of not fitting in the gender binary is not assuming people's gender. I always tell people I don't care if you use feminine or masculine pronouns, my problem comes when you're _assuming_ I'm a man or a woman. Those posts don't help normalise not assuming other people's gender. It has to stop. We all want to be validated here but it's just not the way, it can be extremely triggering for some people's dysphoria.
Agreed. It just makes me feel like every time someone looks at me, they’re going to try to assume what gender I am based off their perceptions and ideas. And I have no gender. It’s like I can’t unsubscribe lmfao
It’s almost like telling people if they “pass.”
Yuck.
This!!!
I agree
So much isn't captured in photos either
To me it comes off as begging for validation with how frequently it gets posted ngl
Yeah this sub is starting to feel like transpassing omg x.x
THANK YOU! I could feel that these posts were harming me but hadn’t found the words yet, THIS!!!
Agreed. At best, it’s annoying and at worst it’s triggering to people who aren’t skinny or white that don’t fit into the stereotypical image of ‘non-binary’. It’s like, damn am I even supposed to be here?
Yeah, I agree. Its gotten to the point I have to actively avoid the sub if I'm having a bad dysphoria day. I will never pass and I can't get on HRT thanks to health issues, I really don't need that reminder being thrown into my face every other day. I've made my peace with it, don't get me wrong, but its hard trying to feel apart of a community with this happening. Its not great for my imposter syndrome, and I already feel out of place as it is for not getting HRT. 

There are subs specifically built for checking if you pass or for getting compliments that are specifically for trans people or are trans friendly. Please take your posts there. Theres a reason I am not a member of those and this is exactly why. I've already had to turn off notifications for this place which is a shame because there are some great threads I end up being late to.
agreed. if ppl need binary passing assurance for safety reasons then maybe do that in a subreddit for binary trans ppl or trans ppl in general and not on this one? 
also it just feels like a form of self harm so like unless this is for your safety maybe just… don’t. we have plenty of transphobic cis ppl out there to focus on these kinds of things already
It’s exhausting to see. I look at them and I look at the comments and I try to figure out what they could possibly want out of it. I start looking at myself more critically, wondering what people would say if it were me. 

I agree that it’s just a form of checking. I don’t keep mirrors in my home for a reason, and I never, *ever* ask for input on what people perceive me as. When I see glimpses of myself in the mirror or take selfies I feel fucking awesome because I’m no longer over-saturating my mind with those obsessive thoughts of “oh, my eyes look like this my face shape is this my hair my nose my chin-“ and I get to just see myself in passing, the way everyone else in my life does. Now I know I’m hot as hell, and if I don’t feel like that some days, I know how to walk away from the mirror and live my life until I do again. 

I don’t frequent this sub as much anymore because of posts like that.
Agreed!!!
Those kinds of posts would fit better on r/transpassing or something like that.
Yeah it does remind me of ed forums with ""Guess my weight"" or ""guess my bmi""
Agreed, it’s unsettling at the least.
Yeah that's pretty cringy.
Tbh I never comment on these posts. Sometimes I can't tell so they look completely enby to me. Sometimes I can clearly tell their agab and don't wanna hurt them. Because I don't know what gender they are, and they could be everything from demiboy, to genderfluid, or agender.
I do agree with you but I understand why people do it. I know non-binary has no ""look"" but I like the idea of people in the street being confused about my gender, or just not assuming I'm a girl. And it's nice to know when I give off that vibe and get the opinion of other enbys who understand. 
 
I think there's harmful and non harmful ways to go about it. But I definitely agree with you. Maybe people should put content warnings on posts like that so people who may be harmed by them can avoid them
The only way we could tell your gender from a picture is if you shared MRI scans of your brain and someone well trained in neurology and gender could interpret it. That's really where gender is. Everything else is meat clothing
Honestly the pics are lovely but I didn't think r/nonbinary would be purely pictures of people. especially when 50% of it is what you just said
Idk, while I do get what your saying, that mentality feeds into the mentality that NBs are all about escaping gender norms(instead of just something that's important to some).  As a newly realized Pangender NB I could see myself wanting to know others opinions once I start expressing my feminine\androgynous\whatever else sides.

For me it's very much a genders and their norms are a bunch of illusions and bullshit but after I realized that I also realized I'd still like to present as them, just not be restricted by my amab body to just being a dude... If that makes any sense(pretty stoned atm lol)

Edit: that being said, I could easily post on other reddits if it is that triggering for others here but still feels a bit invalidating for myself knowing I can't really discuss my presentation without using the terms relating to the genders I may be trying to evoke with a look once I actually start working towards that 🤷
Hey, I understand where you’re coming from, and I fully agree with the message of this post and that the gender assumption posts are not appropriate, but “triggering” is a word specific to trauma and ptsd experiences (it “triggers” a traumatic event to be brought forward in the mind, causing a visceral and dysregulated response to reliving said trauma) so unless you mean it in that sense, it might be best to choose a different word. I know people often think “but “triggering” has a strong connotation to it and I need that connotation to get my point across” but it has that connotation because it’s tied directly to the lived experience of trauma survivors and our daily battles against what we were put through. Just wanted to mention that.

ETA: To the people downvoting, *please* recognize that experiencing strong emotions and negative experiences ≠ trauma responses. If you’re in full control of your actions, and able to set the issue aside (albeit with difficulty), then it’s probably not a trauma response. Yes, that word holds weight. Yes, your experiences are absolutely still valid and should be respected. But using “triggered” to emphasize importance in a non-traumatic context harms members of the ptsd community who *need* that word to be recognized as a severe and dysregulated reaction to overwhelming stress that fundamentally restructured your brain. 

Note: To “trigger” an experience (ex: “these posts trigger dysphoria in some people”) is a different thing, and an absolutely valid use of the word. But as a stand-alone phrase (“to be triggered”, “this is triggering”) is specific to ptsd experiences
You see I agreed with you until you related it to EDs.
[deleted]
I get where you're coming from, but for me, my friends are all 'yes men' who always try and validate me. And when i look in the mirror sometimes I see something completely different day by day.
While I havn't made one of these posts before, I absolutely see why people would. Sometimes I absolutely would love an unbiased ""you look afab/aman/idk"" confirmation. I get that some of yall wouldn't want to see a post like that, but can y'all really name any other enby-friendly community where someone could ask for help with that?
Also, why are you assuming people are doing it for complements? Isn't that just ""theyre trans for attention"" repackaged? Maybe they just want a sanity check that they actually do/don't look how they think they do.
[deleted]
I'm mostly with you, but likening it to eating disorders is kinda insensitive. There are a bunch of really good reasons why some people need to do that kind of thing, and they don't need to be shamed or told that they have a mental health issue for it.
Gender checking is *very* different than ED checking. Sorry but they are 2 wildly different problems.
What? Just don’t look at them
Yeah I get where you are coming from.
I'm not particularly bothered by those posts but yeah, asking ""what agab do I look like?"" Kinda defeats the whole point of being in a space where people identify outside of the binary.
Asking what gender they look like it's not as bad imo, because you could say they look gender fluid or bigender or choose from the many genders inside of the non-binary umbrella. 
I agree that it's kinda pointless because of the fact that gender =/= physical appearance. It's like posting a pic of you and asking what nationality you look like, literally could be anything(??
all I want is the connection here .  i don't want to scrutinize gender .  we are (hopefully) past that .  Both or Neither or Im Between .  Done .  I agree
I absolutely agree
Hear hear 💕
im gonna start posting ""what gender do you think i am?"" posts but its just gonna be rorschach inkblots and pictures of inanimate objects. Maybe some frogs.
It certainly did not help me and I am actually reluctant to post pictures now.  I made such a post and it went unanswered for some time and I had forgotten about it.  Suddenly when I got an alert on my phone that simply said ""male"" and it just undid a lot of the positive real life interactions I had with people where they did not know my AGAB at first and even ended the convo basically having to understand that I was truly a sort of androgyne.
Yes, I try very hard not to assume someone's gender from the way they look. In fact, I rather enjoy gender ambiguity and not needing to know what gender they are (or identify as).
I see a r/Skyrim reference
I feel this! I don’t want to assume anyone’s gender by how they look especially in an enby community!!!
PLEASE.
I’m guilty of making a post like that because I saw other people doing it and I saw they got a lot of positive comments that seemed to boost their confidence and I wanted that too because I felt so bad about people calling me a girl that day that i felt the need to be hyper masculine, and I kinda wanna delete it now because it really doesn’t help or accomplish anything,,, if anything it makes you feel worse about yourself. You’re right and I think people shouldn’t do it anymore either, while it can be positive for some people it can still effect the mental health of others. I know it’s hard when you’re misgendered as your birth gender and it hurts a lot but hypermasculinizing/femininizing yourself to avoid that and still getting called your birth gender takes alot of mental energy and it always hurts more when people tell you no, you look like (insert gender here) anyways you guys are awesome ❤️ continue to be your amazing selves
Yup, these are the worst part of this subreddit. They make me sad and uncomfortable.
Legit, I have a whole thing about being against the idea of needing to pass as a particular gender (other than for safety) and posts like those op is talking about can propagate that need to pass or cause emotional harm to posters who feel the need to pass and end up feeling like they don't pass based on the comments. No shade to people who post that stuff, I get wondering what people see you as, but I dont think that mindset is very healthy and such posts often cause detriment to posters, commenters and viewers.
I don’t think you’re wrong, at all. 

I feel like there’s this weird paradox being non binary where even though you want to escape the gender binary, at the same time you want to experience it all in a way. At least speaking for myself. 

But yes there’s for sure a difference in approach and and the posts you’re talking about do leave an odd taste in my mouth, now realizing for the reasons you’re listing. 

Of course to each their own and the internet is used/ plays a different roll in everyone’s life so I try not to assume
Glad to know I'm not the only who has to actively unlearn binary gender norms. I still struggle with this too and feel so silly about it since I'm nonbinary myself. I've already unlearned so much, I can unlearn this as well.
This exactly. Any guess I make is through the same binary auto-categorization that people use to ""clock"" us irl, which is shitty and exactly what I'm trying to unlearn.
This, this, this 💯 

These posts just reinforce exactly what we don’t want for the cis folks out there to do, and yet…
I have the same issue, i think its a thing our brain instinctually does. Apparently, a person's gender is one of the main bits of information our brains registers in when seeing someone which naturally requires us to assume the person's gender. Idk if one can unlearn that, but it's important to notice it when it occurs so you don't unconsciously enforce the gender binary.

 These ""what's my gender"" posts bring these assumptions out of our thoughts and into the open for everyone to see. It's like that thing where you might think something but you know you shouldn't say it out loud and then someone asks you to tell them the exact thought you're thinking and you end up saying it to the detriment of the person who asked. Just because they asked doesn't mean you should tell them and in this case, don't ask either because the entire point of those posts is to comment and say your thoughts that you would normally keep to yourself so you don't hurt the person. And of course, the poster gets hurt. 

Also, I think we should all start to avoid commenting or interacting with these posts so that people stop posting them. Especially if the mods don't end up doing anything about it.
I shared this post with the sub mods. Hopefully this will be done. 
I couldn't find a rulebook or anything anywhere either.
PLEASE
Also, does this sub have any written rules? Couldn’t find them anywhere. I think it’d in our best interest to have some kind of established do’s and do not’s.
Agreed.
I think the bottom line is these posts will always pop up without a rule. In the couple years I've been here and other trans subs, it's just always a thing here and there.

I think there should be a rule, and a separate subreddit for those that really want to post that shit. It might be unhealthy, but it definitely seems to be a phenomenon that tons of people want to ask. There should just be a separate sub for that.

Oh I guess there is: /r/transpassing
amen
that’s really it.

like it would be incredibly rude to say „you look like a man/you look like a woman“ to a person posting on freaking r/ nonbinary, no matter how stereotypically one may fit into what someone imagines that look like.

so you can basically never be sure the answer will be the truth & not just politeness. at which point why bother, especially in the face of all the reasons not to mentioned in this thread & by op.

also reinforces that you have to a certain way to be enby, or that it is a look in the first place.
It’s both to me, everyone posting looks nb to me in some way especially because they’re on the nonbinary subreddit, and most everyone commenting will say nb because those commenting are also on the nonbinary subreddit lol
Right... and you don't even know what answer would be technically polite in response to these.
Yeah, its sort of like a loaded question to ask.
Yea it almost (almost) could be used as a form of self harm. Being misgendered/ perceived as something ur not, exposing urself to preconceptions about gender and identity. All of what we’re trying to get away from
This is similar to the ""do I pass"" posts with trans binary people.

Many don't. Lots of people lie. Some are straight up honest and they need to expect that. And you don't know if you're doing them a favor or not by being honest.

For some it's literal safety, like ""is it relatively safe for me to go out like this or will I get immediately clocked"", and I can respect that. But some, they're just going to get hurt when they have confidence to ask and then hear no, they don't yet.
I’d rather just see selfies titled “feeling confident today” than the current “what do you think is in my pants”. If you wanna have attention and feel good about yourself okay, but don’t go against the whole point of non-binary.
Or any other trans subreddit tbh
I know this is out of context but I frickin' love your username.
Thank you, I feel exactly the same way. I live in a very unwelcoming area, and every time I see one of these posts, I feel awful and start second-guessing myself and worrying about what other people are thinking about me when I go out in public.
>if you want to have a face full of makeup and a beard and you ID as non-binary then you go do that, checking your gender imo shouldn't be the focus here, it should be positivity no matter what you look like.

This is where my gender expression is nowadays so thank you for putting a smile on my face while reading. It’s a doozy when ppl assume my gender is man just bc I rock my T beard so I say fuck the binary and adorn full faces of makeup, jewelry, etc. I despise being read as a cishet bro 🤢
If I could upvote this millions of times, I would. It’s like they forget what non-binary means.
fr i have people assume what gender i am daily and against my will, why the fuck anyone would subject themselves to that on purpose in a nonbinary space where we're all supposed to be free of that hell is beyond me
Please and thank you!
thanks for your time and attention on this!
I find those just as annoying for different reasons. 

People don't seem to understand the way names work, which is: you tell me your name, and then you look like that name. 

Its literally impossible to ""look like a kevin"" or ""look like a jessica"". Names are given to people at birth, before anyone knows what the person will look like. 

""I want a name that fits me"". So fucking pick one, and that name will fit you. Literally any fucking name.
That sounds beautiful
Why do you all gotta bring Talos into this?! That’s illegal. I’m telling!
Thank you! I was curious if there was a sub like that. Sure validation is nice and all, but sometimes I want somebody to tell me if I fly under the radar enough to use a public restroom.
Yes, we can. We can start agreeing to comment ""This post is harmful please delete it."" and if we do it enough an entirely new subreddit for gender checking will come!
Mods can literally make a rule against it and delete the posts. Can and should, I would say, if the community in general supports it.
Not relevant really, but I _love_ these gender deacriptions! And even relate some!
Send a modmail plz. Just tagging me does nothing.
Wow. Just... so much to unpack here. I feel for her. She's a victim of passing culture and doesn't realize the real harm she's doing to not only herself but to other trans people.
It seems like that's genuinely what they're talking about.

For one, androgyny isn't what non-binary people have to express. For some it feels invalidating if they look like their AGAB and someone else doesn't - like for yourself you're going to see more androgynous people who could potentially be a bit triggering for your body dysmorphia. It might remind some they look like their AGAB and they feel they have to meet your standard, when they don't.

Also, you're coming from a place where it's about body dysmorphia. OP is considering it to be, as some others do, a form of self-harm. Like you post stuff that ends up reinforcing your body dysmorphia from their comments, and maybe expect it. It's you making you feel bad.

The point is not much good comes out of these posts. You might not get validated, and it's a form of self harm. Or you might get validated, and it triggers other people. Point being, you need to be happy being you, regardless of what other people see. As we all do.

I just think there should be another sub for it.

Edit: there is, /r/transpassing
Not at all. Asking questions to try to understand how to communicate how you feel are great. Asking a loaded question about placing someone into a gender binary based on their presentation is the problem being addressed in this post.
Same
im much more a fan of dibella myself, but shes not as well known :D
I honestly can't think of a non-harmful way to do it. If people really want to know what assumptions cis people will make, they can go to r/transpassing. I'd like subs like this one to be an escape from cissexist assumptions.
Yeah, that's really not possible either. There is no neural imaging method capable of determining gender on an individual scale.
You might like /r/NonBinaryTalk. Images are not allowed, so you'll only see discussion there.
I think you can express your presentation here, easily.  You could say ""feeling fem/masc in this picture"" or ""how do I look more fem/masc"" or similar, thereby expressing the gender you currently want to be identified as.  Saying ""what gender do I look"" encourages viewers to reinforce the existing gender binary by judging you according to rigid standards, and in that case they're likely to see you as a gender you aren't currently presenting.  That's the problem.
Well yeah, that's what it is, it's literally triggering to constantly see posts from what's supposed to be the non-binary community that tell me I can't ever be accepted as who I am because I don't look (and can't ever look) the 'right' way. The trauma done by being misgendered for a number of years is real trauma. I don't know what good it's supposed to do to pretend that you have to be diagnosed with PTSD to have triggers related to your trauma, when most of the time a PTSD diagnosis because of assigned gender trauma isn't a thing that people get. But the spiral of self-hate and self-harm is absolutely the same. I've left posts here sobbing to find a scalpel because that shit is extremely triggering, exclusive context intended. **Efforts to minimize and erase trans trauma do NOT belong here.**
[deleted]
You are right, and for the folks downvoting: get a fucking sense of civility and decency. 

Someone is pointing out problematic language that actively harms people who experienced debilitating trauma, and instead of learning from it you discourage them? Shame on you.
how is it validating? truly curious. if people give you the “wrong” answer, wouldn’t that make you feel worse? 

you can post a selfie and say “i need some validation today” and i’m sure people would be happy to oblige. and then no one else feels bad.
Their validation shouldn't come at the expense of other queer people. I understand where you're coming from. Being validated and affirmed is important. But there are a million ways to do that without being harmful toward your own community. 

But also what you describe as a need for validation, is just passing culture and that shit is toxic. Most especially to a group who is specifically not trying to pass as one thing or another. Validation and affirmation doesn't come from some rando saying, ""I totally couldn't tell that you're A[G]AB!"" It comes from the love and acceptance of your community for being exactly who you are. By living your life unapologetically unmoored from the opinions of others.
There are other ways to feel validated that aren't asking others to assume your gender based on one picture
Genuinely trying to understand that point of view. Someone with low self esteem in need of validation to get through their day, posts a selfie here asking ""what gender do I look like?"" No further context. I can see 4 possible outcomes of this:

1. I say 'you look like you're x binary gender', I guess correctly what they wanted to hear, they get their validation and move on with their day.
2. I say 'you look like you're x binary gender', I guess incorrectly what they wanted to hear, they're super bummed because they didn't get the validation they wanted and actually got the opposite, their day is ruined due to their low self esteem.
3. ""You look non-binary""/""Can't tell""/""Gender is an internal experience independent of how you choose to present."" This is probably the most truthful option tbh, because presentation *doesn't* define gender, and you *can't* tell what someone's gender is based on how they look. But that isn't what people want to hear, it's not what they asked for. Not as bad as option 2, but not the validation they were looking for.
4. No one replies, they feel ignored and isolated, not a good feeling either.

So, out of the 4 options I see, only one of them is likely to give the user the boost you want them to receive, and it's largely based on chance. How do you justify the risk of ""anti-validation"" for lack of a better term?
Validation posts are different. Ive seen people post saying 'feeling insecure today, tell me im 'cute/handsome/pretty/scary'. Thats direct and honest and fine.

What the op is asking people to stop doing is posting asking what gender they pass as. Thats a toxic form of validation seeking & can be self defeating and/or triggering
r/transpassing

There are also plenty of other trans and nonbinary subs that are specifically built for things like that. There's nothing wrong with the posts themselves, but this isn't the place for it.
TIL mentioning you're being made uncomfortable by someone's actions is policing their identity.


If the majority of the community is in agreement that it makes them feel bad, then MAYBE, JUST MAYBE, you should step back and evaluate if you're the one being inconsiderate.

NO ONE said you couldn't be a masc/femme leaning enby. What was ACTUALLY said was that seeing people on a sub dedicated to being a place for enby people to comfortably be theirselves constantly posting asking ""do i fit --- gender binary??"" triggers their dysphoria.

Make a seperate sub for that and quit stepping on everyone else's toes just to get a crumb of validation from internet strangers. You're allowed to be yourself and seek validation, but when you're knowingly hurting people in the process you're just a selfish asshole.
You don't get to needlessly harm members of your own community for your validation.
Read my post again and come back with a better take. Maybe also look up ""checking"" since you don't seem to get it.
It's not. It's the *exact* same SH spiral for me - hate for my body/fatness/gender.
I agree with you
Honestly, that struck me as a bit off too. Gender dysphoria is absolutely a mental health concern and should be taken seriously but to compare it to an ED out of nowhere seems insensitive and tone-deaf.

Like, I’m in full support of the message of this post. Those posts are frustrating and misleading, because this is a non-binary sub, and you *can’t* in good faith actively misgender someone to try to validate them. And posts like that can easily cause intense dysphoria spikes and that’s not okay. But there’s no reason to compare it to another disorder like that.
So I'm a person with an eating disorder who is in an 8 year relationship with someone who--as of October--is 10 years in recovery.

This kind of behavior directly mirrors the toxic side of the online ED community. It's very much akin to someone with anorexia posting a photo with their shirt pulled up saying, ""Do I look skinny today?"" They're getting validation but is absolutely the wrong kind of validation. It's very very damaging. Not to mention the people who will go out of their way to trigger people with ED.

In the same vain, asking someone to guess your AGAB is asking, ""Do I pass?"" The negative affect of being told either yes or no is that it reinforces the need to pass to be valid. Which is toxic. 

I really can't think of a good reason unless you can share one with me. But I fail to see why someone would *need* to do this outside of having an unhealthy fixation on passing. As I mentioned another comment, there are a million ways to be validated by others and so few are this harmful to yourself and other queer folks. 

P.S. Its not offensive to say that someone has a mental disorder in a non-derogatory way. There's nothing wrong with having a mental disorder and we shouldn't pretend like their is.
They're literally half of the subs posts sometimes. You can only avoid looking for so long.
I'm almost positive that everyone struggles with this. Try not beating yourself up over it
You'll get there.

After almost a year of actively working on it, I'm finally at a place where I *sometimes* succeed in not immediately assigning gender to strangers, but can consistently catch myself when I fail. I'm not there yet, but being able to see progress is so inspiring.

The only ingredients are time, intent, and treating yourself with kindness.
Im also non-binary and am finding it EXTREMELY difficult to not shove everyone into a box in my head based on how the look. I grew up religious and conservative ao i have that shit BURNED into my brain
I like this, I'm naturally feminine but I'm trying to figure it out and its a weird thing because yes. I present the gender I was born as and that seems pointless to bring up and confusing I'm sure but right now irregardless of how I dress I don't want to be called female because I don't know what that means other than a vagina between your legs and we all know that's not really the gender indicator we assumed it was.
There are things under the community guidelines area, but they don't seem to be fleshed out.
I've settled on the perfect form of rudeness - I just tell them all they look like baby-faced childrens instead. ..... Because many of you do look about twelve years old to me, I swear. >.>""
technically polite is 'please don't ask me that""
It can absolutely be a means of emotional SH or an early step of physical SH. All it takes is one comment that mirrors internal invalidation to fall into a spiral. In this sub there's a fair chance that every comment will support internal invalidation.
This is exactly why the comparison to eating disorders was made. Folks with severe ED will do exactly this kind of thing in order to self harm.
Yea, a lot of people are extremely worried about passing, sometimes excessively. I understand the anxiety, since people can be terrible, but a lot of times, an asshole is gonna be an asshole no matter what, so in some situations it's best to just not worry about them and distance yourself.  


Your own comfort is the most important, and if you're gonna worry too much about, you'll never be fully happy with yourself. Focus on your own good, but also make sure to be safe. Transitioning is a long process, and you have to give it time.
Oh, I'm so on board! I love it when people say I'm feeling very gender today as well because that could mean anything! Yesterday I was out in full femme mode and felt amazing but I know I don't pass and I don't give a crap! Just be yourself don't ask people to answer weird questions!
For some binary trans people it's safety, like being clocked in public might be dangerous. It helps them to know if they don't yet, so they don't put themselves in a dangerous situation. But you never know if that's the case or not with those posts.
Some binary folk might want to pass, and that's fine for them, but like, what the fuck am *I* supposed to ""pass"" as?
Thanks! For both infertile humans and endometriosis humans, it’s quite relevant!
Legit, their username is a mood.
you'll never be a cishet bro to me, you rock those blade-sharp eyeliner wings and groomed beard
Lol, this reminds me of an episode in the unbreakable kimmy Schmidt where the guy names his baby Linda and everyone else considers it a weird name for a baby because they think Linda is an adult name. 

Just imagine you meet someone and they're like, ""hi, my name is kevin"" 

""Whaaaat? You don't look like a Kevin, you look more like a Dave. You should call yourself Dave.""

""But, my name is kev-""

""Shut up Dave.""
I vaguely remember a paper that found some statistical correlation between names and faces that ig were found on the internet. Dunno that I put mich stock in them, but...

Even if there _were_ some connection, I am so bad at understanding it I don't know if I even understand the question!

And this coming from a plural system who has been on baby name sites more than probably most people <.< You'd think I understand naming by now smh
Sometimes I meet new people that look or behave similar to people I already know so I think they could fit that name. Unfortunately that's not always a compliment 😅

But well, that's how it works for me anyway. I'd probably make a post like ""I like those 3 names, which is the best for me"" if I hadn't already chosen a name
Some of that is just not true. A lot of people see people as not “looking like a kevin.” I couldn’t tell you the criteria, but it’s not a line that’s rare.

I do actually think many people do or don’t look like their names, and since we (trans people) are picking our own, why not ask??
We can probably skip the last part lol
Okay I will. But also, now you’ve seen it so…
Ok with the example being applied to myself it makes a lot more sense, thank you for taking the time of writing it out. 

What actually differs for me though is that the body dysmorphia is a seperate problem to my gender identity, which i had way before realizing i didn't fit my agab. So, it's just making it hard to judge in an unbiased way, and i don't think that i would personally get offended by people commenting what they actually think, but i understand that others will get hurt by it, so making a seperate subreddit, as you and others proposed, would now make sense to me as well.

One thing I will say time and time again, is that I find it incredible just how nicely and calmly people in this subreddit will discuss issues like this to make the community more comfortable for as many people as possible, so kudos to you and everybody else for talking things out in a healthy manner :)
I just wanted to make sure! I don't like offending people
Ahhh thankyou, I didn't know about that subreddit. I'll use that for this type of thing from now on. Not that I do it often. Actually I'm not sure if I ever have as a post as I usually ask friends who I know are cool with it
Yeah, you're not wrong. I guess the whole point is the cliche of ""it's what's on the inside"" but in a more literal scientific way
I'll look into that one! thanks
I guess the crit in your name is short for hypocrite?
You can have civility and decency and be aware that the word is used in contexts beyond PTSD. That is a way narrower definition than is used in psychology. It is widely used for extreme negative emotional reactions in general by mental health professionals, including anxiety, panic attacks, acute dysphoria, etc. Trying to narrow a term to one specific condition and restrict language from people experiencing other struggles which have long used it is not helpful to anyone. Seeing someone ask to be gendered based on experience CAN trigger dysphoria, anxiety, etc. in trans people who have fears and dysphoria around how others view their own gender in connection to their physical appearance.
Exactly this — posting a photo with caption ""need some validation"" feels much healthier and likely to succeed at its goal... Nonbinary has no look. And Man/Woman have no look. You are what you know you are, and that's genuinely all that matters.

>After almost a year of actively working on it, I'm finally at a place where I *sometimes* succeed in not immediately assigning gender to strangers

Your brain has spent a million-plus years learning to categorize every living thing you see within the first second you see them; it's a survival trait. Being able to asses whether this new person is a potential threat, friend,  or mate is one of the reasons we're still here. So y'know, don't kick yourself too hard if it takes more than a year to untrain that part of your brain. It might actually not be fully possible. 

But we can trains ourselves to add more categories to our automatic-assessing process. We can also get into the habit of making those categories more flexible in our minds. Most people see someone and default to ""male/female"" instantly when identifying them. We can still do that, but just make it more of a ""probably male-identifying/probably female-identifying/probably nonbinary"" thought process, and proceed according to those assessments, while being mentally ready to shift them should new information appear. That ongoing process of being able to switch or re-assess assumptions is a lot more work for the brain(I think it's this last step that less tolerant people can't or aren't willing to learn - the ability to switch their assessment of someone's gender identity away from what they'd first assumed)
The sidebar on old reddit has some info:

> 1. This is a subreddit for people of every stripe who feel that they don't fit into our culture's gender-binary. This is a place to share stories, experiences, questions, images, art, poetry - anything to help you through the journey of expressing the real you and meeting others who are like you.
> 2. Anyone binary wanting to ask questions because you don't understand something non-binary must search the archive before posting. Odds are your questions have been answered...multiple times. If it's obvious you haven't done this, your post will be removed.
> 3. When making a link post, please make the first comment to your post. You can include a summary of the link, an opinion, and/or a discussion question. Thanks for participating!

As someone who has struggled with TOCD, I think a clear line distinction in the language of posts could help. 

Posts with questions like, ""Do you think I pass (safety)"" can keep people from feeling the need to overflow with validating language versus ""Do you think I pass (validation)"" where the poster is clearly seeking either safety feedback or validation. 

A lot of folks with OCD tendencies can get caught up in the ""am I trans/NB/cis/gay *enough* cycle of self doubt and imposter syndrome"" and just live there.
Perpetuating the idea of “passing” is harmful to all trans people and a lot of cis people
You. I ADORE You. Endo haver here and it is HELL, the only reason I don't suffer horrible pain now is that my doctor put me on hormonal BC and told me ""you can skip the week without hormones and just go straight into a new pack"" because she knows what hell that is for me. Nice lil bonus, no more menstrual dysphoria! Can't rec it enough if you're able to access that care.
If people feel the need to congregate over a style of post, that's not on me to judge them imo. I won't be joining the subreddit and that'll be that
Yes haha that part is true. I realized after I posted that comment.
To “trigger” an experience is one thing. Yes, that is absolutely a medically valid use of the word. 

However, using it as a standalone verb (“to be triggered”, “triggering someone”) is very much specific to ptsd and trauma-based circles. 

Op used the word as the latter. Had they said “trigger dysphoria”, it wouldn’t be an issue, but “to be triggered” is a very specific phrase with ptsd origins which the internet use of the word has done immeasurable amounts of damage on
Oh my god. The fucking self victimization is insane.  If you're gonna act like a dick, then yeah, you should probably leave.
I'm having trouble communicating with you because you have the right ideas but you're coming to the opposite conclusion imo.


>You don't think it's unfair to put your discomfort in the mere existence of another person who expresses themselves differently than you?

So it's not about discomfort, it's about harm. Those posts are absolutely harmful to people because they reinforce passing culture. Passing culture is the thing that locks us into the gender binary and that can be extremely harmful.


>The whole point of the ""non-binary"" label is that it encompasses a variety of different ways of being yourself. 

This is why I'm confused. To me, this is an argument that ""Guess my AGAB"" posts are at best pointless in a room full of enbies. Why does their AGAB matter? As you said:

>It feels antithetical to the whole point.



>Excluding people because their expression makes you feel bad is still excluding

Again we are not talking about how it might make someone feel bad. We're talking about harm done. We're also not excluding people at all. We're excluding a behavior that is harmful to the community and the person exhibiting it. Multiple times in this thread the suggestion has been to ask for validation or gendered/non-gendered compliments. That way that person *isn't* being excluded and they're able to find the validation they need. We should strive to exclude toxic behaviors from our every day. 


>you make it about your feelings rather than their desire to be included.


As I've said, there are a million ways to be included that don't harm your community. No one is owed inclusion if their behavior is harmful. In fact, the opposite is true. If you are entering a shared space and your behavior is harmful, others in that space have every right to tell you to stop and tell you to leave if you don't stop.
That's not what any of this is about and it's deceptive to pretend it is.
100% all of this. Our brains will naturally push back on the insistence to _not_ categorise things (for good reason!), but what we can do is retrain the categories. Much of what we call ""learning"" boils down to a refinement of these recognition categories.

We can broaden how we receive others' gender presentation from ""manlike or womanlike"" to masculine/feminine/androgynous/neutral. We can try to see behaviours as confident/belligerent/diplomatic/modest instead of attaching gendered roles to them (and then feeling weird when this doesn't match the expectations of an assigned gender).

It's hard at first, but fortunately the longer we train ourselves to do this, the easier it gets. The effects of neuroplasticity do weaken as we age, but our brains are still fundamentally built to learn stuff. With practice, anything we repeat for long enough becomes second-nature.
Yes, this! It can be found on mobile under community guidelines.
Appreciate that, thank you!
I'm not going to tell a woman that it's bad for her to want to be perceived as a woman, but I WILL get fucking pissed when you tell me that literally anything about me other than the words coming out of my mouth saying ""yes that's what I am""  *makes* me one. Or a man, for that matter.
I agree, as a trans man, I fucking hate the idea of passing. It's a common issue in the trans community that people aren't considered trans because they don't pass or don't attempt to pass. I don't care if I pass, i dont care if i dont have a masculine body, i dont care if i wear dresses and i dont care if i wear make up, I am a man no matter how I am perceived by others. My gender is what I say it is.

Edit: in many areas of the world, some people need to pass for their own safety and security which I completely understand. Of course the fact that one needs to pass for their safety isn't great, but I'm not gonna hate on people for wanting to pass so that they don't get bashed, arrested etc.
Lol I was worried you'd kick me out for being a sassy b\*\*\*\*
It... isn't. It is absolutely ridiculous to say that all mental health conditions which can have triggers can say that something that something is a trigger for them, but only those with PTSD are allowed to say triggered. That is bizarre and pedantic. As someone who has been through traumatic events, it does not hurt me in any way if someone dealing with panic attacks says that they were triggered by something. Nitpicky infighting between people with differing mental health conditions, dysphoria, etc. doesn't do anything positive.

We can try to see behaviours as confident/belligerent/diplomatic/modest instead of attaching gendered roles to them (and then feeling weird when this doesn't match the expectations of an assigned gender).

I do kinda cling to the weird notion that associating these constellations of loosely-related traits to the ideas of ""masculine"" and ""feminine"" isn't in itself problematic. Like, we can say that tending to be physically larger,  having a deeper and louder voice, being more outgoing, competitive or aggressive, having facial hair and clothes that accentuate upper-body size, etc are generally ""masculine"" traits; and tending to be smaller, more empathetic and collaborative, wearing softer fabrics and makeup etc are generally ""feminine"". Those terms are the semi-permeable membranes that hold those groups of related characteristics together. 

The problem is when we treat those categories as prescriptive, rather than descriptive. When we say there's something wrong with a male-bodied/male-identifying person not being ""masculine enough."" The judgment that a man is ""doing maleness wrong"" when he embraces his feminine traits as well as the masculine ones, and vice versa. 

In other words, it's not that these groupings of traits aren't real or are morally bad; it's that they're not mandatory. I think this is the mistake a lot of people (mostly guys) make when they object to gender-diversity. They think we're trying to erase the *concepts* of masculinity and femininity, to make the categories themselves problematic. But i don't think we need to do that. We just need to understand that all of it is optional. ""Feminine"" men, ""masculine"" women, both cis and trans, and NB folks all need to be equally welcome to embrace and express all of the traditionally masculine *and* feminine traits that make up their authentic selves. 

I guess what i'm saying is super obvious, but i find it interesting how the *way* we talk about this is evolving.
WHOOPS. I had no idea could see all this on the Community Info button—still newish to Reddit. Thanks!
As someone with ptsd, I’ve been mocked and ridiculed for the use of the word “triggered” because it’s come to represent anything that upsets someone. In reality, the meaning of the word in this usage is that a specific situation triggers forward traumatic memories and behavioural responses, which cause the person to act out or behave in erratic or inconsistent ways, often detrimental to themselves or others

People watched this happening from the outside and started using “triggered” as a word to equal “getting upset and losing your cool”, without acknowledging the traumatic intent and reason behind these words. For the longest time, I wasn’t comfortable using the word “triggered” to refer to my ptsd despite my psychologist using it *because* of the connotations that the online community has placed on it. 

There’s been a surge in the ptsd and subtype community to take back the word to mean specifically trauma responses, rather than “anything upsetting”. The same word can have multiple meanings depending on how it’s used. When used as “triggers [blank]”, it’s fine, but without the context of what is being triggered the assumption is traumatic experiences. The state of being “triggered” is a trauma-induced one at its core. 

I understand you may feel differently, and that’s fine, I’m just voicing my perspective on this issue as one of many ptsd survivors who are tired of this word being used in contexts that don’t reflect what it actually means. The word carries with it the weight of the struggles, experiences, and healing journeys of millions of trauma survivors, and using the word simply because it holds the weight they’re hoping to convey and vaguely resembles another use of the word that *is* appropriate is not okay
This is again missing the point completely. I'm not going to continue explaining this to you. You can read through the multiple comments I've made in this thread and actually listen to the words of people in your community are saying if you want. I understand that you're still a pretty freshly cracked egg. But that means you need to listen and learn from people who have been in the community for sometime. Hell, I've only been aware of my own identity for about a year and a half. But I've spent that time listening to other people in the community. Learning what is and isn't harmful. You need to do the same and stop with the self victimization. No one is coming after you.
Friend. When you've cooled off a bit, I really want you to read back through this thread. You are wildly misinterpreting what people are saying to you. No one is telling you that your very presence is harmful. Personally though, I'm over the self victimization. So you're welcome to figure this out on your own or with someone else once you've chilled out.
That's interesting, and certainly a valid way to look at things. Personally I'm drawn to the ideal of a post-gender world (one where the average person is so free in their presentation that these traits stop being useful to categorise any given person as one gender or another), but I can accept that others see it as flavour."	z0zyam	NonBinary	2397	0.97	2022-11-21 14:11:46
"Best rant on my pronouns I've seen. I think ""shitlord"" is my favorite insult now"		"Also, singular ""they"" is older than singular ""you""
I explain this to people all the time and it just... they just blank it. It's amazing.
The good thing about shitlord is its a genderless pronoun too
> People use they when **they** should use he, she, or it

How can a person be this dense, my god??? 

Edit: I'm the dense one lol. ""People"" is plural
People that don’t study language fail to realize that languages change, because people who use them change, societies change. Languages evolve with their users needs. We have a lot of new words related to technology (or new uses for old words, like “mouse” for a clicking hardware that is not an animal). Anyone who actually studies grammar knows that. I’m Brazilian and I used to study languages in college some 20 years ago, and that’s like the subject of our first class in the first year. I’m really upset about this kind of stupid argument (and we are facing it A LOT with our current 💩 of a government trying to legally stop gender neutral language from spreading, which is absolute nonsense and waste of time, because language exists according to its users needs, and we non-binary folks exist, even though Portuguese and all Latin-derived languages are strongly gendered!). Languages change and it’s impossible to stop it. You have to be an absolute idiot to say you are “defending” grammar if you are trying to keep a language from evolving according to the real world that surrounds it!
\>well... actually... no...

god, the melodramaticism here is noxious enough to wipe out a small village all in one go.
""Someone dropped their keychain, I will take it to the security guard for them to find."" Duh.
An oldie, but a goodie. Dicknut is my personal favourite.
To say that my mom is a ""Word Wizard"" as she calls herself, she will literally throw a fit when I tell her that ""they"" has been used as a singular since elementary school. They taught us this in primary. Why as soon as I tell her a friend of mine goes by they/them, she degrades them to people who have ""multiple personalities""? If you were a grammar queen or whatever you call yourself, you would know that they has been used as a singular before.
As an enby this shit pisses me off. 

As a linguistics nerd, this shit makes me wanna start a crusade. 


These people act like they care about grammar, but in reality they don’t give a shit about linguistics. Almost all linguists talk about being “descriptivists”. 

Prescriptivists prescribe how language *should* be spoken, whereas descriptivists simply describe how language is used. 

These are the same people to complain about “libary” and “aks” despite the fact that a lot of them say things like “perscription” “ar(g)ue”. 

What people don’t realize is that there’s variation in language and it’s all valid. If you don’t like it, it’s because of racism, sexism, classism, homophobia, or transphobia. 

Simple. 

I’m not even sorry if it hurts your feelings anymore. 


Facts don’t care about your feelings.
> People use they when THEY should use...

We are gathered here today to explicitly _not_ mourn the loss of another foolish grammar nazi that can't even follow their own rules because their own rules are dumb.
“Dense motherfucker” 🤣🤣🤣
We all need to start using the wonderful word ""pantaloons"" more.
Should send this to my dad
I hate when people use dictionaries as an argument, and then when you show them an in depth article by Oxford explaining singular They and its origins, they decide dictionaries aren't right anymore
The first evidence of singular they goes all the way back to the 1800s, doesn't it? Like, this is very much not a new thing.

When I was in elementary school (ugh, over a decade ago now, goodness gracious...) we were taught that if you don't know whether someone is a boy or girl, you use they. The teacher gave examples like, ""if you find someone's glasses and you don't know who owns them, you'd say 'someone lost their glasses' because it's less complicated than saying 'his or hers' every time.""

The only reason people have a problem with singular they/them now is because individual persons who experience gender as something other than 100% man or 100% woman have specifically asked that people use the gender neutral pronoun instead of he/she.

These people aren't actually concerned with grammar, it is literally JUST transphobia.

These people refuse to acknowledge that not only is singular they/them not a new thing, but that language changes constantly. We're not still saying ""nifty"" as common vernacular to say that something is interesting, we aren't still using thee/thy/thine/thou in every day speech. And actually, if they are so insistent that they/them can only ever be plural, they need to stop using singular ""you"" and go back to thee/thy/thine/thou. ""You"" was originally plural, so if the function of a word cannot ever ever change, ""you"" is for a group of people, ""cool"" can only mean slightly cold (not ""good"") and awesome is only allowed to be used if something strikes you with a fearful amazement.
My Mom should read this.  🥴
You could argue Shakespeare using it doesn't count for anything because he was prone to making shit up. But I don't think Chaucer was.
In the realm of gender neutral insults, ""chucklefuck"" is one of my favorites.

""I care more about my first grade understanding of grammar than I do about being respectful to human beings"".

Cool.
""well... actually... no... they is plural. people use they when **they** should use he, she, or it."" bloody brilliant
My favorite is the miguel comment literally reading ""people use they when **they** should use"" xyz
I heard this from my partner, whom I met through [TS Dates](https://datingadvocate.com/ts-dates), and we had discussions regarding these pronouns.

Many people still don't understand them, but soon they will!
And if that whole argument doesn’t work you can just tell them that language is all made up noises and we can say whatever the fuck we want
They literally used it in that comment
Murdered by words

This takes the whole grammar Nazi thing to another level of stupidity.
And this is why I love Tumblr
""melodramatic dipshit"" ""dense motherfucker""
Damn I guess there are still two straight people left on tumblr lol
I'm with Camille Paglia on this.  I hate having to list my own preferred pronouns on my correspondence and have pointed out that there is a perfectly useful non-gendered pronoun in our language, ""it.""  I don't think that would be acceptable, though I'd be comfortable being referred to by that pronoun because the multiplicity of options is nonsensical.
Right? I’m still fucking salty about losing thou. Do you know how much meaning you can get by when you used ‘thou’ vs ‘you’ for a single person? Bitches can take singular they when they give me my fucking thou back.
My favorite fact is that it's older than using the letters ""th"" to make that sound, in some werewolf book that I don't remember the name of, they spelled it with the letter thorn
What sucks for older people is that we were humiliated growing up by teachers who did not let us refer to singular entities as they. It’s not hard to use a preferred pronoun though.
People usually blank it for me when i bring up that ""you"" is both used as singular and plural
Shitlaird actually. Shitlord is for men. Shitlady is for women.
not a pronoun and not genderless... but pretty good anyway
I noticed this. I want to print it out, decoupage it to a brick, then beat Miguel wirh it.

Edit:spelling
They said people, not person, so not that I want to defend them but they were using it as a plural.
My non-binary boyfriend told me I should add that ""Grammar exists to serve us, not the other way around"". There’s a Brazilian writer called Luis Fernando Verissimo, and he once wrote that we should slap language every once in a while so it knows who’s the boss, or something like it 😂

It's the exact same behavior of people citing their first grade understanding of biology to justify that nonbinary people can't possibly exist.😠 They suddenly care so much! while knowing absolute fuck-all about what they think they're referencing.

People is plural
1700s actually. 1735 IIRC

Edit: ACTUALLY 1375 I’m just mildly dyslexic apparently, so like 600 something years of singular they being in use.
all language comes from making shit up
You can thank the removal of thorn for that
Beowulf! Also r/bringbackthorn
I really think we all need to remember that prescriptivism is death for languages and usually it's super racist too so you know what? We're gonna throw it out of the window and remember that languages evolve.
Is second person singular 'you' ever paired with a verb that doesn't match third person plural?? 🤔

What do you want / What do those folks want
You go / They go
You jump / They jump

... o.o The fact that 'you' is both singular and plural is not new to me, but I think it ALSO always pluralizes verbs...
It's a nice, efficient way of the trash taking itself out IG...

And what's crazy is it could have still been used in the singular in that sentence. I don't know if they did that specifically to prove a point or if they actually don't know it can be used as singular.
That makes a lot of sense! 😂
.. or its 🥲

People are dogs according to that Person 🤣
I get that, but in everyday speak, it's okay. And anytime I tell her this she gets so pissed with me, saying that we (gen z specifically) are all crazy
Thanks lol. 

I just upsets me and I’m tired of trying to explain it to people “nicely”. 

The only reason they care about it is they either just hate a certain group that does something linguistically (and so it’s easier to attack the linguistics than the group) 

Or they simply have a linguistic prejudice (which is also bigotry) and they’ve just never examined it because linguistics isn’t taught. 

Ugh socio-linguistics should be a required course in HS or something.
Yep. It’s so frustrating. 

Or when people start to care that scientifically Ariel lives under the ocean and having dark skin wouldn’t make sense. 

Or whatever else conservatives are scared of lately.
Interesting... I think my brain read it as ""[individual] people use..."" which seems, it's hard to describe, but less like the subject is plural and more like the whole sentence is plural (many actions) where each instance of the action described would have a singular subject.

Then again, replacing the ""offending"" 'they' with 'he/she' doesn't sound right to my ears, which means the pronoun should grammatically be plural regardless of the semantics.

Ah well, you win some you lose some. Now I know to slow down and verify the search for a 'they' with a check on the referent!
So, yeah. Extremely NOT a new thing.

I do not want to be viewed as a gender, I want to be viewed as a threat.		"i got an incredibly strong mental image of waking up on the deck of a steampunk ship from this image i like it a lot
Yees, steampunk enbies are my favorite!
Looking very Dr. Horrible's Sing-Along Blog. Check out that musical if you haven't yet. :)
“Hey you you’re finally awake” but make it a steampunk ship full of nonbinary criminals adkgdgdhsns
Good news! It’s 2020 everything is a threat
***NO GENDER, ONLY THREAT***
Hell ya then you are a threat my fellow human. :)
This is the type of energy I need in my life
You look like the hot scrappy character that can Hotwire vehicles and give us funny quips during our adventure
If I woke up to this I think my little enby heart might pop! You look so good!
Damn I usually hate animal prints but you're rockin it.
You're god damn right! And you're fucking ROCKING that look, my friend!! You've got my transition goal pulled off, i want to make people question their sexuality by looking at me and going ""she's cute...wait, no, he? Is that a he? A she?"" I live for the double takes darling.


You have such a well-made aesthetic here, you don't need gender!!
I just want your goggles
I can just see myself bumping into you and saying “oh sorry your new around here right? let me show you around.”
Gog-goals
Ah yes the 3 genders woman, man, and THREAT! I personally am a threat as well.
*infomercial narrator voice* Now with coronavirus, you can!
Ok same
Those glasses give me Leo Valdez vibes lol
a threat to my confidence. you look amazing
You look like you could beat my ass and still my significant other if I had one
Please dont... hurt meh....
You seem way too cute, to be a threat
I'm thoroughly intimidated, and I think I like it!  😆
Fucking threat to the Hetero-patriarchy
Oooh just realized we are leopard print buddies today!
Do you moderate your galactic radio station on a cruiser by any chance? :D
*slaps your face with both hands to show I come in peace* (there's 3 types of faces in the world. 1) the ones I wanna slap with both hands in peace 2) the ones I wanna slap with one hand in annoyance 3) the other face)
Dr. Horrible fused with a leopard print Cruella De Vil.
Aha, me too
Same!!! 😂
Major steampunk vibes. Love it!
Sounds like a speech a Bond villain would make.
A threat to my composure, oh damn! 🤩🤩😍🤩🙈

It’s working 🔥🔥🔥
10/10 intimidating!
FHSDHKF u look amazing thank you

Woah

AARRRGGHHH!!!  

&#x200B;

/pout
Your style is absolutely fantastic.
That’s a mood!
That's is literally what im striving for
I am officially in love
Mood tho
Is that a threat?

I feel unsafe.
ROYALTY
THIS IS A VIBE I CAN GET BEHIND
Non-binary pirates. Transhuman bodies for a post gender world.
You give me ""more likeable main characters best friend"" vibes
Umm umm hecc you’re amazingly attractive asf!!!! 😍
You are definitely rocking it.
The caption is relatable lol

I love your outfit!
Loving your aesthetic.
I see no gender I only see a hottie
It's working, I feel threatened already. At least I think that's what I'm feeling.
Goals
Those goggles are sick!!
badass
Okay sry but like, that’s kind of really hot tho
ah you, you’re finally awake,
Thank youuu. It's such a ""Well hello there, stowaway"" look.
That's one of my favourites! Love a villain who's bad at his job, lmao.
I thought the same thing! And to think, it only cost a penny.
I want in
Lmao
The two are not mutually exclusive, my friend.

I mean, sure I *could* conform to my assigned gender... or I could WEAR THESE PANTS THAT GIVE ME LEGS FOR DAYS		"pants, wear the pants
People still use the gender their parents picked out for them? We laugh
Those are excellent pants. I'm a bit jealous.
I vote that you wear the pants.
I may be on the asexual spectrum but HOT DAMN
Pants are definitely the better option
please, please, please don’t conform to your assigned gender. this is much better.
*bangs on the table rythmically* PANTS PANTS PANTS!
Well now I need some of those pants! Mind sharing the brand?
cool pants
God what a look
High waisted pants/shorts/skirt/whatever w shirt tucked in >>>> anything else
Legs for days!? More like legs for *years*.
High waisted pants are such an enby aesthetic tbh I don't even associate them with assigned genders anymore
dem legs hehe
Damn! It would be deeply, morally wrong for you to let something silly like gender norms stop you from wearing those pants.
Wait, you mean you're NOT David Tennant?

BULLLLLSHIIIIIITTT

Anyway, David Tennant, you look incredible in those jeans.
we all know the superior option
Legs for days... And days, and days...
Are you using stilts under those pants cause god damn you tall
Ok but my question is... how does the crotch feel? I struggle with this
anyone who dares tell you to not wear the pants should be banished off the face of the earth. those are some attractive pants right there.
i have a crush on you
The pants. Definitely stick with those pants. They were made for you!
You look great wish I had the confidence to dress the way I want
lookin like 2D from Gorillaz out here. it’s a good look though!
You look incredible in those pants
Oh my lawd those pants look absolutely fab on you
What’s on the menu?
Legs; legs!
Legs for months. LEGS FOR CENTURIES
LOOK AT ALL THEM LEGS YES
Hell yeah
It took my 4am brain way too long to process that no, your legs are not disproportionally long in comparison to the rest of your body.
PANTS
Pants are in, gender is last season.
Those look amazing on you! Wear the goddamn pants!!
Oh yesssss I love it!
omggg
Sooo cute! Aesthetic goals for sure~
your legs are perfect! great pants OP
YES you look absolutely amazing!
be my bestfriend pls omg
Finding the right pants is the best. Congrats, you look great. :D
They look so good on you!
😍😍😍
High waisted skinny jeans are a LOOK and you're killing it
😍😍😍
Incredible. I need to try this look out now
Absolutely gorgeous 😍😍😍
You look beautiful. I want those ;-;
You, captain, have excellent legs.

Living for this look 👀

For DAAAAAYYYYYYYYS

Real talk, you look amazing! I wish I could wear high waisted jeans as good as you.
Gorgeous.

I would eat those legs ngl

I mean, your username is basically the premise of this post...
As they say: username checks out.
You can’t beat home cooked gender
So last season
You have no idea how long it took me to find juuuust the right pair online
I feel like if I should definitely take advice from anyone, it’s someone with the username Lesbian_communist. Someone from the schools of Butler and Marx must be on to something
Glad to cater to a broad audience ☺️
Here's the exact pair: [https://www.asos.com/au/asos-tall/asos-design-tall-ankle-length-stretch-skinny-pants-in-black/prd/12562255?cta](https://www.asos.com/au/asos-tall/asos-design-tall-ankle-length-stretch-skinny-pants-in-black/prd/12562255?ctaRef=my%20orders)
I’d love to get some high waisted shorts... someday I’ll be brave enough for a skirt (maybe)
This is basically every outfit I own nowadays 😂
We have annexed them.
Hahaha, I used to get called David Tennant all the time! No one’s said that to me for about 6 years now!
I promise you, I’m no more than 6’ and that I’m not using anything any more insidious than Doc Martens.
Underpants fit in pants. So if you can fit in your underpants, you can fit in pants. Also, women’s fit jeans are stretchier, so there’s a bit of an allowance there.
Aw, shucks...
It’s taken me a lot of growth to get as far as I have, and this is one of my good days. Patience, dear heart
When my friend and I were in a band together, we'd try and figure out which members of our band were most like which member of some other band. Despite me playing bass and my friend playing keyboard, I was 2D, and he, ominously, was Murdoc...
Legs, legs, spam, legs and spam
I think that means the pants are working
There’s a link to them somewhere in these comments
🥰
I’m sure there are styles out there that you could (and should) rock 1,000x better than I could!
Are you flirting with me?
You’re cute. Try better.
It has never been this topical, you're right
I love this. Haha
*roll your own gender*
I sure can imagine. Buying pants is a nightmare even when you're not GNC. Congrats on finding them!
i luv the shoes two, the whole outfit is a vibe
But now I needa know where you got these 👀
Wow I wanted to ask the exactly same question and then was a bit sad because it's from their tall collection.  Then I realised that it's the women's tall collection and that I'm actually in the range for it considering that I'm actually 5'9"" (still wish i was a bit taller though). 

Also on a scale from ""it's women's pants, what do you expect"" to ""I'm positively surprised and am only sort of missing my functional guy pockets"" how would you rate them?
Thanks! How's the sizing?
thank 👏🏻 you 👏🏻
How long does the leg actually come out on these? I bought some plain black trousers from the ASOS womens tall range and the legs are like 37 inches long, it's insane
*DO IT*
Anything would look fabulous on you!!
hooray! retrofuturism!
True. I guess I need tighter fitting underpants. I just have a lot of baggy stuff that rides up and is uncomfortable.
oh no
Aww you're sweet! I'll do my best.
Thank you for the great comment, u/FuckMelnTheAssDaddy
You could mean smoking or D&D and I’m here for either (or both)
ASOS. There’s a link on another comment.
I can fit my phone in them, but I’m worried about it falling out whenever I sit down. Hasn’t happened yet though. I can fit my keys and wallet in them too, but it kills the fit. I usually have a jacket with pockets or a satchel on me anyway. These are the lengths we must go to so that the world may bask in our magnificence. It is our burden to carry.

(Note: that’s the inclusive we, not the royal we)
I mean, these size 10's fit me great! I think that's pretty consistent with other womens' pants I've tried on
🥰
You could just not wear underwear. It's the cheaper option lol.
helpful correction: u/FuckMelnTheAssDaddy (it's a lowercase L not an uppercase i)
definitely both
That sounds quite good for ""women's"" pants actually! I usually tend to put my things in my jacket or bag/backpack as well but it's always nice to know that technically you're not doomed to be carrying everything in your hands when everything else fails. Thank you for your enlightenment dear stranger and may you continue looking absolutely wonderful in your pants!
r/sewing recently had a post from someone who augmented all their pants with functional pockets in one afternoon. It was pretty simple, too!
So THAT'S why it linked somewhere else, thank you mate.

My six month TRANSformation: I’m more confident, gender euphoric, and body positive!		"Coming out has been a long journey for me, and getting top surgery two weeks ago was the best decision of my life. I’m the happiest with myself and with my body that I’ve ever been! YAY!!
Congrats! Also damn you're *shredded*
You genuinely look so much happier! Congrats 🥰
That smile positively glows :)
That is so awesome! I'm so glad that you are feeling better in your skin :)
You look so good. Also do you have any fitness tips?
I’m so happy for you! And you seem so much happier too congrats! :D
that smile in the second pic is intoxicating
You look so awesome!
I heard u/weez_the_wizard had an 8pack, that they were shredded.
Woxers are the best!
LOOK ST YOU
ive never considered using trans tape of any kind. i have a binder that doesn’t work super well for me bc im a 36dd :/ does tape do a better job than a binder can for larger chests?
And hot!!!!
-#goals -
holy shit, gender envy!! You look absolutely stunning and handsome!
U can see the happiness in the second picture !!! Enjoy !!
Can I ask if you always hated your chest or that you fell out with them over time? I think about top surgery, but I’m also attached to my boobs in a way (maybe it’s just cause I love boobs and I feel I’m never getting any from another source y’know) wink wink) lol) dear god) yes, I just said that) any hoo…
you look so handsome (in the most gender neutral way possible) and so happy!!
Your after photo says it all!!!
you look awesome!!
You definitely seem a lot happier. Congratulations!
Amazing. So proud of you, and we’re all glad you’re happy.
Hey dude, you look great! Are you on t now / were you before surgery? Feel free to not answer if too personal… I’m getting top surgery in a few months and just trying to figure out what kind of results I can expect as someone not on t.
im jealous :(
You look great!

Jealous of them abs tho lol
So happy for you OP!
You look so happy I’m so happy for you!!
Congrats! Also shout out to the Woxer brand, that shit is so comfy.
Hi Friend!!!
You look so happy, congratulations man.
I have a question, do the scars heal or do they stay that way? Also congratulations on getting top surgery!!! I’m happy for you!!!!! ✨✨
How bad does top surgery hurt?
Yes! My main sport is triathlon, but ive been doing that for two years now and never really noticed a change in my physique until i started eating healthier. Ive been eating intuitively and choosing healthy options (with one sweet per day to ease my cravings) and making sure i under-eat by 300-500 calories. Over time, i actually noticed a big difference! Also, DRINK MORE WATER! It helps your body digest faster and metabolize quicker, storing less fat.
This is the sweetest compliment anyones ever said to me! Thank you!
🥺
I dont have a large chest, but i noticed trans tape helped my back not hurt as much.
Omg you flatter me
Thank you!!!!
Honestly, i completely relate to what youre saying. I never hated my chest but i felt more comfortable with myself when i looked in the mirror with a binder on versus with a bra on. My best advice is to think about how you genuinely see yourself in your head. For me, i see myself as a genderless blob so no boobs made sense (i love confusing the Karens who try to gender me in public). Its all about self reflection!
Im actually not on T and ive never been. The doctors were totally fine with me not being on hormones! If you have any more intimate questions about surgery please message me id be happy to share!
It barely hurt! The first three days were uncomfortable from the drains but i got my drains out on day 4 so after that i didnt even need any Tylenol!
It really depends on the person and method.
Shouldn’t hurt at all, usually you go under anesthesia during surgery and afterwards your surgeon will generally prescribe you pain killers to take while you are healing.
Thanks for the tips. Diet is my Achilles heel
Love these tips! Thanks!
That's amazing!
As someone who eats like an 12 year old with a credit card, I feel this comment in my soul.
Trust me… i struggled for a long time to find what worked for me
I've never seen my diet described so accurately before
I'll do my best to find what works. Thanks for your responses.

A comic I made after I got my hair done! The most gender euphoria I’d ever felt 😍		"This was the feeling i had when a friend took me to get acrylic nails done...I was so happy...then hated them within a day because fucking typing sucks with long nails
Love it! This is same good!
Hmm maybe I should dye my hair at some point… I had a feeling almost like this when I first got bangs though lol
Same with my first crew cut. Couldn't stop smiling for three days. I even smile now  that I remember it.
When I started cutting my own hair (I actually make it look as good as a salon cut!), I had that same feeling... Like my hair has gone Super Sayajin 3 the way theirs in the comic did!
Its amazing isn't it. You feel like You.
I felt like this after getting my eyebrow pierced. That sudden snap is like magic.
I love seeing your comics.

I’ve only seen a few of them but they always feel relatable and honest in a way that’s nice to see.

Your art style is also adorable. Keep up the good work!!!
Get this feeling anytime I get to wear non gender specific clothing (baggy shirts for example)
This was the feeling I had when I first dyed my hair. I felt like the newness of me! At that time I didn't realize the build up of being non-binary was me, becoming me.
I had my hair done recently too and it was also the most gender euphoria I’ve ever felt!!! (The only gender euphoria I’ve ever felt, actually.) It’s truly such a wonderful experience and that’s amazing that you experienced it too.
I can't wait for the day I can be myself, which I hope is soon.
Bet you look amazing!
One day...
This was literally me when my brother helped cut my hair from a nasty matted mess that I tried to hack at with scissors to pretty much this style! Love the artwork!
I felt the same way when I got a my shaggy pixie cut. I still love it!
Oh my god this is exactly how I felt this week getting my hair done
Had this same feeling the first time I tried having my hair at medium length and died blonde. Also put pink in it too, which is also wonderful.
Haha true, that’s so wonderful though I’m glad you had that affirming experience!
You learn to use the pads of your fingers instead of your fingertips. It's definitely a pain to get used to, though
[deleted]
Thank you so much ❤️❤️❤️ I’ll keep making them 😌
Also 3rd frame where the hair transforms is hot
Absolutely! ❤️
That’s amazing! Glad you also had that experience :)

💅		"yeah fuck where did it go
I may have lost my gender identity in late middle age, but I'm finding a new one.
I love how virginity is rainbow and subtly implies it could've been an extremely gay experience 😭
Sorry to be that guy but 'virginty' got me
Lol, imagine having a gender! 💛🤍💜🖤
My dog ate it along with my homework.
ha ha nice!
This meme is amazing! 🌠👏

It's hilarious and on point.

Cause, that's more or less how it went.

Thank you OP 💚
Imagine having one gender *laughs in demigirl*
True!
I've never lost my virginity, as for gender identity, well I can't really lose what I never had can I?
I lost mine but I haven't made i to high-school yet lol
Hmmm have you looked in the washing machine? Mine always gets stuck inside the sealing if I forget to take it out of my pockets before washing.
I sold mine on eBay for 5 bucks, got some nice sour cream and onion lays chips afterwards.
yikes
Yeah, I have literally the same
It woulda been nice if mine left so early, was a couple years late on that one
Not to brag. But I lost both and my mind.
Bro I lost it in middle school
i ate it sorry i was just so hungry
facts
(me too but don't tell)🤫😂
Same here ♠️💜💚🤍
Absolutely, gender is extremely overrated. 🖤🤍💚🤍🖤
Couldn't be me
imagine knowing how many genders you are *laughs in unlabeled genderqueer*

But mom said I could eat the last gender

I'm in this photo and I don't like it		"I’m “they/them only but if someone irl says she I’m not gonna say anything because I have anxiety”
they/she

Conflict is the first choice for me. 😜
I feel so seen rn
[deleted]
... oh
I will never say that someone’s pronouns are wrong. However, to all enbies that use binary pronouns, stop and think: is it for you? Or is it to make the people around you comfortable?

Hint: anyone that you need to make feel comfortable by doing that can go fuck themselves.
Me when my country doesn't legally recognise non-binary identities: guess I have to choose between being seen as a cis guy or a trans gal
I think I started out as ""he/they"" last year for those exact reasons. Woof!
Maybe I'm weird because some people actually use they/them for me, while others use he/him, but I genuinely like and am fine with both. Both make me happy because I am a gender nonconforming man, so both are reflective of my gender.

....idk....is that weird? I'm totally fine being the odd one out on this, but I'd like to know if it is weird because if it's weird then I need to be more mindful of how I communicate this and more mindful of what pronouns I use for someone if they give they/them and another option and be more mindful of asking if they have a preference if I'm given multiple options. (Holy run-on sentence batman! I'm too sleepy for better punctuation)
They/Them as in peace was never an option.
My favorite/most accurate to me is that I’m they/he; as in I prefer they but will not correct my mother in law
Who took this from my diary
S l a s h
I just go through the day hoping nobody asks. Mostly, my pronouns feel like Idon'tknow/what.
They / she as in 

Common guys I want to feel euphoria 

*slash* 

I guess I technically don’t mind birth gender it’s just so unoriginal of you
He/they and yes.
I’m fae/faem unless like anyone who isn’t my fiancée asks in which case she is fine I’m sorry for existing
Oh shit there I am. Literally just commented on the same lines. I hate making waves and am also so very tired
I'm genuinely they/he/she (or just any), but can you use one of the first two preferably? Cuz I get enough of the last one day to day...
see I'm they/she as in

I'm actually a sentient blob of electricity trapped in and forced to pilot a traditionally femininely shaped meat mech

*s l a s h* 

People don't bother using my pronouns and 96% of the time i can't be arsed to correct them but I'm still gonna die a little inside each time.
""Call me anything but idiot""👍
I started out that way for exactly that reason, but then said screw it. They/them all day, except I'm not correcting people cuz I don't have energy for that.
This is so relatable it hurts :'(
They/Them but no worries if not! 😅😅😅🥺
i’m bummed this is so many folks reality. i’m they exclusively to make the mark & not let people walk over me, because if they do once they will again
Me recently as I went from Cis AMAB to NB to demifem in one image
She/them as in I live in a slavic country where gender neutral pronouns are not really a thing besides ""it""
This Reminds Me Of The One Time Someone Was Yelling About How I'd Get Mad If They Called Me Anything Other Than They/Them, On A Discord Server Where I Literally Had A Role Entitled ""Any Pronoun's Fine"". Like If You're Gonna Get Mad At My Pronouns At Least Have The Decency To Read What They Are Jesus Christ.

~~Anyway I Too Dislike Conflict, Which Is Why I Usually Avoid Telling People My Pronouns At All, But Then Just Silently Judge Them Based On What They Use.~~
im they/them but i dont care
She/they because I don’t wanna be asked questions 🥹
She/they/he: avatar, master of all genders 👐
On of my favourite enby jokes is by Clara Oshansky: ""I'm none binary, my pronouns are they/them, unless you use other ones - I'm not confrontational""
I enjoy being called they. I don’t mind being called she. I would not like to be called he.
She/Fae here and yeahhhhhhh
She/they as in I think I might prefer she/her but I'm too scared to commit to it.
I’m she/her as in I’m terrified of confrontation *slash* they’re the only pronouns I don’t hate on me 💀💀
Yes.
They/she,haven't tried out he but ik I do like masculine words like,brother,son when used for me. I feel like I'd like he alot though
This is basically what I told a coworker when she asked about my pronouns in my email signature
He/They as in I want to avoid conflict *slash*  I have a secret gay gender *slash* If you call me She I'd be so happy I'd be a blushing mess which is inappropriate in polite society
He/she/they as long as its clear you talk to me or about me i do not give an ducking sh*t.
😔
REAL
this is exactly why I got by they/she...sigh....lol
perfect
I love this
""unspecified gay gender"" i love this!
She/They: *I'm not a girl.... not yet a god....*
Chiming in as a transfemme she/they, we also exist! Not trying to intrude on this post, I just think a lot of the time people assume this is the *only* kind of she/they.
They/them only but I let other correct people for me and sometimes dont even tell people my pronouns until I've decided they aren't scawwy
Thats me too lol
that’s me but with he, and i’m spanish so i am always using neutral gender marks when referring to myself but if they mess up i can’t bring myself to say anything, i just remark more the gender marks. and if i don’t feel comfortable with the other person knowing i ommit the gender letter when speaking, so i could have said anything. taking no gender to another extreme ahaha
they/he because I accept mediocrity
They/he but I was AFAB so I guess still putting the conflict second!
Saaaaame - I joke that we are chaotic neutral. Don't trust those of us with ""they"" as the first pronoun 😁
Thinking about saying this
Couldn't have said it better myself
Well I Know I Get Happy From Both 'They' And 'She', I Don't Know If I Actually Like 'He' Or If I'm Just So Used To Being Called It My Entire Life That I Can't Tell.
It is 100% to make the people around me comfortable but making people comfortable is my gender
i do it bc i have (please help me figure this one out) transphobic gay parents

idon’t understand in the slightest and im not about to try to figure them out. if i was able to distance myself from them, i would, but unfortunately i can’t right now which blows big time
woof?
Not weird at all! You are totally valid 💛
That Definitely Seems Pretty Normal To Me. Honestly My Default Assumption When I See Someone Give Multiple Sets Of Pronouns Is That They Like Both, And Thus I'll Try To Use Both For Them.
My gender is simply chaos goose.
Same 😆
Me. If I'm completely honest with myself I wouldn't mind going by he/they/she or they/he/she but I know if I ever dare to use again she, even just one time, others will default to it.
Literally me
Sameeee
Conflict... oh you wanted to dodge the conflict? Well GUESS WHAT SUCKER!
I feel so called out by this, lol. Are you my doppelganger?
Same but the opposite.
Oh of course, I’m not blaming anyone that makes any choice for their personal safety. My above advice for people who have the personal freedom to cut people out of their life, or at least have healthy distance from them.
I meant ""woof"" in how accurate this post was for me!

You're so cute!
They look like an ex partner of mine (I live in New Zealand...same hair and colour, build, everything...wow!
Damn 😳
You are cute as hell!!

You look amazing!!!!
Today's gender is ""powerful"".  Congrats on being so winning-ful.  You look great!
I’m getting gender euphoria just by looking at you, you beautiful human!
Wow you are stunning! 😍

""You guys still have genders?""
*…must- fight- dad joke-…*

I think you just invented the Ginger Gender!
Haha!! I spit my afternoon tea out when I saw this post lmao!! Love it!

EDIT: such an attractive human, too 😍
Yeah, why they gotta brag?! (❤️❤️❤️)
Thank you ☺️☺️☺️
Thank you! I've always found it hard to present more masculine because of my large chest. Especially wearing a mask that hides my lil stache. I'm basically in the ""you can die mad about it"" phase of my evolution... So it makes it easier to feel confident about my presentation.
IKR? I can't stop looking at them.
Lol.. lipwig 😛😛 thanks friendo 😁
☺️☺️☺️ thanks
Aww shucks 🥰🥰🥰
It was a gift.. from my motherrr

My Chao asked me what my gender is in the first Chao Adventure....this game is from 1998		"Based game
I wish it was NEITHER! with the energy of the other two but I love it all the same.
What happens when you actually choose neither?
How far we’ve come!
🥺🥺🥺
i love this!
Well. I need to get some more batteries for my VMU and do another playthrough of SA1.
I wish Pokemon would get on that boat lol
Nice. The only games with non binary options I've played were Undertale and OFF
Based chao <3
That’s soo cool from a game that old
 neither 👹✨🧚‍♀️
That's amazing lol

Also had no idea this was a thing!!! Please do give more info, I'm a HUGE Sonic fan
N E I T H E R
My compressed reaction to this is...

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

...uwu!
Dreamcast was the best.
THEEE FUTUUUREEEE
I think all Chao are canonically genderless now.

Also, I believe all but one of the Koco (a mother Koco) are referred to by they/them pronouns in the new Sonic Frontiers game.
Not enough pixels on that screen I think lol
📢A BOY!!!🗣

📢A GIRL!!!🗣

*neither*👁👄👁
The game goes back to normal with the Chao walking and vibing
Chao gets to grow up without feeling pressured into societal gender roles. Probably gets some kickass sword too, cause idk where I got me kendo sword but I’ve realized us enby’s just seem to spawn with em lol.
So tru
Same tho
If you know where to get them and if you still have SA1 plus a Dreamcast then do it (idk what country you're in so I can't help with locating the batteries)
Shadows Over Loathing lets you choose between him, her, and them pronouns!
Monster Prom offers that too
Ayyyy, same, huge Sonic fan here as well

two things:  
A: Wdym exactly by more info? like the VMU game, VMU's as a whole or what? /gen /nm  
and  
B: If you're up for it, we could geek and nerd out about Sonic in either Reddit or Discord DM's (Discord is much easier for me tbh)
Noice, I honestly never even thought about the gender of Chao's tbh, also yeah, in Frontiers, Both Amy and Sonic refers to both multiple and singular Koko's with they/them pronouns
Dang, gender too large for screen
Yeah, idk what the resolution is but it is a really tiny screen
I still have my Dreamcast, VMU, and SA1 from launch in 99. I swapped out my batteries in the VMU last year but sure they're dead by now. Those things murder batteries. Haha
Harvestella for the switch
Forza Horizon 5 also has Enby options and I think NFS Unbound does as well (Not 100% sure with the latter)
A: info about the VMU game yea lol, or VMU in general because I've never heard of it until now lol
B: Absolutely!! I'll pm you my Discord username :D
Yep, 100%, gender is too large for the VMU
Noice, I wasn't even born when SA1 first came and only a baby when SA2 first came out, also, honestly the Dreamcast I have is my first ever one, i'd been wanting one for a while but never had the opportunity to get one until last month, also i've heard that the batteries in the VMu's can die quickly so I think I really need to stock up on some.
Well the VMU game ain't anything too impressive, however it is a VERY cute game that let's you raise your chao from SA1 while you're away from the Dreamcast doing IRL stuff and can very easily be transferred to and from the game, altho it is pretty sizey at 128 blocks of the VMU.

Also VMU is short for Visual Memory Unit as it triples as a save game organiser for DC games, a mini game console (that people have somehow put Pokémon on) and a clock...I don't get the point of the last function on it's own but here we are."	zhano0	NonBinary	2282	1.0	2022-12-09 22:23:47
First binder at 30. Feeling euphoric and hopefully looking ambiguously gendered		"Assigned Punk Singer at Birth
I love how it frames your chest tattoo!!
Two things. One: I can not in any way tell your AGAB visually. For me, it's impossible. 2: I'm 32 and you look so young! I had you pegged at maybe 20, 21 tops. I'm super jealous!
Wow, you're doing androgeny and aging wonderfully
fashion tip: to show off a binder, wear smth over it to accentuate its affect

other than that i think you’ve achieved ur goal :D
you look incredible!!
Your chest piece of CLEAN. Plan on getting it colored at all or leaving it as-is?
Oh my god 30?? You're looking hella good
It’s like it was made for you/your tattoo
Ambiguous as hell! 🔥
You look amazing and so comfortable! And I dig your rainbow window trim!
[deleted]
Ooh yay! I’m so excited for you. I’ll be getting my first binder at 40, so.. it’s never too late to live authentically. You also look younger than 30 😉
Very ambiguous gender uwu
Cool tattoos!
Im happy for you! I hope you find love and happiness in your life!
You look great! And I love your tattoos they’re done so well and look great on you!
You look amazing!
You look amazing! I love all your tattoos!
you look wonderful!
Maximum Androgyny
Cutie :3
looking great!
Was that from gc2b? Because I think I just got the exact same one as my first binder too!
You look so much like a guy at my school its freaking me out
Not many people can rock a straight-up binder and make it sexy. I find this look very aspirational 😍
fucking bad ass!
Lookin' Badass!!
You look amazing, and I got my first binder at 34. Welcome to the euphoria club!
You're tattoos are badass!
Cutee
...this sounds weird but I feel like we have very similar aesthetics and I love ur aesthetic cuz I love my aesthetic u look great
ok cool
Congrats! Isn’t it an amazing feeling? I finally ordered my second and third binders today—seeing your post got me excited again.
love it! what binder did you get? i just turned 30
and am thinking of getting my first binder as well
Super handsome! Love this. I am also 30 and just got my first binder! :) cheers!
Also, loveee your tattoos. 
Any way you can PM me a better photo of the eagle? I love the clean lines and grass at the bottom
Okay, this is goals.
It looks immaculate
first off: r/13or30 and second off yeah I can't tell at all
Awesome! It definitely looks great on you, and like the others have said, if I didn't know what a binder was, I'd have no idea what your AGAB was, so I'm sure you're ambiguously gendered to an outside perspective. Anyway, I'm happy for your euphoria. 😊
Hi friend! First of all, you look great! You’ve found the fountain of youth, for sure! Second, where did you buy your binder? I’ve been looking into getting one but don’t know where to start!
Your tats really suit you! Beautiful
Haha maybe this is what I'll tell the next person who asks me what my gender is
Thanks, me too!
Oh mate, you're too kind. I'm buzzing about your first point especially - that is the dream!
Lol that’s what I was thinking about the age! I’m getting wrinkles and it makes me feel old coming out this late in life. Please message me, cuz I’m always looking for people older to connect with. It is different. T and surgery.. we didn’t even have that as an option when i grew up!. :(
Thanks pal!
like a shirt with a print?
Thanks pal!
Yes it's meant to be coloured in but covid interrupted! Once the tattoo studios open again I'll get it finished. Thanks.
Thanks! I still get asked to prove my age in the pub so guess I'm doing something right.
Haha not immortal - as far as I know... Unless a lesbian vampire came and bit me and I didn't notice. But thanks pal!
Good for you pal! It's never too late for a binder!
Thank you! That is the goal
No, it's from Spectrum Outfitters in the UK. They are great! I'm glad to hear you got your debut binder too. Have fun with it!
Haha maybe there's some funky time space continuum stuff going on.
Thanks pal! Means a lot
I bet you look great too!
Awesome! Yeah I can already tell that numerous colours would come in handy
I got this one from Spectrum Outfitters, I recommend! Also, I didn't know how much I would love this one until I put it on so I think it's worth trying it out.
Thank you mate. It's very interesting, not to mention validating, to hear other people's perspective.
Hello mate. Thank you very much! I got mine from Spectrum Outfitters and I'm very happy with it. I chose them because they are based in the UK like me so required less shipping, and they use recycled materials which is cool. It's also super comfortable and they have lots of colour options. Hope that helps, and good luck looking!
I'm serious. If it wasnt for the fact you said it's a binder, I'd be left in the dark. You are andro as fuck imho. Again, I'm super jealous
any shirt ig, just as long as it hides the existence of the binder. maybe a print would do better at that but idk
Much appreciated. But don't be down on yourself pal, there are all kinds of beautiful ways to be androgynous and non-binary!"	lv78fm	NonBinary	2255	1.0	2021-03-01 11:48:37
Feeling super dysphoric rn & my mom keeps misgendering me so have some pics where I felt tons of gender euphoria (+ dog)		"Okay the blazer and shirt combo in photo one is an aspirational look for me that I have never nailed in such a way as you!!!! Perfection ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️

Sorry about your mom, though. It’s rough, but living your truth is so worth it in the long run.
I like your Unnus Annus hat👉👈

✨You look incredible!✨Let your true self shine through, your mom will get with the program eventually!!

Sorry about the stress with your mom, your euphoria looks great!
YOU! ARE ! VALID ! 

Correct your parents on your pronouns ! They should respect you !!
Gender envy😔
i feel that. my mom is very supportive of me and genders me correctly, but other family members do not. i dont live in the same continent as them, and so this past year for my birthday we did a zoom call (it was more for them than me). . and i was constantly misgendered .. not fun. 

my mom, for what its worth, sent an email later saying that she was sorry abou the misgendering and that it mustve been hard. but yeah, i totally get where youre coming from.
You’re feelings are so valid. Also you look amazing and I LOVE your shirt in the second pic!!
You look seriously cool though, no joke.
So sorry about ur mom:,( on the bright side u are truly fabulous✨
Love these pictures! You are a light! Keep it up.
Woah! You look great! I especially love your hair!
you are stunning!!! ✨ sorry about your mom, hoping she comes around eventually
Love the outfits!!

But sorry about your mom, that can be really tough, hope it gets better.
You are valid and you are perfect the way you are. You deserve respect and love. 
Btw. I love your style
You’re very pretty, I’m sorry she’s misgendered you and if it makes you feel better I think you’ve got a kind of androgynous look
Damn you look amazing! Loving the suit! 

You look exactly like the person who sits next to me in graphics class and it shocked me a bit 😅
Your glasses are so on point!! Very handsome in all pics but we have like the same kind of professional style so I’m especially loving the first pic!
You look amazing! And ur dog is so cute looks like my old dog 🥺
Is the Unus annus merch I see??

That lipstick tho 👀❤️
𝘗u𝚙𝗉ƴ!

YOU ARE SO HANDSOME and your dog is adorable!! Damn I wish I had your style. If you ever need someone to talk to my DMs are always open, friend!

Ah! All these pictures look amazing! Serious gender envy from that first picture 😂 you're doing great liege. I'm sorry the dysphoria is hitting

You are absolutely stunning 😍
My hair: 🤢
Yours: 🥰
Like can I have some 😔
Why does everyone look like a god!!!
I see that Annus hat 👀
I absolutely LOVE the flannel on you! (Tho you look great in all these pics :))
Adorable doggo! I'm so sorry that happens to you. My mom does that to me all the time, so just remember you're not alone. Love your outfit!
Damn you're stunning, what s your pronouns
wow you are stunning!!
Your hair is amazing, and you got great style!
I love your variety looks and vibes you create, (and your puppers)!

May I ask the hard question, if you think your Mom ""doesn't get it"" or is just plain not accepting?  If it's the latter, then please know you have a huge, accepting community that is walking this walk with you.  If it's the former, please be as patient and loving with her as you can muster.  We are all in the process of living out the seminal words of Crosby, Stills, and Nash:

...And teach your parents well  
Their children's hell will slowly go by  
And feed them on your dreams  
The one they pick's the one you'll know by

Don't you ever ask them, ""Why?  
If they told you, you will cry  
So just look at them and sigh  
And know they love you
me: scrolling through nb pics tryna figure out if I'm bi or pan

sees you being cute af

alright, pack it up lads, we're done here. definitely pan.
thank you for saying that! i'm trying hard to keep that in mind i've spent years trying to accept my identity and i think that's more important than what my mom say or does 💛
ahhh fellow unnus annus fan! momento mori 💛
This
To the dog?
surprisingly the beanie is one of my most gender-affirming items of clothing so thanks to eef & mark! + momento mori! 💛
it's super hard to correct people on my pronouns i feel like i'd sound annoying if i corrected her repeatedly but i have corrected her about 3 times before so that's a step 😅
ahhhh that's exactly how i feel sometimes when scrolling through the subreddit haha, every enby comes in a different shape and form you'll find your true form and absolutely slay 💛
I absolutely love your mom! That was very sweet of her to make light of a bad situation :) + (yikess sorry that happened to you hope you had a good b-day otherwise)
Yes! that makes me feel immensely better haha androgynous is what i'm really going for so thank you, that makes me really happy :) (respect to my primarily  masc & fem enbys tho)
Lmaooo, do I have a doppelgänger now? haha &  thank you btw! felt so happy when i got this suit
Yessss, blazers for the win! thank you 💛
momento mori! glad to see more enby unus annus fans :) + thank you!
i haven't worn red lipstick in about 3 years (because i thought it was extremely gendered but realized any gender can wear makeup!) i definitely missed the bold red lip haha
his name is nikko hehe :)
Enby poc need more representation!! i'm glad i can represent :) + momento mori! that channel will always have a special place in my heart 🥰
no u 🥺💛
ANOTHER EEF & MARK FAN SPOTTED
Yes! i'm fine with any compliment :) and thank you! this brightened my day for sure 💛
ahhh liege is the cutest thing! haha thank you 💛
his name is nikko! thanks for asking :) and you're so sweet! 💛
awww, yes nikko (my dog) has been with me through lots of hard times love him! 🥰
hahaha sure, take some! might shave my head 😳
a god? ah! i'm so flattered lol thank you haha
only the best of the best know 👀
he/they :)
hahahaha i'm also pan! glad i could help (no but seriously thank you!) 🥰
It took me years to realize what i am, and my mom can't accept it as she thinks its a form of self delusion brought about by hanging out with democrats.

I have stopped interacting with her as much as possible way before this but its kinda one more nail in the coffin.

So you can understand this is coming from someone who is walking away from misgendering and toxicity, its much better to live your truth even if someone doesn't like you for it/disagrees, you will be living with you FAR LONGER than anyone else will live with you and you deserve to be free to find own happiness. Don't live with a miserable person, do what makes you happy even if someone else tries to make you miserable for it. You are more important than anyone else's opinion.
Indeed
Absolutely!
Absolutely!
That's a good start ! 

My mom and my coworkers at work so the same thing. They're all slowly getting on training and in the meantime, correcting people on your pronouns is also validating yourself
Awwww that's the sweetest reply I have ever gotten on this app. Thank you! I hope everything goes well for you💞
yeah, it was extremely validating. some times all you need is a , ""that must be tough/hard for you"" sympathetic ear, especially if its on something you cant fully understand. we just want to be validated. 

side note: you are *sooooo* pretty and cute! (hope those r ok words). your eyes are gorgeous! love the septum, whered you get it? i need a new one.
My sister called me it when I came out and I've loved using it ever since! 💛
I love Nikko 🐶 good dog
I’m pretty sure you’d look good in anything so if you want to go for it! And thank you for the hair 🤲🏽
Youre extremely handsome my friend I hope its gonna get better with your mom
wow, your story is truly inspiring. its awful that you had to go through with that! (especially since she made your identity political ugh). i really really appreciate your sentiment! it was really moving 💛
thank you so much! i'm fine with any compliment but i appreciate the thought :) + i got my septum at amazon actually! (pic 3) it came with sooo many more, my advice before choosing tho is know your gauge and mm before choosing! you don't want a septum ring that doesn't fit you (i learned that from experience hahaha)
I'm glad you got a lot out of it. Those kinds of thoughts are what kept me going through my depression anxiety ADD symptoms and learning to accept myself for who I am.

For a more practical real-world advice, it's going to be hard to remember that especially on the bad days, even when you feel like you don't believe it tell it to yourself anyway.

Finally got the gender marker on my driver’s permit changed to X! One of the most affirming moments I’ve experienced to date.		"!!!!   I did this last year too.. also in Oregon.   and was so happy to learn we could do this without a bunch of supporting docs..   congrats!!!   It felt amazing for me too, super overwhelming.
That looks cool as fuck. I wanna have that when I get my permit & ID but my mother is an everythingphobe👁️
I wish every state did this ! Or just took off gender markers entirely !
Hey, I’m nonbinary and definitely love affirming moments! Congrats on the triumph. 

Maybe this will make me sound like a total wackjob but I’m trying to understand why anyone would want the cops or government to know that you’re nonbinary/trans especially with the recent federal decisions allowing people to deny healthcare to trans folks? 
Wouldn’t it be better to just remove this marker?
In the process of getting mine in Oregon too.
The Netherlands is going to stop putting gender on Id's in 2025 if I remember correctly
I didn’t know I would be able to do this!! This is awesome! I’ll have to get that changed sometime! I’m so happy for you!!
nice! TX doesnt allow this sadly :/
Congratulations!! I moved to Colorado from Kansas where that's not an option during covid and got mine changed. I agree so much! It feels so good to have the X on there for my own validation and when people see my ID. Stay safe, fam!
Congrats that’s amazing! 😃
But I’m confused, when I had to renew my license recently I saw no option to allow X for the gender question.. Does NY state not allow this choice yet? I’m the type to not like any conflict, so I said nothing and quietly forced myself to put my gender. . My question is should I have asked why there wasn’t the option?
That’s cool I wanna do that too!
One of the best feelings! Congrats!!!
I didn't know you could even do that!!! I need to do this!!!
Congrats. I 'm also a fellow Oregonion haha when I heard  Oregon allows X markers, I thought Oregon couldn't get cooler (get it...cause it's always so rainy and cold here  3/4 of the seasons...)
Ack! I want to go do that so bad! I’m also an Oregon enbie...how big of a hassle was it?
I am doing a small celebratory dance in your honor.
Me too! Just got my replacement in July! (License, not permit. I'm old!)

CONGRATULATIONS!
man, i wish my state did this :( i changed my name, but i'll have to go somewhere else to get this done. congratulations though, must feel amazing :)
Yooo Oregon enbies represent!
I'm glad our drivers permits and IDs don't have gender on them
I got mine as Non-binary because that’s an option here, but that’s awesome! I remember the rush of euphoria I hope you feel the same!
This is so cool!! 
My country doesn’t even offer an ""x"" gender marker, only f and m 😔
Why does your permit picture look good though? Is it possible to achieve this power?
Wow! Congrats! I am so jealous.
I love how it’s “x” bc it’s like someone asking what your gender is and just going “no💖”
[deleted]
Congrats. So happy for you
That's Rad! ~~What's With The Psychotic Look In The Picture Though?~~
I've come across this picture a couple of times scrolling through and every single time my first thought is that it's about missing person and a suspect is in custody
congratulations!! i’m looking to do this too since i just moved states to one that does it (not for that reason but an added perk 😌)
You can do that?????
i love that you have the confidence to do this! i’m in a state where i can but im just really worried about it opening up doors to transphobia when i get carded and stuff:/
Jealous!
Congrats thats so awesome!!!
Woah! I didn't even know you could do that! Unfortunately, you can't where I live, but still! Congrats!
omgggg congratulationssssssss this is awesomeeee
see i’d do that. but then remember, 
i would not want a cop yo know i’m trans
Wish that I could do that too :(( anw congrats!!!!!
LOVE it the ""X"" is perfect cause we all are X and the superior beings are double XX and of course the males don't even have 23 complete pairs. It is plain common sense women are the future.
That’s amazing!! Congrats to you too! It was so easy and the person who helped me gave me a thumbs up and said “good for you!” when I very anxiously blurted out that I needed to change it haha
Lol let’s start a club cause I just did this a few months ago in Oregon! Congrats to the three of us 💜!
Ugh I’m so sorry to hear that :( I hope you’ll be able to get it done one day regardless. I’m lucky my family is supportive but I never came out to my mother before she passed away because she was the same way unfortunately.
Me too! I think they passed another legislation here that you can legally get your birth certificate updated as well now but I have a CA birth certificate even though I’ve lived in Portland since I was a toddler so I don’t think I can get that done unfortunately.
PA has it!
Yeah, I wish Iowa would do this, but that isn't likely
Alternative perspective:

Last week I was moving a bunch of stuff into a storage unit, and the lady behind the counter pretty clearly didn't know how to interact with my gender presentation. When I offered my pronouns, she didn't know how to respond, but when she copied my license for the places records, she noticed the X, and I explained what was up.

Her attitude went from ""IDK how to interact with you"" to ""this is fine, and I like you"" in 5 seconds flat once she knew that my gender was recognized by the state. 

Folks' senses of morality comes from all kinds of places, and legal recognition definitely matters for some people.
That’s a totally understandable concern but I guess it would just depend on the person and how safe they feel in the area they live in. Some people might feel that the affirmation is worth the risk but I can’t speak for anyone else but myself and for me it is. Trans healthcare is covered by our state health insurance plan so I don’t see healthcare specifically being a problem for me while I still live here but I would definitely be more concerned about dealing with cops.
i thought about that after i went through the paperwork but tbh changing your marker at all (even if you're just switching it from M to F or vice versa) let's the government & cops know you're trans. especially if you don't pass 100%. i don't really see people saying this to binary trans people so i think it's kinda odd that i keep seeing it brought up to nonbinary people. 

i agree that having the markers completely gone is better tho.
This is a very good point.
I've had the X on my license for almost a year. I've crossed the border into Canada 3 times with it, twice by plane and once by car. I've rented cars, hotel rooms, bought booze, and been pulled over by the cops. 

As far as I've been able to tell 99% of people don't notice the X. They're worried about the DOB and that is it. 

The *one* time I have ever been obviously discriminated against was in Boston, MA. Conversely, the most obvious time where someone changed their behavior to be more inclusive was in Dallas, TX. 


*Every single time* the topic of X on a ID comes up there are always people clutching their pearls about the government and police. Why? This would *never* happen in a discussion where someone who is MtF or Ftm is talking about getting their documents changed, and *especially* not by other trans people. It *only* ever happens among nonbinary people and it is ridiculous.
Congrats!
I wish the US would do this!
Thank you! I hope you get to get yours soon :)
I’m sorry to hear that :( I really wish the US would just completely remove gender from our legal and medical documents in general.
That’s amazing, I’m so happy for you! Have you had any negative experiences with it so far or has it stayed pretty neutral?
I don’t know about NY but it’s been an option in Oregon since 2017. Maybe do some research online for your state before going in next time so you don’t have to put yourself in an uncomfortable situation. It’s definitely a state by state thing and not recognized nationally. On the Oregon DMV site I double checked it to make sure there was really nothing else I needed to do to get it done and all the information was on there.
Thank you so much!
You can change your birth certificate too now! I can’t because I was born in CA but if you have an OR one you should be able to :)
It wasn’t a hassle at all actually! You don’t need additional documentation and usually just have to fill it out on the form and let the person at the DMV know you want to change your gender. I was anxious that I might get some push back anyway if the person who was there had a personal problem with it or something but the person who helped me was super sweet and supportive and made the process really pleasant.
Congratulations to you too! <3
Thank you so much! I’m sorry it’s not available in your state yet :( I wish we could just not even have to disclose our gender on anything it would be so much easier and safer!
💛🤍💜🖤
You’re so lucky! I wish that was the case in the US. Where are you from that does that?
Congrats! It was definitely a good feeling :)
Thank you so much! I was so bummed that you can see my stray hair that got caught on my forehead sweat though 😭
Yes!!!
I totally agree. America is so obsessed with gender unfortunately I don’t see that happening anytime soon.
That’s so exciting! Congratulations!
That’s totally understandable! I’d be lying if I said I wasn’t worried about that too and another user mentioned cops and concerns about being denied healthcare which is totally valid as well. There’s a reason I haven’t gotten this done until now even though I’ve wanted to get it done since it was first introduced in 2017 and it’s because it’s definitely a huge decision. I think I just got so sick of people not taking me seriously I really just needed to do it for me, ya know?
I'm femme/queer presenting, but changed my name to something overtly masculine. Only comments I've gotten when carded are 'No way you're 26. You look 17.' (Amsterdam bar) and 'Cool name' (local Ohio liquor store). People at the grocery store just care about my DOB. I really only go to gay clubs and don't interact with the police.


 u/cyan386 maybe try writing it in yourself (I used to use white-out tape and a pen, or black nail polish to cover stuff completely) to try it out. Washi tape works for passports. Note that the TSA hates any ID mods (which is why I picked stuff that can be scratched off).


Congrats OP on changing your gender marker!


Ohio, fuck you.
I feel so lucky to be able to do this where I am but I hope this will become the norm in more places in the future! You deserve to be validated!
Thank you so much! I’ve been buzzing all day 😁
Thank you! I think we might be the only state in the US that does it so far but I’m hopeful that more states will start to follow suit.
I was very shocked it was so easy that I didn't believe it even as I was doing it.   the lady at the dmv was super nice about it though.
Whooohoooo!!!   I am having the best week ever as I find more and more people similar to myself, and this week started off really lousy for me..   thank you.
yeah, one day im just gonna say ""fuck it"" and start living for me
Awe that’s so shit ;-; I hope one day it’s all changed. I’m in Florida and all we can do is change binary gender on our license, social security card n birth certificate ;-; and u have to have some documents and such
california has that option too! i'm planning on doing it
Im in a similar situation, born WA, raised OR, i came out at 16 after I got my drivers license I want to legally update it bc I'm 18 now
Totally! I’m glad that went so well for you. 

This is the kind of thing I raised the question for, because in my limited viewpoint it just seems like there couldn’t be enough upsides for me. But this is definitely one!
Yeah totally get that thanks for answering! I think Oregon probably is way different that the south where I live and I would be terrified for that kind of thing tbh. I already worry that I look “too queer” and take my flag buttons off when I visit the doctors office
Yeah totally get that thanks for answering! I think Oregon probably is way different that the south where I live and I would be terrified for that kind of thing tbh. I already worry that I look “too queer” and take my flag buttons off my bag when I visit the doctors/optometry office. Makes sense that things are different in other states.
No, it isn't. No one would say this to someone who is MtF or FtM when they talk about getting their documents changed.
Because there is historical precedent for governments using information like this to hunt people down and with fascism on the rise globally its a understandable concern.
Congrats on having your gender marker changed! I’m glad it’s been good for you and I’m glad you feel affirmed. It sounds like you live quite a jetset life! 

You’ve made several comments in a row that I’m going to address once here since you’ve already decided what I am. I am not “concern trolling” or “ridiculous” I am genuinely curious and concerned. I was actually kind of hoping that I would get responses that would make it seem safer and and less terrifying to have this kind of marker, and some folks were really great and gave me things to think about! But also I think location and other kinds of privilege factor a lot into this decision in a way I hadn’t considered.
So excited!
Thank you so much!
Thanks! So far it's been fine! I have chronic pain and C-PTSD that I treat with mj, so most of the people who see it are dispensary folks who don't think anything of it or are some kind of queer/trans/enby fam themselves. We'll see if/how it impacts medical visits and stuff when I find a doctor out here!
Thanks, more reasons Oregon seems like a great place to live. I’ve been debating on movies to Portland but then this pandemic happened.. Does living in a safe neighborhood cost a lot? I apologize if I’m asking a lot. Thank you regardless for responding. Congrats again.
I was actually born in Guam. But have lived in Oregon since I was probably three. So I'm not sure if I can or not;; 

But it is still cool to know that you definitely can if you were born in Oregon!
I'm from Germany. I recently saw a news article that the Netherlands or Belgium voted to remove gender from their IDs and when I looked at mine I noticed that we didn't have that in the first place.
Nah honestly I just thought that was a streak from printing haha
thanks! 😁
well i’m happy for u!!
As lucky as we are for this..  this is also the reason Oregon ID does not meet the standard for airline travel by October next year I think.   So, if you want to fly, soon you will have to get another ID option and go through all that hassle.   I fly about twice a year..  so been thinking about this a lot.
There are something like 10 or 12 states that allow an X on their IDs.
you can do it!
I believe in you!
I was super surprised! 

I got my marker changed to X initially because I didn't want bartenders to gender me by my license, but I never expected ink on plastic to change someone's attitude towards me that much! 

I definitely know people in my area who raised similar concerns to yours when Washington (state) changed its policy last summer, so I wanted to share a good-feels story.
I’m sorry you have to deal with that :( everyone should be able to be themselves openly without fear but unfortunately that’s not reality. A few years ago I went to a PP here in Portland and I was so happy because I was able to indicate on my chart that I’m non-binary and use they/them pronouns but then none of the staff actually cared or used my correct pronouns. Not a dangerous experience but certainly disappointing and stuff like that definitely makes it hard to speak up for yourself because what if you try to correct them and they lash out at you?
Why?
Please provide a *modern* example of a government using a driver's license database to persecute people.

If you think the government needs our driver's licenses to know we are trans you are woefully naive. If they want to create lists of that information data mining technology has existed for years - corporations routinely use it for advertising. 

And *again*, *no one says this to binary trans people*. Especially not other binary trans people. If you went into r/mtf or r/ftm or r/translater and said ""you know, I don't know if it's a good idea to get your documents changed because the government"" you'd get banned for being an unsupportive concern troll. 

But somehow every time any nonbinary person posts about having an X *other nonbinary people* are the first to jump in with this argument. It's not tolerated in other trans spaces and it shouldn't be tolerated here.
It’s definitely expensive if you want to live downtown so it’s really common for people to move to Beaverton or Gresham which are both more suburban areas right outside of Portland. A lot of people end up living in the east side of the river but that’s a hotbed for gentrification so that would be something to keep in mind too. There are an increasing number of buildings in the NW and SW areas of Portland that offer low income housing options but the qualifications for those can be strict and are very competitive. I would also recommend checking out the Portland queer housing group on Facebook!
That’s amazing!
Having an X on your license is not what is preventing Oregon's IDs from being Real ID compliant.
I did not know that :(
That’s so cool! I had no idea!
Because binary trans people seem to recognize that it is concern trolling and invalidating and thus don't tolerate comments from people discouraging others from getting their documents changed.
Thank you! I actually deleted my Facebook awhile ago :) but I’ll definitely look into everything you’ve said so far. Take care, thank you again.
true.. its the fact you can do so without any kind of documentation.  there is more to it of course..    I was simplifying the situation.  but I am not looking forward to showing up to the DMV with a non matching birth certificate and a bunch of long ago dated paperwork, name changes, etc.  assuming I can find that paperwork..... [**https://dmv2u.oregon.gov/eServices/\_/#3**](https://dmv2u.oregon.gov/eServices/_/#3)

fortunately we should be able to keep the x, since the TSA and DHS have said the X designation is consistent with aviation regulations as other countries use the X identified as well.
The above person is wrong. Having an X on your license doesn't invalidate it for Real ID compliance. You can have a Real ID-compliant ID *and* an X (I have one although not from OR). If Oregon's IDs aren't Real ID compliant it is for other reasons besides the X.
yea...  so unless Oregon adopts the Real ID standards by then, people like yourself and I will need a passport to fly even within our countries borders.
I suppose I just don't like authority/government dipping into personal life. Not much to do with trans/gender. If anything I'd rather the field be removed. I see you point though. :)
You too! :)
>true.. its the fact you can do so without any kind of documentation. there is more to it of course.. 

No, it isn't. It is the fact that you don't have to prove citizenship to get an ID in Oregon. It has absolutely nothing to do with the gender marker. 

&nbsp; 

I have a Real ID compliant ID with an X on it. Literally took longer to take a new picture than to process the paperwork. 

I used my passport, social security card, my vehicle registration, and a utility bill.
Thank you for clarifying! If I need to go out of state/country I will definitely make sure I research everything ahead of time.
That really sucks but thank you for letting me know. I don’t plan on traveling anytime soon but it’s good to be aware of.
There's a ton more to Oregon that the Portland Metro too.   I live in Eugene/Springfield about 2 hours south.   there is the Capital, Salem, Corvallis, Albany, and a bunch of smaller towns near each of those if quieter living is more your jam.

Ashland/Meford and surrounding areas further south, Bend/Sisters and Pendleton more east.

Tons of cool towns on the coast.

Lot's of variety here.  depends how much city you want, and what climate you want.  we got temperate rainforest, desert, high desert, mountains and glaciers, temperate mountains, ocean coast...

Generally speaking Oregon is a very expensive place to live compared to wages.  If you are in a high skill/demand industry you will be good.  if you have ok basic work skills..   it can be rough.
ahjh thank you for the correction.. I didn't know you could get an Oregon ID without proof of citizenship.

I have a lot of anxiety when it comes to dealing with the DMV.   so when I first transitioned in 1992-93 I forget the exact year I tried to get a drivers license.  I had legally changed my name, I had done so with the SSA already, and the SSA even changed my gender no questions asked.. which was kinda crazy.  I don't think they were supposed to do that.

Anyways.  I go to the dmv to try and get a drivers license.. I pass the written test, I fill out the paperwork.. I have my birth certificate, name change docs, social card, and paperwork from the ssa that had my gender on it.    Then they tell me no.   and that I needed some other documents.  so I came back a week later with the docs they asked for, and they told me no.   I followed what they told me, and they still denied me. then the told me to come back with a letter from a shrink.

I went to the shrink.. we had exactly 1 in Eugene who was on the state sanctioned list for treating trans people and issuing letters, and he was a misogynist freudian psychologist who mainly advertised his practice as dealing in ""mens issues""  He and I did not get along..  I got no letter from him, and stopped seeing him because it was a total waste of time and money, after he dragged me along about the letter ""maybe next week""  ""maybe next week"" for 6 months.  the standard of care at the time said 3 months.  later I got my full file of his notes when I was a patient and he wrote down some crazy assumptions about me about things we never talked about and things he never asked.

You want to know how I got my gender changed on my license?  I started driving with no license, cause I had to work.   I got pulled over one evening.. and with no ID the cops have to write down all your info and take a picture of you with your vehicle. They had a Polaroid camera.  So I told them my name, DOB, gender, they wrote it down and submitted it to the DMV database.

So this whole, bring in a ton of paperwork to get ID to fly...   same paperwork if I tried to get a passport.   I am just not excited for this again.  I hope you understand my anxiety..

I see you said you got a real ID with the X.. that is good news.
My only concern would be how queer friendly and safe the more rural parts of Oregon would be. I’ve only been through Eugene in passing but I know that it’s similar to Portland in that respect and sounds like a lovely place to live but I have heard that other parts of Oregon can be pretty conservative.
Absolutely, there are more conservative parts or Oregon, but even most of the conservative parts are not intolerant.   Sadly of course, you will find a certain amount of intolerance everywhere even in Portland.

Find where you like best and feel most comfortable of course.  Me personally, I can't stand living anywhere bigger than where I am, which is Springfield.  65k pop.  Next to Eugene, but I almost never go into Eugene.  I'd rather be more rural, but I have responsibilities here."	imnuse	NonBinary	2235	1.0	2020-09-04 20:40:18
Ehm. Wow. I mean I should probably not be surprised, but .. wtf?!		"You’ve somehow fought your way through the deadly uncrossable abyss of German bureaucracy to get your gender changed or acknowledged in your passport - and some countries don’t even allow you to fucking transit (e.g. stop for fuel, not leaving the plane). How very.. thorough..
It's all so tiresome.

Like... Qatar wanted to host the World Cup and then got pissy when LGBTQ+ people and women were being LGBTQ+ people and women there.

Eventually these countries are gonna have to realize that they either have to be more inclusive or lose that sweet sweet tourism revenue.
""Funny"" that the only other thing not permitting you to enter is having the passport fcking handwritten 💀
I mean, a country where being LGBTQ+ can legally sentence you to death and de facto lend you with 15 years in prison does not have a government I would expect to tolerate non-binary people . If you go there, I advise you strongly to be very, very cautious with people who speak English there and especially with officials. 

You can never know who is in front of you and keeping your life is of utmost importance. Depending on any choice you make (and if you planned to go there in the first place), I wish you the best of luck.
I've been warning people about this since gender neutral markers have been allowed by local governments. While it is important to have your gender recognized locally, it is important to remember larger implications of wearing the label so publicly unfortunately. Although countries so clearly showing their feelings makes it evident that they may be a place you cannot safely travel to or that you might not want to contribute to economically with your tourism.

My partner and I chose not to take one another's last name. One major reason for that is that we do not want to/can't risk questioning if we ever travel together to his country or other countries in his region.
Not ever planning to visit the UAE, but may travel to places that require a stop there as part of the travel…reasons I’ve chosen to not get the X marker on my passport. The likelihood of active discrimination and risk of harm is too high for me.
Exactly why gender markers shouldnt be on forms like this - it just gives more chances for discrimination
In much of The United Arab Emirates, being trans is a crime punishable by death/imprisonment. I found this out when I was planning to go to a convention in Dubai and I found out that most likely I would be denied entry into the country and even if they did, would risk imprisonment by being there.
I wouldn't go to or transit through those countries. Even buying food or something to drink at the airport is tax revenue for them and I'm not about to support them with my money.
It's a shitty country build on slave labor, corruption and murder.

Don't bother spending your money there.
Hell, even traveling with my assigned at birth gender is dangerous. Sorry you had deal with this. These governments only care about one thing (gender,control) and it’s fucking disgusting.
If a country doesn't accept my passport because it has an X on it, then I don't want to go there. There's usually a reason...
Horrifying, absolutely horrifying. Is there a list of all countries which do this?
Wait. What the fuck? Where is this? and what would you do when this IS your documentation? my license and all other identification I own has X listed. for me, it's largely because of my identity, but it also is because I am intersex. I know I am not the only person who uses these designations because we are in even the most conservative, transphobic views, we still aren't M nor F. are we just stuck where we are?
I just want to state that this isn't a religious thing, it's not. Its just them being discriminating ass hats. Just like our hateful lawmakers here, they hide behind religion but it's never mentioned in these books. So just keep that in mind
QUEER PEOPLE

Do not go to places that don’t like us. See Brittany Greer. Stay safe.
Not surprising from the UAE.
This is precisely why nobody should ever be advocating for ""more inclusive gender markers"" but instead for the abolishment of gender/sex markers in passports and ID documentation.

Get rid of gender discrimination by making it more difficult, not by making it easier to target specific people.

Germany needs to abolish gender markers entirely. It wouldn't matter if some small nation does it, it needs to be someplace powerful, and I don't imagine the US or UK doing that anytime soon. I've plenty doubts we could ever manage it in Germany either, but certainly it's more realistic here.
I mean the feelings mutual, I don't wanna go there and they don't want me there
So I'm an F1 fan, and I've always been curious as to what would happen if either a woman, or a member of the LGBTQ community would enter the sport and drive in the UAE, Singapore, Bahrain, Saudi Arabia, Azerbaijan etc. Would they be allowed? Would the government disallow their access to the country, would they be allowed to compete? What would happen if they won? Would the government officials on the podium shake their hand while handing them the trophy? It really makes me think
I am of the opinion that the gender marker on my documentation is not for me, it's for the people who check it in whatever context. As a result, I pick the marker that will keep me safest. It sucks, but it is what it is.
Oh, well, I didn't wanted to go anyway
Why would you even want to go to this terrible place?
Fuck it, I didn't want to go there anyway.
Stuff like this was one of the reasons I hesitated changing my legal gender marker to X, but eventually I did it anyway. I'm visibly queer enough that I wouldn't be safe in countries/places that don't accept enby & queer people to begin with.
Great we’re banned from whole countries now?
When I thought I was nonbinary this worried me if I changed it to x but my country doesn't even acknowledge  nonbinary people.
Why would you go to UAE this place sucks
F. them to be honest. They don't deserve your time, money or any of your resources...
as a canadian who also filled out the form to get my gender marker changed on my passport to x (ive been waiting for like 6 months for it to arrive though), tbh those are places we probably aren’t reasonably safe travelling to anyways, no matter what our passports say
Yeah I don't ""pass"" enough to choose a M or F. I am visibly non binary. I hadn't thought about how different I look from my passport photo/gender before going to South Africa and I had some trouble at the border trying to leave to Botswana because they didn't believe the passport was mine. Luckily I was with a tour group through GAdventures or they might not have let me leave. I didn't have any problems with getting in or Botswana or Zimbabwe or getting back to the US but I also wore my mask as much as possible to try to hide my facial hair. I haven't decided what to do with my passport going forward but the whole thing blows even if there isn't specific laws preventing you from entry
Yeah i’ve heard that in Australia when you apply to get your gender marker on your passport changed to an X they warn you that it might become way harder to travel overseas to europe, because often flights from here to europe stopover in places where an X gender marker could have you arrested.
I wanted an X on my passport to match my drivers license, but this type of bigotry drove me to (reluctantly) put F.
Never going to anywhere in the Middle East for my own safety. (Not trying to generalize, they just have harsh laws against LGBTQ people)
EXCUSE ME!!! like what the actual f*ck
What… the fuck
Tbh classic oil country, all for money, and all for religion. Look at the wc, qatar just wanted the dosh, lied to everyone, and when lgbtq people came and so did the people who wanted alcohol, they made massive announcements last minute
Being lgbtq+ in any form can be a death sentence in the UAE. Until they’ve made their own reform, it’s probably best to just avoid the Middle East and a good portion of Africa.
The entire leadership of that region of the world would look great covered in 6ft of soil.
What the actual fuck, in many countries this is for intersdx people, being intersex is natural, great job uae
In Australia, if one chooses to have x on their passport, they actually warn you that you may not be permitted in some places. Though, I thought that was just a logistical thing, like their systems only recognise m and f so it would cause difficulties. I guess I'm wrong.
Traveling to other countries is the exact reason I don't want to get my marker changed. My name yes, but the marker is too dangerous for the places I want to go
I wouldn't want to visit the UAE unless I was going as my AGAB.  


I might consider it as a post-operative MtF presenting as female, provided that I had never traveled there before (many countries take biometrics, so if they have any data on your previous identity from traveling there before, that might be problematic in a transphobic country).  I'd have to be 100% stealth though, and even then it's probably not something I'd want to chance. Actively traveling to a country that is hostile to your very existence is not really a good idea; even just being a US citizen can be a problem in some countries, and it is for reasons like these that the US State Department, and analogous agencies in other nations, issue travel advisories.
Bruh just don't go there..they suck
🤬
Because if they acknowledge this exists it will fuck up their entire pitiful ideology.
Seven Hells. I’m in Australia, and here we can actually change our sex descriptor on our birth certificate. The amount of countries and places I’ve had to scratch off my bucket list, for the fact I could and would likely be killed for being is an unfortunate amount.
Why would you want to go there anyway?
You may also not be allowed in Qatar and/or battered and/or imprisoned and/or killed.

Always research where you're going for human rights violations. Be safe out there, y'all, and possible also subscribe to LGBT Nation for global news regarding queer goings on.
This is one reason i don’t reflect my NB gender status on my passport. I pick a binary gender just in case i end up in some situation while traveling internationally. Hell, even domestically!
This is part of the reason why I don’t wanna change my gender marker. Like, it’s affirming, but also makes it easier to discriminate against me
I mean it’s ducking ridiculous for everyone. But about about intersex people who are like born with this? It’s discriminatory against every nb, but Intersex people haven’t had even the choice.
On one side, that is a very good reason to not change the marker on the passport, on the other that is exactly what they want. If there will be a lot of people with a gender marker change they’ll have to adapt. In the situations like this, I feel like it is important to check where you stand privilege wise within the oppressed group, and if you have it, use it in order to benefit the group. Like as an immigrant, I’m thinking having one passport out of two with a changed marker could be useful to mess with them when you can.
That's why I didn't change my gender marker. It would be nice to be recognized in my homecountry as unspecified gender, but UAE is not the only country that completely bans people with X/U gender markers from transit.
In what does people's gender affect the country ? *eyeroll
""respect our culture that we will respect yours""

Arabic countries out there:
Not surprised but exactly why i haven't changed my markers on anything.
The UAE is like extremely problematic in so many ways. I saw this and before seeing the full image I kinda already knew.
this is why i'm not doing it. republicans would do it in a heartbeat if they could. and then comes the internment camps. the did it to the japanese, they would do it to us. how old is george takei? how old are republicans in government?
Hang on... since when do passports even have that option? 😅
You know what, with the way the world is going right now I think I might settle to change my passport to M. at least we can stealth with binary gender markers. God this is so sad.
Being non-binary, I chose only to have X on my drivers licence in Canada because *within* Canada, it’s recognized.

However, I specifically chose not to do this on my passports for this specific reason. Not that I would want to travel to a country where X is an issue - I just don’t know where my career will take me. Africa and the Middle East are hot spots for my job prospects. Might even be a layover location, who knows. I have dual citizenship with a Mediterranean country close to countries where X isn’t recognized. You just never know.
There's a reason I didn't put X on my passport, and it's because most countries don't allow people with a gender neutral marker to enter. The wise choice is to put whatever you are going to be read as by transportation officials.
this is why i've never changed my name of gender marker, i have a longer legal name and have always gone by a nickname regardless, just tweaked it more netral ( en suffix instead of ie lol) 

the x gender marker became available where i live but this was a potential fear
they don't grant rights to women so not surprised at all lol

tbh who would want to have anything to do wish such abusive joke-of-a-country country anyway...
Based
Chile...... U didnt need to post this. U knew. We know.
Campaigns for non binary gender markers always felt like performative cis ally shit to me....
Phew, luckily my gender is E!
I know the X, but what does the U mean?
In Emirate Arabia, everyone conforms to gender /s
what is U and X gender?
And this is why, despite my domestic documents all saying ""X"", my new passport will have an ""F"" on it, because that's what I look closest to generally. Not planning on going anywhere which might have issues with my existence, but you never know.
Praying for the world right now. I just wish everyone could be at peace. We are all different for a reason.
Is this passports in general or if going somewhere specific
I'm surprised they don't require additional documentation on your religion. Several middle eastern countries have religion marked on all their identifying documents, and I thought some require travelers to do the same.
Tbh, I wouldn't want to go UAE regardless. They're living in the 1500s socially.
Wtf...? So certain trans people aren't allowed to travel on plane? Wooooow. Just what the honest f***, people?
Omg??? I'm also not surprised but damn, i am so sorry :c
Glory to Arstotzka
I can’t change mine because I have no gender and they don’t have an option for that.  But I thought about it and there are quite a few countries where you can be denied or it can be unsafe 


I travel a lot by myself and present as female so I will likely never visit the Middle East for the above reasons and also women are severely restricted in some countries with harsh punishments for things such as just going out of the house unaccompanied by a male.
I would never go there even if it was allowed. I’d be afraid I’d get hatecrimed, perhaps even by the state
Ugh, I feel this. I travel for work a lot, and pass through and travel to countries where being non-binary and/or LGBTQ+ is illegal- so while I’m changing my name here in the US this year, I’m having to grapple with whether I should change my gender marker to x, keep it as my AGAB, or change it to what I would pass as (M)- it’s tough. The debate over security and safety vs personal identity is never ending, and frustrating.
I'd say it's a quick way to ID which countries are unsafe, but we already knew, didn't we?
Do they really have that as a restriction? And none is saying anything? Well another reason for never going there 🤌🏾🤌🏾🤌🏾
dw you aint missing much ;]
yep, fuck the UAE and most if not all other middle eastern countries
I remember having to stop over here as a layover for a study tour my high school did. I pass as male due to noticeable facial hair, but that doesn't stop the fact there's no 'M' on my passport gender marker.

Teacher couldn't work out why I spent the entire time in the airport on the verge of a panic attack until I mentioned this to her. It was a small comfort seeing her so furious that the country's laws could result in me being persecuted, but it was not enough to stop me from spending the ~2 hours we were there in fight-or-flight mode...
Wow.  This makes me think of that time that Russia said there just weren't any gays in their country.  There's just no nb people there.  They just don't exist.  You don't get dysphoria or anything until you're out of their borders.
yikes guess i’m not going to ferrari world any time soon
Jeez...
My thought process when changing mine was that anywhere that doesn't accept it is somewhere I don't want to go.
You probably shouldn't be going to the UAE in the first place...
Yeah, some of these people would throw you off a cliff or building. So might be a good place to avoid.
Stay safe, I'm not trying to be discouraging in trying to be realistic and prioritize safety in a very fucked up and unfair world. I understand changing the gender marking can be very important.. this being said, I'm never going to do it simply because of the discrimination and violence against nb ppl.

It's a shame that people need to choose between 
1) being authentically themselves + their comfort
2) physical/social safety.. 

Personally speaking, the dysphoria I feel is less of a safety risk than the potential for discrimination and violence.

It's important to weigh out which option poses a bigger risk to your well-being and safety. Although it can feel validating and help push away dysphoria, the letter on your passport or ID doesn't define you. Changing it doesn't suddenly make you a ""Real ENBY"" bc you already were.. you're valid whatever letters you have on your ID.

If you worry about discrimination, you don't need to jump through these hoops to come out to the government and potentially jeopardize your safety.
I mean, it’s the UAE. Should probably just steer clear anyway.
as someone whos been living in iran i strongly advise you to STAY THE FUCK AWAY FROM THE MIDDLE EAST not only is being non binary not considered anywhere its a fucking crime so is being homosexual and guess what the punishment is its death by hanging and if you happen to live in iran and identify as non-binary well one day youre walking down the street the next you disappear and months later your bones are discovered in the middle of a desert (this actually happened btw not sure if the person was any particular minority but still this happened) so yeah stay the fuck away safety first its not worth it.  


p.s: sorry for the trauma dump.
Well that's the reason why your legal gender marker in Germany does not have to match the one on your passport if it is X or U. So yeah still sucks but at least there's a fix. So you can have M or F in your passport when your legal gendermarker is X or U.

https://www.personalausweisportal.de/SharedDocs/kurzmeldungen/Webs/PA/DE/2020/Neue_Vorgaben_Pass_Personalausweis.html
I mean, it’s pretty much advertising that it’s not a safe country to be in anyway for us. So I’m not mad at it. I’ll happily stay far away.
bruh the GERMAN bureaucracy?

you deserve financial compensation for that. german bureaucracy is insane.
Are you sure that's what ""transit"" means according to these rules? Most international layovers I've had don't require you to go through immigration in order to change planes. How would the government of the UAE even know? Certainly with plane refueling, people don't even disembark. Unless a UAE immigration official boards the plane and checks passport while the plane refuels, that seems impossible logistically speaking.

On the other hand, this passport rule would definitely make me avoid flying on Emirates airlines through the UAE, because on their end they may not let you board with an X or U.

Edit: it seems more like this refers to eligibility for a transit visa, not ability to change planes in at a UAE airport.
\> (e.g. stop for fuel, not leaving the plane)

Are you fucking serious?? You can't even just... like have it on a stop where you don't deboard?

Like if I set up a flight from another airline, do they make sure I can't buy it if I have an X and it stops in the UAE briefly?
Is gender marker X an option in Germany?
Does it mean they check passports in the plane while transiting ?
Yeah, but they didn't *actually* wanted to host the WC, they don't even like Football (or Soccer if you are from the USA) there. They wanted what they could gain with it and unfortunately I suppose they got it..
I'm so bored of all these cut-and-paste, hallmark passports. I like to make my passport myself, its much more personal when it's handwritten ✨
They're at least allowed to transit
Because apparently potential fraud and just existing as a genderqueer person are both harmful crimes that country feels like they need to limit?? 
Queerphobia is nothing but bigotry, and it's sad entire governments are so brazenly in support of it.
It’s just unfortunate that to get across a large swathe of the world, planes stopping to refuel in Qatar or Dubai is very very common, and the alternatives are usually more expensive.
Seems like preventing such travel is effectively protected people, despite the mal intentions
I hate it, but same. I want a neutral marker on my documents for both intersex and enby reasons, but my government warns that even locally not all programs will accept it so it's just not worth it at this point
For me, I've made the decision that even if the UK (where I live) allowed an X gender marker on documents in the future, I wouldn't do it. With all the constant attacks against trans people from the tories at the moment, I would absolutely not feel safe knowing that the government had records somewhere showing that I am not cis.
Even getting into the US (used to be) a pain in the ass with an X passport. The ESTA visa waiver form just straight up didn't have an option, so you'd automatically get flagged as not matching your passport.
I get it but transit is also meant when the plane only stops for gas and nobody leaves the plane.. it’s pretty extreme
Also that’s your choice. You’re not given that choice if your intersex. You simply can’t enter or transit.
I’m unfortunately stuck spending my money in a country built on slave labor, corruption, and murder every day (I live in the U.S.)

You also don’t exactly have a choice if you’re intersex or non-binary in your passport. You’ll HAVE to find a different route because you can’t transit..
So are most European countries, built on the blood of the transatlantic slave trade.. 
but sometimes you have to simply travel through countries because that’s how flights work
Genuinely asking...which country was not built with a history of those things plus others just as bad? I mean, u know? 

But I get what u mean, I suppose. ""Don't go visit places where your existence is legally hunted and exterminated"".
But yea like sorta adding onto OPs point, it’s European and American interests who made and continue to make the world so uniquely unsafe for queer people. Not only did European colonization stifle the gender expression of queer indigenous people (good example is the Crow Badé who were forced to cut their hair and participate in “masculine” activities) but U.S. and European powers continue to prop up fascist governments/organizations to maintain their resource extraction empires
True, I think this facet is important to recognize - One may not be able to enter with an X on their passport, but never forget that even with an F you're not really that safe. And with an M, well, it depends on how gender-conforming they think you appear.
this is exactly what i was thinking
The fact that they're twisting the religion to justify it doesn't really make it ""not a religious thing."" They're still using the religion as an excuse. I get you're trying to get people not to generalize but it really just comes off as unnecessary lip service to the people who are still discriminating against and killing us.
Do you mean Brittney Griner?
Travelling across the world in the eastern hemisphere, it’s very difficult not to transit there actually.
oh no.. anyway.
I have transited several times in Qatar (and Dubai) and each time I did not want to be there, it was because the flight alternatives were way more expensive/lengthy. Go look at Flight Radar 24.
Im sorry if you are just finding this out, but being trans is punishable by death/life imprisonment in a lot of the world… at least they give you some kind of a warning by posting this.
we are assigned a gender at birth, intersex people have to change their marker manually to X if they want to as adults it's not given automatically.
It’s a religious thing. No surprise there.
US passports started allowing X markers mid last year.
not everyone knows
Uh no, not everyone knew. I didn’t, and judging by the rest of the comments here I am not the only one. Information like this is some of the most important to spread in our communities
elaborate
I believe the U stands for “unbekannt“ - unknown.
Not male or female - it’s nonbinary people. This country has banned trans people
I feel that. For the sake of my future career and networking I don’t actively express my gender identity unless asked. Sharing my pronouns with others who may have a say in my future is just not viable for me.

In the end I know who I am and I am lucky to feel secure enough in that to not let how others think of and refer to me affect me too much. My dysphoria can also be managed with some chest binding and a more androgynous appearance so that’s what I’ll have to leave it at. 

Obviously not ideal, but like you said the world is fucked up
Yup same here, I was renewing my license and I wanted to throw that X on there…

…until I realized what would happen if a cop pulled me over
Yup. I moved from the US to the UK and through all the legal paperwork and traveling, I just kept my gender marker as my birth sex and didn't correct anyone assuming I was a woman. In any other scenario, I would (got my name and pronouns updated at work and such), but when it's these circumstances, things are already stressful enough trying to get shit approved. Me arguing ""No, it's actually supposed to be X"" not only would be a huge, dysphoria inducing headache, but holds the very real potential of me getting denied based upon that alone. 

'Sides, it was kinda cool going through it in retrospect. Like I was a super secret undercover spy lying about my identity with these fake documents. All those governments officials totally bought my disguise hook, line, and sinker. And now here I am, mission fully accomplished, cover never blown, living my best enby life.
My country gives the option to change gender marker to X. But I fear giving that information to the state. Because it can be used against us (like in, having a harder time getting medical insurance or being charged more just on case we may want to transition, having issues with the police/potential employers, that sort of stuff)
lol for real I thought it was understood how shitty that country is to anyone who isn't male, muslim, and rich as fuck
Yeah, my initial thought was 'this ban is for your own safety'
While true, Dubai is a massive transit hub for people travelling between Australia and Europe / American. I'm shocked I didn't know this before
Please don't apologize. I hope you're staying safe 💖
Yeah I'm also in Iran and can definitely second that! It feels like we don't even have the right to think about coming out as a non binary or ANYTHING OUTSIDE the damn male/female system... I was fortunate enough to be an amab at least, yet life is still so difficult cuz I'm an NB and I absolutely hate being a masculine man (no offense to any of the amazing masculine ppl out there!). Being AFAB in here is a completely diffrent story (long story short, ""Nightmare""). And yeah all they're saying is true... THIS IS REALITY...
First time i've heard of that, that's pretty useful except for the 'choose if you want your current or previous gender marker' part. Could still cause issues if you don't pass as your AGAB.
That’s really cool actually
That is so handy omg. I wish the UK had a system like that (instead of flat out denying all nonbinary people legal representation outside of the Census ✌️🤪)
Thank you for sharing this info! This practise sets a valuable and important precedent for other countries that are implementing neutral gender markers. My country has allowed X as a gender marker for 3.5 years, but they still haven't come up with a solution for passport and travel safety.
As far as I am aware you can also get a second passport, for that reason. So that you can have one with your actual gendermarker and one that would allow you to travel into countries that don't recognize the X / U.
At least you get stuff for all the bureaucracy… in the US we don’t get anything but stupid discriminatory laws, broken roads, no healthcare, etc..
I...assumed all bureaucracy is Hell. Pardon my ignorance, but what gives German the steroids...?
They can check when you're in the airport with the check in crew. I fly Emirates all the time since I lived there no probs but I wouldn't risk it. I flew Qatar Airways and there was no condition, but they didn't let me on during check in because I didn't have a return trip even though it was just a layover in the country.
It’s not an exclusive definition of course but unless you are eligible for a visa waiver you are required a transit visa even if it’s only for a short technical stop or fuel stop. I think they’d usually stop you before boarding the plain in the first place.
Yes
>suppose they got it..

Well, they wanted good PR, and I can't say that they got it
Shit that's true, I'm dead o-o
Yeah, there are lots of transits that go through Dubai if you go on any long-distance flights.
If you never go through immigration at the airport your passport is never looked at and you never officially entered the country.

By not allowed to enter they mean they won't let you through immigration. They'll make sure you're on a plane leaving.
From the UK I can't go to Australia, New Zealand, Japan, Thailand, or anywhere else by and or in the Pacific cuz all flights stop in UAE lmao
They probably meant to word it as layover then although it wouldn't surprise me if they meant it exactly as it is written.
I'm not sure about your country specifically, but aren't most intersex people given a binary gender marker when they're born?  I've never personally heard of an intersex person getting an 'x' gender marker at birth, it usually has to be changed to that later *if* they want it

On every single form and resource my government has regarding the 'x' gender marker, it is explicitly stated their are places that may not accept your ID and countries that will not allow entry with that gender on your passport, no exceptions.  It's not anything they can control, so it is ultimately your decision if you want the affirmation of your gender being recognized *or* the convenience of being legally identified as binary.  Thankfully, I believe my government will allow me to change my gender on my driver's license without changing it on the rest of my IDs.
[deleted]
Brazilian here. My country too was based on slave labour, corruption and murder.
the usa is much better than uae.
not to be blunt but did you change your gender marker?
UAE has almost entirely developed in the last 20 years or so. What european county is still using slave labor in that time span?
The issue with the UAE isn't its *history* of using slaves, it's that they literally still have slaves as we speak.
But what about the cultures outside of European influence that still have homophobia?

I understand how European homophobia is the oppressors of indigenous expression both here and in places like India - but the UAE doesn’t have that excuse, do they?
I’m aware of that, but I haven’t slept in over 24 hours (nasty cold) so it didn’t occur to me. I’ve never seen us be banned in this way.
Unfortunately this is a true statement as I tried to assign our newborn x. And was told by our lawyer its not legal.
Nerd moment here, it's actually not a religious thing. Just like Christians cherry picking that is what they are doing as well in there own religion. No where in there does it mention discrimination against nonbinary people. So over all this is just wrong that they are doing this
Edit: not per say cherry picking but making shit up that doesn't exist. Sorry for any confusion on that
Yeah.. still sad but at least there are other places to visit.
It’s actually more cultural than religious in this case. Please check your facts before making statements like this
Because most of the time it does nothing but open you up to more abuse. Why do we even need any genders listed on legal docs? There’s no reason.
That's actually pretty badass
To be fair, if you actually get in and they find out you’re trans, you’ll be sent to jail and probably executed. So stopping you at the border is probably the best outcome in this situation
Same for me. I use they/them and a gender neutral name outside of work, but use she/her and my (very feminine) legal name at work and on official paperwork. It's just not worth opening that can of worms to me. We're slowly working towards it not being an issue, but we've still got a long way to go. Gotta do whatever works best for your personal situation.
Exactly. I want my gender marker removed because it doesn’t apply to me, and putting an X there just makes me a target even if I “appear to be cis”
Saaaaaame!  I cannot tell you how long I scared at the three gender options (M/F/X) before I picked one. I went with my AGAB, because I travel out of state pretty regularly and the last thing I need is a layover in one of the…. less enlightened…. regions of the US, and a cop who wants to score some points with the redhats. It’s not safe to be trans everywhere in my own country, ffs, I do not want to fuck with my ability to “pass” if shit gets real internationally.
I have the X on my drivers license but no way on a passport.
Muslim isn't actually a necessary factor tbh. as long as you're male and rich you're probably good.
salam!!!!  
anyways I once knew someone who was amab but identified as female and just knowing all the challenges she faced through her life its awful to even think about hopefully with the current state of the country theres a brighter morrow where we are not discriminated against but till then I wish you the best friend its actually quite heartwarming to hear or well read your comment idk why it never occoured to me that there are other people like me XD
yess it can still cause issues and is not perfect. but well at least something. luckyly i had never to test it but knowing that i do have the option is making things a lot easier in my head.
We are waaaay behind on digital stuff. So much still has to be done on paper and that's why it takes longer. Like, why are we so behind? And there is so much paperwork. And you run from one office to another constantly.

We are so behind my UK friends are laughing at us.

Before going to university I had to go to the building to get the paperwork, then go to my bank and print proof that I transferred the money they wanted me to transfer, then I had to go to the building of my insurance and get proof that I am insured (and I had to wait a lot there because they were busy) and then I had to go back to the university building to show all the proof and the filled in paperwork for like 1 second... You know, as opposed to send proof digitally or mail it. I had to do it all in person.

When I left the church community I went to one office to fill out all the paperwork, then had to take the stairs to go to another office in the building, show them the paperwork, pay (yeah you have to pay to leave), then get proof that I paid, then walk back and show the first office proof that I paid and then it was official. Now that process didn't take very long but still... They could make it more efficient but for some reason they won't.

And that's only two examples of this nonsense. 

Imagine if anywhere in the process.

Changing gender might be more difficult because I think according to german law you need two psychiatrists to confirm you're really trans. Forgive me if I got that wrong. I haven't looked into that in a while because I have kinda given up on that.
That's not accurate.

You may be right that Emirates staff will give you a hard time. That's a subjective thing, and there are a lot of different reasons that could happen. Like I said, I'm not sure I would choose to fly Emirates at all, and definitely not while transiting through a UAE airport.

But usually the airline is only looking at whether you have the documents you need for your final destination. Since refueling stops and airport layovers don't require visas, in theory, Emirates would not require you to have a transit visa for the UAE if your final destination is a different country. In general, airlines do not require passengers to have visas for countries where they have a layover.

(Example: I traveled to Italy via Istanbul on Turkish Airlines in 2015. They did not care at all whether I had the ability to enter Turkey, because I wasn't going to Turkey, I was going to Italy. The same happened to me when I traveled to Japan via Shanghai on a Chinese airline in 2017 - they only cared whether I could get into Japan, not China.)

Edit: A ""transit visa"" is usually only used if you are traveling overland through a country to get to a different country, or if you are staying for a brief period while waiting for a different mode of transportation. For example if you're disembarking in Dubai and then driving to Oman, you might need a transit visa.
I don’t think the PR was nearly as negative as it should have been. I only saw a handful of subs talking about it. Every other sub and social media talked about people boycotting the cup as overreacting. Hell, Reddit consistently was putting posts from r/Qatar on my feed constantly trying to dismiss and debunk criticisms
If PR stands for Public Relations it is really debatable. We r not naive and all know the sewer pipe FIFA is, getting the chance to host the event is one of the best things ever to help with all sorts of corruption; they made loads of money. No one talked about their country before that, basically, and since it ended they r going again outside of the major public eye, but oligarchs don't make buissness for the people or to get good impressions. Our world is literally run by Psychopaths and Sociopaths with power and welth we can't count, those seeking to strike buissness with them will get what they want and they don't give a shit about all the people slaved and murdered to make this event happen. It's about the public only if u r the public, the ones who administrate those things don't care about us and getting good impressions is a bonus and not a priority. Guessing it worked out for them..
It is still regarded as a transit so some will still need a transit visa for this situation, regardless of if they have to go through immigration or not.
There are non-stop flights from London Heathrow to (I think) Sydney and Perth in Australia these days on Qantas. Also you can come via Singapore Airlines, or Malaysia Airlines, possibly one or two others.

So there are other options if you're avoiding Etihad, Qatar, Emirates or any others from that area of the we world. But they're fewer and more expensive.
Maybe layover in another European country? I flew to Japan, China and Singapore nonstop from Germany
Really? I’ve had some flight stop in Istanbul before heading there.
What do you mean ? Many people need a transit visa for transit, no matter what exact kind of transit it is. Layover, like stopping for gas, is just another type of transit.
Really depends on the country. In Germany the option for passports has existed for quite a few years now. The option for a third gender for intersex people or for those you chose to leave it out entirely in birth registers is possible since 2018.

There have been changes here and there all over the world tho. I think in the US the first passport with a gender „X“ was issued for a non-binary person a couple of years ago.
It does depend on the country issuing the passport tho. In Germany it’s since 2018 that a third gender can be entered into the birth register, also including the option to omit the gender completely. The „X“ in the German passport for „undefined“ has been an option for some time tho, since 2013 or sth.
We weren’t talking about which was worse, were we?
No need to turn this into a shitting competition but any closer look into the dodgy (to say the least) supply chains of most European companies with modern slave labour, child labour etc. reveals anything but a rosy picture. Capitalism lives off exploitation, also in Europe where they care enough about trying to hide their dirt and remove themselves from responsibility.

That does not minimise the extreme human rights violations elsewhere, and hell, UAE are fucking next level, but a fair and benevolent Europe is an absurdly romanticised fantasy.
so does the United States, should people not spend money here either?
[removed]
Sure but the original commenter was very obviously acting like Muslim countries are somehow culturally inferior or even uniquely barbaric to European countries. They would never say “America is built on slave labor, corruption, and murder. Why spend your money there?” even though it obviously is
Im not sure theres a more severe ban than the penalty of death lmfao
yup, i am intersex but AFAB and transmasc but people never understand that lol if i had just been assigned intersex at birth it would be a lot simpler
The fact that they're twisting the religion to justify it doesn't really make it ""not a religious thing."" They're still using the religion as an excuse. I get you're trying to get people not to generalize but it really just comes off as unnecessary lip service to the people who are still discriminating against and killing us.
Not transiting there is actually hard if you are going from Europe to Asia/Oceania.
Which in those areas are in fact deeply rooted in religious influence. I am not incorrect here.
I got mine changed to X and I've been perfecting my outraged libertarian impression for the day someone gets in my business about it.

""The fucking government has no right to know anything about me! First they put gender on shit, next they're going to be asking your cock size! I won't tell them anything they don't make me! I'm a private citizen and they can butt the fuck out of my life!""
You can choose which documents have which gender marker?? Which country are you in?
And cis-het. Not too big on hte gaaays.
Salam haha
Oh I can imagine how horrible it must've been for them
But yeah, hopefully a brighter future is upon us! Also this is as heartwarming for me my friend and tbh you're actually the first Iranian NB I've talked to knowing that they're NB and can understand me! Pleasure is all mine dear fellow human being :))
Just note that the USA is a major exception to this rule.

If you require a US visa to enter the USA as a tourist, then you'll need a visa to transit a US airport, even if the plane is just stopping to refuel or if you need to switch planes at a US airport.  I know Canada also requires transit visas even if you are just switching planes at a Canadian airport (provided that you need a visa to enter Canada as a tourist).

Simply put, the USA and Canada don't allow for sterile transit.
Anyone who spoke out about human rights abuses on Twitter was immediately dogpiled for being racist and islamophobic, so, the PR spin worked.
>Every other sub and social media talked about people boycotting the cup as overreaRedditcting

Well, what I saw was people saying that boycotting it was ineffective and pointless. And that being angry at other people weren't also boycotting it was overeating.


>don’t think the PR was nearly as negative as it should have been.

Yeah, i agree. But it wasn't how they wanted it so, at least there's that.
And TV is full of advertising for holidays there at the moment
But it WAS for PR. They want to rebrand their country to something closer to Dubai and sports are a part of that. Their goal is to change their economic dependence on oil, and to do that they need to attract foreign skilled workers.


The bad PR they got doesn't go along with this.


 

>the ones who administrate those things don't care about us and getting good impressions is a bonus and not a priority. Guessing it worked out for them..

 And then what exactly Qatar got out of it? Attention of oligarchs? Why would they need attention if not to use as PR. If all they wanted was to seem approachable for business to the rich of the world, how would a World cup help that? 

Sports events are always about the PR. It's a show of your country and part of greater objectives. If they wanted to deal with the rich, there were loads of more efficient and direct ways it doing so.
I think it probably did work for them, and unfortunately the reason for that is that even in the West people don’t really give a shit about LGBT people, at least not as much as they care about football :(
As an Aussie I BEG you, don’t use Qantas. They will cancel your flight and leave you here. I’m not joking. It’s become the laughing stock of airlines and the worst part is, they don’t give a shit.
Maybe that could work, still a pain to get several tickets though
I mean, Turkey is not currently great about this stuff, either.
I could be wrong then
I mean, they just probably don't want you to de-plane for a layover but it wouldn't surprise me if it is as written.
I don't think you're understanding what I'm saying.  ""X"" or blank gender markers exist a lot of places yes, but it is very rare if ever the assigned gender marker at birth for a person, if at all.  People are able to make the change if they *want* to, but it comes with legal issues because it *isn't* recognized everywhere and you are typically given fair warning before the change is made.  I'm sure if there are cases where *some* intersex people are not assigned a binary sex at birth, the parents are made aware of the legal risks of that legal designation.

By changing your gender marker to 'x' or removing it, you are agreeing to documentation that may not be recognized internationally.  Your nation offers it as an option to you, but they have no control over if other nations recognize it.  To a nation like the UAE, an 'x' is invalid formatting, they do not recognize that passport as valid.  *If* you have to take a stop in the UAE because of your airline's planning, you should be faulting the airline for only giving the option to stop in an incredibly socially behind country.  The UAE has far worse crimes than not accepting a passport without gender designation, their laws suggest killing people for being gay.  No airline should be making a stop there if they have other options.
I don't think anyones saying that? 

It's a thread about a picture of the UAE's fucked up policies, all i'm saying is lets not try to downplay the fucked upness.
Yes.

As a Canadian, I would not want to travel to, nor spend money in quite a few states given their attitudes. I may not vote in your elections, but I can still vote with my dollars.
yeah, they shouldn't
The US currently has slaves? You wanna cite what you're saying or nah?
Please examine why you feel the need to minimize this issue, and then never speak to me again.
The long and short of it is that while there are oppressive religious/cultural influences that harm queer people, if we were to count up who’s been the most harmful to queer people historically, it’s been European and American colonial and neo-colonial forces. People, such as OP can and should absolutely call out oppression wherever it exists, but that doesn’t give people like the commenter an excuse to be, frankly, orientalist and racist
Yeah, I can’t disagree with that.
A lot of things would be simpler too.
And you are lumping everyone in as one which isn't right. Yes they are using and abusing their religion in all the wrong ways but doesn't mean everyone believes that. There is a ton of people that don't believe what they are doing!
You're right ! Even from Africa to Asia, you have to transit there. Well now that's a problem
You actually are. I spoke directly to many people who are both Middle Eastern and Muslim and every single one returned the answer that it is primarily not religious in nature. What you are doing is spreading falsehoods about the Islamic faith which quite literally can inspire bigotry and violence. Do your research instead of blindly spreading damaging misconceptions about an already widely misunderstood and vilified religion.
That's a method lol. Unfortunately I'm too visibly queer for it to be viable
I’m in the US and do this. My license is through the state and offers X. Federally with social security I’m male and for any binary gendered forms. I will be getting a passport with male soon. What you can do depends on the state you’re in here. My state makes it very easy to change your gender on all documents and they aren’t required to all list the same one. I changed my license before my birth certificate because I was excited to change it to X as soon as it was available so I’d stop getting misgendered as much after getting IDed for alcohol etc. I waited to change my birth certificate until my name change went through since I don’t have to it to show people typically.
In the US non binary recently became an option on passports. I already had mine and won’t update it. On state documents my state recognizes non-binary so I updated it.  Not all states will do this and all states are independent from the federal government (passports)
Sometimes you can’t. Like maybe the federal government and the state you moved to let you change most of your IDs but the state you were born in doesn’t allow you to change your birth certificate. It depends entirely on which state you live in
As a bi gal in the UAE, yeahh nope. Can't wait for uni!
Exactly, that depends completely on the country and your citizenship. unless you can travel without visa or are eligible for a visa waiver you always need a transit visa for transit in countries that you’re citizenship requires it. And transit includes stuff like layovers but also only fuel and technical stops. Many flights from Europe to e.g. New Zealand over Sydney will always require a transit visa for Australia, even if you’re not leaving the plain.
All of this. Basically, if you didn't watch because it was in Qatar, it was because you're racist. But if you supported the hearts and rainbows etc, you don't care about rules and decorum... people suck...
There was an analysis in the run up to the cup that pointed out that a few decades ago, most sporting events were held in open, democratic countries. Now they are increasingly held in authoritarian ones, even as democracy has spread. It gave a simple reason: as it's been shown that hosting these events costs the country more than it brings in, governments that are accountable to their citizens have lost interest. They don't bid for the events, or at least make bids with smaller offerings (in terms of stadiums and other infrastructure built). So instead the bids are won by dictators who have little interest in their people's welfare, can build a huge stadium by decree, and care far more about the related PR, since these governments are not usually well seen worldwide. In that respect, Qatar's bid has been a mixed success at best.
Ok, I think I see what you mean now. It’s definitely still extremely flawed since it’s not recognised internationally by all countries. It’s only a beginning. 

What I was saying in response was just that Germany is one of those countries where people now have the option, where it’s possible to go beyond the f/m binary option when a child is born and for intersex people to be correctly registered in the birth register, from the beginning. 

Upon birth, the parents will of course still have to make that decision for the child in consideration of the legal international context, and so far not many parents in Germany have actually chosen to make use of this option, most likely also because of the potential negative impacts internationally. 

But the option of a third gender was actually introduced for legal reasons for intersex and trans individuals in Germany, who previously only had the option to completely remove their gender from legal or identification documents, which lead to a plethora of legal issues in their family and partnership documentation and other bureaucratic matters. 

Internationally - for those who already had their gender blanked out before, the official recognition of / chance to the third gender option will not really make much of a different experience at this point, but within the country it can make a huge difference.
Sure I totally agree. But if that’s all you meant the comparison to Europe in your comment “What european county is still using slave labor in that time span?” was somewhat misleading.
I can say the same about Canada. I stand with my indigenous siblings across all borders.
Look into the prison labour system. Look into immigrant exploitation.
The 13th amendment LITERALLY allows slavery if it’s punishment for a crime. Not an interpretation. It uses the words. 
“Neither slavery nor involuntary servitude, except as a punishment for crime whereof the party shall have been duly convicted, shall exist within the United States, or any place subject to their jurisdiction.”
Prison slavery is still slavery.
The 13th amendment

>Neither slavery nor involuntary servitude, *except as a punishment for crime whereof the party shall have been duly convicted*, shall exist within the United States, or any place subject to their jurisdiction.
I think they may have been trying to agree with you? Just worded it extremely awkwardly
The truth of the matter is that dismantling colonialism and white supremacy is in our best interest as queer and GNC people, so we shouldn’t let ourselves get suckered into acting like the East or the Global South are uniquely savage or barbaric. That kind of thinking not only led to colonialism, imperialism, and mass war and extermination, but also oppression and erasure for people like us
I'm not lumping them in though. It's not generalizing a religion to just acknowledge when people are using that religion to hurt others. No duh plenty of people practice peacefully, that doesn't change the reality of those that don't. You can't just claim religion has nothing to do with it when they are *specifically using their religion to justify it* just because that's not how everyone in the religion does it.
This is good to know, thanks. I’ve been thinking of updating my marker when I get my REAL ID but have been having concerns.
The worst thing is some people absolutely were being racist and Islamophobic. It’s just that anyone speaking out got lumped in with them too. 

Same thing happened to people speaking against Israel to support Palestine—they were branded antisemitic by the PR spin and delegitimised for it. And again there absolutely were people using it as an excuse to be antisemitic, but the whole support was swept up into the same generalisation for political PR.
Well, then that turns into a discussion of what constitues slave labor which upon further thought is not a discussion I want to have. So I apologize if thats what I was steering this towards.
That's perfectly fine with me, too, and not mutually exclusive.  I'm all for wrongs not being supported, wherever they lie.
Sure exploited labor is definitely problematic and an obvious injustice, but to compare that to the actual forced labor happening in countries like UAE just diminishes it's batshit insane level of cruelty.
They were not.
What state are you in.  In MA it took less than 5 min and no drama. I didn’t have to show/prove anything.
I Absolutely Hate When This Happens, Where A Frankly Detestable Group Is Really Vocal In Their Distaste Of Something Or Another, To The Point That If You Try To Express Your Own Distaste Of It You Could Get Lumped In, So You Need To Either Explain Several Times That You're Not Part Of The Group, Or Risk Getting Thought Of As One.
Just as important is just that slavery overseas isn't necessarily culpable only to the nation in which it takes place.
Ask the black and brown prisoners doing 25 years for weed how they feel. Especially in states where weed is now legal.
Could you explain how if you don’t mind? I read it a few times and I’m still pretty sure they were just trying to expand on your point, but very clumsily as I mentioned. I’m trying to wrap my head around it lol
Oh- I have my paperwork and such it’s not a problem with the paperwork on my end. I’m hesitant because of traveling for work, getting harassed, etc.
Why Are You Typing Like This
Again, not defending it, direct your anger somewhere else. Just saying actual literal slavery is still happening and lets not downplay it by comparing it to prison labor.

Pretty fucked up to die on this hill of all hills.
I mind
Prison labour is actual literal slavery in the US, and in many other places too
How is prison labor not slave labor, not sure i understand? Its unpaid, forced labor

I got my gender on my drivers license now!!!		"Congrats, I’m seriously considering doing this soon.
Omg that's so cool, I'm very happy for you 
In France sadly that's not happening because apparently not being either a man or a woman ""threatens the social and legal order of society ""
Granted I haven't done the research but I didn't know oregon offered the X. I should get mine updated at some point
[deleted]
Yayy, congrats!!!
Congrats that's awesome !!!
Congratulations, I’m happy for you 😃
let’s goooo
That’s genuinely amazing, congrats!
I am moving to Oregon I stg
I’ve got my name change next month and am strongly considering doing my gender at the same time. (Also in Oregon)
Congratulations!!!! You've just reminded me that this is a thing, I'm gonna have to get that changed in the future <3
I love that I live in a state that has this option!!
I recently discovered it's a simple process to do that where I am. The catch is...60$+plus the cost of a notaries services to update my birth certificate,  then 80$ to update and get a new provincial ID (government issue ID, think drivers license adjacent but just to verify yourself)

I am slowly psyching myself up to it. I keep questioning myself, but my ability to commit to big life things is...shoddy
 I miss living in Oregon. I used to live in Bend before they let it get overrun by Colleges and businesses (the population was 60,000 when I lived there).  I live in Texas now which is a Red State Hellscape. As far as I know, we don't have that option.
Congrats!  I’m just over here crying in Texas - no option whatsoever here
I want to do this with my birth certificate but I live away from my birth state. I'm not really sure if I'd be able to get my state id changed, or if I move to a state without this if I could get one at all.
I’ve been meaning to do this but I always forget it’s an option! Maybe I’ll do it for my birthday next week.
Eyyy congrats. We can't do that here in UK. There was actually a recent law case taken to supreme court but it wasn't allowed because apparently ""your gender is a way of confirming your identity"" and they also said they wouldn't cos the system is male and female so why change it. Like come on, gender is not a way to confirm someone's identity, it assumes everyone looks like their AGAB when many don't and also like the only way you could confirm it anyway was if they told you to expose yourself which is not a thing. They just came out with the most bullshit excuses as to not do it. Fucking conservative bastards I say.
I think the USA passport will have that option too this year!
Ive had X on my VA DL for awhile. Its a nice feeling but im surprised literally no one had said anything or noticed it.
Sex?  N O.
That’s so awesome!! 

I’m my opinion I think it could be good for medical reasons to have the sex assigned at birth and the person’s gender. For example mine would be “F,X”

I feel like that would be good info incase I got in an accident and the doctors needed to know what my assigned gender at birth was for medical reasons.

Or maybe that should be on a medical card? I don’t know haha
Awe I'm so happy for you!
Gender : unknown
I just switched as well. Waiting for my ID to come in.
Niceeee I can’t wait for mine. I went to the court and everything just the waiting game
Neat
Awesome! PSA for those living in NJ, you can now have an “X”/enby designation on your licenses here too, just like Oregon. I’m planning to get mine changed when I move to my new address next month :)
Cries with jealousy that my state won't let me
Yay.
I'm in California and I did this
I didn’t even know they did that :o
Ooo i wish I could do this! Hopefully I Wisconsin allows it soon
so happy for you!!!! how long did it take??
Wow that is so awesome! I am Oregon also, I’m so glad to know we have this option!!! Thank you!
Congratulations! That is awesome, and I'm so happy for you. I've been needing to do the same with my license, but I haven't driven in a long time so I've been lazy about it.
I hate arizona :(
Did the same too a couple months ago. Congratulations! 🥳
Yessss congrats love!!
Cascadia gang!
I am Colombian and I am conservative I do not like this idea but good job on your license as i feel all should have rights I support this but my catholic and traditional side tugs at this
It was really easy! I was nervous but the lady at the dmv didn’t care and just let me update my gender no questions asked!
[removed]
Dumb logic considering Nonbinary have existed across cultures around the world since humans were alive
Sheesh. If they're worried about legal loopholes, all they have to do is make a law that says, ""All laws that apply to males and females apply to non-binary people too"".
Jeez what do they think of non-binary intersex people then?
Do it!
I'm pretty sure you just mark it on the form! I could be wrong though
heyo it’s as simple as you just telling them what your gender is! got my non-binary “x” last summer!
When I moved here they just asked “Male, Female, or unspecified?” when I transferred my CDL.
I know that when Minnesota added the 'X' option, they made it clear that the gender marker on your state ID/DL is completely self-identified. You can pick any of the three options for any reason. You don't need any additional documentation.

I'd imagine Oregon is similar.
It's self-identified, and to add to what someone else mentioned, it's basically a ""Prefer not to say"" option. It translates in their system to ""unspecified"", not ""non-binary"" (which honestly makes me more comfortable to travel with that as my identification). I just got mine updated last week, with name change too! Oregon makes most of this stuff really easy.
do it!
There's no time pressure, you know... you're allowed to take as long as you want.
Confirming that Texas has only M/F state ID options
Sorry to hear that! Maybe one day Texas will do this
Hey my birthday is next week too! Happy Birthday!!!
God they sound like idiots. Sorry you have to deal with that
That’s what I’ve heard. They announced they were going to make the X an option in 2021 but idk when it will take effect
This is exactly why I have always gone back and forth on doing this on my own ID! Especially since if you get in an accident, they would just take you to the nearest hospital and not necessarily have access to your medical info right away. I’m not sure how much of a serious or vital piece of information my biological sex is if I were to get in an 
accident /gen 
If there’s anyone who works in the medical field that could give some insight on this, I would really appreciate it 🙏
That’s great! Early congratulations then!
The longest thing was making an appointment at the dmv to renew my license. But from going in to getting my gender changed like 20 minutes
Wooo!
HOW??!????? HOW DO I DO THAT!???!?!!??!?
It does stand officially for undisclosed and sex. But it allows enbys like us to say we aren’t male or female on official papers
Sex and gender are generally used interchangeably.

The split gender/sex model is also an older concept that less people are using. The [newer model ](https://thebodyisnotanapology.com/magazine/sex-and-gender-are-actually-the-same-thing-but-bear-with-me/) is what more and more people are using.
Hey but that means I need to come out first. Which well, step by step
Same! They didn’t care
Just got here and haven't gotten ID'd up yet, this is a thing here? Rad if true.
True!
Heck yeah! Happy birthday!
Yes agreed! Medical eggs of Reddit, help!
If you are a state that has an X options make an appointment at your local DMV and then go and ask to change your gender marker. If you aren’t born in the USA you will need other documents I think? But if you’re a us citizen there should be no other documentation but your old license
You’ll get there!
For Minnesota? Absolutely.

Here in Pennsylvania all you have to do is fill out [PennDOT form DL-32](https://www.dot.state.pa.us/public/dvspubsforms/BDL/BDL%20Form/DL-32.pdf) and bring it to the DMV. You'll have to pay if you want a brand new ID with that change printed up right there and then, or you can get an update card for free and wait until you need to renew your ID for the change to appear on your ID. No doctor note or other paperwork necessary.

not at all. gender is a difficult road and if I can help one person feel more comfortable with themselves then it's all worth it <3

ps. i hope i explained myself correctly!

harry styles? i-

I love that look!!! I really like high top skinny jeans, but I struggle to find ones that fit me well. Not having hips, women's jeans are loose on me at the waist. Mens skinny jeans fit me better but are never high top. The struggle is real 😑
Your doing Great!
I've been trying to work up the confidence for crop tops lately. You look great!
You look adorable. My aesthetic exactly.
i think it looks great, probably feels great to be living your authentic self

Dam they do look kinda like Harry Styles
They look way hotter than harry
Thanks! They're from Topshop, they're the Considered Bleach straight jeans.
Same, looking forward to hearing some new stuff in a few months!
This 100%. I was AMAB & I've barely made any changes to my appearance since I came out as non binary and I feel completely confident in who I am as agender. However, if they want to express their gender identity through exploration outside of what society considers to be normal for us, then that's absolutely cool, too. Either way, we're here to support you, enby fam. 👍❤️
Thanks so much!

I lost my gender in a terrible accident a few years back. It was incredibly tragic. Very hard to talk about.
Gender? No thanks I already ate.

Why...hot...very...cute...brain...short-circuiting.... Why...?

Answer...no one cares about gender when person=hot.

I like your gender I'll take six, seven if you throw in a crape
Shit man your hot regardless of gender.
Mr, ms? The fuk are those? You may refer to me as master.
I'm sorry if this sounds insulting, but you look like my Miraculous Ladybug OC I made in middle school. Again I'm not trying to insult you, you both are cute, but you look just like them with that shirt.
I want that fishnet shirt so bad 😩😩😩

Wearing my pronouns today, because unfortunately customers feel the need to gender me		"Those earrings are kickass. Are you Ace?
The whole look is on point and if people still don't get it they are donkey doo-doo.
I'm sorry people feel the need to gender you. Its amazing how blind others can be to experiences outside of their own. I can't imagine most wanted to hurt your feelings though. I imagine most are just not very educated about gender identity.
I'm considering getting a pronoun pin to wear at work - did you find that it worked at all? I get called ""lady"" constantly and just want it to stop 😭
❤️
Omg I love the shirt! From where did you get it?
I'm super shy and introverted so if someone gets my pronouns wrong I'm like welp whatever it is it is. I legit hate correcting people on these things.
I hope it works at least for a few of the customers

Looks great
Gender? No… I’m about to show you *something beyond that*
In my experience, it doesn’t really help. Hope your experience is different, friend.
When people gender me, I just don't blame them. They don't know me well so I just correct them
That is an awesome shirt!
Would it be weird to get a pronoun pin for the club or nights out?
Omg, where did you get this shirt!?!?!? Edit: Your dreads look AMAZING!
I hate when people throw in unnecessary gendered terms…
Uggh… I’m starting back into customer service next week and I’m dreading this.  How hard is it to just say hi and ask for what you want without bringing up gender?

You look awesome by the way.
I'll just say I love the use of gender as a verb. You did not have a gender till they game you one in their heads. Let them live the fairytale land of ""gender"". You are existing simply as a person, which is something they don't get to experience
You look stunning!
Thank you! I am ace and i love these earrings so much.
They never get it. I have multiple shirts, a sweatshirt, and pins. They dont even try and it hurts sometimes
Yeah most people are very ignorant about the subject and thats why the majority of the time i dont let it get to me. But sometimes it just feels like my identity itself gets erased. Ya know?
I get dear and darling a lot. But the worst one lately..  




Ma'am 😫
☺️
I found it on etsy. I buy all my amazing stuff from etsy, like my ace earrings!😆
Its really hard to do, and you dont know how they will react. Some people are so fearful of stuff that they dont understand that they might verbally assault you. Also it takes a lot of energy to correct someone when you are shy and introverted. I know from experience
This makes me think of the scene from teen titans when Raven dragged dr. Light into darkness 😈 great scene
Oh it doesnt work 🥲 but it makes me feel better to at least have the shirt. The majority of people are still ignorant about the subject
Ive thought about correcting people but the issue is that it happens with to many people. Ya know? At some point it would get tiring.
Thank you!
So I don’t personally identify as NB but I joined this sub because a few of my friends are and honestly pins, shirts or colored jewelry makes me feel a lot better when addressing my friends or people I don’t know very well. I always feel like such a sleeze when I misgender people even if it’s an accident.
Love the shirt idea though :)
I dont think it would be weird
It would be weird to go to a club in a pandemic but it’s always cool to wear a pin with your pronouns.
I got the shirt from etsy, i get a lot of stuff from there, and it supports small business 😁 and thank you!☺️
Its absolutely annoying, and unnecessary. People think its being respectful but its really not
Thank you! ☺️

Unfortunately it seems to very difficult for people to not bring up gender. Its mostly older folks. Younger guys like to say ""thanks bro"" and im perfectly fine with that. But when someone says ""sir"" or ""young man"" i get annoyed
Thank you! ❤️☺️
I will fight people if they keep harassing you.
I have a shirt like this that I wear to work along with knee-length trans flag socks and the security guys still misgender me - which would be bad enough if it weren't the security guards, but that just adds a whole extra layer of shitty on it.
Some people are blind to sweat shirts pins and graphic T-Shirts but damn a pronoun is such an easy word to see that your eye should catch it anyway! It’s not like a name that is mispelt beyond repair, its three or four letters.

People gotta do better, else they risk misgendering a cis person on a bad day… I’ve seen the wrath of a middle aged lady being called sir.
I can only imagine how grating it would be to be misidentified day in and day out, regardless of intent. We grew up in a world where everyone was supposed to fit in prescribed boxes, and thus anyone who we couldn't accurately categorize was dismissed as weird or at worst ostracized. The concept that some people do not identify with either of the two ""accepted"" gender identities has not yet reached the global consciousness. I believe your situation will remain unfortunately common until the future. But I also believe things will change for the better in that respect. Good luck to you, and don't give up if others wear down your resolve. You have every right to be properly addressed.
Thanks for this. I’ve started going out again (since covid vaccinations avail) and it’s been annoying because it’s like ppl go out of their way to get my attention and then misgender me (I don’t think it’s malicious; just less understood/conservative area). 

I think I’m going to get a rubber id they/them bracelet thing for casual daily wear, a few nice shirts for first meetups and some different pins and pendants to switch it up (I wonder if they would even notice this). I also worry even with all that, they still won’t get it 🤦🏾
I dont use pronouns when talking to people unless i really need to get someone’s attention (like a customer) and i usually dont feel bad at that point because its usually an older person and they are usually cis.
Thanks. You inspired me to check out some shirts on Etsy 😎
There are plenty of ppl going out and doing things now with vaccinations and precautions (and many before) but after almost two years of not going out, I’m going out to “clubs” or whatever I want with acceptable risks.
I should really be checkin out etsy! They have the coolest stuff! Thank you!
Thats sweet of you! Thank you☺️
Im sorry. It really sucks how hard it is to get people to acknowledge your identity, people dont even try.
People really seem to understand gender when you use the wrong pronouns for their dogs lmao.
Right! And my thing is that why do people have to add 'sir' or 'ma'am' when speaking to you or someone saying ""thank you young man/lady"" like its unnecessary to do that. Some days it makes me sad that i get gendered over and over again. And sometimes i get happy when they get it wrong lol
Thank you! I have high hopes that in the future it will be more normal to not just label people based on gender. It does wear me down but i have some great friends that go to great lengths to remind me that they see me for who i am, and it helps a lot
Hey imo the only people who matter are the ones who notice and respect it. You can’t be a very interesting human if you can’t respect such a simple request. Have fun and be safe!
Your welcome!😆
Np I have pent up anger to spare when it comes to ignorance.
People misgender my dog all the time, then PROFUSELY APPOLOGIZE when I say ""yeah she-"" like... I don't even correct them... it uh... reminds me of when people do the same for humans... it is an uncomfy thing to be a part of
I worked at a semi-formal job… my “egg” has many many many cracks in it now, the amount of misgendering seriously affected me, but I still can’t seem to come out to anyone I am around cause they have not figured it out yet… my hints are not strong enough. 

Lucky for me though, I live in the south, and I adore southern pet names cause they are inherently non-gendered, so at least a handfull of people that I used to interact with last year never misgendered anyone, cause everyone became “baby, love, sweetheart” regardless of how they looked.
Same. I've got a dog that's goofy looking and a dog that's pretty. People misgender them all time. Same reaction.

Edit: [Can't resist posting dog pictures ](https://i.imgur.com/bk2lpLb.jpg)
I feel like i would be fine with pet names, unfortunately i cant get that. Even though a lot of older people come into the store i work at, they adhere to the ""sir/ma'am"" or the ""young man/lady""
Yeah it’s uncommon sadly. I hope the older we get the less we do this to other people trying to just get through their shifts."	pl0cm5	NonBinary	2042	1.0	2021-09-09 15:45:05

If I was transfem I would love that, alas
I would kill for your moobs. Does that term serve them justice? Idk how to describe them.
If you've got a bit of extra tissue on your chest, leaning forward and squeezing your shoulders/upper arms in like OP is doing will make it look like you have boobs.

thanks for your concern but I’m all good lol! Those are from years ago :-)
thanks, you got style
Glad to hear that =)! It just remembered me of the scars from my older sister. She wouldn't let me be there for her and constantly pushed me away... I wish I could have helped her more during that time but I wasn't the person who could help her. 

I also know how off putting it can be when people point out that you have scars but I also know they can be a sign of strength and past troubles you've conquered. So I hope I didn't make you feel uncomfortable.

Thank you, this was life changing. The dead af two wolves meme makes it even worse, but like… in a good way? ❤️🌈
*I'm in this picture and I don't like it*
This actually kinda helped me, too? Replace the wolves with a cat and a worm on a string. The cat's a cool girl, the worm on a string's a genderfucked being that barely passes as being of this realm. They are both gay, and that's pretty much it.
Where are my wolves? I don't have any wolves...
almost accurate.. 

&#x200B;

I'm not cool 😭
Omg I’ve always described it like having a really butch lesbian and an incredibly feminine man in my brain!! This is literally so perfect!!
There is a comic out there that says that inside every bisexual there is a disaster twink and a power lesbian and I think about that a lot - anyway I just came out to my whole family as enby this weekend how is your day going?
okay but same,, if only i was actually cool
I feel called out lol
this is true! i also seem to have one extra ""cool boy"" wolf, so that's awesome
Omg I’ve drawn this EXACT meme in my sketchbook before. Enby hivemind go brrrr
The fact that this kinda gave me euphoria and put my feelings into words ☺️
Lol tru
Wow, this hits home and I didn't realize
I think i finally understand myself O_O
This, and they vaguely merged into this ""cool not-actually-a-boy"" creature that happens to be me.
I’ve never related to anything so hard
Well this is a whole mood. 😅
oh yeah this is it, actually
more like, three wolves... slut, criminal, and child
me, but also me and my roommate when I'm feeling more masc?
All I gotta say is you all are beautiful!

I'm more fem than not and I'm ace so it's not relatable to me, but anyone who wins both worlds is just beautiful in my eyes.
Lol holy crap same
Yes
Yes
Um why is this true???
This is scarily accurate to me lmao
I feel the same way, but replace cool with parkour, and now I'm talking
My wolves are roommates, but not friends haha
Feed them!
Same here
Yup, same
I'm so happy my homebrew meme was actually helpful to people haha. 💓 It's cool to be able to embrace my softness in a masculine way now, after rejecting feminine softness so hard
Your gender identity is Doctor Who and I’m all about it.
Is it weird that those are the exact definitions of people I want to date? Like I am completely ace, but I'm compelled to date people ""in the middle"" or whatever, specifically butch women and fem men - I find them the most attractive not sexually but like maybe visually or something. I'm not sure.... You people are so beautiful. Just thinking out loud I guess.
relatable lol. congrats on coming out!!
CONGRAAAAAATS! On coming out! That's huuuge! I'm proud to hear that Mx!
Care to explain these to me? What is feminine softness vs masculine softness? And same for feminine vs masculine coolness? What do those terms even mean? I am really curious and don't understand.
Yeah my brain keeps chiming in with “Maybe you, an exceedingly private 34 yo adult, came out to all your friends and family for attention.” So, thanks for nothing, brain. I know it’s a good thing, and I’m glad, but damn that was draining!
ah it's kind of hard to explain, I think a lot of it is individualized (and they're not really legit terms lol, just a way to describe my experience). 
as someone who's AFAB, to me feminine softness is linked with more stereotypically feminine presentation/interests, the male gaze, submissiveness, quietness being an expectation. when I think ""soft girl,"" I think of a sweet thing in a dress that acts like a ""girlfriend"" when in a relationship. I feel more soft and feminine in the way that a shy queer boy would be. in that makes sense 😅
I don't entirely understand to be honest, but if it makes sense to you, then more power to you! LOL"	ub2970	NonBinary	2007	1.0	2022-04-24 19:28:03

Hey how is Ohio for trans people? I want to live in Columbus someday but I know the political side of things is a little sketchy

Congratulations from a fellow Ohioan!
My court date for my name change is Friday. So jazzed! 😆
Ayyy! I'm so happy for you, bro!
heck yeah! Congrats bro!!
Aaaaaa congrats!
You changed into an Ohioan? gross
I love your snake bites!
I know all states are different, but I’m curious how difficult it was to get your name legally changed. Was it expensive? Did you need to provide a reason? Also, congrats!! You must feel like a million bucks rn.
If someone told me to describe you, I'd just say fire asf
Hell yeah! I’m so happy for u! Also the lisence says BRO, so that’s fun! Love ur aesthetic, it’s absolutely iconic! :))
Yo, that's fucking sick, but...

KMFDM tee? That's even sicker.
Hell yes! Solid name choice 😃 and T is the business, for sure
Fck yeah!!! Get it!!
im sorry for some reason i thought u changed ur name to ohio and was like fair
Agree, not fair to look that good on ID. I look absolutely spaced in all mine 😂
I looked into it recently. Ohio requires ~~medical documents~~ a short legal document signed by a doctor, therapist, nurse practitioner, or social worker to get your marker changed and they only have binary options.
It was pretty easy, I just filled out a form, faxed it to my primary care doctor, they filled it out, and then faxed it to the BMV! Ohio only offers M or F at the moment, but I wouldn't be surprised if they offer X soon as well. However, one thing to keep in mind is that very few people are assigned X at birth, so having your marker as X would immediately out you as not cis.
Personally it's been pretty great for me, I'm a middle leaning anarchist so I actually like that Ohio is an even split politically, but I know some people prefer one way or the other. In my experience, Ohio is legally left leaning in regards to LGBTQ issues, so my legal and medical transition has been pretty straightforward.
I've actually never seen that cover, but you're right that it definitely does look similar 😂
Born and raised in the land of corn 😂
Iirc it was a bit under $200 and for reason I just said ""gender transition,"" the whole process was a little confusing but once I understood it it was pretty easy to do! And thank you!
Hell yeah!! 
Half the shirts I wear are KMFDM at this point 😂

That's so cool :D
This fucking slaps so hard. Awesome outfit!
This is everything I needed today
Have you ever read the Bloody Jack series? It’s about a girl who sneaks onto a ship by dressing as a boy, and as she grows up she kind of just goes back and forth in her presentation. That’s the vibes I’m getting from these pictures
AAAAAHHHHHHH!!!!!! THIS IS SO GENDER! I love it!
Have you seen Our Flag Means Death?

Also you need a Brown Bess Land Pattern Musket
Where is the hat from?
Yes yes yes! I never feel more comfortable in my gender than when I’m in some kind of costume. Very nice work!
I need this outfit in my life
r/birates would like to plunder your booty.
Hot.
Fabulous! If you're not already aware, Jim Jimenez from Our Flag Means Death (played by Vico Ortiz) is an amazing enby pirate icon.
This is awesome! Absolutely goals.   Would you mind sharing where you got the shirt, or what the brand is?  I've been looking for one just like it.
Arrrrrr I'd give up my booty for you
You've given me sustenance. This is such a vibe that I'd love to wear. It's stylish, bold, and sexy. You did a great job putting it together.
So cool! Where did you get your tricorn hat?
Omg I need a top like this, where did u get??

Also you absolutely killed it wow I wanna be a pirate too!! 😹
Mind if i ask where you found that corset, or that vest?
This is sick! Can I draw you?

""Captain"" is gender-neutral.

Ahoy Number42O! Nay bad but me wasn't convinced. Give this a sail:

Arrrr me’d share me booty wit' ye
Jshdhsjsj this made me laugh
I thrifted them so I’m not 100% sure, but they say Denver Hayes on the bottom, and they’re leather!
Thanks! I’m absolutely obsessed with the print, it’s so perfect for pirate-themed looks
Thanks!!
Oooo I haven’t read that, it sounds right up my alley tho!!
Honestly I got it at a Halloween store years ago lol!
Same here!! Dressing up in some sort of vaguely fantasy or d&d-looking outfit always gives me gender euphoria for some reason lol
It’s a Chinese brand called Infanta, here’s where I bought it! https://www.clobbaonline.com/shop/index.php?route=product/product&product_id=127&search=Infanta+blouse
Thank you so much, this is so sweet!!
At a Halloween store years ago haha, I can’t remember which one sorry!
Thank you!! It’s from a Chinese brand, here’s where I ordered it: https://www.clobbaonline.com/shop/index.php?route=product/product&product_id=127&search=Infanta+blouse
So there’s a few layers there: the vest/waistcoat was from Le Chateau, the dark brown corset belt was from Amazon, and the light brown one was thrifted!
Omg absolutely!! Please send it to me if you do!!
Ahahahah this is the best compliment, thank you!
YES
It’s actually a dress folded down into a skirt, it’s from a Chinese brand called Diamond Honey, and the dress print is called Treasure Voyage! I got it here, not sure if it’s still in stock: https://www.clobbaonline.com/shop/index.php?route=product/product&product_id=2182. And I’ve hitched it up with a sort of elastic belt thing!
Good bot
The ruffled trim really sells the time period as well...elevates it from looking like a Halloween costume. Well done!
It’s so good and I think there’s around 10 books?
Thank you!
Just sharing my honest thoughts💖
Thank you, the one I found at Spirit Halloween last year was too big for my head sadly
Ooh thank you! 🤩
Hell yeah thanks, well just be a sketch so don't expect too much from me I'm not too good but I'll def send it to you🥰 you seem cool
OP thank you so much!

I reverse image searched and found this dress on aliexpress from a non-sketch vendor for $25 free shipping. 

https://www.aliexpress.com/item/3256801128685403.html?spm=a2g0o.cart.0.0.767d38daB3h7RI&mp=1 

I am curious what size you went with. I am guessing this is something I should size up with?

It was pointed out to me that this sub is overrun with images of white, skinny vaguely masculine people as gender envy. Here are some photos of incredible nonbinary and gender nonconforming POC		"this was inspiring. sometimes it's easy to think that I'm not nonbinary enough which can give me both imposter syndrome AND dysphoria at once lmao. very happy 💜
somehow number 5 is gender goals  
or maybe it's pirates in general

blackbeard moment
yall making me wanna post as I'm an amab poc but I'm shy af
damn that eyeliner
Who is that first person though 👀 (I'd like to follow them on social media)
One of my favorite POC NB artists is ig@ _cubicalsecret_ 
But i love love love seeing all different shapes and shades of being NB c:
These are all so awesome. OP, thanks for the inspiration! 💜
Love that Thank you OP!

And to anyone who didn't felt like putting their face on this sub, it's ok, you don't have to. And to those who would like to but feel like it's not for them to do so, please do

I may have participate in the trend, but it was really not my goal. I would like everyone to feel welcome as they are  


Edit (Also, side note, ""white skinny vaguely masculine people"" didn't choose to look like that maybe, the ""vaguely masculine"" part is not really nice either...)
That last person is so problematic and anti-black it’s triggering to see them in this sub.
I love them so much. The vibe of that second one speaks to my soul.
@/isisrose on Instagram is a gender nonconforming POC who mixes up masc and femme ! 
Edit: also @/angryarrows @/wipmia @/mythsooka  all on different parts of the gender spectrum, amazing accounts to follow. Some do YouTube on similar topics too and also create amazing queer black art.
I was also thinking this. I was thinking about leaving the sub-Reddit because it’s literally just people posting their best gender selves - which is great - it’s just slightly demoralising for *some* who are starting to realise it’s harder for them to reach the standard of always being perfect gender..
Thank you 🙏🏽
I'm not a POC but I'm glad that someone else out there is waving the less feminine non binary flag, I try my best but I'm still pretty masculine even in selfies. Recently I took a lot of selfies with stubble and my body not really shaven and it felt good, it was me in the rawest form. Hair and all!
I recently had to tell someone that being Non Binary isn't a ""white people problem"" and that Non Binary POC people exist
My man Rahul Kohli is he/they enby!
I also wanted to apologise for being part of that trend and oversaturating this sub with images of skinny white boys when poc deserve the same attention and recognition
Love this. Though at this point I think I'd prefer to just have a fat enby sub because this obsession with the frail Victorian child look is getting old. I'm trying to distance myself from harmful societal norms and this obsession with extremely thin white men is not it.
this is great, love seeing more POC in these subs... I know they out there, so why should white people get all the shine? like seiorusly, pease take my shine, I don't like being ripped out of the shadows of the abyss...
FINALLY SOME SPICE IN HERE 🔥
Yes! Thank you. Everyone is beautiful; No matter their skin tone.
As a white* skinny vaguely masculine leaning dude, the first pic makes me VERY envious. 

*I am albino which means I am extra extra white 😂
Yes!!! This is a big mood!!! Beautiful!!
omg yes please
MOAR!
Yes yes yes
Gender envy over everyone for me damn
I follow the first person on Instagram! They always give me major gender envy.
That third picture has been the epitome of my gender envy for YEARS 😍😍😍
aahhh this is so lovely!! (ﾉ◕ヮ◕)ﾉ\*:･ﾟ✧
The third set is amazing!
Thank you thank you thank you thank you thank you thank you thank you thank you thank you thank you
Yaaaaaa thank u for sharing these beauties 😮‍💨

First one is 😩👌🏻👌🏻👌🏻
i love u
These are great! Thanks for sharing!
Yessss
thank you
Who's the artist for the second pic?
🔥🔥
Yessssss
finally
Yes please, thank you for the post😊
As an Asian enby, I applaud you.
Great to see a black enby who knows about themselves, although, idk if there's a correct way to be enby.
Thank fucking god.
Thank you so much for this!!
Gorgeous, all of them
At least one of them wasn't skinny. Guess that must be a requirement.
I’m glad this made you feel a bit better. I wish I had understood sooner how much of an issue whitewashing is in the trans community
sameee
Please do!
Do it!!!
We wanna bask in yr gloryyyy lolol
please do!!
@unrxalbxy.exe on Instagram
All good :)
I’m OP, a white, skinny, vaguely masculine person who contributed to that trend yesterday and wanted to do better, so I’ve collected some pictures of nonbinary poc to combat the trend
I wanted to comment this exactly but I couldnt put it into words. Thank you for sharing! Because as much as I agree that we need more diversity to help POC nb's feel more welcome in the community, I just couldn't help thinking that the caption was aimed at me directly since my post just several hours prior was highly upvoted and I am white, skinny, and ""vaguely masculine"". I really didn't come here to be grouped into ""the norm"", and it's upsetting that I have been. So thank you once again 💜
Oh I didn’t know! I just saw their image in a series about queer poc
Yeah, I’m sorry you’ve been feeling that way. My earlier post contributed to that but it was also because I looked vaguely like those people that I did it, not thinking of how it could effect others self image and self esteem
a fat enby sub would be amazing 🥺
You should definitely start one and promote it here!
Gonna be honest, sounds pretty rude to say people posting here look like frail children when most pictures here are selfies from people active here, not just random people off Google /: you can express your want for more diversity without being negative towards other people in the community.
And the last 2 are just absolute cuties
I think it must be witchcraft of some kind lol
Wasn’t trying to tear down white people. I am white. See my other gender envy post for context (read comments)
Joana Neves
Just want to clarify, I’m not black, but I felt there was a need for more res presentation of enbies of colour in this community :) these are images off Pinterest
I haven’t been able to find many plus size nonbinary POC even though I know there must be a lot out there
I'm relatively new to the community and I really appreciate seeing all of the representation! Please keep doing it!
Oh no! Don’t worry about that, no one on the here is purposely being malicious, I think it’s our own responsibility to take ourselves away from what’s perpetuating any negative feelings.
I'm not talking about selfies/OC. I'm talking about the gender envy posts of celebrities.
IKR! It's just barely believable that it's the same person! Very femme, and then very masculine.
[deleted]
Thank you, but it’s not totally your responsibility - it’s not your fault that media is skewed to represent one type of person
That wasn't really clear, sorry. I do feel like posts like that are quite rare here, they seem more prevalent on the meme subs like egg_irl. Scrolling through new here is like 90% selfies and text posts.
No, these are a collection of photos from Pinterest
Damn. They seem to be the only posts that end up on my feed. Guess I gotta scroll the sub more."	sr9tc6	NonBinary	1993	0.99	2022-02-13 04:14:24
I did nonbinary flag makeup, and went to Pride looking like an 80s drag king. Gender off the fucking charts!		"Woaaah, this is stunning! Your makeup is peak but also just the top makes it, love it
This is SO gender
Omg. This is amazing. What lipstick is that? Cuz I love it.
Simply En Fuego!!🔥🔥🔥

Goddamn the sheer amount of gender in this photo is off the fuckin charts
inCREDIBLE

That is very gender I love it
Very cool look! ☺️

I absolutely love it! I might borrow your makeup idea for my own pride outfit! I hope you enjoyed pride
Can I ask if the mustache was makeup? If so, how did you achieve that look?
Hey! Leave some gender for the rest of us!

Monarch, thou art RADIANT!!! :D

yasss go get it love! I’m so proud of you💛🤍💜🖤
You look fuckin amazing!! ✨
Omg, can we get a product list?  Those eyeshadow colors are amazing and I need them!!
Reminds me of Kerry Eurodyne a bit!
Lipstick is a combo of the purple base, which is Ciate’s Glitter Flip liquid lipstick in ‘Iconic’, and the gold in the middle is Wet n’ Wild’s Perfect Pout lip color in ‘First Place Winner’.
Thank you! and it was sort of a combo- I have a small/light mustache naturally but I added eyebrow gel and a little bit of fiber mascara to make it more prominent.
Thank you so much!! Here's the product list:

For the eyeshadows: I used the Pür ‘Festival’ palette (for the purple, and the gold glitter), Violet Voss ‘Essentials’ palette (black, light gold highlight on lid), and the Ace Beauté ‘Nostalgia’ palette (warm gold inner corner and bright purple). I especially love the Nostalgia palette, it's super pigmented.  
For the eyeliner, I used the Stila waterproof liquid liner in black and the L'Oreal Infallible Paints in white. My mascara is tarté Big Ego and I used Colorpop brow boss gel on the eyebrows. I used that mascara and brow gel for the mustache as well. 

For the lips, I mentioned this above, but it's Ciaté Glitter Flip liquid lipstick in ‘Iconic’, and the gold in the middle is Wet n’ Wild’s Perfect Pout lip color in ‘First Place Winner’."	op5geu	NonBinary	1995	1.0	2021-07-22 03:10:58
standard black shirts give me gender euphoria. ten weeks on the dude juice. ayyyyo.		"I don't know WHAT it is about plain black shirts, but they just make me feel fantastic. I'm wearing one now. I'm tempted to buy 6 more so I can wear them every day.
turquoise piercings 😩💘 i love a good matchy matchy
""The dude juice"" XD I love it
Congrats on 10 weeks ! I start HRT in 2 days ! You look great btw :')
i love ur piercings so much oh my god
I have this one black shirt with a feminine cut, but it still feels so masc?? Black shirts are the best!!
Ayyyo indeed, this look is fire
Dude juice, that’s such a great term lol. Your piercings are super cool too.
Love the body jewellery changes.

How you been? Hmu on discord if you fancy a chat :)
cute cute cute
god i am in love
how common is it for trans people to get gender euphoria with one plain piece of clothing haha
wow i posted this when i felt euphoric, fell asleep. and woke up to all you wonderful people. thank you all for the compliments & support. especially anyone that complimented my piercings. i went through a pretty big rough patch and had to take them all out. i slowly started to put them back in and feel like myself. but everyone here definitely made my night/morning.
Loooove the piercings
My goodness you're an attractive human! I buy tons of those t-shirts at Costco.
“Dude juice” lmao

Also your jawline could kill a person
I feel the EXACT same way about plain black shirts. And PS you rock them beautifully 🖤
ahhh thank you!!! at work everyone still misgenders me. so i appreciate it.
they’re a big part of me. so i appreciate it. thank you!
I’m not trans but enby, it’s maybe once or twice a week for me cuz but some ppl are luckier than others, I remember when I was going thru a rough patch I stayed in bed all day I didn’t even wanna see myself. If you make the effort to look nice then you feel comfortable about it and sometimes even euphoric! :)"	msezjv	NonBinary	1985	1.0	2021-04-16 23:13:57
"Using this ""name"" started as a joke... 4 years ago. It caught on and just kept going. When I started to question my gender, I also thought about a new name, but then I realized that there was a conviniently gender neutral nickname most people already knew me by. So, Admiral it is."		"I chose my name by looking in the D&D monster manual and picking what looks the coolest.
You should say your name is Private. Confuse everyone.
Then there's the people who uses their sisters ex boyfriends name
god I picked my name from my favorite Titanfall 2 character, Ash, and I *never even played the game,* lmao

she just sounds incredible and somewhat gender neutral.

also kinda also picked the name after the dude from pokemon
Admiral is a fucking S tier name holy shit.

The power you must feel when you introduce yourself
Can I be Grand Moff pls
I chose my name by looking in my closet and seeing a mint candy that had been there for 4 months
YYYYOOOO I GOT MIRA FROM SHORTENING ADMIRAL BECAUSE I THINK LIKING SEA SHANTIES IS AN ENTIRE PERSONALITY TRAIT

&#x200B;

ADMIRAL GANG
I like that name. If people ask if you are in the military when you say your name I would just play along with it saying you are. Congrats on finding a name relatively fast that you like
That's grand, Admiral!

The name Nova for me was a name I gave to my para. Their the first male OC I made who I used as sort of my stand in for daydreams and fanfic. They were my ideal me. I never thought too much about how I suddenly, at the beginning of middle school began using a male oriented OC rather than female(Im AFAB) but they have stuck around and they have been with me through my journey in discovering who I am. 

I really learned about myself through them. What I like, what I don't, what I'm comfortable with, my boundaries, I used them to help me better understand different genders by altering them. This helped me discover myself as Nonbinary. Seeing how much this character has helped me grow and learn, I thought it make sense to use the name I gave me as my own. At this point, they really are just me. All the way down to my preferred pronouns!
I had half a mind to call myself Brigadier after best-boy Brigadier Alistair Gordon Lethbridge-Stewart. People would have called me 'The Brigadier.'
I don't want to assume that you're enby as you haven't confirmed whether you're just questioning or feeling fairly sure of your gender, but if you are non-binary or just non-cis, would you be comfortable with sharing your experience in the military? The treatment, recognition, validation, etc. I'm curious as to how gender-noncomforming people are treated and registered on documentation, that sort of thing. Also, that is a fucking great name!
My gaming friends call me Cap'n. Because of star trek. Because starfleet doesn't have a standard 'everyone is sir', it's generally up to each captain what their preference is. Ensign Kim waffled about what to call Janeway, and she tells him she prefers 'Captain' over sir or ma'am.

Started off vaguely as an enby joke, come to have a life of it's own. I regret nothing. XD
I am military. I had a coworker, a civilian, named Admiral. Scared me so bad when I was straight from boot camp and being introduced to someone named admiral. Couldn’t figure out why he wasn’t in uniform until like a week later I realized it was his name, not a rank.

Also someone named sergant, he’s a sergeant.
I feel a little stereotypical because I did name myself after a mineral. /hj
Hi if you don't mind i might try that one myself, im questioning my gender coming to the conclusion that i think im enby and im looking for a different name preferable starting with an A since my deadname starts with it :)
How grand! And here's me just shaving letters off my birth name cause I was named after someone who passed.
I like the name Admiral. I’m in the second category. I’m Fox.

I wanted a name related to my favorite animal, and as I was walking home from work trying to think of one I liked, I realized Fox is gender neutral. I’ve been Fox ever since.
Yknow that things that fly off sparklers?
Yeah that's me- 💅
and here i am with my name being a creature species just because i got too attached to a fictional character and started using it as a nickname :')
My name started off as a joke in HS from sgt Jasper because of a military movie I saw. I dunno I just like Jasper as a name.
wow that name is actually rlly good. My first thought was 'aww, a butterfly name' lmao. It's a nice double meaning.
I remember Admiral is the name of the cat of Yang Wenli from Legend of the Galactic Heroes. I approve of the nickname\~
If anyone gives you shit about it and asked why you’re called Admiral, just tell them it’s because you are the ‘Admiral of Space’. 

I mean… they can’t disprove it 😬
I chose my name based on an old internet nickname. It also is a plant and a man's first name in England (and rarely in the USA). Basil.
I got lucky with my ""birth"" name, Ashely, as it can be so easily shortened to the cool vibes gender neutral ""Ashe""

Admiral is dip af though
The name my great uncle was given at birth was Colonel. You do you

Personally, I went with an animal lmao
Also an animal crossing character lol
That's a dope name Admiral!
Admiral is a badass name, I'm glad you had one readily available, searching for q fitting name can be a real task. 

I chose Reese because it's kind of neutral while leaning a little more feminine. Jokes on me since I'm planning to fully transition to masc presenting. Keeping the name tho, normalize it a little more for guys
My name is Jericho. I didn't really choose it, but it's still my perfect name lmao. 

Yes I know the name is based in Christianity with that story of that one town, but that wasn't the reason. I don't like the religion, but I'm glad it introduced me to my new name!
And there is me thinking about calling me Feder (feather) because I love birds 🙈😂
I feel boring- 

My name is Ollie, and I chose it because I thought that it was perfect for me. 

My nickname is Lollie. :)
I'm the first two :)
I chose a letter
My name was an alternative name my late mother wanted to name me
Haha! That's legit. 

I have a similar story. My younger cousin gave me a 'cool' gender-ambiguous nickname after I complained about my real name. Funny enough, it is space/gods related but sounds similar to my real name. The nickname accompanied me through the end of middleschool, highschool, college, and up to now. Even my conservative parents sometimes use the nickname to address me. 

I'm face-palming and laughing in retrospect because me being excited about the nickname over my birth name was probably the very first time I experienced gender euphoria but I was too oblivious to realize that's what it was. 

So should I change legally change my name in the future, it wouldn't change much. A coming out would be semi-anticlimactic  because that's what most people in my life already call me. 😅
I named myself after a rock lol
I chose a decent Greek name that is gender neutral asf and happily told my friends about it,,,,but it looks kike that is all about to be changed because I want to be named after a colour,,,,Green,,,please fellow Nonbinary stop me from doing this
As an Orion, I certainly respect an Admiral!!
I just chose out of Celtic ones Ainsley looked good and it means ones own meadow so yeah I use it as a symbol of solidarity as well as a new name
I just picked Jupiter because I wanted a space related name and Ive done three school projects on Jupiter
Using the name of a gem
Thr captain is the name of my user in my linux installations and I call my PCs with ship names so yeah... And I did that before I knew what kubernetes was. I kind of dig. I will rename my GitHub and everything to the captain
You need to get in the navy, Admiral Admiral.
Jack is the name I’ve mostly settled on, but I’ve also been enjoying the thought of going by Asimov or Riven as well :] robotics is awesome, and I also love fictional wish-dragons. But then there’s the list of names I have in my notes app... bleh
That's boss, tbh
I think I saw a tik tok where someone listed weird names kids at church camp had and one was Addy, short for Admiral. So someone has that name given to them.
Was sarge from RvB an enby?
Bro everyone chooses super cool names with different meanings and I'm here just being

Alexis
As someone whose name is literally a noise an animal makes I fucking LOVE Admiral. It’s 🔥
Too accurate..
I’m using my actual name (for now) it’s easier and my name is already neutral
It makes me think of the UK home and car insurance company,, I’m no better though, hello admiral! My name is ham
Admiral is such an awesome name ❤️
MEMEMEMEME!!! i was going through celtic and irish mythology and now i use the name ronan LMAO
I chose mine because it's masculine and I'm going to go into a male-dominated field (so my resume is more likely to get fully looked over) but the nickname is a verb and thus genderless
Also me keeping my birth name because its already unisex
willow🥰🥰
I chose Jax. It's simple, I like it, and my old name started with a J, so hopefully my family was able to adjust easily and well enough. They still don't really try with pronounce, but they're at least calling me Jax more often.
I used the nickname for my home town
Admiral is actually a rly dope name, something I doubt very many people have, not awkward to say or spell and super duper gender neutral. I fucks with it 😌
I picked mine bc my synesthete brain said it sounded purple XP 

Still really scared to start using it IRL tho…
I literally just picked my middle name and shortened it .\_.
I chose the name soop because...I like saying ""soup"" but two o's looks cooler /srs
I use Pyromaniac as name in discord, and always shorten it as pyro. Been using it for a couple years now and actually liking to hear people calling me Pyro.

Too bad I can't legally change my name as that here
I have been using my own name, just because i kinda like it, but i have been considering going by what i would have been named if i was a boy (or having it as a middle name so i have both my fem and masc name)

I have been considering unisex names, but my moms family has a naming tradition (that we are not required to follow, but i want too) and havent been able to find any unisex names that fit that

There is one who have like a male and female version of the name itself, but the male version is much more popular, so im concerned it would have the same effect as just going by my male name
I used to common and nickname of my birth name, which is really great cuz It's super stealth
Some guy I thought was cute messed up my dead name and called me Morgan and now that I identify as non-binary I can’t let go of it
I always wanted to be called Kai as a nickname because it’s similar to my birth name. Then, I came out as non-binary and I was like it me!! So, now I go by Kai. Also, Kai means ocean in Hawaiian(I’m not Hawaiian, but I thought that was really cool) and it’s gender neutral.
u/memesveryyes
My name is April, in which of the two first categories do I belong?
My name is blitz cause I thought it sounded cool and i do sometimes feel like a mass of electricity and plasma
i chose my name because it’s a nickname my friend gave me before i even came out and it just happened to be gender neutral so it stuck
i chose aeron because it apparently means war, some of my friends call me ares for short and my nickname is achilles. my two middle names come from guy characters i look up to
Admiral is an epic name, I use both Ash and Phantom
Is there a nick-name for it?
My friend picked mine and I’m just a colour, now.
Ya know what? Admiral is a hella cool name.

Funny (?) story about picking my own name (and middle name as well), my deadname's initials spelled out a common three-letter word. When picking my new name, I actually took that into account and chose names that started with the same letters as my deadname and dead middle name. It worked out really well though, because I ended up loving both anyway and probably would have chosen them even if my deadname's initials didn't spell out a word lol
I love your name Admiral, I'm into naval stuff so I'm even a little jealous but as long as you are happy thats great!
Me using a videogame character:
I chose my name because it sounded good (Khara) and I learned it meant ""Shit""... Now I love it even more :')
i really thought i was safe until i read “mineral”
“Admiral” is way more badass than any plant or mineral name
Now I need to know which one you picked pls
Some real “who’s on first” energy
That's oddly specific 👁👁
I need the whole story here
I still simp for Ash because she's such a cool character ~~and I wish I could be a robot~~

Excellent choice of name. It's one of those names that just sounds cool no matter the gender
BT-7274 is also a good choice
Also my favourite Final Space character.
Teacher: Ok everyone we have a new student. Please give them your full attention. 

OP: Hi my name is Admiral *drops mike*
Absolutely!
hi lifesaver
Andes!
ADMIRALS! ASSEMBLE!

Sea shanties are awesome, though I got mine. cause we got a fourth boat, meaning we now definitely had a fleet now, so one morning at school, I made the joke that I had been promoted from captain to Admiral, and would like to be referred to as such from now. I didn't expect it to last till lunch, just a fun little joke, not unlike this we made all the time, but it has been 4 years now.
Thanks!

People assuming that I am in the military isn't really uncommon. Me wearing cargo pants all the time and occasionally green/camo colored button up shirts doesn't help this assumption. And neither does the fact that I AM in the military...

Just not as Admiral, I'm only in charge of boats and sometimes fleets in my free time.
I love that there's two Star Wars jokes in this thread.
That sounds so therapeutic.
I've had a similar experience! I used a character to represent myself as a cat and that character was a guy- this was years before even questioning my gender. It can really be cathartic, huh? I still use characters to represent myself until this day.
I almost named my second child brigadier but my family objected because they can't spell
Well, i can only talk about the German military and I haven't been in it for long, but so far I haven't had any big problems. I get along well with the other recruits n all, but I suspect it's partially because of my particular circumstances. 

I'm afab, have little to no disphoria and most closely identify with demigirl /greygender, but with a pretty masculine presentation. All in all, to people who don't know the lgbtq+ community, I come of as a slightly extrem tomboy/butch type. There aren't really any options besides male and female on documentation and all, but I don't have a problem with that designation it's ""just not the whole truth"" for me. With names it's probably that you have to use the same as on your ID, but many of the the other recruits have stated that the have preferred nicknames, when we talk among each other. In official settings with higher ups, you'll pretty much only use your family name anyway. 

So it's fine so far, but I could imagine that it would be a lot different depending on the person. Tomboyisch/butch type girls aren't too uncommon in the military, and just because I take it a lot further then most hasn't given me any trouble. Not even because I'm ""a woman"", our company is almost 50/50 male/female. But someone who's completely neither male not female, and wants this in official documentation might run into some problems, with acceptance varying form company to company, squad to squad and so on. Though generally the acceptance of queer people in Germany isn't really bad.

It's not a lot, but I hope I could at least give you some insight in the matter.
Minerals rock :D
Does it count as naming myself after a bird if I just went with my middle name? Feeling stereotypical too :/
Of course I don't mind! If it helps you that'd be great!
Haha, that's what I've done in real life! It's still feminine but not to the extent of my full name, so no one suspects anything.
Fox is a really cool name, awesome!
Or you could be admiral Patrick from Star Trek and say ""that's a stupid question!""
The real question here: Bay-sil or Bah-sil?
I love that. No names are boring and most words, and especially names, have epic stories and associations <3
I'm already in the army, well, I'm in a medical division, incorporated in the army, it'd be a matter of paperwork asking for transfer, really. But I like to keep sailing and ""the fleet"" to my free time.


... I should get into something air force related next, get all the branches.
Well, there's an interesting headcannon for ya.
I picked a Wyvern
But I was torn between that and Flumph
Wait. Who's on first?
So my sister was dating this tall lanky guy who was a ginger and he was funny, he was like a brother so when they broke up I missed him. So when I came out I stole his name and he knows lol
Literally
Nah, Mint
You realise if you don't become Admiral Admiral now I'm going to be very disappointed...
""what's your name?""

""Major-General Admiral sir""
Oh shit. That's cool. I was not expecting that.
I don’t think so because you weren’t purposely naming yourself after a bird, you just happen to share a name with a bird. Like my name is Quartz and I purposefully took my name from the mineral. That said I definitely don’t think it’s wrong to be stereotypical. Falling into stereotypes doesn’t make nonbinary people any less valid or anything, but I can also understand why you might not want to.
Thank you!
Thank you for asking. 
I do think of it as a name, so I prefer the way the British name is pronounced. Bah-zil.
Thank you <3
I approve of this method and also ""Wyvern"" is one hell of a name. Awesome.
I would have thought you'd go with Beholder. That's proby first choice :)
Do you pronounce it with-ern or why-vern?
Exactly!
Awwwww,,,aighty then,,,I thought it was more hectic
I second this notion
Sadly, I'm currently in the wrong branch of the military for that.
Major Major Major Major
I am the very model of a modern Major-General
I would totally end up calling them 'vern for short
Beholders are so damn cool. 
I would go for Blight maybe
Why-vern
What's their name?!
Time to move to the navy
That's even better, Sergeant Admiral has *amazing* energy.
A real Catch 22.
Was going to say this but you bet me to it 😂
I actually would not mind that.

Its official: gender reveal parties are now for trans people only. Sorry I don't make the rules ¯\_(ツ)_/¯		"Is it really a gender reveal party if nothing got burnt down?
Super cute! I'd love to do this for myself someday and have a big ol banner at the end that just says, ""neither"" in fancy script
Fuck gender reveals, I want my gender to remain a mystery.
sorry guys, I left my gender at home but I found these cool baloons-
We've already burned enough of California. Can we please stop the gender reveal parties?
This is definitely the vibe
This is too wholesome, I love it!
[deleted]
Nice. Very neutral; not even a small fire.
ok this is pretty cool
Love it! 💕
I love this
I love this ❤️
OK, this is genius
This is amazing! I totally wanna have a boy/girl/nonbinary party now aaa!!!! You look so happy!
I honestly thought you were Noelle Stevenson at first 😅 looking fabulous 🤍💜💛🖤

(Noelle's a fabulous nonbinary artist & he spearheaded the queer as fuck She-Ra reboot🌈)
Love this. Also I read the title as ""sorry I do make the rules"" and was totally here for it.
This would be great for enbys who later realize they're a binary gender. Right now I'm Nonbinary,  but I feel that a gender reveal party would be fun if i ""decide"" I'm a trans guy after all.
I love this omg. Also you’re adorable just fyi
This is such an amazing idea!!!
MY HEART
yes yes yES YES THIS IS BEAUTIFUL
This is awesome!!!
Now this is the ONLY kind of gender reveal party that makes any sense!
I love this!
This legit made me cry 😭 this Is the cutest thing I have ever seen. Sending you love OP ❤
Sidenote: killer outfit
Okay but I would go to these ALL the time, but I bring those kigurumi onesies instead of the baby ones.
I wish this picture sequence happened on ultrasounds. Before I knew better, I was told I was 'having a girl' and I believed it. 

These are really nice quality photos, what camera, lighting and settings did you use, OP?
I suggest we don't allow any kind of explosive or pressurized devices and have a rule that no one can reveal anyone else's gender for them. 

In fact, most gender reveal parties should have a big box filled with different kinds of modelling clay, like home made play dough or goop or natural clays of all sorts of colors, or paints and paper, whatever. Everyone can pick their own colors and paint, colloage, or mold their own ""reveal"" and put words or music to it if they wish. 

Or they can skip that part and help prepare or eat salads or cupcakes, which also can be made with veggies and fruit (for the salads) or batters, icings and toppings (for the cupcakes) of all the colors you can imagine, and some you wouldn't have considered.
Adore those pics, that is fabulous.
best gender reveal ever!
This is also what Debutante balls were for.  They were a way for the rich to introduce their children to society when they were of age.  We can totally steal that too, and make it introducing your real self to society when you're ready.  Personally, I just want another excuse to wear a fancy dress
Wow, those decorations lol

I had a gender reveal party too! It was a zoom party and I mailed scratch cards to my friends for the reveal. Then we played Jackbox games together, it was fun

Gender reveal parties should absolutely belong to trans people!!! I'm even considering celebrating the day I legally changed my name as my name day as a second birthday, cause trans people also deserve two birthdays 😉
I love this!!
Yeah, we're missing the janky DIY pyrotechnics.
I mean, my first try was a cake but that got burned lol. The balloons were plan B haha
Gender repeal party
""Neither"" but with the nonbinary flag as a color gradient.
or ""boy nor girl""
Go for it! I had a lot of fun, I definitely recommend :) my original plan was to do a cake, but my oven did not agree with me haha
A gender conceal party 🙏
That's easy, instead of pink or blue, everything will be your favorite shade of purple. Purple cake, some awesome purple gift in a giant box, purple non-explosive party favors for the guests. 

Once purple is ""revealed"", someone puts your favorite music on, purple and or black lights are turned on, making more things purple. When people ask, ""I don't get it. I mean, purple? What's their gender now?""

Close friends nod and smile, enigmatically, ""Oh, but you do get it. Purple. And isn't it grand? Oooh! We're going to either dance or wrestle in a pool of jacaranda flowers! Let's go!""
Dangit pasta, you'd loose your butt if it wasn't attached to you! /nsrs /j
Right? Even the lady who started the whole gender reveal party thing hates what it's become and regrets ever doing one.
Thank you!!
Haha thanks! Gotta make it fun somehow 😂
Ha I don't trust myself with fire 😂 that'd be a disaster just waiting!
Ah thank you!
It was so much fun! I can definitely recommend it :)
Honestly that's a top tier complement 😂 if only I could be as cool. Thank you!!
Ah thanks!!
Haha I just used my phone! Google pixel 4a. Nothing special for settings and the lighting was just the ceiling lights in my apartment :)
Underrated comment for sure 😂
YASS.
Omg yes
For those who hate purple, you'll have to make your own adaptation, because I don't understand you in fundamental ways.
lmao I could never, it's my best feature /j
The poor lady had no idea baking a cute cake could have such disastrous consequences
Tbf, she just made cake, never explosives, but the baby she had the cake with pink icing inside made for has been educating her mom about gender expectations :-) https://www.npr.org/2019/07/28/745990073/woman-who-popularized-gender-reveal-parties-says-her-views-on-gender-have-change

Hey all, it's been a while hasn't it? During that time I had been questioning my gender identity....again, and I've figured out that I'm actually a trans girl! So I guess I'll be moving over to r/trans. But I will be sticking around here because I love seeing all of y'all being happy!		"Yaaaaay! So happy for you! Stop by again any old time!
I guess I won’t be moving to r/trans alone ☺️
Congrats!! Wish you all the best :)
Congratulations!
Congrats on finding yourself! I’m glad this community has helped you and I hope it continues to.
Hey, I'm a trans guy who thought he was an enby initially and is still on this sub because the people are great :) congrats on figuring out your gender!
congrats! so happy for you !!
And we love seeing you happy too :)
I’m so glad that you found out who you are! You’re awesome! **❤️**
You do you sis

Well done! Don't forget that you can question and change your gender to whatever, whenever you like- Enjoy being female!
I hope this doesn't come across as wrong but since you look young, please for the love of all that is holy, enjoy your gorgeous body to the full! 

Once upon a time, I had a lovely young body but stupid me did not enjoy it & now I look at old photos & think WTF WAS WRONG WITH ME?!? I still look good & try to enjoy my body more now, but I wish someone had said to me, ""You look damn fine! Enjoy your sexy youth in whatever way makes *you* happy!"" So now I'm saying it to you. Sexy older adult is real too but I don't want anyone to have the regrets I do.

You look beautiful!
That's so great! 💖 Also you look magnificent in that and I'm jelly 😚
So happy you found yourself! Congrats!

Jesus that's scary, luckily no, I'm not the person you're looking for. I live in South Africa and I've never been to another country.

I sincerely hope that you do find the person you're looking for, whatever they're done, it needs to be put to justice
Is the person you’re reminded of 17
I could ask you the same question there XD
This is largely why I'm here too. 

The relentless positivity makes it impossible to leave.

It's okay, I understand the concern. I'm just sorry that something like this has happened, and I'm sorry if I've caused any discomfort for you
Hm okay kinda coincidental tho"	o9g9xz	NonBinary	1946	1.0	2021-06-28 08:49:41
IDK what Gender I identify as, Half of me says Non-binary and the other half is saying to stay male		"As a reminder, you are allowed to try on and explore different gender identities and expressions throughout your lifetime.  You are allowed to use different pronouns as you grow and adapt. You don't have to pick one and stand by it forever. Whatever makes you feel empowered in your own skin is worthy of trying out. 

Any learning we gain from experience in this realm can help to move our communities away from the aspects of gender binary culture that causes society so much anguish.
Demiboy?
that's ok. these days i think of myself as a non-binary guy. non-binary is a very broad term and encompasses a lot. so does male, honestly. 

personally - I've come to feel like having a name for my gender really isn't that important. and whatever you end up feeling, it's not like you're committed for life anyway.
I've reached a point where I've just given up on labels. I'm transfemme and when I started I really wanted to go for a full binary transition, but in the last few months I've realised that I spent more time thinking about what my gender was, than just existing in the way I want to.

As long as you know what Pronouns you like, that's all people need to know.
I define myself as nonbinary and female almost equally. Someone I know started describing themselves as a ""themme"" and I identify with that pretty strongly. You never have to ""settle"" on a label to be valid. You are what you feel you are
okay this meme, but being AFAB :))
Why not both?
Enboy or demiboy?
bigender maybe? - ☁️
The term demiboy sounds like what you might feel but you can indentify as whatever you want honestly
I’m this way but with girl and non-binary. Right now I identify with genderfluid, but the act of coming out (even though I’ve come out before with my sexuality) and having people around me change how they treat me or slip up makes me want to just suck it up and be cis, even if the dysphoria can feel so bad
mood, that's why I'm a demiboy :D
Me too
Same but I'm AFAB
Both. Both is good.
A question that's helped a lot of friends: would you still feel non-binary if you were assigned a different gender at birth?
Same here bro
I don't know how seriously you mean this because I know it's tagged as meme, but as a non binary sociology teacher and professor, this really interest me! I feel like many people feel this way because one, there's a lot of privilege that comes along with being perceived as a man and two, in many Western societies man is the default. I live in America and here, men are like the factory setting for things lol
Same here most of me is saying non binary and the rest is saying female I go by non binary for now tho
Sounds demiboy to me
Well, and here I thought I wouldnt find someone else in my exact same situation
Half of me says nonbinary, the other might want to be a girl. But I'm not sure.
How bout demiboy or paraboy
Both Is Good.
That's fine.
dude i was like that but then I just gave up on labels.
nonbinary guy ?
Just be you 🤗
this is a certified gender moment

but seriously you will figure it out, you can try things like demiboy or like me a non-binary man. gender is complicated and you can use multiple labels or non
A lot of people identify as a nonbinary man or nonbinary woman, which means they're comfortable being seen as, or having the body of, a man or woman, but they don't fully feel connected to the binary gender or they internally know they're nonbinary. They may use he/they or she/they, because they feel comfortable with both. I don't know if this applies to you but it's how I experience being nonbinary. Hope this helps!
Naturally a lot of people are saying demiboy, but my best advice is to not worry about labels too much or you might end up trapping yourself in a box. Figure out what you like and what you don't like as far as pronouns, personality, appearance, descriptions, names, etc. and *then* look towards a label that makes you comfortable and aligns with all those things. It's perfectly okay to not know exactly what you are right now and it's okay to stick with vague labels like trans masculine if that fits better.
i identify as biologically female, but not a girl or woman. i identify *with* women/girls, but not *as* one. you can be both!
Oh hey, if it isn’t me

I go by the Demiboy label, which typically means half agender and half boy. You should drop by r/demiboy and see if anything fits

I also go by bigender, and explain my two genders are non-binary (specifically agender) and boy. r/bigender if you want to check it out. Its not uncommon for demigender people to also describe themselves as bigender.

Bottom line is, when it comes to gender, it’s more like play doh than it is picking a box. There’s no wrong answer and you are allowed to have multiple genders at once, switch between several genders daily, or have no gender at all if you’d prefer that.
Ye that’s how I felt when I first became Enby, it’ll fade as you learn more, if you really think you are, not saying that’s everyone of course
Genderfaun perhaps? It’s a form of genderfluidity that completely excludes masculinity 

I myself am genderfae, a form of genderfluidity that completely excludes masculinity
trans masc? you (if afab) can get bottom surgery and have male autonomy while identifying as enby.     
or demi boy? which is like male adjacent where an amab doesn’t fully identify as male but also sort of identifies as male.    
or maybe just gender queer and you just straight vibing with no specific label.
That's vaild.
Omg sameeee :0 ive decided im a demiboy aka trans man in denial :)
demiboy gang 😎
Be both! Demiboy
Demiboy is always there
You could be a demiboy or a form of genderfluid
I get you. I'm sort of a gender abolitionist, but I'm also a strong 6'1/185cm ape with a full beard. A lot of people expect enbies to be somewhat genderfluid in their appearance (not to say androgynous), but that's a very reductionist perspective. I often ""feel masculine"", though I'm not entirely sure what that means, so like you I've questioned my identity over and over. But in the end those are mostly just words... artefacts of language. 

Who you are and what you present yourself as is a personal matter, and no words will ever encompass the complexity of your behaviour and sensations. Push both buttons, my enby dude.
I shake your hand with a little too much force! :)
I feel so called out by this!
Come be gendernull with me
haveing the same problem
I have the same dilemma but with being a girl. 

I'm thinking of using she/they pronouns so
EXPLORE! Not only is exploring your gender informative, it’s fun too! You can find your true self while having a blast. Best of luck!
You can be both. I’m both, bigender male and non-binary. 

Lots of comments saying demiboy too. Demiboy isn’t exactly male and non-binary the way being both is but still a valid identity. Lots of other identities on the masc side of the non-binary spectrum as well.
This was me, while I hated my reflection for years and years. 

Now that I've accepted myself as NB I don't give a flying fuck about my appearance (except for facial hair) haha!
Demiboy
Maybe try out the label Demiboy!
Personally nonbinary, politically male
I fluctuate between the two, and identify as boyflux
Genderfluid perhaps?
try out demiboy
You could look into demi boy, but a label is really not needed if you simply don’t want one
This is very relatable lol
Me, who decided that identifying as both to encapsulate how I feel over a range of things regarding my gender will help alleviate the stress of trying to determine what exactly I am.
Hi! Same, but for the other side of things, they/she! I identify as genderqueer, which is a good label for me because what I call myself or think of myself as doesn’t really have specific labels. 

Being both or fluctuating between the two doesn’t make you any less valid!
do you want to experiment? i know pronouns dont equal gender, but maybe we could experiment? and dont forget to experiment with clothing!
This was me but I’m afab lol
I'm gonna be blunt here. Bro, if your struggling with this choice then you are not surrounded by people you actually need in your life. Who the fuck even cares? dress the way you want, style your hair the way you want, be who you want. The right people shouldn't be bothered by it and neither should you.

Feel free to start a conversation in the comments.
Maybe try out the demiboy label
✨demiboy✨

At least that’s what I went with. That, or I call myself a nonbinary trans guy. You can be both, it’s not a contradiction, since nonbinary is a very broad category that encompasses more than just androgyny
Why not both?
friend the same thing happens to me
I COULDN'T AGREE MORE! In my opinion its so frustrating that it seems the ""norm"" for nonbinary idividuals is an androgynous afab. Don't get me wrong there is nothingwrong with being afab nonbinary, I just feel like when people see a more masc leaning enby they automatically think he/him.
My struggle right now…
Go with both, you coward. 

(No but fr it’s difficult to figure this shit out, and you might wanna give it some time. And until then, you can try each one for a while and see which you like best. Exploration is good.)
gender fluid?
I have this problem but I'm afab...
Don't recommend necessarily: the first time I wore a dress i was tripping, it felt so natural and freeing! I looked at myself in the bathroom mirror and just giggled like a child. It made me realize a side of me that I had closed off long ago. Everyone's journey is long with very unique endings, cheers to the ride ahead!
Genderfluid?
Serious comments aside... Man-minary
Do both. Nonbinary trans dude here. Never felt more comfortable with the label. Ashton Daniel is a nonbinary trans dude on YouTube and he's dope as hell if your looking for anyone online with a similar experience.
Yup. I think the problem is trying to identify as something others will accept. That shouldn't matter. It doesn't matter. You are your own person.
Non-binary man? :3
This is me, but girl/woman instead of man. I don't identify with a demigender, though.
As a non binary trans guy I'm the alternate version of this meme where the guy hits both buttons
And then there's a third half that says I'm actually a trans woman
Nonbinary isn't one identity. It can be an identity on its own, but its not a limited 3rd gender. You can be both! Nonbinary can be so much
May I introduce you to some fun gender options like Demiboy or Genderfaun
Plenty of people have said plenty, and I'm not sure I can add anything new except to say that that's pretty much where I was about eight months ago.

Having identified as cis my whole life basically just by default because I never felt strongly enough, confidently enough, that I was anything else, even once I started really questioning my gender in earnest, it was a real mental leap to come to believe that I was permitted to claim non-binary identity, that I was valid - i.e. that I'm actually non-binary and not just pretending or something.

I gave some serious thought, as I imagine you are doing too, to questions like ""what does it mean to be a man?"" and ""what does being a man mean to me?"" and ""can I be, should I be, am I truly 'just' a gender-non-conforming man and not a non-binary individual?"" And having agonized over it for a long time, I came to my realizations and decisions. I don't really know how to say my conclusions on that without getting into a rather lengthy, rambling, discussion of it, but ... 

Suffice it to say, you don't have to identify as a man, or associate yourself with ""all men"" if you don't want to. You don't owe it to your fellow men, or to society, or to anyone to have to be a man if you don't want to, if that's not who you feel you are. I wrestled for decades, literally, with trying to figure out what kind of man I could try to be, what kind of masculinity I could try to aspire to, that wouldn't leave me feeling unhappy, restricted, like I was settling for the possible and making my peace with what was within the realm of possibility (i.e. and feeling like being not-a-man was just not a possibility). I wrestled with this and after so many years, I never found my answer. And so I finally said, screw it. I'm tired of trying to squeeze myself into the square-shaped hole of whatever it means to be a ""man."" I'm tired of trying to figure out what type of man or what version of masculinity I should be, and I'm tired of the emotional stress of always having to interact with men as a fellow man, and interact with women as someone who is seen as ""a man"" before I'm seen as an individual... and so I decided that identifying as non-binary makes me more happy, more calm, within myself. It quiets all those anxieties.

Which isn't to say that's the path you have to take, not by any means. It all depends on your thoughts and feelings, your questions and anxieties, and what feels right for you. It can be extremely stressful, of course, but I hope you can also find ways to *enjoy* the journey, and get something out of it. New realizations about gender and society, and about yourself. Best of luck on your journey.

I'm pretty new to all of this too, having only come out to myself within the past year. But please feel free to DM me if you want to chat about it, have any questions I might be able to offer my perspectives/experience on, or whatever. 👍
Was your grandfather a lesbian? That could make you quarter lesbian.


You're you. Non-binary, leaning masc but still enby. Fluid maybe? The labels really are for other people. You just be you.
Nothing wrong with being both. And it can change, shift, whenever.
I identify as a catastrophe
Me
Bigender ?
You might be Demi boy? That is when you are half male, half non binary :) good luck!
It’s important to understand that non-binary means not exclusively male or female, meaning you can be both male and non-binary. It’s also ok to explore your identity and experiment a little with what makes you the most happy and comfortable.
Really well put. ❤️ Love this.

Reminds me of something an old friend said when I told them that I think I'm non-binary: We all have seasons to our gender

+ OP: you might want to check out r/genderfluid
Hey man, thank you so so so much for the reminder. I really needed to hear this today!!!
Yeah, I'm a demigirl!
it me
I saw this and thought the same thing. I’m a demiboy also.
I second this comment.
Me too, but girl/woman. I hate the idea that you have to be completely androgynous to be nonbinary, although that's how many people experience it there's also people who are closer to the binary genders on the spectrum. I don't like to label my gender (apart from being biologically female which I'm comfortable with) but if I was to get technical then I'd say I feel the same as you.
> non-binary is a very broad term and encompasses a lot

This

I think the submission title is plenty to say you're non-binary. If you're between non-binary and male, it's like you're saying you're non-binary because you're saying you're not always on that binary spectrum.

But only if you feel comfortable with that label of course
Nonbinary trans man here

*yes*
This should be way higher up. A completely valid suggestion.

Seasons to our genders, huh? That's honestly really lovely
Now say it to the theme of the gummy bear song
Same
same, I'm nonbinary and AFAB but am pretty feminine so I just say my gender is knock off girl.
please excuse my ignorance but i genuinely want to know and it is better to ask over the internet than in real life. But what is a nonbinary trans man? isnt that kinda an oxymoron? i thought being nonbinary means youre not a gender at all. Therefore i was wondering how u could be trans or a man. I hope this does not offend you, i actually wanna know.

Thank you sincerely for putting this in my brain
agender but commenting bc skyrim :D
non-binary just means you believe your gender is outside of the man/woman binary. what this means is up to the person but it could mean agender(no gender at all) or genderfluid(change genders at will). anything that isn't the 'traditional' man or woman. some non-binary people also identify as trans because they no longer identify with their assigned birth gender. it's a little unorthodox identifying as ""non-binary trans man"" i usually see ""non-binary trans masculine"" but because of identities like demiboy there are people who partially identify with the binary but are still somewhat outside of it, like the author of the meme we are commenting on.
I thought they meant the theme song to the old Disney cartoon Adventures Of The Gummi Bears, I was so confused when this didn't fit the rhythm of that whatsoever.

Ah yes, the three genders, yes, no, and maybe.		"Either abolish gender, or everyone gets their own unique gender. Functionally they're the same.
im less ""abolish gender"" and more ""gender is cool, but abolish gender roles and stereotypes""
Also non-binary of non-binary when you sometimes feel like abolishing gender and other times like making more of them. Shit is getting fractal
If you make enough genders, then you've basically abolished gender. Win win
I think they should kiss
There are probably as many gender identities as there are people in the world.  At which point there's not really much of a distinction between abolition and infinity.

But the one on the left is more my style, so I'll go with them 😅🙃
I just want the world to let me be who I am and I'm pretty sure everyone else wants that for themselves too. So maybe neither of these are the right path ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯
Yes, no, maybe, I don't know, can you repeat the question?
I’m in between binary trans and nonbinary (I’m a ftm Demi boy) and half of me is like ‘abolish gender it’s dumb’ but also ‘I’m a guy so what do I do then’
Where's the part when they make out...? ;-;
I think the thing we need to abolish isn't gender itself but gender roles. Particularly the socially imposed pressure to conform to those roles. A person's roles should be up to the individual. Labels should be descriptive, not prescriptive. Societal consequences for nonconformity hurt everyone. The standards people are held to shouldn't depend on what gender others perceive them as or what labels they use for themselves. I think gender should be seen as optional, and I would like to see a world where diversity is accepted or even celebrated rather than shunned.
Both is good
I'm more of a gender abolitionist, but both good
More! MOOORE!
These aren't in opposition, I'm both 💜
I hate to be an enlightened centrist but I’m more of a ‘gender is ok in moderation’ kind of enby

A gender recreationalist if you will…

They/them in the streets, he/she in the sheets 🤔
Both of them are so goddamn good looking! I love the left one especially!
When everyone is gender, nobody is

*Evil laugh*
It would be a great art performance: we'll create millions of genders and then smash them all at the same tame and they will break into peaces. Then — no genders at all
both of them are kissing sloppy style
third option: let everyone self-determine their gender <3
It sort of blows peoples minds when I tell them everyone has a unique gender identity because each individual has different opinions and feeling on what it means to be their gender therefore no two can be the same even if they use the same word to categorize themselves.
Additional info: they are happily dating
I always thought the argument to get rid of gender is a tad phobic.  Cis people identify with their their AGAB and I think it would be as hard for them to not have gender as it is for us being forced to conform to one of their two.

S'far as I'm concerned my gender only matters to the actual people in my life and the rest of the world shouldn't care one way or the other (so long as they are still respectful and all).
Abolish gender *then* give everyone their own gender.  
  
Third Way Enbyism
I don't think I'm smart enough to figure out how much transition I do or don't want without some standard ideas of ""man"" and ""woman"" to serve as reference points. So I can't really get on board with gender abolition without some sort of assurance that people like me won't be hosed if y'all win.
I make more genders in often accidental way, like thinking abt and plotting the four most common ones uncovered number 5.
Omg ~~yes~~  I've been saying that for years
Party rockers in the house tonight
I feel I’m in the maybe category. On the one hand I feel I’ve lost interest in using a label or gender. On the other If someone wants one for themself that’s fine.
both!!!!
I think more genders is more my wish for now so I can have a 3 gender public toilet and not be forced to get the weird looks in the woman toilet .
I prefer the first one
I'm both
I feel like I agree more with the first one than the second one. Gender causes so many problems it will be so much better if we lived in a world without gender. No stupid expectations, no stupid gender stereotypes. We'd all just be individuals and not judge each other based on something as dumb and arbitrary as biological sex.
and they were roommates
Gender for some, miniature American flags for the others.
Gender for some! Miniature American flags for others!
I’m not against either but me personally. The more genders the better :P
If I had a dollar for every gender I would be a broke bitch
Look, as a enby lack-tavist (aka I play video games, smoke weed and I never call my family) so I wouldn't even know anyway. 👉👉
me when i say i’m a demigirl then feel like the rock johnson levels of masculinity are flowing thru my body after a good upper body workout then feel like a sexless genderless entity that predates the big bang and humanity could never comprehend
i feel called out
Two paths to the same result
NO GENDER ALLOWED MUST DESTROY ALL GENDER
I’m both at the same time somehow.
i’m the kinda enby that wants to abolish gender, purely so the gender i feel isn’t summed up as just a third gender
I'm more of let people do what they want I'm just here
whyd you cut the second panel
And I am both! Never ask an abrosexual, panromantic, nonbinary person to choose between two things lol.
I’m the fuck gender one!
Yup, this. Personally, I think we should define what gender as a subject is, and then people get to self-determine where they are in the vast expanse of a multidimensional gender continuum.
I’m curious as to pro’s and con’s if either happened. Like everyone agreed we get are own unique gender or there is no such thing as gender.

I don’t think it would but no matter what, everyone is their unique thing. Some are more similar but also never exactly the same. Every story behind them is different then the rest. And that’s how they become who they are, with obstacles of their own. 

No matter what, it’s important to accept how people want to be viewed as in the world, even if it’s not considered a more socialized concept.
Everyone's gender is now just their name/nickname and age. Hi my gender is Zenith-22. Hmm very space-like. Just the 22nd star from my current zenith on planet Earth!

>I always thought the argument to get rid of gender is a tad phobic. Cis people identify with their their AGAB and I think it would be as hard for them to not have gender as it is for us being forced to conform to one of their two.

Maybe for some of them it will be hard but I don't think it would be too difficult for most of them. From what I've gathered a majority of cis people identify that way because it's normal to them and everybody else does it. If the default was Agender or just unlabeled not having a gender they would be doing that right now. 
Also it's not like they would be forced to do anything different, they could just keep doing things the way they did them before having no more genders means no more BS expectations around how to act and what to wear so you could just do as you please and no one would care.

&#x200B;

>S'far as I'm concerned my gender only matters to the actual people in my life and the rest of the world shouldn't care one way or the other (so long as they are still respectful and all).

That's a very good point.
Problem is that gender abolition is a very intuitive concept, and everyone has a different intuition of what it is and what that'd be like.

Personally I'm of the opinion that language surrounding sex and identity will, barring something terrible setting us back, inevitably evolve to be more reflective of human nature. Things will become more intuitive, important questions will be more easily answered for young people, unimportant questions will be forgotten, and we will in general fuss a lot less.

Considering how vastly unintuitive and backwards our idea of gender is now, how the way we codify gender actively works to make you less informed about the world and how people work, whatever comes to replace it may as well be called gender abolition.

It's not then a total lack of reference points for identity, just a rearranging of what modes of being we compare ourselves to. I'm kinda with you though, and I'd probably feel more than a bit out of place. I'd still probably feel that way even if, had I grown up in that world, I'd have had an easier time. Just because it means little to us now doesn't mean women wearing pants wasn't a huge deal to them at the time. I feel kinda like that, stuck reading meaning into silly nonsense.

That's fair I think.  I thought I was cis because that was what was expected and nonbinary wasn't something I knew much about.  Once certain barriers are broken down then we'll probably find out that far less people fit into the 'norm' than we think.  I've had this theory that everyone, or at least the majority, of the world is at least at tiny, teeny, weeny bit bi/pansexual but since heterosexuality is the norm most people don't notice.  Mostly from looking at how many people in B.C.E. leadership openly had lovers of multiple genders.

Gender is a scam!!!		"Gender was invented by bathroom companies to sell more bathrooms lol
""Yo would you like to buy my gender as an NFT for $100? I'm trying to pay my medical bills,""
its certainly a multidimensional contiuum and hard to pin down. Youve seen the Genderbread Man, I assume. https://www.genderbread.org/
I agree I wish people wouldn’t force a gender on you as soon as your fkin born
If I looked even half as good as you I would be very, very happy!
Gender? In THIS economy?!
Always has been.
So true! I am non-binary too. You look amazing!
You look great in this pic. I have a lot of body hair and am learning what suits me and your look is exactly it. ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
ur so handsome / beautiful :OO
Looking gorgeous fellow drugarica, never listen to the scammers o7
Thanks so much for further proving it with your gorgeous pics😍 I love your look!
Well people, it has been confirmed. Gender is in fact, and say it will me y'all, A SCAM
I have never been so confused as to what someone’s gender is in my life. If I saw you on the street I would simply assume I was in the presence of a gender less goddex
oh very excellent! truly a blessing ✨
You’re gorgeous omfg I love the makeup so much
I love that lip color on you!!
That's why I prefer to pirate my genders.
True story
YEAH FIDLAR
Wow! Your lipstick is incredible

You have to laser
Really I bought 2
You are beautiful.
OKAY I NEED LINKS TO LEARN THOSE MAKEUP SKILLS, HOLY FUCK

Your face right now is my gender expression goal, fucking please tell me how you did this
WOW 😍😳
WTF
They did the same with Italy to sell more pasta. Doesn’t exist!!
We must resist Big Bathroom
Quick someone tell the bathroom companies they can sell 50% more bathrooms by adding a gender neutral option!
Ahh double the scam
I actually haven’t but good resource thank you!
OP over here looking like the doctors really tried their best but couldn't
That’s so kind omg 💕💕💕
Side note you are stunning yourself!
I can barely supply myself with serotonin u think I can keep up a gender??
There aren't enough genders to go around, and someone's hoarding them, and the resale price gouging on those things in the fourth dimension flea market is worse than overhyped video game consoles and in demand concert tickets! I'd much rather spend my resources on things I actually need!
It’s still something I find issue with, shaving is so much effort and sometimes I like a bit of hair other times I like smooth. I think it’s purely what ur feelin that day really
Thank you so so much!! 💕💕
Omg truly I am living the dream if this is the case ✨🤙
Thank you!!!
Thank you!! It’s requiem by ABH
Gender.exe stopped working
FUCK YEAH 🤙
Omg I try thank u hahah
lol you are on the wrong sub, honey
Hold up I gotta go to the store and find out who asked
I should be able to return it I have the birth receipt
Thank you!!
And?
No I don’t 🤙
No they don't, what's your damage?
You’re too kind
I spent a while learning what works for my face shape etc but I also worked as a makeup artist for a couple years which taught me most of what I know 🥰🥰 thank u so much though that’s so kind x
it do be that way
U R Welcime! You can see by the sliders how there are an infinite number of possibilities. Sex , on the other hand, is very limited to the primary ones and a few intersex variations. https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intersex#:~:text=Intersex%20people%20are%20born%20with,range%20of%20natural%20bodily%20variations.
you often see gender essentialists equating gender and sex. they have no clue. that been over since the 50s. theure just bigots. https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sex_and_gender_distinction
You’re god damn right they couldn’t
Yess
You're so so welcome! 😘💕😘  Looking forward to more pics so I can copy your look hehe!
Hell yeah! You go kin- quee- … monarch!
Nah, but for me to not identify with either,  I dont have to shit on the whole concept
Hold up, didn't exactly ask for your feedback
Well the carpet looks good
Oh okay so I only have to quit my job and pursue makeup as a career to do that

lol fuck
**[Intersex](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intersex#:~:text=Intersex people are born with,range of natural bodily variations)** 
 
 >Intersex people are individuals born with any of several sex characteristics including chromosome patterns, gonads, or genitals that, according to the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights, ""do not fit typical binary notions of male or female bodies"". Sex assignment at birth usually aligns with a child's anatomical sex and phenotype. The number of births with ambiguous genitals is in the range of 0. 02% to 0.

Gender has some relationship to sex though right ?  If only historically ?  Correct me if I am wrong (I've tried to understand it logically)  but it seem that gender began to be used ( probably by feminist writers) as a way to describe traditional roles and behaviours and especially to imply that the roles and behaviours were taught and learnt by socialisation, and that's why sex and gender are separate.       gender only makes sense with reference to a societies normative standards of what the sexes are and how they should present and behave?
what is a gender essentialist?  it is confusing if you consider that transgender people seek to alter their sexual anatomy.
Not at all!! Just practice lots tbh. I still come out with some busted looks
gender has both socioligical and neuroligical aspects https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gender
Gender Essentialists equate gender and sex https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gender_essentialism
The reason trans people do that is basically to give the proper feedback to their brains and feel more congruent. This is a bit over peoples heads but the basis is described here.  https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-020-80687-2
**[Sex and gender distinction](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sex_and_gender_distinction)** 
 
 >Sex is distinct from gender, which can refer to either social roles based on the sex of a person (gender role) or personal identification of one's own gender based on an internal awareness (gender identity). While in ordinary speech, the terms sex and gender are often used interchangeably, most contemporary social scientists, behavioral scientists and biologists, many legal systems and government bodies, and intergovernmental agencies such as the WHO make a distinction between gender and sex.

That seemed to be the default position prior to the 50's.

is it an untenable position to think that now?

You can jack my car and carelessly toss me into traffic anytime?
Best post on this subreddit 😫
Omfg what a cute top, it looks so comfy and stretchy!? Thats such a good outfit on you
i am extremely jealous of how well you pull off the low rise pants wtf
That is literally the most accurate connection I have ever heard!
Yeah GTA!
This posts reminds me of the ultimate gay issue. 

Do I want to be you. Or do I want to be with you. 

Usually the answer is both. So I’ll go with that one.
I unironically like the fashion sense of some of the NPCs in Polecat's videos LOL
Iconic!
You look stuuuuuuuuunnnnniiiinnngggg💛❤️💛❤️💛❤️💛❤️💛❤️✨✨💕absolutely gorgeous
This is something 2003 Britney would wear, it looks amazing on you and I love it
cuteeee
omg i'm jealous of your waist!!! 😭
so stylish 💛🤍💜🖤
Then you're the kind of NPC that everyone wants to hear every voiceline you have to say! Absolutely stunning look, you rock!
Wow, I'm Animal Crossing, what about you?
I want my gender to look like a gahtdang Super Smash roster!! 😂 Also thank you v much!!!
I identify as animal crossing
I think I may be both....
I think I’m more of a sims online person
I can't, I'm too busy sashaying idly into oncoming traffic 😂
Oh lord, that is some high flattery!! Thank you so much!!!
Thank you!! I actually went into the store to find some bell bottoms, and picked this up to prove to my friend that these kinda shirts never fit me. I've never been so happy to be wrong!!!!
I will bring them back whether society likes it or not!!!!!
Both is a good answer 🥰💖
Ahhhhh thank you very much!!! 🖤💖🖤💖🖤💖
2003 Britney is my mom 💕💕
I’m Legend of Zelda, BOTW, lol.
Right there with you. I don’t get the hype over high waisted. It just looks dumb imo. I mean some people look good. But on me I look silly.
What?? You can pick a gender besides GTA or AC??
I love both tbh. I feel like all my crop tops look silly with high waisted pants though. What's the point on being cropped if you can't see my tum?!

growing out my armpits is giving me so much GENDER EUPHORIAAAA AHHH		"Love your style omg!!
Yes! I haven’t shaved my armpits and legs in like 5 years and I love it and feel so free!
I love it! I’ve been growing mine out for months and I love the little hairs, also natural deodorant is a life changing thing, the hairs don’t get matted which I find spray on tends to do.

Also shampoo the hair at least once a week, it keeps them soft (learnt that from my very hairy SO)
Your makeup is so bomb!!! That necklace is really cute too! 😍
This is amazing.  I caved and shaved before a vacation with my partners (very conservative) family.  I cried in the shower, it felt like such a betrayal to me.  

You are an inspiration!
You look so amazing!!
I cannot do it. It’s not the look, it’s the feel of hair in between my skin and my skin. Which is stupid, because when I first hit puberty I didn’t shave my pits, but I’m too used to not having hair now that past a certain length, body hair just feels wrong. 

Now I’m wondering if I could like buzz cut my leg hair and this may be a thought that only makes sense at stupid o clock in the morning but. 

Anyway, keep on rocking it.
Just did mine, already missing the euphoria it gave me  already xD Rock it fellow person!
Fuck yeaaaaaaaah
I try to grow my hair on my pits and legs but my mom gets very pissed when I do
Awesome! I shaved my legs and armpits once and immediately hated it. 4 years later and I still won't be doing it again.
Looks great! And as others have said, love your style!
Right? It doesn't seem like a big thing but then you grow it and like, *ooooh* my armpit hair is the same color and texture as my head hair... I lived for years thinking it'd be like my leg hair or something, and it isn't. It's so nice!
I grow my body hair and bleach it blond and it gives me massive euphoria too ☺️
You look amazing!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

This should be a daily reminder. Your armpit hair makes you even hotter somehow. Kind of like a fuck you to”Normal”. Normal isn’t freaking normal. 

This is great to wake up to.
I'm the complete opposite and shaved mine for the first time yesterday (I'm amab), but it's so great to do what you want!
I wish I could grow facial hair. 😢
Why would anyone ever want to shave their armpits? I tried it once, and it was the worst, most itchy, irritating experience. Any hygiene benefit I could possibly imagine is negated by how horrible armpit stubble is.
Its super cute and I love ur necklace. Wheres it from?
Yassss✨Also your style is great!
woo love to see it! I've had unshaved legs and arm pits for almost a year and it's the best :D gotta do what makes you happy
I want to be this confident with my body hair. I’m bigenderflux so even moreso I want to be confident with it… but at the same time I can’t help but think everyone will judge me :/
Is it weird that I'm transfem and the only body hair that doesn't make me feel gross is armpit hair? Like I feel like that's weird
Me too!!
Nice! Just a warning: they might not grow in evenly. I’ve been growing mine out since August, and I kept waiting for the left one to catch up, but they are just super uneven 🤷🏼‍♂️
i’m so in love with that necklace
I’ve had this growing out leg hair! ✨Euphoria✨
Oh my god right?? I stopped shaving a while ago and I thought I was okay with not shaving but then actually stopped shaving and it’s been amazing
your aesthetic has me in awe fr
Best men repellent is:
Armpit hair
She looks damn sexy
🪒
ahh thank you so much :’)
Same
i’ve gone long periods of time without shaving my armpits and legs but always ended up shaving them after getting not so nice remarks from family and friends, but fuck em, im gonna do what makes me happy:) and right?? it feels so freeing !! i luv it
dont shave mine since I'm 17 and I'm 25 now.   
i shave them occasionally when I feel like it but that's maybe every couple months for my pits and every couple years for my legs  


Then again I grew my first pit hair when I was 19 😂
ooo i will definitely try that !! thank you sm<3
Shampoo? Not conditioner? I’d think shampoo on its own would be drying.
thank you lovely!! <3
been there before too:( hopefully you can grow them back (if you’d like to ofc) and your partners family learns to be more acceptive. i don’t know why people care so much about other peoples bodies, i mean it’s body hair?? i’m sorry you had to go through that, you shouldn’t have to change things about yourself to appeal to other peoples “standards”. my dads side of the family is also very conservative and not very accepting of my identity, it’s definitely a hard pill to swallow but just remember to stay true to yourself, that’s all that matters !! <3 wishing you the best angel
thank you !!! you’re so nice😭
n that’s totally okay!! i have sensory issues with certain things so i think i understand where you’re coming from abt the feeling of it (personally it doesn’t bother me i have those kinds of issues with other feelings). and that sounds like a good idea !! also thank you<3
thank you!! and ya it literally gives me so much euphoria i stg LOL
<3
Give it some time. You won't live with her forever. Just hang in there. :)
my mom doesn’t rly approve of it either, it’s definitely difficult but try and stay true to yourself and do what makes YOU happy:(
yess i love that. i hate the feeling when i shave too😭 might as well just not, LOL
thank you so much !! :D
right ?! obviously at the beginning it’s sorta spikey like leg hair is, but then when you get past that stage it’s so smooth !! keep rockin it<3
i’ve done that before and i loved it !! dyed my armpit hair green once and felt so cool LOL
omg thank you so much<3 and yes i love that message, “normal” isn’t even normal !! love your energy :D
i love that !! <3 and yes, always do what you want and what feels best !
same honestly, but sometimes i like to play around with makeup and try to make the appearance of a “5 o’clock shadow”. dark eyeshadow or eyeliner to make the appearance of little hairs, or if you already have peach fuzz or stubble, you can use mascara to make it darker ! i’ve seen some rly good tutorials on tiktok if that’s something you haven’t tried <3
ikr, everytime i’ve shaved my armpits they get soo itchy and annoying, tried a bunch of different methods but they always just got irritated afterwards. i like the appearance of it and the way it makes me feel anyways, so might as well just embrace it, right? keep on rocking it:D
thank you! my necklace is from a local metaphysical store in my home town that unfortunately doesn’t have an online store, but maybe you can find similar ones at crystal stores or maybe etsy? i’m not sure:(
thank you!!❤️
yess exactly! :D
to tell you the truth, sadly people will judge one another no matter what it is.. why not give them something to talk about;) 
it’s easier said than done ofc. but take baby steps ! maybe you can see how you feel with body hair and decide whether or not you feel confident. always do what’s in your best interest and not base your decision on what other people might think. you are your own person and have 1 life to live, why not make yourself the main character in your own world and do what makes YOU happy. besides, if you really don’t like it or are just not feeling like your best self, you can always just shave it off! that’s the fun thing abt hair, it’s temporary :D 
easier said than done ofc, but i hope i could help in some way!:’) wishing you nothing but the best <3
i don’t think that’s weird at all !! do whatever makes you happy and feel comfortable <3
I mean ss a cis fem I'll be the first to tell that the first step o took to gender liberating was not shaving my pits, legs and groin. It gives me a massive sense of being REAL and self ownership rather than going with the flow. Plus I have kinky curly hair so ingrown hair's is a biiiiiiiiitch
yess<3
omg ikr !! one of my armpits is way more full then the other, plus they’re patchy but it doesn’t bother me ! keep on rocking it, i bet they look great :D
thank you !! i got it from my local crystal shop, but i’m sure you can find similar ones at other places,, or maybe on etsy or something:’) wish i had a link to give u LOL
right?? i love it:D keep on rocking it !!
yess, i love that !!!:D
yess, i love that !!!:D
ahh thank you so much !!! <3
literally LMFAO
um thanks but- my pronouns are they/them lol
😘
thank you love!!
The body produces its own oils naturally, so with short hair (like body hair) conditioner can actually cause issues because the body basically thinks it’s overproducing oils and can stop, actually causing dry skin. Whereas using a shampoo and just moisturising your body and/or using natural deodorants prevents that reaction
You're welcome cutie!
:)
I've no intention to! Though I did trim them up the other day. When I get to thinking about the *Scary Movie* films I get the scissors out.
For me I just love my body being so smooth after like 17yrs of it being a literal jungle of hair lmao, think i guess for both of us after living under a different identity and following different ""gender rules"" for so long is nice for a change
Thank you so much! I really needed to hear that.
Maybe it's cause its not as noticeable as other body hair
HAHA no worries, i will image search it and hopefully will find smth similar :))
You're welcome!!
I’ve never conditioned my underarms because I don’t keep the hair long enough , but I do admit to infrequently conditioning the landscape  downstairs, so to speak. You’re right though that  an oil would work just as well. I’m just bad at moisturizing in general.
LMFAOO
i agree, always nice for a change after following stereotypical “gender rules/roles” for so long:’) wishing you the best :D
no problem at all !! <3

Was feeling very gender yesterday, a vibe upgrade at the age of 40!		">at the age of 40!

&#x200B;

No. There is no way you are older than me.
Sorry, *what?* You look 25 max. I love your style (and your hair!), I’m glad you’re feeling yourself, and I hope I age half as well as you. xD
40???? Please share your black magic with us! I love the vibe you give off. Simply Fabulous!!
You look amazing! Yay Enby at 40!!!😍
It's funny how at the age of 40 you seem younger than me (I'm already a trainwreck and I'm only 22).

Your style looks so good! Even your hair color matches your outfit <3
You look like my old English professor! (That's a good thing, they were amazing and the first 30+ yr old enby I met).

Also, I love the hair color. Pastel is hard to pull off imo but you absolutely kill it.
What?? You're 40? I want to look like you when I'm 40 😭
As a 37-year-old struggling with coming back into my gender ""late"", I wanna thank you for posting this. Love it. You look great! Love the 'fit, the hair, the smirk - everything!!! ❤️😍
Looking wonderful ! The style really suits you :)   
Also happy to meet another in their early 40s.
I love the button up!! Pretty colors. 

Also I refuse to believe that you're 40. You look 25 MAX.
40?! What demon did u sell your soul to, to look this younger???
Haha well, I like the euphoria look, way to go!
i thought you were maybe 20😭 you look so great
you are cool! And, 40 is really a good age for everyone!
Not gonna lie, I thought you were Elliot Page for a second.
Looking amazing!!! I love your shirt so much, and your glasses look great with your hair!
You're 40?!?!?
no way you are 40, I'd say that you're like 23 or something 😳😳 you look gorgeous 😻
I REFUSE to believe ur 40 oh my gosh, u look younger than me n I'm 22 😭 pls give me ur power
FORTY??????????

disbelief aside, its always, *always* heartwarming to see older nonbinary people. and you do look very gender!
You sure don't look 40. Lol. Blessed with youthful looks? I'd say no older than 30.
Daaaaaamn ur such a pilf
Holy shit, *40??* I could have sworn you were my age! I'm 22, for reference.

You look great in this pic, OP! Very gender indeed :)
40?! You look 19-
No way you’re 40!
40??? Please, kind fellow, bless us with your magical ageing
    ERROR: Hacking too much gender!
ik everyone in these comments is saying the same thing, BUT 40??? bro, if you told me you were 18 i would not think twice lmao
Got anymore of that fountain of youth water? 👀
Wow you look incredible, not only for your age but you have great style!!
Very gender, such vibe, much feeling. So upgrade! Wow! 🐕
The look suits you :3
Love the look!! The envy has gripped me.
Ah yes, you are, in fact, looking Exceptionally Gender™️
There's no way you're forty -
You do *not* look 40.
You look wonderful. :)
First of all, you look great! Definitely feeling your vibe and wanting the same for myself!
20* 
Ain’t no way you’re 40
I loveeee your shirt, goes great with your hair! Also tret gang rise up :D
Love the shirt
So very gender!! Well done, well done.
Dude u look like your 20 something at mod 25 or 26 woah
You look incredible, friend! Love the subtle hair color.
Love the hair!
Unless it's filters, you look very very good at your 40s, and I mean good in general, regardless of age!

But what does ' feeling very gender ' mean? I've seen that phrase on net, but I can't wrap my mind around it.
40!?!??
I’m not even 30 why do you look younger than meeee? 😭
You look excellent for an eldritch god. Only 8.2*10^47 years old…
ummm the vibe pouring off this pic is fabulous! 🥰
40 ???? I’m 21 and you barely look older than me !!!
40????

comrade, i would card you just to be safe lmao. you look 22 :) (this is intended as a compliment but if not taken as such i’ll just delete)
I KNEW there had to be other people my age here!
No way you are 40.... You are just making others jealous of you 🥺.... I'm 20 and i dont have a flawless skin like you 🤌🥺♥️
Hella sunscreen
Hey! Thank you for commenting <3. I started figuring this stuff out at 38, after like 24 solid years of identifying as queer but often feeling this other kind of pull that I never looked in the eye. I was hyper-femme for a long time due to being a AFAB person raised in the conservative south. Never too late. I feel more myself than I ever have.
High five!!
Ayy thanks! The vibe I’m going for lol!
Same! Especially with that smile, they look exactly like him!
XD
Thank you!!
'Feeling very gender' is like really feeling that your style that day connects to your gender identity in a way that's satisfying/pleasing. When it's about other people (""wow, they're looking very gender"") it's usually about appreciating their style as it relates to their gender expression.

This is what it means to me, anyway! Hope it helps (:
I seriously do think I got some good lighting with this one. But TY ❤️
Sunscreen, hat, hyaluronic acid, tretinoin, and definitely good lighting last night! Probably mostly the lighting. XD
It's so true! Never too late to find happy, find ourselves. I was very non-binary in school, I just didn't have the language for it! Then I had to fit in as An Adult and also lived in a very conservative place. Started coming out to close people and figuring it all out for myself about 2018 (""coincidentally"" got divorced from a bad cishetmonogamarriage). 

Anyway, yeah, thanks for being here and sharing this pic and for being you!
Thanks for explaining! Ok, I think I get it. ;)

Dear my fellow enbies, I have realized I've been wrong about my gender. I am not an enby. I am not a woman. I am a man. I bid you farewell. Good luck, my froggy loving peeps. ❤		"May your journey be a great one my dude
Farewell! We’re proud of you for pursuing your truth! Good luck Man! Rooting for you 🚹🥳🎉🏳️‍⚧️
I first came out 1.5 years ago as nonbinary. Half a year after that I was pretty sure I am a trans guy (and came out again). Then like 3 months ago heard the term genderfaun (genderfluid between nonbinary and  a man) and realized I’m actually that. Sometimes finding one’s self is a journey with many surprise doors. Good luck on your journey!!

Woah, I have never heard of genderfaun. I may have some more thinking to do in the coming days!
If anyone is curious, the feminine version is called genderfae :)
Woah, I think I just discovered I'm Genderfaun. Never heard the term before.

finally feeling comfortable enough to play around with my gender presentation (and filters) after a year of avoiding femme things so i would look “masc enough”. there’s no one way to look non binary!		"facial hair and makeup is such a good look
You look fantastic
Oh my goodness, love the hair! And you pull off androgyny so fearlessly! Love it 😍!
You look awesome!
THE MUSTACHE IS SICK OML
So cute!! Your makeup looks perfect with your mustache!
You have such a nice style! :)
do my makeup please
The mustache is p e r f e c t
You are sooo pretty!
The mustache suits you so well!
why are you so cute? Who allowed you? Do you have a permit?
If you like mustaches it's a great thing you can sport them and you do it well!
This is such a good look on you!!!!!!!!!
Omg you look amazing and beautiful.
Wish I could grow a mustache like that..... Or at all....
Gosh, you're so pretty!
Thank you for sharing! I’ve been wanting to experimenting with a more feminine gender presentation but have been hesitant because I’m very attached to my mustache haha! Your picture is really encouraging and I’m glad that you found the bravery to be your authentic self ☺️
That hair is absolutely magnificently FABULOUS!
Honestly this is so great you look amazing
The amount of confusion you’ll cause the cishets is delicious
HELL YES I LOVE IT
Moustache *chef kiss*
you look great!
I wish i had those eyeliner skills
Seeing some modern Justin Bieber vibe. You’re looking amazing!
Oh wow I love the everything 😻
Oh shit you look fantastic I'm so glad you're feeling comfortable enough to play with gender presentation its so wonderful
You look beautiful. I love intentional non binary presentation. I wish I was brave enough to do that.
felt this so hard, i struggle so much w presenting femme bc i have mad imposter syndrome and hate when people misgender me but at the end of the day it makes me happy n fuck how ppl perceive us!!! you look amazing and i love ur look
femmestache is my new life goal
This is such a cool look!
Lovvvvvve the green hair and the mustache
I’ve never wanted a mustache more (ever?) in my life... yet here we are 😍
You are an amazing ""them"". Keep it up.
I legit cannot tell if you were born male or female and I mean that as a sincere compliment 😂
You got games on your phone?
It may be a filter, but that moustache still looks really good & really fits your style, and this is coming from a person who doesn't normally like moustaches that aren't attached to beards, so take that as very high praise. 👍
couldn’t agree more! everyone should try it it’s great
you’re so kind! thank u!!
thank you!! i dyed it myself! and that’s such a nice compliment <3 i really strive for androgyny that means a lot
thank you so much!!!
ty!!! the first one is an instagram filter named Bigode by wondanland !! very good for gender euphoria or just to mess around with!
thank you!! i love mustache filters (first pic) or the classic brown eyebrow mascara trick (second pic)
thank you sm!! i really appreciate it

Assigned gender at birth is just reinforcing the binary		"I think the only reason I would want to share my AGAB is for medical reasons/sharing dysphoria stories when I feel comfortable to do so.
when i read this i read “assigned gay at birth” before remember the g is for “gender”
I feel it can be useful in certain contexts, when describing your trans journey or your initial outlook on life or the pressures you had in childhood and so on. However in general you are correct I just don't like that view things in absolutes.
Asking for someone’s agab is basically asking “how can I misgender you?”
Cis people when I mention a new enby friend I made: Oh what's their AGAB? :)

Me, every single time without fail: I don't know, I can't tell :)))
no exactly! i hate AGAB labels so much. its just a “better” way to ask someone what their genitalia is 😳 however, i can be useful depending on context. but i still dont like them
Literally every post that starts with somebody's agab, my first thought is, ""I didn't need that info""
I will always upvote some sweet Spiderman nonbinary memes
THANK YOU omfg, only necessary during very specific medical situations, otherwise AMAB/AFAB has become a complicated way of saying man/woman... and the OBSESSION about it within the community...... oof omg it's always giving performative identity imo
I hate the justifications people try to use that agab is a way to specify things like body parts, transition goals, types of dysphoria, whether someone is affected by misogyny, and so many other things. Like it really doesn't explain any of that. You shouldn't assume those things based on agab. Just say what you mean instead of trying to use short cuts for everything
I agree. It's fine if people WANT to say what their assigned gender is, but it's almost like people feel it's a requirement. And that's not even mentioning cis people who ask about our assigned gender as a loophole.
I found out I was intersex as part of getting hormones, cis enby time
my brain first read that as “assigned gay at birth” so i think that’s a sign that i need to go to bed
The recent “Dressing as my birth sex :)” thing makes me wanna scream.
I always use ASAB (assigned sex at birth). People aren't born with genders, babies are just babies.
Assigned Glitch At Birth
Tbh what he gonna do with just the monitor anyway?
If you don't need it, great! But a lot of us find it to be relevant to our experiences. Let us have that.
I never explicitly mention my assigned because it can either be worked out from the context or it's not important to the discussion.
But it's useful in some contexts, like how we got socialized and how the world treats us. We are not at the point where we could just dismiss all of that. Some day hopefully but not yet.
Just a reminder that AGAB originated from the intersex community and was never meant to be used by trans people. The more you know
In my opinion, it would be cooler if most non-binary spaces didn't distinguish based on agab (although of course I guess some people would feel safer in a space with just enbies of their agab, and although I disagree it's not my job to tell anyone what to do)
Agab is out, acab is in
Just saw someone on OkCupid with “AFAB non-binary” in their bio, like sweetie, you don’t have to do that.
Assigned gamer at birth
One day I'd like to be like that. Right now my AGAB is written on my forehead like a neon billboard.
I thought it’s assigned gay at birth and was like yes
for a sec i thought that said ACAB, pleasantly relieved to see it’s a G lmao
Moood
it is pretty relevant insofar as the gender you were socialized as. I understand discomfort with this stuff but we can’t just hush hush everything that makes the trans/nb experience complex/messy/hard to qualify— “just a different way to talk about genitals” well, kind of, but genitals are relevant to a persons experience, and inform how they think about their body and their selves, too. Especially in queer spaces like this sub, I think it’s important for ppl to reconcile with the parts of queer identity that don’t make it simple or easy to
understand.


however if we’re just talking about ppl posting to try to deduce who has which genitalia, that’s rotten
Idk very important for medical things though.
That's how I feel about transmasc/transfemme labels but I'm not gonna rip them out of someone's hands and throw them out just because I personally don't like them. Let others define themselves how they want?
I think it can be necessary when talking about medical issues, but that's about it
I think there are situations where it's useful, because there are of course genuine differences in the transition experience, but there's so many people I see specifying or, worst of all, asking about agab when it's entirely unnecessary
Every single time I see an enby start their post with ""As a afab/amab nb..."" genuinely just sounds like binary gender with extra steps.
This isn't a black and white topic.

There absolutely are times where AGAB is used as a lazy way to lump people in with cis men and cis women when it makes no sense to. But there are other times where it's absolutely relevant and shouldn't be ignored.

For example, being AMAB non binary and attracted to women is a *very* different set of experiences from being AFAB non binary and attracted to women.

[removed]
THANK YOU
Is that not how it is normally used? That’s typically where I see it and how I use it
My brain always thinks it means ""all genders are bastards"" lol
Same 😂😂😂 could not think of any word for the g but gay.
I mean technically I was Assigned Gay at Birth
i often feel like there are more specific things people are trying to get at when they throw around afab/amab as a way to broadly classify people -- they're often assuming things like all amab people have penises, and as far as talking about how you grew up i feel like it makes more sense to say ""raised as a boy/girl"" -- intersex people and the increasing number of kids who are getting to transition young have experiences with gender roles growing up that don't map onto what sex they were assigned
I understand. This was more aimed at posts that say “21 AMAB non-binary what gender do you see me as?” Bc it feels like they’re just reducing nb down to amab and AFAB nb individuals
Me, some form of intersex : you want the short or long answer? :)))
the best and only response
ME TOO FUCK
Agreed.
I feel like assigned gender at birth should exclusively mean the gender society/doctors/parents placed onto you against your will at birth. Nothing else needs to be included in that assumption because AGAB is just a sticker put on the baby when born, and is meaningless (especially to me who is agender). It has nothing to do with sex or gender whatsoever, only made up social rules, and people who keep reinforcing that must not have unlearned that gendered concept yet.
Yeah no, a lot of the more direct terms give me a hell of a lot more dysphoria and can be more innacurate than generalizing by agab. I agree we shouldn't use them in more general things where they're unneeded and only cause divisions in those instances but they can also be genuinely useful
🏆
YES this
It really just seems to be a cudgel used against amab non-binary folks who aren't tranfem
Can you give me a single justification for feeling safer in a space that is restricted by agab that isn't just outright transphobia? /gen
On OK Cupid? You can't see why someone might feel the need to do this?!
Yeah but most of the posts here aren’t about medical stuff
I find it useful as a shorthand for “I’m trans in a similar way to how trans women are, but I’m not exactly a woman, I am non-binary.” It sets the expectation for overall how I would like to be treated and perceived. 

It’s an important descriptor for me. It has nothing to do with my agab.
Other people can use them if they like but we also don’t need to reduce non-binary to a binary
Respectfully, this type of rhetoric is both unhelpful and lowkey transphobic towards both binary trans people and nonbinary people who feel aligned with one or both binary genders, so please cut that shit out.    

You don't have to share your own assigned gender with anyone, but whether you like it or not, the experiences of AFAB and AMAB people differ, even if they identify as the exact same gender. That's not reinforcing the binary, that's acknowledging the ways that it confines all of us, cis and trans, binary and nonbinary alike. 

We can't discuss transmisogyny without acknowledging how it affects AMAB enbies. We can't discuss the ways AFAB people regardless of gender are infantilized and invalidated if we don't acknowledge that their assigned gender plays a role in this. We can't even talk about transitioning, HRT etc. without taking assigned gender into account. 

If that bothers you, take it up with cis people pigeonholing everyone from birth by taking one look at their genitals, don't blame us for using whatever terminology is available to us to accurately describe our existence and challenges.
Non-binary doesn’t equal agender

I thought so too. Outside of our bubble no one even knows what AGAB means
#Assigned Cop At Birth
It does, though
My favorite thing to do is talk about being trans without revealing my current gender either.
That can still be them just viewing their appearance as a measurement for how far they've come towards the person they identify as. Really, I think the biggest problem there is the reliance on others' validation.
That’s fine for *you* but don’t say *we* should do it that way. Because absolutely not. I’m not here to police anyones preferences, labels or way of being queer but please do not insist that your way should be the standard.
It is absolutely transphobic to use agab to generalize any of the things I mentioned. Don't throw other trans and non-binary people under the bus because of your own dysphoria.
I think it’s similar to having friends who were in your same religion before you switched to another. You have similar experiences and can empathize with some very specific struggles.
[removed]
No.
Yeah, sure. I don't like being referred to by my biological gender at all. But medical stuff is part of our day to day life and like very important. In every other context we are on the same page probably though.
But sometimes medical stuff is relevant to discussing one’s experience with transition and identity.
how would those terms set the expectation for how you are treated and perceived?
Absolutely. I'm not referring to those instances where it is actually is relevant, useful, and even necessary in order to accurately reflect peoples experiences. Absolutely, I am not denying that, nor have I said anything denying that, and I am already fully aware of everything you just pointed out. 

I'm talking about people feeling like they need to clarify their AGAB on posts that have absolutely nothing to do with AGAB and just kinda say it randomly, and I see it all the time. It genuinely comes across as just feels like binary gender with extra steps when it happens in the way I am referring to, and does not feel much different to cis people dumbing everything down to specifically genitalia.
wrong sub, I suck 🤦
[removed]
Hahaha this is gold 🥇
I was chatting with my tattoo artist while she worked on my leg. She’s queer too, bi I think, and I was talking about trans stuff. And I could tell from the way she said certain things that she thought I was transmasc. Big gender euphoria moment
Also intersexist. I don't have the same experiences as other transmascs because I'm intersex and I was not treated like them almost ever.

Nope that's transphobia, seeing a person not as a person but as a penis. Its trauma informed transphobia, but its still transphobia. Just because you are hurt doesnt mean you can hurt others, it's not your fault, but it is your responsibility to not perpetuate harm.
afab people can have penises and amab people can have vaginas. so you're still just relying on transphobia
Okay. Sorry I have a dick, I don’t like it either. You sound kinda terfy.
Wow. OK let me spell it out for you then: internet dating is even harder for enby folks than cis folks. There is extra pressure put on us to ""explain"" things that may not be well understood. There are also hate messages that can happen if you are not ""honest."" You really don't understand this?
I’m transitioning to be perceived similarly to how most would perceive a woman. That’s how I want to be perceived and treated. So I’m not a trans woman, but I am transfem. 

It’s an important part of my identity and in no way undermines it in the way casual agab labels do. 

I’m not sure I understand what your issue with it is.
Ha, no problem :)
Read what I said again. And read the response to that comment. Nothing I brought up is contradicted by what that person said. I never said that agab is never useful for anything but there are so many things that people use it for that are transphobic and not helpful.
We're not responsible for managing other people's triggers. I do understand why that can be a trigger for people with trauma, and why they want spaces free of anyone that makes them feel unsafe. But substitute anything else for the ""penis-bearing"" quality: would it be OK to form a group that excludes an age group, people above or below a certain height, mental health status, or POC? It's only ok because our society accepts gender segregation. I agree it's transphobia when used against transwomen and amab enbies
Also that has nothing to do with agab. Anyone can have or not have those body parts
Exactly. I know plenty of AMAB people with vaginas and AFAB people with penises. I think that AGAB is pretty much useless.
[removed]
Hmmm no idc, I’m not telling anyone my agab. It’s not relevant unless I know I am going to fuck you.

Love your tone implying that I’m a fucking idiot though!
Okay well your orignal comment really made it seem like you're saying any use of it is transphobic
It's different, as we're talking about an oppressed class having trauma about an oppressor class. And, as a member of the oppressor class myself, I believe it is best for us to take as little space as possible as to not make our presence harmful - thus justifying these afab-safe non-binary spaces.
I do not take up too much space by existing with a penis. Anyone who thinks I do can fuck off.
Well some people want to fuck and they want to share their agab so they won't have an awkward conversation about it

Nobody is forcing you to do it or force you to fuck anyone
I literally listed the things I was talking about and was super specific about what I meant. You decided to extrapolate things I didn't say.
You added ""types of dysphoria, whether someone is affected by misogyny,"" which are often greatly affected by agab, and then trailed off with ""many other things"" which is not specific at all. With that and the ""Just say what you mean instead of trying to use short cuts for everything"" that seemed more like a general attack against the terms, your initial comment was pretty general.
Those things are not inherently based on agab even if they *can* be affected by agab. Both amab and afab people can be dysphoric about the same exact things and both can be affected by misogyny. And yeah, excuse me for not writing a damn essay to be even more fucking specific for you in particular. And yeah I said that trying to find a short cut for EVERYTHING *rather* than saying what you mean directly implies that there are times to bring up agab, but it doesn't work for EVERYTHING. This really isn't that complicated, you're just doing the exact shit Im talking about, insisting that we always have to divide ourselves and not being willing to accept that agab doesn't divide us as much as we often think."	tyie6g	NonBinary	1826	0.99	2022-04-07 17:42:36

I'm going through a tough time with coming out to friends. One is a quiet homophobe, the other tried to make it all about herself, and the other two don't really seem to know what to make of it. Makes me plan to get more involved in LGBTQ-friendly activities so I can meet other people who aren't like that.
It is important to surround yourself with accepting friends
when my partner moves in with me im gonna do this for her ❤️
Ha, my gf is perfect, except for the fact that she makes a bit of fun of enbys 😬 I am jealous

Aw that's nice of you! I hope she feels more comfortable dressing the way she wants in public!

Yeah, of course that alone doesn't make a good friend.
Less about confidence, and more about trying to survive in a rural red state, and milking that AGAB privilege to be left alone as much as possible.
I bet you’ll find someone like that :) there’s good people out there
Thank you! I've been really scared of coming out and even doing a support group, but as I'm exploring this things seem to make more sense. It's really opened my eyes to what kinds of friends I need. Perhaps as I become more open with being myself it will be easier to find them.

Oof yeah I'm sorry to hear that. Hopefully they change or you're able to move out of there. I'm fortunate that I live in a swing state but I want to move to a blue state."	10j88cg	NonBinary	1779	1.0	2023-01-23 09:10:11
I have a ‘X’ gender marker, but I’m moving to a state that doesn’t have a non-binary option. Will I run into problems when I get a new ID?		"You can get an x marker on a driver's license in Michigan?!?!? I might be moving there soon so awesome! Do they allow x markers on birth certificates too?  How hard is it to get a name change?
As cool as this is I'm dying over the Eyes: Bro and End: None

Verdict: enbies are immortal
I want an X, but I am lowkey afraid of transphobic police
This is a really good question.

I know in PA before they officially changed it, it was discovered as a option by DMV employees so they were allowing people to change it without formal approval by people writing in the X option. It started in Philadelphia and then it spread by word of mouth. 

Other states might be using identical systems but not have publicized that this is an option. Per Real ID rules I think its supposed to be an option, I know Delaware has said that’s why they are making it an option there, but there’s no official form to get it processed on the DMV website yet.
That is an amazing name
""Eyes, bro!""
Maybe. Sadly probably yes.
I feel the need to add yet another comment about how I didn't know Michigan was doing this now. Might have to get my license changed...but I'm concerned about bigoted cops.
Michigan has x gender? But this state is terrible! *Passes out from confusion*
I did this — but in my new state I got a real ID, so they ended up just using the gender from my passport :/ I just included a change of gender self attestation form to get a different gender marker though.
How is your drivers license pic so good 😭
MICHIGAN HAS X MARKER???? I live in mi and had no idea!!!
i find it hilarious that your eyecolor is BRO
[removed]
Maybe. Great jawline tho.
Wait, I LIVE in Michigan.... how in the FUCK did I not hear about this becoming a thing!?!?!
Thanks for posting this ot led me to do some research and I found out that I can change my gender to X in my state
Depends on the state. Look into the state rules before getting a license to see what's the situation.
That jaw-line omg
Its super awesome you got an X!!! 
But I would say depending on the state you might be fucked. Most are unwilling to negotiate for an X because of stupid reasons. So maybe just use that license until it expires 😊
i have a question, i live in michigan, can they change your birth marker on a birth certificate from out of state???
Depends on what you define as a ""problem."" A problem getting a new license? Not likely. A problem getting a license that continues to say X? Likely.
so jelly. am getting a passport just so i can have some form of id that says it
What form did you fill out for this? I can only find the old ones that only have M or F :/
Omg yes!!!!
This is the one good thing about America, although we don't have genders on driving licences here in the UK
Do you need to change the id right away? Maybe keep this one until the state updates their options
I found out that I could have done this a month ago, about 3 days after i went to the dmv. Next time for sure.
I would think so.
Forgive me if I'm wrong but I thought sex was more based on your biology? Like I identify as non-binary as my gender but I still say my sex is male because that's my physiology? I know you can be intersex which makes sense and I suppose it doesn't really matter on an ID? But it's sex and gender non two different thing?

Please explain if I am wrong 😬
Thanks

Eyes: BRO
It’s new as of this year! The gender marker change was as easy as going into the DMV and signing a form. 

I did my name change via court order which requires you to provide a reason… I did mine in conjunction with getting married so my reason was ‘marriage’ which didn’t cause any problems, even though I was changing more than my last name. I don’t know what else is considered a valid reason, but overall it was pretty simple, just a hassle and lots of fees (about $200 total I think)
Oh and I’m not sure about gender marker on birth certificate, I have a NC birth certificate which is a definite no, lol
Yeah I was able to change my gender everywhere except the eyes. I still have bro eyes. Facts.
Yeaahhhh… luckily I still have my ‘M’ license because I left it at home when I applied for this one. They told me to destroy it but it’s the same ID number and expiration date, so if I really need to I can probably get away with using it.
I know this is old but I was googling “afraid to change license to x” and this comment came up so solidarity lmao.
I’ve heard about the PA thing. If I’m careful about the DMV I go to, I might find a helpful employee in GA who’s willing to do something similar
Thank you! 😊
Haha came here for this!
Here’s hoping it won’t be more than judgmental stares at the DMV
Yeah I’m sure I’ll never get let off with a warning again, but otherwise I don’t think I’ll be in any real danger. I like showing my ID at bars and restaurants now.
It really is. But there are some good people here, like the current sos Jocelyn Benson who (as I understand) is the one who finally allowed the X option. 

But yeah. Go further than 10 minutes from Detroit or Ann Arbor and outside certain pockets in Grand Rapids and it’s hell. Especially if you’re in Hell.
Tell me about it xP But it does, and I got mine changed the week they announced it!
Interesting. This is a RealID, so if I get a new one, I wonder if they’d get the gender from this ID or my passport. 🤔
Aw you’re too kind ☺️
I'm surprised by the same thing
It’s new!! Go get your X, homie. It’s super easy
Actually, OP is 601 centimeters long.
Yeah it means 6’ 1”, idk why they do it that way
It's only been a thing since late last year (November, but I don't think it went into effect until January this year, because I couldn't get the form on the SoS site sooner) so you aren't that behind on it :D
Hell yeah!!
🥰
Yeahhh unfortunately I think you’re right.
I didn't actually ask/try, but I'm 99.9% sure you have to do that in the issuing state
That would be complicated, but the gender marker change is really simple.
I did it in person at the DMV, and I’m 99% sure that you have to do it that way. I don’t know what the form was called, the clerk just gave it to me.
Yea id rather we just not have gender markers on our identifyin documents.
> we don't have genders on driving licences here in the UK

yes we do

it's a binary choice which shows up in the middle of the licence number
I think you technically are supposed to update your ID within 2 weeks of becoming a resident, and you definitely need an ID if you plan to vote… which will be important for me to do if Georgia is ever going to change. I’m not optimistic that they will within the next 10 years, hell NY just allowed it less than a month ago
You're not wrong at all, but the sex markers on IDs aren't meant to be biologically accurate, they're meant to identify your gender (yes, I don't agree with this but that's a different story). That's why trans men tend to change their marker to M and trans women - to F. Even though they aren't biologically that sex, it represents their gender on the ID/passport/drivers license/whatever other document.
Sex usually refers to gender unless it’s specified to be ‘physical sex’ or something. Regardless I don’t much care for my ID to advertise what genitals I have, that’s gross.
Even if it were based on sex alone, sex gets complicated when you start accounting for trans and intersex people. Sex is a sum of many parts, and all of those parts contribute in significant ways. It wouldn't be accurate to call me male because of how drastically my body has changed with HRT. I can't be treated by a doctor the way they would treat a cis man because my body works differently now
“Sex” on ID’s are an archaic terminology. Stems from a time when everyone assumed sex and gender are the same thing. So because there is only one space on the ID to identify either, intersex and genderqueer people use the area for different reasons.
The point of listing it on an id is the same as listing eye color, it's supposed to be a physical description as to more easily identify discrepancies and make fake licenses harder. It's shit at that of course, between dyed hair, colored contacts and platform boots, every single thing on that is versatile. Listing x instead of m or f doesn't actually effect anything.
Federal stamp? I haven’t heard of this, what’s it entail?
I'm already married so I can't use that as a reason, however my reason would be that my birth name is difficult to spell/say (I used to stutter saying my own deadname) and gets confusing, so hopefully that's enough, but $200 is cheap compared to what it is here. You have to run it in a newspaper and everything. It's so complicated. I'm probably just going to wait until I move for sure.
My reason was “I want something that feels more comfortable” or something banal like that. Did they make you provide a doctor note at the DMV for the X marker? I was told a sex market change would require doctor notes but my state doesn’t offer the X yet so I didn’t do it.
Holy shit! I'm in Michigan looking at name changes soon and I didn't know this!!!
I just did my name change and the reason I used was that ""everybody important in my life knows me as [given name], not [deadname], and I want my legal identity to affirm that"" and it was perfectly acceptable. If you're in a relatively liberal part of Michigan most judges should also just accept being trans as a reason too.
My reason in a Michigan court was, ""I am non-binary and have been using this name professionally and personally."" My fees after filing fees, newspaper, and license changes came to around $500. I had a spreadsheet somewhere with details but that was also back in 2019.
Changing more than your last name due to marriage also varies state by state (or the Ohio social security worker lied to me)
 *cries in Ohioan.
You give massive gender envy to me
Feels on this as someone in the same situation actually heh. Ive been livin in Missouri for nearly a yr and still usin my Oregon ID with an X on it cuz i havent been able to figure out what the frick to do to get them to use the correct marker here.

Gonna be gettin a passport soon tho which shud fix the main issue of lack of current ID, but still gotta work on the state ID situation.
You shouldn’t, if they run it through their system it’ll show up as the new one with the “X” they’ll definitely know you are using an invalid licence
[deleted]
Hopefully. But that is why i avoid all of that by just having a Non Binary U.S. Passport. Thats good anywhere.
Lol the cops in Taylor are horrific, I definitely remember reading an article about how they were under investigation for being corrupt and racist. I tend to stay in Detroit it's way chiller than people think
That is really the truth. Im in this thread like ""how did I not know this? Why am I always so out of the loop w stuff in Michigan?"" Its because I live in bumfuck nowhere on the West coast, no one in this county is gonna _tell us_ you can use a new gender marker lmfao 🙄

I have to drive for hours to see my HRT provider and pcp bc he's actually the ONLY one on this entire side of the state. And every time his office offers me lgbt resources from GR I'm like '....you guys have resources!?!' Like if you're not in GR or Detroit it's easy to forget the community even exists out here. I know I'm not but I very often feel like the only queer person for miles. Ive only started seeing pride flags on ppls houses in my hometown in the last 5, maybe 10 years. That was NOT a thing 15 years ago when I was a teen. My friends and i used to get an absolute ration of shit for having anything rainbow.
I'm in Lansing and it's been surprisingly fantastic to be trans here
I mean, they probably literally just wouldn’t be able to put an X in their system. I happened to get a nice person who was appropriately apologetic about it ahaha
do you need anything special? or can you just go and get it?
That's impossible
[removed]
I submitted mine a week ago. Should have it in the next 1-3 weeks :D  


Thank you for the post reminding me. <3
I wish I wasn't :c
apparently the federal government removed the requirement last year so its up to the states now. would be nice if people started genuinely campaigning for that instead.
Thanks that's what I thought was going on. We don't have gender markers on drivers licences in the UK we only have then on passports as far as I know
Yeah for trans and intersex people it obviously makes sense that if you need to take not of someone's biological attributes that simple male a female doesn't make sense, I just was wondering if the marker on these ID's were gender or sex because it is marked as sex but that doesn't really make sense outside of like maybe a medical ID or something? Idk
https://www.dhs.gov/real-id

https://www.michigan.gov/sos/license-id/real-id

Sorry nm you already have the star so you’re good. I’m dumb. Besides you’ll likely need to alter the address anyhow so you’ll have to get a new card.
You have to run an ad in the local legal paper here too, but that’s just another form and the fee for that is something like $50. That was the most convoluted part of the process for sure, other than getting a background check at the police station. That part made me very uncomfortable.
Depending on where you live, I'm sure, but you don't really even need a ""good"" reason. My wife and my friend both got name changes because... I think 'common use' was the exact term, but it just means 'because that's what people call me.' It was a very quick in and out time at the court.
I just changed my name in MI and it was fairly easy, but you do have to live in  MI/the county you'll be changing it in for at least 1 year. During my hearing I just told them ""because I'm trans"" and the probate clerk was like ""ok bet"" essentially. You also have to run it in the newspaper here but they make it pretty straightforward. The probate clerk (in my area at least) has packs of the paperwork you can purchase at the courthouse as well
Hey just so you know its up to the judge but you can request that they not run it for safety reasons due to transphobia
I've struggled saying my deadname for forever, too.
Nope. I just said “I want to change my gender marker” and I was given a form, checked the appropriate box, and signed it.
Probably more based on the judge than the state.
🥺
Can you get an X gender marker on a US passport?
Good shout, I didn’t think of that.
Yeah it looks like GA just doesn’t have an X option, unfortunately /:
I would get a non-binary passport, but I want to travel places where that could put me in danger
I live in GR, there’s some amazing people and places here. But it’s also not out of the ordinary to get heckled. I have started to see more support in other surrounding towns though, gives me hope
I worked on a film just outside Lansing which has been my only experience there, guess I was too far out!
That’s true. In Michigan I know it took some time for them to be able to include an X even after it was considered legal due to needing to update systems. 

I don’t know what the back end looks like, but I wonder if when RealID standardizes nationwide next March if there will be some sort of universal system that includes the option because of states that allow it
I printed the form off the internet, and filled it out. There's a fee for a new license (about fifteen dollars) but that's it. The clerk who helped me was mildly confused, as they didn't know the form existed, and so they had to talk to their boss to figure out what to do for it, but it went through really smoothly, I think. They didn't charge extra since I needed a new license anyways.
r/whooosh
Welp, I *had* been managing to keep my height dysphoria under control…
No problem! Congratulations!!!
Yeah, I've no intention of carrying a government document that would out me as queer and trans to a cop
Ah yes. From what I can tell Real ID allows for states to determine the genders they recognize, but they don’t require states to recognize any specific gender markers. But I do wonder if I changed all my federal documents (passport) and get my birth certificate sealed so there’s no trace of the old marker what would happen. I’m moving (potentially) to Georgia, which is wildly unpredictable with where they fall on things like this. Like their minimum wage is $5.50 but they voted blue last cycle, and Atlanta and Savannah are some of the most progressive cities in the southeast.
Oh we don't need background checks here, but the paper ad costs $385 alone so thats why I haven't done it. That and I'm still deciding on what name I want. I thought I knew but now I've changed my mind lol.
Just a note, in many states, you don’t have to run the legal ad if there are safety issues. What constitutes a safety issue varies, but some states explicitly allow people changing their name for transition related reasons to skip the publication.
Thanks that really helps
Yep, it's not that bad. I'm really close to where you are, and while I couldn't go through with it due to other issues (my parents essentially threatened to make me homeless if I changed my name under their roof) the rest of the process was very easy--filled out all my paperwork online, just had to print it out--and I suspect my zoom hearing would have been about ten minutes or less.
I met with the judge after it had already been published, do you know how that would have worked?
Sweet! Oh goodness I hope that’s all I have to do soon
You don't have to talk to a  judge here for marriage name changes you just take your marriage certificate to the social security office and they take care if it there
Yes its a more recent change as of this yr
Yes; see here: https://travel.state.gov/gender

You can request and be issued an 'X' passport even if your state doesn't offer 'X' gender markers. Some states' laws also allow for a passport to be used as proof for a gender marker change, which means obtaining a correct-gender passport may allow you to fix your driver's license (or other state ID) without medical documentation you might otherwise need.

(This unfortunately doesn't mean their DMV software will actually be capable of encoding anything other than 'F' or 'M', but it's worth checking your local law and asking about.)
No offense meant, (if this is a rude question tell me and I'll delete) but why would you want to go places where you would be in danger from it?
oh wow. I'm definitely doing that at some point. thanks

i mean personally im already black so thats not really a concern for me but yeah i guess if you're not already vulnerable on sight it'd be hard to give that up
So looking into Georgia, it seems that they don’t allow the X marker so they might make you choose/ go off of other documents like a birth cert.
Fed minimum wage is $7.25.
Huh, the more you know! Is that more complicated, like are there additional forms to get the exemption?
Michigan typically doesn't though :/ I ran into issues with that and judge threatened to just not grant the name change if I thought it would be such a safety issue. But I was also in a conservative city, so it may have been that.
no i dont sorry
You don’t here either if you’re taking either partner’s name or hyphenating, but we made a new name so we had to.
They make it so easy! Now I'm excited to renew my passport
I have family that lives overseas, and sometimes there are great people and places and things to do/see that just happen to be in countries with bad laws
No problem! Hope it goes smooth for you!
Kindly shove off
That's true. Being white and able to boymode is a pretty massive source of security. Especially in my Idaho hometown where the pigs are pretty notorious for ties to extremist groups
That’s what I’m thinking. I’ll probably be given a form with 2 boxes, but inspired by this story: https://whyy.org/episodes/the-secret-way-some-got-a-gender-neutral-pa-drivers-license/ I might try to pencil in my own option and next to my X marker on my MI ID be like 🤷🏼 and just see what happens
Thats why i updated both my ID and my birth cert so they cant use any other marker :3
Yep, but Georgia’s official minimum is still 5.50, which still applies in certain rare cases.
Looks like it may have gone up now, but I found this on their DoL site: https://dol.georgia.gov/minimum-wage
That depends on your local court!
Yup right there with ya! I actually have no idea how I'm going to approach my family when they see me transitioning. My parents were deeply unhappy with visiting family commented that my voice is deeper. Meanwhile I love that stuff. 

I had a smol child come up to me
""Will you be mad at me if I say something?""
-""No'
""Okay your voice sounds like a boy""
- I'm like ""um... that's okay""
Ah. Sorry you gotta deal with that. It shouldn't be so hard for us to just exist.
Good luck!
That’s wacky!
Omg children are so pure. I recently overheard a kid tell their adult ‘I thought that was a girl’ after the adult referred to me with he/him pronouns. Didn’t even feel like I was presenting that androgynous much less feminine
Sometimes they see us for who we are and it's adults who take away their vision. I think of it like Shallow Hal. 

I'll have these interactions with people where they think they're insulting me but it actually affirms me in a weird way. 

Like one time i was at an interest group meeting at a bar and some dude was playing pool nearby. He comes up for some reason and engages in conversation. ""Jesus, Jesus, Jesus, as long as you believe in the lord and are a good Christian we're okay."" I have no clue how we went from this point to this one but me doing drag came up. He goes ""I could tell you were one of those because of the voice"" and when I tried explaining I think I blew his mind. Though if my voice is becoming so androgynous I think I'd like to stop explaining my AGAB situation like I'm defending myself or something. I like the idea of no one knowing
People are boggling. I do think it’s funny when they don’t know how to insult us because they’re so ingrained in binary. I’ve seen people try to calculate my agab, they look so silly."	vhn93t	NonBinary	1759	1.0	2022-06-21 20:51:04

I think I speak for a good few of us when I say I feel attacked.
Shit, I waited two years after quarantine, what’s my prize??
I am not a book, you shouldn't be allowed to read me like that

Shut up,  


but seriously tho you are correct and i hope you have a pleasant day/night x
okay listen,

Oh well why thank you 😂

... covidgender? Agoraphobegender? What am I not getting here
This is great and totally applies to me, but I feel like we shouldn’t assume that all allies are eggs as it could make cis allies uncomfortable and we need all the allies we can get
Thanks, it has pockets!
Hahahaha i really thought i was a straight girl a couple months ago lol
what the fuck i have never been called out for this before lol
Ahhh, I remember when I realized…

May 2020, got ghosted in the pandemic, did soul searching and thought— “this is all bullshit, imma start experimenting with they/them pronouns”

Welp.
Oh, fuck you for knowing things 😂 (/s)
First of all how dare you,
Lol I'm so glad I found out like 3 years before. Glad to have everyone though <3
2019: ""I'm just a great ally!""

c. Sep 2020: ""Ok so I might be asexual""

Nov 2022: ""I've known I'm ace for a few months now, and now I'm Definitely A Lesbian""

Early 2021: ""Wait am I even a girl? Nothing fits, guess I'm a girl.""

Spring 2021: ""Shit I'm Girlflux""

2022: ""Fuck it, they/them because you couldn't behave""
It's amazing how, getting a tiny scrap of dignity during the pandemic, you will do anything not to have to give it back!
Thats gonna be me 2023 lol
Thaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaanks.
Hi
You can go straight to heck.
Quarantine really awakened the gay in us
I feel very called out
This is exactly how I discovered - just almost spat my drying nail polish laughing.
I am trying to better define my gender and I feel part agender
Thou art a year late. To the day, actually.
LISTEN-
""haha, funny post""

*realisation hits*

WAIT, that's about me!
I love my new gender so much thanks for this
Keep your voice down
Me lollll
This did, in fact, happen to me.
thank you
""Good allies"" thing kind of rubs me the wrong way because it somewhat implies one can only be a good ally and really care about other human beings only if one is the part of the community.

It just feels wrong when applied to other things like passionate allies to BIPOC communities, intersex communities, neurodivergent and disabled communities. ""Good allies"" is almost implying in a twisted way that they must be a part of the community too since they care so much.
same lmfao
Same
ALL the gender!!
How do you think I feel? Haven't even auditioned and already played like a fiddle!
It took me a second, but I think the joke is playing off the dedicated 'allies' who end up being trans trope, and the fact that covid lockdown led to a lot of trans people realising their identities.
I think it's talking about enbies who recently discovered themselves after thinking they were just allies, not that all allies are actually trans
That early 2021 part tho… finding womens clothes that fit my big 52yo man shaped ass can be a challenge. Yay flared yoga pants!

Heck yeah Spotify!! Non-binary option in gender on spotify :)		"My gender is: none of Spotify's business.
If only they’d let me change my username so that it’s not my deadname anymore… last time I talked to someone who worked there they told me I’d have to make a new account. I’d lose so many songs and playlists I’ve been using Spotify for years. You can change your nickname, but people can still see your username if you send your link etc.
Why does Spotify need a gender marker in the first place?
Ooh. Now, if you excuse me, I need to do an update on my Spotify.

Oh, also to let people know who uses Tubi TV you have the choice of 'male, female, or other.'
Aside from general ad targeting stuff, setting your gender in spotify changes the voice that some ads are delivered in. When it's set to non-binary, you sometimes get the same ad twice in a row but once with a male voice and once with a female voice.
Does your gender change the algorithms?
Sorry if this is a dumb question but how do you get to this I can't find it
Theres a gender option on spotify? What-
I wouldnt use Spotify. Joe Rogan and Blair White live there.
Why does spotify even need to know my gender
Give me some of that sweet non bino algorithm
Before I realized, I got so annoyed I even had to answer that question like why does it matter? Gender is a construct that has no bearing on anything and this stupid music app needs to know? What the shit is this?  


Now I'm all like, oh that's why I act like that
Doing this now lmao!!
Love that they have this option. However I always click prefer not to say bc why do they care? Lol
Everyday I regret signing up for Spotify with my Facebook when I was 15
We are setting a status quo for all the nonbinies out there! Take note truscum!
Is this a localised thing? Just checked and couldn't find it anywhere in my app. Noticed some other folks talking about changing their names though which I'm pretty sure you can do; don't think I've ever seen my old tag after changing it when I send a link to someone
still prefer not to say tho. enby is not nothingness
[deleted]
When I signed up it didn’t even have à prefer not to say or skip this step
Do you guys have any cool queer podcasts on Spotify you recommend?
thats so exciting! where can i change this?
Why do you need a gender setting to listen to music?
Agree
Oh noo I diddnt know that you couldn’t change your username,That sucks :(
I usually opt for not putting my name in my username incase it changes
I changed my username. I forgot how though it was ages ago. Talk to support they helped me
Could you make a new account and make your playlists a collaboration so that you can still make changes to them on the new one?
On pc, I think you can click first song, shift+click the last song to select all of them, ctrl+C and then ctrl+V on a new account, so maybe replicate your old account and playlists could be easier that way. At least easier than going one by one. 

I didn't know this could be done until someone told me, I'm sure you can google more info about it.
I couldn't change my profile picture because my Facebook account is gone.

Spotify has highly available, globally distributed audio streaming down pretty well. Can't deny that. But the software has to be a completely mangled mess if their answer to problems is always ""lol new account""
If your Spotify is linked to Facebook, changing your name on Facebook changes the account name on Spotify as well. Hope this helps!
I was able to change mine on my computer browser just by going to my profile and clicking th3 name and changing it. It was like 2 years ago tho so idk if that still works
Statistics for recommendations of playlists and for the free accounts ads
yeah but i’d prefer if every company just spent the tiniest bit of extra time and put non-binary in there
Weird
That’s kinda stupid tho
Well at least that means the option does something.
And here I thought my boyfriend getting a playlist for downgrading to free again was hilarious and stupid at the same time. This is just beyond ridiculous and makes me kind of glad that I don't use Spotify that often.
I think I've gotten the same ad twice in a row but with the same voice..
Or is it for their analytics to increase their profit margins?
On pc, click your profile picture, then click account and it'll take you to spotify through your browser. If you're logged into the spotify on that browser, it should show a side bar to the left, with edit profile being the fourth option. The gender option is under that!
I have no idea! This is just me creating a new account (also on mobile if that helps)
That's not stupid, I can't find it either!
Time to change mine ig
Exactly. Like this is fine in and of itself. But at the same time, my gender has nothing to do with whether I wanna throw down to some slamz or not. I'll do it in heels in the pit if they need proof.
I think its to make people feel more comfortable and more likely to buy their crap
So they can market you nonbinary crap
Wdym by that?
Probably stealing your data ¯\_(ツ)_/¯ 
Not the point tho
Realistically probably 1. usership analytics and 2. ad targeting
to more effectively sell you shit you don't need
It’s so frustrating, I don’t want to out myself every time I send my link to someone. And now if you create a new account they don’t even let you choose a name it’s just letters apparently. Same with Etsy >< I’m hoping they both change that someday.
I changed my nickname which is the display name but not my username. Talked to a few support people already and they told me that you can’t change your username/login name.
Yeah I was thinking of doing something like that so that I can save and transfer all of my playlists over I just wish I could have my name in my new username instead of a bunch of numbers
That’s awesome, thank you for letting me know. I was wondering if there was some kind of select all for transferring songs to playlists hopefully there’s a similar way to do that on a Mac if I end up making a new account.
You can’t change your picture? That’s so weird it lets me do it under edit profile. 

I love Spotify so much it’s my favorite music streaming platform but being told to make another one and that you can’t customize or change the name of it (same as Etsy) is seriously lacking. I was hoping someone who works there would at least have that ability if I couldn’t do it for myself.
Brb, gonna go mess up their statistics >:]
Technically, other and nonbinary would fulfill the same role in this context.
I have no fuffing clue
That would be so stereotypical to recommend songs based on gender
ayyyyyyy
Thank you!!!
Where is it?
when you are above or below gender, you are not boy, girl or enby, you're nothingness.
Ok I want them to sell me non-binary shit tho
I'm pretty late, but you could make a new account and use a website like Soundiiz to transfer all your playlists to a new account
Oh yeah I had the same thing. I have deadname3 as my ""username"" and genderaffirmingname as my display name. That's what I thought you meant
Yeah, it’s unfortunate. I wonder why so many platforms don’t allow you to change your username..
I saw some people complaining it no longer works on Mac a few years ago, but I also found this so I hope it helps! It's just a quick search ""spotify mac select all songs 2023""

https://www.hitpaw.com/video-converter/how-to-select-multiple-songs-on-spotify.html
My account was tied to Facebook so it was stuck at the last profile picture I had on FB, which um isn't me anymore ):< 

Whatever, it's very gay now and that's all that matters
Did you ever find it? I can't
not necessarily, although some people might feel like that
well then choose other? you are in the nonbinary sub lol
Would that be like agender or gendervoid?
Right, same here. The only thing that doesn’t make sense is that if you send your link people still see your deadname in the link even though they see your chosen name in your profile. Same with Etsy ><
I think people are just lazy and slightly close-minded maybe. Someone printed out a receipt for me from Etsy and it said my deadname username under my display name it felt awful. Ugh didn’t mean to hijack OP’s happiness. I just feel like Spotify only made part of the effort that they need to make.
That’s so nice of you, thank you.
Haha indeed that is what matters. Glad you could figure it out then? I’m not sure what mine is attached to I think I made it without linking it to something I haven’t had that kind of problem at least.
just found it, its in the account settings
Ohhhh... That sucks. What do you mean your link? Like sending a playlist?
That’s horrible! I’m so sorry :(
Hopefully enough people complain about it that they allow us to change usernames.
If I sent someone a link to my profile the link has my deadname/username in it. It doesn’t seem that way for individual playlists though.
Oh odd. Thanks for letting me know"	10ojpvf	NonBinary	1734	0.99	2023-01-29 21:49:55
Been havin me them big ol' gender feels lately which means trying out new styles		"Wow, I love this look!!!! Those trousers 💯
HOT aahajjgnngkfkfn can i borrow some your energy please???
I love this style! Where did you get those pants? they are so great!
Love your style! You are flippin cute as hell.
That's the exact hair colour I've been wanting to make my hair! At the moment it's more pastel mint green than emerald because I didn't let it set for long enough. Which dye did you use?
This style is dope on you!
You look amazing! 🤩
1. Fantastic.

2. is that knife just... hanging there?
You look so cute! Keep on finding yourself 🥰
Ohmygod I love your style! You look so cool and chill!
Holy gender envy-
Please tell me about those pants!

Ok but hot??? You look amazing!!
damn you look sharp
You are so iconic I might have teared up a little bit....
Ah beans. I wake up and this has kinda exploded. You're all so ding darn sweet, I might cry 💚💚💚
Thank you so much!
Thank you! I think I got them from h&m yeeeears ago. I usually only wear them when I gotta dress up a lil fancy but I'm tryna figure out how to style them more casually
The ends are done with the pine green from crazy colour. It's a couple of washes in so a little faded from what it was but I think I only let it set for half an hour or so. Pastel mint sounds super cute though, ngl
The knife sitting there made think of [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/comics/comments/79nrxi/house_plants_oc/).
1, thanks 💚
2, yes... I have no explanation... I had nowhere else to put it

Eh, you know, traditions, guys having to flirt with girls and not vice versa, it's rare to be AMAB and be flirted with

Got an email today from the government, and they used the gender neutral honorific! I almost had tears of joy !		"There *is* one?!!  Dope!  Congrats!
Awesome!!
Nice!!
I'm curious about that what government is inviting you to haha.
That’s awesome! But you don’t live in the U.S. do you…?
Yes, we love to see it!! I got an email from my state board of pharmacy, and even though they force you to choose a ""gender"" of male or female, they honored my request to be addressed as Mx. \[insert name\]. It felt so good!
That's great :)
THATS SO COOL WHAT
WOOOOOOOO
Amazing! Which government?
Wow that's amazing! I think I might start using mx. Also I know it's specific but those are some very neat nails! Congrats friend!
This is super intriguing to me.  My brother works at a law firm and asked me about honorifics the other day because one of his co-workers said they aren’t supposed to use ‘Mx.’ on official documents.  They didn’t provide an alternative, so my brother was curious what nb people would prefer?
[removed]
hey!! thats so cool! I’m a trans guy and im kinda clueless about enbies. How do you pronounce mx? Congrats btw this is amazing
This is awesome, and honestly, why does our govt need to know our gender anyway? Why can’t we all be Mx, and you have to fill out a form if you want the govt to refer to you by gender? One day…
Happy for you :)
[removed]
Which government, exactly? Asking for a friend.
There's a couple I know of. 'Mx' (pronounced mix), 'M' (pronounced mist) and 'Mm' (pronounced mistrum)
Lol just a survey through my work. Nothing too exciting!
Did some Reddit stalking and it appears they are from Canada
There's truly no better feeling than gender euphoria, especially when it's unexpected! I'm glad you're being addressed how you want to :)
Canada! Specifically the Yukon
Haha thank you!
I can't speak for all nonbinary folks, but I know many people don't like honorifics at all and prefer just to be addressed by their name. Mx is getting more popular, and I've heard of M (mist) and Mm (mistrum). I can't imagine why Mx wouldn't be okay on official documents though... it's a nonspecific title that isn't granted through official means. Mind you I'm Canadian so perhaps we have different rules in that regard.
Hahaha thank you! I'm a nurse so my hands are usually dry and just awful. I'm glad they look good here haha
It's pronounced mix! And thank you :)
It's not a pronoun, it's an honorific
Ty for your input buttfucker joe
Bro made a whole ass account just to be an unfunny troll 😭😭
Yukon, Canada.
Haven’t heard of the other two, just Mx., I love M and how it’s pronounced!
Freaking love this.  😍
Also

* Per (Person)
* Ind (Individual)
* Myr (Mystery)

As far as banks go HSBC UK also support a bunch of others some of which I'm not actually familiar with https://www.hsbc.co.uk/help/banking-made-easy/change-of-gender

Mx. is the most popular it'd seem tho
ALRIGHT MOVING TO CANADA FOR SOME VALIDATION
Yup I'm Canadian.
Ah, yeah, my brother and I are both from the US, but we live on opposite ends of the country, and I don’t think there are any national laws about such a thing?

We both understand dropping honorifics all together, but that could be seen as ‘informal’ for a law firm; so he asked me (as the only out nb person he knows) if I knew of any other honorifics/titles that were popular.  I’ll definitely tell him about M (mist) and Mm (mistrum) though!

It's certainly on my radar. But it'll sadly have to wait a year until my contract is up at my current firm. But I do want to focus my career on LGBTQ+ rights eventually. 

In the meantime, I'll probably be starting a YouTube channel about trans rights in my jurisdiction, so be on the lookout for that.
Indeed we do. But you'll be happy to know that, including me, 3/4 lawyers in my small firm are LGBTQ+.

Minecraft says trans rights		"makes sense, some of the best music (Pigstep and I believe Otherside) in the game is composed by Lena Raine, who is trans and also the composer of Celeste's soundtrack
Aww nice! I know Notch was pretty transphobic so I love seeing this message on Minecraft.
I feel like this is a direct swing at Notch and I love it.
Big props to the creator of Minecraft, Hatsune Miku, for supporting trans rights.
They actually added a few similar ones recently (1.19.3.):

You are valid!
‌I'm glad you're here!
‌You are welcome here!
‌Your gender is valid!
‌Contains infinite genders!

and I love it.
Hey I play Minecraft!
YAAASSSSSS
Based Minecraft
Well if minecraft says it I guess it is
Yay!!!!
Minecraft is such a good game
Mmm yaay! It's nice to see my childhood hyperfixation still supports me
How the tables turned. Notch/Markus Persson is transphobic and now Minecraft says trans rights and one of the music composers is trans!

Trans rights!
I love this
Bare minimum/pandering
Wow nazis support trans people now?
Woah I'm actually surprised! (in a good way)
Yeeeaaaahh! fuck notch, dude is a transphobic asshole, nice to see Mojang be better than his stinky ass
:)
WAIT SHES TRANS WHAT

also she made some of the ambient music for certain 1.18 biomes and 1.17 nether biomes and its rly good hehe
was?
Better than most extremely popular mainstream games are doing also what more do you expect? Rainbow themed armour?
Well minecraft doesn't have a story so how could they do more?
correction: bare minimum is *not* being transphobic for no reason

however: this is, in fact, pandering
uhhh wtf are you talking about (please include valid sources)
Maybe they were hoping Notch had stopped existing.
i think was was used in the context of ""when he worked on minecraft"" because he doesn't anymore
It's just weird pandering like we're supposed to go absolutely wild for this
Jesus Christ I was just talking about how notch is a nazi
relatable
https://i.imgur.com/dNBQxQk.jpg
I was hoping he had changed from when he worked on Minecraft. People can grow and learn from past mistakes, they can become more accepting. 

Maybe I’m just too naive / hopeful. Most people suck.
oh okay
You may have meant that, but it’s definitely not what you said— hasn’t notch been separated from minecraft for a while now?
Notch is also transphobic - he has been removed from Minecraft.
Actually, not to hurt your mood, but he changed for the worse. Believe it or not, I remember reading Notch himself on his old blog once confirming there was only one gender in minecraft, and everyone was gay, with the caption “Take that homophobes”.

Like, damn, who knew the mighty could fall so hard, eh? It’s likely directly caused by two things, the biggest case of suffering from success I have ever seen, and the cesspool breeding ground of vile and controversy that promotes attention seeking, also known as Twitter. He has also stated something about straight pride existing too, but he went back on it with a rather heartfelt tweet admitting his mistake, he’s a different person nowadays I’m pretty sure, for the worse I’d say, but it’s strange to know he was once pretty genuine, which leaves me in a quite a confusing parasocial relationship.
Yeah he hasn't. His Twitter is full of transphobic stuff. He even complains that Unicode has gender neutral modifiers for some emojis.
I can understand. Some people do grow up and out of old views sometimes and I can understand hoping someone will come to learn and accept people as they find themselves
more than 8 years, in fact
Idfk I don’t keep up with Minecraft lore
The villagers still a little anti semetic tho
It's not lore
Yes? I am not disagreeing with you. I know about the antisemitism problems in Minecraft. It's not only the villagers: the jewish community has been asking Mojang to not appropriate the word ""golem"" and Mojang isn't listening. I take this problem seriously but at the same time we can celebrate that Minecraft says trans rights. I hope one day we will get both. Trans rights AND safety for the jewish community."	z2chdb	NonBinary	1680	1.0	2022-11-23 02:14:24

hi there!! i started T shots on march 31st of 2016! in june of last year i switched to topical T (condensed cream/lotion). i started at .25mL every week when i first started if i remember correctly? after a little bit i was upped to .5mL a week before switching out to topical bc i stopped being able to do shots myself for some reason. honestly i kind of want to try shots again just because it’s so much harder for me to remember the topical T every day :/
yes it is, good eye!! i got it at a local shop, but i found [this listing!](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00CWJ7A5K/ref=cm_sw_r_cp_api_i_rgVgDb6QD86YX)  there’s another listing on a website called inked goddess creations, but it’s sold out.

Since I have a smaller chest, I decided to buy TransTape so I could wear open button ups. First time using it and I'm becoming entirely too powerful. Love that gender euphoria(he/they)		"I’m loving the confidence , inspiration to the nation ☺️
Too powerful indeed! You look amazing!
I just ordered Trans Tape. Does it work well?
This button up 😍
You look amazing! Very jealous of your aesthetic!
does anyone happen to know the sizes that trans tape works well for? i have no concept of how big my chest is, even though i’ve measured multiple times for binders, and i only ever wore/wear sports bras 😂 but i would LOVE to experience this euphoria, lmao
Gender envy. You look amazing!
YES this looks amazing on you!

My fiance has this shirt as well and I regularly steal it for similar looks!
Tell me about this tape! I'd love to do this too! Edit: you're sexy af, btw.
YES!! I recently did the same thing and I’m obsessed!
you look great, want that shirt!
I'm getting major majima vibes :D you look fantastic!
You look amazing! I've considered getting trans tape too for the same reason
Oh wow!! Such goals, wish I could do that : D
I declare hax. Nobody looks that good. :)
You look so good! I can't wait to be able to do this
I'm so jealous! I own such a cute 'fake' button up shirt but can't wear it without a bra or binder 😭
How do you use it? I bought “boob tape” and then it says you need nipple covers to use it so I never tried.
Looks great 😊
You look incredible!!!
YOOO i love your piercings ^~^
An entire vibe! I love the confidence it is giving you 😌
You look great. :D
how does trans tape work? also you look great :D
IFJWJXKEXJIE WE HAVE THE SAME SHIRT AAAYE
They ALL DAY!! So much power comes when we
Love the way we look
you radiate so much confidence and power i hope you have a very nice day 🥰🥰🥰
Love your confidence! Great picture
love this♥️♥️
You look great! I recently got trans tape, worn it about 3 times now and I’ve now got into the swing of how much a need etc. It’s made me so much more confident! Glad you’re feeling the euphoria too!
handsome
YOU GIVE ME SO MUCH GENDER ENVY
Isn't it weird as if people can see thru you clothes ant tell you are doing something ""wrong"" or you are afab ?
WHAT! I need to do this!!!!
what width tape did you get? i can’t decide between 3 and 4
Looking fire
thabk you! 😁
I use it occasionally and my experience is that your mileage varies immensely depending on the specifics of your body. For me, my chest is medium-smallish I guess? But they're uh.... rather perky, so the tape doesn't work as well as I would like. There's also a learning curve, so it will probably take you a few tries to figure out how to apply it in a way that gives you the best results.

Also, be patient and really take your time with the removal so you don't wreck your skin >.<

It's not perfect, but I'm still glad it's an option.
Tbh I got it at walmart 👀
Haha thanks!! To be honest it's still a work in progress 😂
Bigger chested transmasc here. It really works best for smaller chests. I’m a 32DD and cannot use it at all.
Thank you!!!
A valid move!!
Haha thank you! Like I mentioned this is my first time using it and my application was definitely a little messy, but they do have a website with more information, taping tutorials, and links to videos! It comes in three sizes (3"", 4"", and 5"") and in three colors iirc
I got it at walmart! I think they might still be selling it
Idk who that is but thank you!
Do iiiiiit
You need nipple covers for this as well, but honestly I just used folder toilet paper and some of the tape 😂
Thank you!! I still don't have all the ones I want, but I'm planning to get my labret next 👀
Thank you!! And essentially you just use the tape to pull your chest down and back, which helps flatten it and give the illusion of having a flat chest by removing cleavage. You can't really tell in the pictures, but it doesn't make my chest completely flat - the way I have the button-up placed just hides that. It comes in three different sizes (3, 4, and 5 inch) and I highly recommend checking the website for more information!
AYYYE HELL YEAH
Facts!!!
AAAAAA THANK YOU
i got the 4!
Your very welcome!
Seconded on this! This was my first time using it and there are definitely things I should have done differently, but it's fairly easy even with the learning curve! I'm about a C so I'm on the smaller side and it doesn't make my chest completely flat, but it does get it out of the way and make me more comfortable.
Do you put something on before applying the tape? I read something about milk of magnesia but I couldn't find it anywhere at the drug store.
Gotta love walmart
thank you! i think i might be on the bigger side of DD, close to DDD, but my partner is DDD and there’s a pretty sizable difference, but it could just be me not understanding how my chest looks 😂😂 i really wish there was something like trans tape for bigger chested people, because binders are absolute hell sometimes
Damnit. I am also this size and bummed because I was thinking about trying it :/
Yeah that sucks. I wore a binder a long time ago and want something to get that affect but I can’t even wear sports bras on the regular anymore. I hate the confinement on my chest. 34DD here 🤦🏾‍♀️
Thank you!
tfw in uk
😯🤔 I’ll try this because “eww nipple pasties” or whatever the fuck lol
ohh ok i think i get it , thank you :]
I don't put anything on my skin before applying the tape. I wouldn't recommend it since you probably want your skin to be clean and dry to have good adhesion. However do make sure you cover your nips! I usually cut out a little square of trans tape and then put folded up toilet paper underneath, and I think some people just use bandaids.

You probably could/should put something on your skin after you take the tape off, to soothe irritation/heal any damage. However, I don't have any recs because I'm bad at actually staying on top of my own skin care. Iirc the actual trans tape website has some guidance on that.
Same :/ yeah I can only get away with a binder if my shirt is on the baggy side. Fitted clothes just don’t work for me lol, even with a binder it looks like I’m smuggling bagged pizza dough some days 😂
Save yourself the pain, literally. Even pre-T/before chest hair growth, it wouldn’t work for me. Granted, depending on chest shape/size and your frame, your mileage may vary. But I’m pretty petite, and it didn’t do anything for me at all. Frankly made me more dysphoric to see how poorly it did, but you never know. 🤷
damn it do be like that 😭
Bandaids also work in a pinch! Just make sure the soft part is over your nipple, and kinda pull down so that your nipple is tucked away (?? Does that make sense?)
ofc!!
ohhh pizza dough 😂 weird but accurate comparison. binders can flatten me enough to ease any discomfort, but it’s in the 100s right now where i am so binders are out of the question.
I'm trying a new compression sports bra this week, but also hoping Title Nine brings back the frog bra which was my all time favorite for pulling off masculine looks.
We have a ton of bandaids. I’ll try this first. Thanks"	ot5fi2	NonBinary	1663	1.0	2021-07-28 08:00:46
gender goal: confuse the cishets		"Thought I was in r/streetwear cause of how fire the fit is
Gender? I don't even know them. 😏
No but that’s literally my goal. To be as visually confusing as I possibly can. So much that people spend time when they see me in stores trying to figure it out.
If McDonald's was a co-op leftie vegan restaurant, this is what Ronald McDonald would look like (i swear it's a compliment, you look fantastic!)
i am going inSANE where did you get those clothes
I love that sweater
I love love love your look, your hair especially!!

My goal every day is, ""am I a boy? Am I a girl? Who knows, but everyone thinks I'm hot so that makes everyone gay."" Keep being fire 🔥🔥
MORE LIKE GENDER GOAL: I WOULD SAVE YOU TO MY ""NICE THINGS"" BOARD ON PINTEREST BECAUSE YOU LOOK AMAZING
I. Love. Your. Fit. 

Oh my god it's so beautiful, and you wear it so well!! 💗💗
I am obsessed with that outfit holy cow that’s not a fit my love that is art
hi where are those shorts from?!
Ayyyyy fellow nonbinary cane user
go further, confuse monosexuals in general
Wish my hair would take that colour
I am obsessed with your whole fit. Also that sweater is the bee’s knees <3
dean pelton outfit vibes
UR SO COOL
i’m not cishet and i’m still confused. goal achieved.
holy shit I love this
I love your sweater!
I had white blonde hair years ago. But years of chemo and stress mean it's grey and sparse these days. I can't bear being touched, so just use the trimmers on the back and take the scissors to the top. I was using some really good professional Chinese hair colours that came out well. Maybe it's from being stuck in the house for 28 months, but it is just so dull, whatever I do.
True and general chaos
saw your post on r/shouldercats, you look:

1) amazing 

2) very androgynous

tell your little void they look amazing, too :)
Great outfit!
This mustard look is everything
it's the ""queer"" knee tattoo for me
AAAHHH FELLOW NONBINARY CANE USER obsessed with the fit that sweater is everything and your hair looks AMAZING!!! <3
Goal achieved! 😉 and not to beat a dead horse but your outfit is rad
What my gender? Yes
Reminds me of a jester look, but the hair colour just straight up reminds me of hisoka from hxh xD. It's an aesthetic I've always liked because it gives off this eccentric, mysterious, trickster character mood. And it's great since the trickster archetype tends to always lean to queerness while also being probably the most entertaining and  attractive character types.
Welp. Now I have to tattoo queer on my leg. (No I don’t have original thoughts)
This outfit is everything!!!
holy crap i love this outfit!!!!! u look awesome!
For some reason, I'm getting Dr. Who vibes from that.
You look amazing! I love your hair <33
That is such a goal like if I can do that, I've succeeded with my identity appearance
I love the outfit! Do you by any chance know where you got it from? Very lovely 💚
bless you I'd be too scared to post there 😅
yesss I love to walk by a group of people and overhear them trying to figure out if I'm a man or a woman 😂
Sameeee
lmaooo I both hate and love that 😂
I'm glad I wasn't the only one who got mcdonald's vibes.
the jumper is thrifted, jacket and shorts are both lucy & yak, and then the boots are military surplus haha
thanks, I actually thrifted it 😊
thank you, I do my hair myself and it's my pride and joy 🥰 and yesss I have a very similar routine, you keep being fire too 💕
awww thank you 🥰
thank you 💕
thank you! that's what I attempt with all my outfits but I'm not always successful lol
they're lucy & yak, they're the bonnie shorts in mustard!
ayyy we are the coolest 😎
it might! have you ever tried bleaching it?
lol he is a style icon after all
Me too, the outfit reminds me of the fourth doctor. Just needs a scarf!

Could I please borrow someone’s gender I am trying to buy this thank you		"wtf? why? [swipes to 2nd image] ok thats p funny actually
Here you can have one of mine, I steal genders so I have plenty in storage for just this occasion.
wtf?
Here I have loads of genders, you can take your pick. I just ask that you return it in the same condition.
This is so confusing

Edit: wait I just got the joke
Okay, this is actually hilarious.
Disregard binary, join hexadecimal #FFFFFF
What the actual fuck

Edit: ahahaha
What is it you're trying to buy?
[removed]
I like the joke would buy more a few

Also i can give a gender, got them from my jorney.
here have some genders, I dumpster dove for them and they're still in mint condition
Here's a glass of gender-fluid <3 good luck
Then why is it an option
funny except the second image has an I and an O not a 1 and 0
I have read the comments and still have no idea what's going on here
That's the funniest thing I've heard today
You can just have mine, I don't want the damn thing. I never liked the concept of gender in the first place.
why is there an enter key? You can just type 0101111001101110
this made me giggle a bit
Uuuh yikes let's see *searches through my genderfluid and pulls out GeNdeRz* you can borrow either boy or girl for now
Ahhhh hahahaha that’s great
I have half of one you can barrow but you'll need to ask someone else for another half.
Here have [ALL the gender!](https://genders.wtf)
I think this you have a good case to sue for discrimination. 🤣
That's a cute joke but I hate that there's a feature on this website that allows you to discriminate over who gets to buy your product
tHat,S rACisT
WOWWWWWW
amazing
Rude
Ok this is pretty funny 😂
Here you can take my male, I only identify partially with it
sorry i have no gender to spare..times are hard
Only have 1, I need it. But you can borrow it if you'll bring it back! 

And take it on a day when I'm not going out and don't need to think about dressing myself! (Because lounging around in jammies doesn't require gender!)
Mine could work in a pinch...though it's pretty inconsistent. Like bad cell phone reception it'll fade in and out. Just select female and keep hitting purchase until it works.
Do this, write male in one paper female on the other, fold them, put ur in a jar, shake it and the first paper you pick you use as the gender for this purchase!
I only use mine on the weekends, so I’ll need it back, but you’re welcome to borrow it until then.
Shucks, I’m sorry frondo!!! I’ve been keeping my gender secret in a lockbox, let me forward you the treasure map….
Shit, I'm all out of it. Sorry.
I feel like this would only not work if it were let’s say a binder….
You can have my left over female, I'm not using it. Can't guarantee it'll get you the product but it's worth a shot.
I am a transfem lurking here and enjoying the Chad jokes and still subscribed from my time I was questioning that concept of gender as such. You can gladly have my rest of maleness, maybe this pushes you over the edge just barely enough👩‍🌾 /s
I have many, pick one 😹
Well, crap. I fed my gender to a goose a few years ago, but I would give it to you if I still had it.
haha wtf?
How would that keyboard work though? Obviously characters are binary encoded but I don't really see how it would work to type with only 0 and 1 keys because even though they're binary the characters themselves use 8 or 16 bits as well as the instructions themselves. 

The way that I would do it if I wanted to make a keyboard to type in binary would be to use 8 or 16 toggle switches (probably 16 so it'll be compatible with both utf-8 and utf-16) as well as an enable button to send those eight bits to the device.
LMAO

I love nerdy puns
What the heck?
You can just keep mine, I never use that thing
so thats where the binary came from.... the biggest nightmares coming from this one little device........
Y'know what? I was about to rant, but I'm not even mad anymore lol
I can borrow you my man gender but I would like to know when you gonna return it. I need it for weekend.
You can have mine as soon as I figure out where the hell i left it
Yeah my sibling is pangender they won't mind if you borrow one. Right u/gabekkd ?
Wait I don't get it, could U pls explain
I been begging you to give me back my genders!!! What I need to do!!!
You can have one of mine, i collect them on my jorney
So that's where they all went.
[deleted]
When I first came out to my Singaporean coworker, who happens to be a database admin, she was very confused because nonbinary is a data type in some databases. Lol
Swipe over there’s 2 images
reading this was a fantastic experience, thank you
Swipe to the second image.
so op first pic is about (op) choosing the non-binary option

swipe theres a second image, 1 and 0 binary code languages. these are “binary” but op chose the gender “non-binary” therefore can not buy it
yeah it’s real funny ok fine whatever now can I PLEASE borrow your gender I am agender (aka not a gender, and not to be confused with not agender) I need to finish my coding so I can carry out this here trans agender pardner
I doubt that was the intention tbh idk where this came from but it looks more like a bug than something intentional
There's a second image that recontextualises it.

I was readying my pitchfork until I swiped to the second one.
Yeah that's fine, I've got all of them which would you like?
This is like an unstoppable force vs immovable object. You have all genders I have none of them we are at a stalemate
I don’t know much about computers but to my knowledge “binary code” a series of “0”s and “1”s is used by  computers. Therefore the joke being, the device used to type binary code  is very much binary.
I think I might have some extras if you’re looking for a replacement. No promises about them being whole or in good condition though tbh
I don’t get it pls explain
A keypad with an on button, off button, and backspace?
Ah.

Right...
Thanks
You can borrow the fem presenting part, but uhh, I'm also non binary, we're both unallowed to buy it (well, she/they but same thing)
I hope so
Me too I was ready to fight
Added to that that the third option is 'back space'; so if you're not binary, you cannot proceed and have to go back, like OP experienced in the post.
Ah yes thank u
I thought it was a keyboard with only O and I and thought that it was like one of those gaming keyboards with only wasd so it didn't made sense at all lol
*Previously loved gender*

*Mildly used gender*

*Gender like new - only taken out of the box and looked at* 

*Box has surface damage, gender inside is fine* 

*Gender - box included. Few pieces missing but still works* 

*Free gender - stuck together with duct tape but otherwise in working order* 

These are the product descriptions your comment made me imagine ha
I have some in the junk drawer. 

Also happy cake day!
It's a 1 and 0: binary.
Binary keyboard
This made me think of that 1999 Toyota Corolla Craigslist copypasta lmao
baby gender, never worn
Bought this gender for my grandson. He loves it. 5 stars
Oh you beautiful bastard you 🥰

Here's my classified:

_Free to a good home: vintage gender, hardly any use. Looks like new, but I don't know how to operate it, so I can't comment on functionality._
I love this, lol
I fucking love this sub 😂😂😂 

thank you for a much needed belly laugh
:)
OHHHHHHH I DIDNT GET IT😂😂😂😂😂😂
it looks more like an I and an O?
Oh that makes way more sense. So the seller is just trying to be funny
So then non-binary we've had keyboards all along?
I've not seen that, but that is the sort of image the comment sparked in my mind! Descriptions of used cars in adverts lol

""Good mileage, don't use in heavy weather, won't start when cold"" 

You know what, used cars and genders definitely have a lot in common! 

And the older I get, the more I relate to an old car who's got bits falling off it. At what point did evolution decide it would be great if sometime in your 20s you can injure yourself just sleeping wrong?
I feel the last bit! *Lost operations manual, and it's in ancient cuneiform so never knew what it said anyway* 😆
There's only two options so it's binary no matter what symbols they use. 🙂
I got you

I'm only 23 and absolutely have been gravely injured by putting my leg a little too far up 😂
I think I have a translation for that!

> Tell Ea-nasir: Nanni sends the following message:

> When you came, you said to me as follows : ""I will give Gimil-Sin (when he comes) fine quality genders."" You left then but you did not do what you promised me. You put genders which were not good before my messenger (Sit-Sin) and said: ""If you want to take them, take them; if you do not want to take them, go away!""

> What do you take me for, that you treat somebody like me with such contempt? I have sent as messengers gentlemen like ourselves to collect the bag with my money (deposited with you) but you have treated me with contempt by sending them back to me empty-handed several times, and that through enemy territory. Is there anyone among the merchants who trade with Telmun who has treated me in this way? You alone treat my messenger with contempt! On account of that one (trifling) mina of silver which I owe(?) you, you feel free to speak in such a way, while I have given to the palace on your behalf 1,080 pounds of gender, and umi-abum has likewise given 1,080 pounds of gender, apart from what we both have had written on a sealed tablet to be kept in the temple of Samas.

> How have you treated me for that gender? You have withheld my money bag from me in enemy territory; it is now up to you to restore (my money) to me in full.

> Take cognizance that (from now on) I will not accept here any gender from you that is not of fine quality. I shall (from now on) select and take the genders individually in my own yard, and I shall exercise against you my right of rejection because you have treated me with contempt.
true, true haha. the joke finally clicked for me, lol. 😭💀
Oh I love that, thank you for sharing! 

Yes exactly! I'm only 1 year older and it's crazy, your 20s are meant to be the prime of your life! Not ""I turned too much to look in one direction and hurt my neck"" or ""I drank water too quickly and almost *DIED*"" (why does the body make us try to breathe at the same time as drinking and then choke?) 

I've heard the 30s are even wilder for these random silly injuries and do not look forward to it 😅 

(Maybe this has always been the case and we're just more resilient now? These strange injuries once killed us and that's why people used to have low life expectancy?)
I never knew I needed this in my life until now. Thank you for the laugh.
Binary code literally is 1s and 0s. That’s what the power switch is as well. A 1 for on and a 0 for off. 

But now I’m forced to ask, which gender is 1 and which is 0?
Ah yes, the two genders, “on” and “off”
I would guess 1 = male; 0 = female. Cuz, you know... similarities?

And zero is the better number, so...
(That was meant to be the joke.)
Zero isn’t even a counting number!! Lame!!
But I thought [three was the magic number](https://schoolhouserock.fandom.com/wiki/Three_Is_a_Magic_Number) and now I'm all confused!
Oops, did I accidentally woosh myself?
How is zero not a counting number? Do you never count outside 1 to 9? No 10? No 100? Zero is critical for base 10 counting.
If you did, you weren’t alone, judging by the votes. 😊
No like zero literally isn’t a counting number
Well I sure as hell count it. So tell me, oh great gatekeeper of the terminology; what is it you mean by ""counting number"" and why should you not be able to use 0?

How many flonks do I have? None, zero, I don't have any. Count: 0.
it’s just math idk I didn’t make up these terms
Weak. I say it is. We use it in counting things, so it is a ""counting number."" You can claim it's ""just math,"" but that isn't really explaining anything, regardless of the source.

Zero is one of the most important concepts in mathematics, critical to the indication of the absence of a value for all manner of calculations. When I write 2023, that zero means there's no value there in the 100s place, and it needed to be represented *somehow* to communicate the final value being represented. You can't have 2023 without indicating the *lack* of that 100 or 200 etc.

First time going out in a dress! Feeling very gender! wish me luck in my small Scottish town!		"Looking smashing.  Have a fun morning!
last pic is legendary
I love the dress/chunky sweater combo!
If I was in your small Scottish Town, I have to admit that I would totally stare, because your hair and makeup are ON POINT!
Hope you had a fun morning!
last pic is a meme format waiting to happen
update your post when you get home, we all want to know how it went!
UPDATE: 

Firstly, I want to say a huge, HUGE thank you to you all. You've been so kind and generous with your compliments, awards, and upvotes. You have absolutely made my day! 
You have all been so overwhelmingly lovely, so thank you! 

Secondly, many of you asked for an update on how it went, how I felt and whether I was accepted. I can confirm that my little Scottish town is full of lovely people! I met with a friend for lunch in our local pub and I felt very welcome. Not a word was whispered behind my back, no strange glances or hostility. I was treated very well and was simply accepted for who I am!

There was a massive downpour of rain that I had not prepared for, but even when soaked through, my heart was kept warm by your kindness and the thrill of this euphoric day. Thank you all for being a part of it!
omg you are the main character
Thank you for giving me new aesthetic goals 😅 You look great!

The enby in me is morally conflicted in finding this hilarious		"also - All this and nobody's noticing how weird it is to ban other languages in your community? What fresh nonsense is this?

EDIT: This isn't the place to defend racism! Don't even fucking *start*.
The enby *and* the language nerd in me are dying laughing at the idea that ""Germxn"" would ever catch on
I refuse to believe that's real.
On one hand, this is funny. On the other hand, nearly everyone seeing this world think it's a 'look at those queers and their ridiculous pronouns' thing and holy shit is that unpleasant
The “removing ‘man’ from words regardless of that word’s root” seems to stem from the radfem ideology of the 90s… I had a snarky book as a preteen that took it to this level. Wild to see it happening “in the wild” so to speak
Reddit subs creating fake interactions and then painting them as real to “prove” the trans community is crazy? It’s more likely than you think

No seriously, y’all keep upvoting the “This is crazy! How could English speaking non-binary people do this???” They ARENT. This is fake you guys, stop rallying against our own community what the fuck
As a proud Gerenby i need to tell that the gerwomans are more scarier then the germans. But i love both equal so we became a gerfamily ::)
What's HILARIOUS is that it's *Deutschland*
Ignoring the obvious bait. I find the whole adding 'x' to words incredibly cringey and frankly problematic. When adding it to already neutral words like folks to folxs or person to persxn implies that we're not already covered by that for some reason, which is incredibly othering. And things like slapping it into other languages à la Latinx with no regard to the language of people who speak it is just colonial AF.
The waifu discord profile pics really elevate this.
personally, i find anyone who throws an x or \* into words like that to be a big ol red flag. we don't comprehend written language letter by letter when we read. it's basically pattern recognition so most folks are gonna read germxn as german anyways in their heads. 

shit is just performative and pointless
Especially since the name of the language IN that language doesn't contain any gendered substring of letters: Deutsch.
Please, for the love of got, stop censoring the occurrence of ""man"" or ""woman"" in words where its obviously not the root. ""Geee im having my personic episode again""
These kinds of things always get me. Just because a word contains a sequence of characters/sounds that sounds like a gendered word doesn't mean that that word is gendered

Manifest is a good example of this. It contains the sequence 'M-A-N', but comes from the combination of the Latin word for hand (manus, which by the way is feminine) and (most probably) an element meaning 'to hold'

'Man' comes from Proto-Germanic 'mann.' So the two words don't share any features of their etymology

Incidentally, the word 'female,' surprisingly enough, doesn't actually make reference to the word 'male' at all. Female comes from the Latin word 'femella,' meaning something akin to ""young woman,' built off of the related word 'femina' combined with a diminutive suffix. Male, on the other hand, comes from the Latin word 'masculus' (young man, similarly a word for man with a diminutive suffix added). They were both borrowed through French, which deleted a lot of sounds to produce 'mâle' and 'femelle,' and then through the natural association that people made between the two (""these words are semantically related, they are both gender terms"") they began to look more similar to each other, and in English they are now 'male' and 'female'

Both words have exactly one meaningful part, and 'female' is *not* just 'male' with a prefix, even in their language of origin, not just English
Oh no their back again, the gerworman, and their gerbils...
German does have really gendered language, but they do have three genders they use in their language. (masc, fem, neuter.) The word for sausage is feminine and the word for girl is neuter and the word for airplane is masculine, and also translates literally to “flying thing”
As a German enby: This is ridiculous
""We don't speak Deutsche here. We speak Douche.""
Tbh even if this were real it’s never real lgbtq people doing this, it’s fake allies who take things too far to an unreasonable degree.
I am BEGGING native English speakers to stop trying to censor words from/about foreign languages.  This is almost as bad as latinx
Thxs lxvxl xf trxllxng xs rxxlly gxttxng xxt xf hxnd. Xdk why pxxplx xngxgx wxth xt.
I hate when people assume that a word is gendered purely because it has the letters m, a and n in that order, like there are only so many letters and so many combinations to put them in
gerwomen made me laugh more then i'd like
English speakers need to stop
So many languages are gendered. 3 that I know are Spanish Portuguese and French
“Gretchen, stop trying to make Germxn happen, it's not going to happen.”
And not just the Germen, but the Gerwomen and the Gerchildren, too.
This can't be real 💀💀💀
I am enby and german and I find this stupid as fuck.
As a german speaking enby I am uncomfortable
Next they’ll censor “man” in the word “woman”. I’m sure this was either scripted for attention or just a troll acting out. German’s are people, no gender associated with their nationality. Like the word mankind, or just the word man honestly. Technically, we all makeup mankind therefore we’re all “man” as far as being human goes.
As a German born enby this both confuses me and makes me laugh. I love all the new language that’s been popping up over the years to get Gender out of most things, but this is beyond that.
I genuinely feel like this kind of thinking is why so many people don't want to take us seriously
Oh my god this is so funny. The ignorance is potent. Just because it has the three letters m a n doesn’t make it _gendered_

People like that make it hard for the rest of us to be taken seriously
This is like how the word Manchester etymologically comes from “town on a boob shaped hill” in Celtic and Anglo-Saxon. Not everything is gendered, sometimes in linguistics you just have false cognates and words that sound similar. Also, many names have nothing to do with English, and to assume that it does is pretty stupid.
Vieleicht du kannst ""Deutsch"" sagen 🇩🇪🖤❤💛
😭😭 I'm fucking dead yall please bury me in satin, lay me down in a bed of roses and sink me in the river at dawn thank u
...or ze rezt of ze vorld kuld shust reshpekt our self-determined descriptor and call us ""deutsch"", like normal people...

/s
Wat...? The ACTUAL fuck. 🤦🏽 like this is what the right points to to dismiss us asking for respect. These people are actively hurting our ability to move people to a more open and accepting headspace by memeing themselves, and literally being the offended for no reason liberals. Sorry to the liberals here. But also move left... (; we have pie.
This seems like a troll to make us look bad honestly.
I have seen this and a similar screenshot a few times. My stance is the same as it was when I first saw it.

If I am going to support people using niche and smaller more accurate terms (Omnisexual, Polygender), then I will respect people who use the most accurate term for what they are talking about.  So censoring a descriptive word, not an insult/slur, has no place in the discourse.

Though I also might not be the best representation. My particular brain deals with ASD, and some things instand by really irk some people. Like, I don't censor quotes with slurs. It is more accurate to quote it directly and I genuinely just don't get the need to change information
Lol id never say that
Morally conflicted why? You can be nonbinary and out-of-touch with reality lol.
That’s fucking stupid. I hate that shit so much because people struggle not to misgender people anyway.
I mean, they could call it Deutsch, which is Deutschland's word for it's own language.  German is an exonym lol
I'm adding this to my mxnual of gender neutral terms to use online.
So if someone was called Roman or something, would they have to censor their own name???
What's to be morally conflicted about? Two of the people in this screenshot are so stupid they could only have gotten that way with chemical assistance, and it's hilarious.
As a German enby this the funniest thing I’ve seen all day 🤣
Can we not do this today lol.
The obvious solution here is just to call it Deutsch, like the Germans do.
So, when I started my transition I started getting into Radical Feminism (ironic, i know) and I decided that was actually proper feminism to replace all instances of ""man"" with ""woman""   
I could see myself doing this back then lmao

Now the funny thing is that the ""man"" in woman comes from the Old English word for ""person""  which is why we have it in other words as well like ""workman"". It comes from Wifman, the first part, Wif being a cognate of ""wife"" but it meant both ""wife"" and ""woman"" (as is common in Germanic languages, ""mann"" in German and ""man"" in Dutch means both ""man"" and ""husband""

You \*could\* analyze ""german"" as ""ger-person""  . . . i mean you'd be wrong but you could do it (it came from latin instead)
People who think like these folks in the screenshot have \*severe\* problems

And no, it's not just pure trolling. This being posted on reddit for discussion is trolling. The source material is the kinda shit that happens in various queer discords constantly.
honestly makes me laugh but honestly even though this is probably a joke/troll this reminds me of people trying to make “latinx” a thing and every latino person was like “??? thats not how that works please just do not”
i’m seeing this back to back on here a r/linguistichumour
Pfft most ‘inclusive’ spaces are anything but 😆 It’s purely hierarchical nonsense, and spaces that seek to aggressively censor any form of expression aren’t worth the spit it would take to hock a loogie at their owners.
🤦‍♀️
Conflicted? Im CACKLING lol what in the fuck
The nb in me ironically going to start censoring gerM*N and other ""gendered"" languages too with my inside joke friends. Cause that shit is bananas. LMAO. Thank you for sharing this.
This has to be some strawman nonsense.... right? RIGHT?
But is it okay to speak Mxndarin?
This shit is just getting too out of control for me personally
This is bait
The blue pfp is correct. German is a fine language, the rules about not speaking gendered languages is xenophobic/racist and stupid. Everyone else is being way too sensitive to the point they’re actively doing harm. How do you think the Germans in that server feel being told their native tongue is some horrible thing because of how its structured?

Edit: Wait this is all about the etymology of the English word for German? That’s even more stupidly sensitive. Not even going to address that viewpoint with an argument, its not significant enough for it.

I am a nonbinary man. The idea that words like “human” “German” “woman” would make people feel unsafe is laughable.
It does not make me feel more safe & included it makes me feel like a joke, man means human in non gendered contexts, censoring all uses of the word “man” is extremely dehumanising imo 💀
I never did understand the pushback against ""gendered language"" like who cares if I refer to them as firemen is it that serious
Why is this such a bad thing? 

At the risk of getting downvoted..... I'm just gonna say that getting upset at more ""neutral"" ways of saying words for ethnic groups of people is as dumb as people getting upset over choices of pronouns. If someone would rather be called Latinx or Germxn who are we to get upset? Obviously we know what they're talking about. It's literally not that hard to say ""okay"" and move on. Respect goes both ways. Just my 2 cents.
As a German and an enby I must say, German is an awfully gendered language. It makes sense to ban it. ;-)
This is incredibly hilarious!!
do we need to refer to humans as hupersons now too?
Why? (genuinely)
i’m not 

HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHHAAH
No, i still don't get why you'd censor German. It's a word for a language, not gendered. The ""man"" isn't gendered but I do get the policy of not using the language in of itself. It do be gendered, confusingly so for learners.
This is some of the things that ruin the acceptance of us, it’s kust a word, being offended is a personal thing i get that, but it means suffering for the vast majority of enbies
Also, can we take a sec to look at the denial of the use of German while *acting* inclusive?

""We don't exclude by genders here, only language.""

It's just silliness is what it is. Trolls and silliness.
Nah this is ridiculous
This is a very germixed up take good god
I truly can’t tell if these people are joking and it bums me out.
I am not conflicted this is just funny.
Germenby
Is it just me or is censoring words in general nowadays getting too out of hands? Everyone says we're being censored, failing to realise we're censoring ourselves. Who knew 'German' was a bad word now lol
this is latinx all over again lmfao
It’s an English word for the language as well —
Ya no, this is going overboard, German is a language, the man in German does act like the genderd variant of the word.

Like - Germany - Gerwomany.

Come on, thats just not how that works.
They’ve not know the history of the word then
Unfortunately I know for a fact that there are real people who would take that way too seriously.
As a joke this is hilarious, however I'm sure some big news company (old York clocks or something like that) is going to make a headline saying ""Millionials are canceling Germany!"".
HFNDHDBDHBD GERMXN LMAO
I wonder if their first language is english lmao, either way it must be trolling
Best part is ""German"" comes from the Roman Latin ""Germania"" and has nothing to do with the English word ""man"".
If you speak spanish, you will understand.

If not, you wont.
Humxn
This is just as strange as people who do go with cisgender stating how they think pronouns should be band forgetting “he/she” also fall under the term.
those people are chronically online
Oh no.
Me and my boyfriend are actively making fun of this
I'm trying to think of another language that they would have to censor.  
I know the poor Russians would have to change from saying ""mother land"" to the parent land.
The envy and German in me is dying of laughter rn

Edit: Germxn, apologies
Poor Germans. Their culture is being taken from them. 💔
\*laughs in spanish speaking enby\*
I disagree. Lots of communities ban foreign language speaking to make it easier to moderate. Can't decide whether to remove a post or not if you don't understand what it says, right?
It took me until ""gerperson"" to realize they meant the literal ""man"" part in the English word rather than the actual issues of arbitrarily gendered nouns and lack of an official they/them equivalent.
germixin
TIL that people come from Germxny or Gerpersony
Lmao, now I gotta recognize I'm part of the humxn race and that I think Romxn history is fascinating.
I mean, as a German, I would like Germxn to catch on: make the language gender neutral by removing ""die"" and ""der"". Only keep the neutral ""das"".
There is no reason for an apple to be male and a lamp to be female.
I mean Latinx is a thing now.
It's a troll. Most of the commenters took the troll bait though and it's quite phobic over there. Avoid reading them if you can.
I have seen plenty of similar post where trolls create fake profiles/texts etc in order to make queer people look bad and then when someone else see that they believe it's real
oh you wish, remember that this people call latinos ""Latinxs"" and as latin myself, I hate it to the core
Exactly
This could be a MechaMew situation where the entire screenshot was fabricated for just this purpose. That happens more often than you’d think.
I think this stems from well-meaning ignorance rather than an actual political stance tbh. It seems like they didn’t think it through that much.
yeah this reminded me of that radfem shit like that one super terfy music festival i can’t remember the name of.  it just feels like such a major red flag
Can radfems not be disruptive for like 1 picosecond?!
It actually doesn't, it stems from fox news acting like feminists were saying that when they weren't saying anything of the kind. Some people were spelling it womyn. That's all that happened. It's just like now! *sigh* But now it's worse!
in their defense some of these are fake but i have been in servers where ur banned if u don't censor man, woman, mom etc 😭😭 it's not a problem w the trans community though just edgy discord users
Geil
Fun fact! ""Deutsch"", when used in a phrase in conjunction with a definite article, is ""das Deutsch"". *""Das"" is the nominative singular neuter form of the definite article, which by German grammar rules means that the following noun is neuter gender.* So inherently, the word ""German"" is nonbinary ***IN ITS OWN NATIVE TONGUE***.
I was just telling a friend today that I hate the addition of x because it feels not only performative but also extremely othering. English isn't a gendered language outside of our use of pronouns and we already have a solution for that. Gendered languages are also coming up with innovative ways to accommodate changing sensibilities that actually fit the grammatical structure of their language too.

Every time someone says latinx seriously it gives me an unpleasant and physical reaction :/
Folx in particular already irritates me to no end. *Folk is already plural*. And it was never gendered to begin with.
Latinx drives me crazy. Regardless of the fact you can't pronounce the word in Spanish. I have never met another Latino who actually speaks Spanish and uses it.
Yes!!!! I hate it when people do it with potentionally triggering words, because it can actually harm people. If you really want to avoid triggering someone avoid using that word and find another expression.
[gxrl hxlp x'm pxrfxrmxtxvxly inclxsxvx](https://miro.medium.com/max/4800/0*IBqYg3kp18b7iXmt)
It took multiple readings before I even realized what was happening. My brain kept seeing German.
oh, it’s like those automatic swearword filters that replaced with synonyms regardless of how fitting it is or if it was a part of another word or not, so you can get clbuttics like buttbuttinate

some more examples are found here, even that’s not the main part of the article: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scunthorpe_problem
This is fascinating and actually feels affirming 😅 I had no idea that male and female *actually* do not have the simple relationship one might assume.
""Das Flugzeug"" (airplane) is neuter, not masculine
It’s also fake
👏🏼
🙌🏾
I’m begging people to recognize fake posts and stop blaming other people with sad Reddit chuds make shit up to cause issues

Also, Latinx was made by Latina scholars who wanted to talk about Latin culture without inherently gendering it. It was meant to be an option to use, it was never meant to replace people using Latino or Latina for themselves. That’s just how transphobes spun it and now even the non-binary subreddit is complaining about a gender neutral form of a very gendered language.
White people did NOT make Latinx, people DO find use in it, and I wish people would stop pointing their fingers at white queer folk for it
To be fair, we Germans don’t call ourselves German, so y‘all can do whatever you want with that word.
... and I am BEGGING native English speakers to stop trying to censor words.
It's so bloody stupid. It's not native English speaker's place to know about other languages and their culture. French has a heck of a lot of gendered language but it's their language and culture, not mine.
speakers need to stop
""Just making a joke bro"" trolls need to stop peddling this shit and egging on people who have zero ability to identify it as completely made-up ragebait.
And the hate trans and enby persons receive is absurd... from what I know the latin american countries get the most because of religion being so damn strong. As a brazilian, o que custa usar o pronome certo com a gente? Parem de matar pessoas LGBT+, não somos mero fetiche seu. Somos humanos como qualquer outro humano.
It likely isn't, I think this screenshot has been used as bait for quite a while, but I'm not sure, though.
and send you away with the words of a love song? xD
I only started using Latinx because all the trans Latinx folx in my community used it. Now folx are moving towards latine but some it was a thing for a good decade.
People always say ""fireman"" for the example of this and it confuses me because I've heard ""firefighters"" more often in real life than ""firemen""
Fire homo sapiens.
I think the pushback comes from issues with the patriarchy problem, that only men can hold jobs like firefighter and police officer. That women can't or shouldn't work in those professions, or work at all because it's ""not proper.""
The majority of non binary latinos I know have repeatedly requested white people to stop referring to them as LaTinx.
I see your point in Latinx but German is not a gendered word. This is how the language is called. Like there is Latina and Latino but there is no German and Gerwoman as the person in the Discord chat said. 
I don‘t know if this further validates my point but I am German and have never even thought about this word sounding gendered. 

On the other hand tho German IS a gendered language. Every goddamn noun has a gender. it is also basically impossible to get referred to by gender neutral pronouns apart from it which I don‘t feel like or neopronouns which I also can‘t identify with.
Same way my students bluff their way through first year: Google translate. 

Is that the common explanation, to draw attention away from the anglocentrism? A pleasant smokescreen to cover racism so leftists can pretend it's a good thing?
Funny you should mention that; in German, ""Deutsch"" (the word for the language), when used in a phrase in conjunction with a definite article, is ""das Deutsch"". ""Das"" is the nominative singular neuter form of the definite article, which by German grammar rules means that the following noun is neuter gender. So, inherently, the word ""German"" is nonbinary in German.
Well it looks to me the first person \*did\* mean that, and then a different cause was taken up by a different commenter.
We'll have to find a way to personage.
Germixin sounds like a medicine name LOL
germexican
germ Nixon
I get that, but I don't know that is want to use that form of the. I like telling nazis to ""the"" and your change would ruin that for me
I wonder how often when trolls pretend to be minorities or SJWs, and acting unreasonable, the people replying and sharing their comments/posts are their alt accounts or friends
For real it irritates the shit out of me that people fall for this shit.

There are issues we care about and the fact that man is in German or that Germans exist is not close to one of them.

People like this make us seem to be insane and it's fucking *annoying*
And when you try to say ""that's obviously not real"" you get dogpiled. I hate using general reddit.
Yeah, I also hate ""latinx"" because it makes no sense in the pronunciation. Most people using gender neutral language use an ""e"" in place of an ""o/a."" (ex. ""Sucie"" in place of ""Sucio/Sucia"") which I can get behind. And for the pronouns Él/Ella there's ""Elle.""
Just because the drive to use Latinx is real doesn't mean this particular comment is sincere. There are a lot of people out there with a vested interest in making us look unreasonable. I think this is likely an example of someone doing just that. Edited to add: I also hate Latinx and the trend of putting X's where they don't need to be in general.
Yeah, my money was on satire, but this is quite likely.
I would be happier if they weren’t even disruptive for a zeptosecond. (A yoctosecond could be too much to ask.)
And now in Things Duolingo Don't Teach You, actual gramatic explanation!
When I used to use twitter, I read threads that argued “folk” is derogatory because it doesn’t include nonbinary people because we apparently need our *own* word.

Shit is just a way of segregating us. Trans twitter went so far left they went in a circle and turned right.

Yeah I learned that in my historical linguistics class in college, and I agree, it does sort of seem affirming, it's nice to know that there actually is a word that really isn't based on a masculine word, they just look similar for the same reason that Americans say 'dove' as the past-tense of 'dive' (because we already say 'drive' > 'drove')
You wouldn’t believe what I experienced in my own language, though….
I didn't know latinx was made by actual Spanish speaking people.  Everyone I know who makes it gender neutral has used Latine, and has talked about how clunky Latinx looks and sounds.  But, even if the post is made up, this isn't at all out of the realm of possibilities.   I've seen people upset over less.  Spelling women ""womyn"" was very much a thing when I first was regularly online.
This point has always been so fascinating to me. They are Deutsche, from Deutschland, so why do we call them German but the Nederlanders from Nederland... Dutch
I was using firemen as an example but apparently The People have not liked that, judging by the downvotes
I get that there's a bigger discussion to be had about how and why certain terms are gendered like that, but i can't ever imagine myself butting into a casual conversation to correct ""fireman"" to ""firefighter"". (Or German to germxn, for example) like, there's a time and a place for that conversation, and calling people out mid conversation for whatever random word has ""men"" in it just... seems silly.
I hope you don't mean to say that google translate conveys things like context and nuance that can be used to harass someone who is a native speaker while seeming inocuous to the anglosphere. language is harder than that.

there is also the concept of a space made for certain groups, like Sweddit for Reddit's Swedish population. why is that idea not valid when applied to English speakers, or subsets thereof? it seems reasonable to me that a group made by English speakers has a native tongue of English. is this really something you're against? if so, why? and if not, what gives the group a duty to cater to members outside their target audience?

This confused me so much at first since personage is also a word, it refers to a person but with a focus on their character rather than their physical form

Comes from the French word 'personnage,' which refers to a character in a story or movie

-great sense of humour
-efficiency
-love of david hasselhoff

I do think some of them believe it. When it comes down to it.. It doesn't matter if they are grifters/trolls or genuine, they are toxic and harmful.
Is this screenshot from reddit? It looks like discord.

But I agree, I got dog piled on a general reddit for saying if you want to sleep with trans women please treat them like humans, not a fetish. 100 downvotes.
“That doesn’t mean it doesn’t happen!!!1!1!!” uhhhh yes it does
yeah, the E it's alot better in terms of language and respect of the structure, after all, Spanish is a very complicated language. 

even so, i not that fan of the E because the louder mayority that tend to use it do it in a ""my way or no way"" and they get so demanding to the point of being annoying rather that helpful, that ruined for me
X's aren't that bad! I'm friends with most of mine! (/pun)
Its something that makes sense if you don't speak Spanish. The ""x"" look cool on texts. But are IMPOSSIBLE to read. Same with the use of ""@"" like in ""tod@s"". It looks lovely and seems to serve the purpose until you have to read what you've written. Or someone has to use a screen reader and it gets stuck. 
That's why we started to use the ""e"" instead.
Ah yes and 'people' also only means men and women. ..... Who'd -fall- for that? T_T
Yeah, alone the Fahrspurende discussion
well, at least in chile, we *do* use latinx; its just pronounced latine because latin-ex is absolutely ridiculous
That’s a straight up TERF thing rather than some attempt to be progressive, don’t put that on progressive communities
It’s even more confusing when you know that German comes from Latin and Deutsch/Dutch from Italian
Funny thing: Pennsylvania Dutch (Amish people) aren't Dutch, they're German. Deutsch somehow turned into Dutch, and so that's where we ended up with that term here in Pennsylvania. Which all supports the argument of ""learn that your way of dpeaking/thinking is universal.""
I doubt they care about the example. They’re disagreeing with your point, which goes against most people’s ideas of how to help language evolve to a more progressive and inclusive form
Ah, well that actually makes sense then. In a casual conversation it's not a big issue, I agree. It's just a word that we're all used to saying. In the case of ""Germxn"" (or heckin ""perchild"" ""romxnian"" ""mxndarin"") though, I doubt that there are actually people who would fight that as it's not related to gender and if there are, that's a problem that they have to deal with on their own really.
Of course it doesn't translate *well*, which is why you can tell when a troll is resorting to another language to sneak something past you, vs. when someone is using a language they know. What GT CAN do is give you enough of the gist of someone's words to tell you if it's a screed of slurs. For any clown who believes they can sneak harassment past just by putting it into another language... well. It's not a secret code that obscures their bigotry, and treating it like one is an assist to them, and a racist microaggression. 

Those spaces exist because English already has a hegemony of the world and it's presumed to be the default. All those spaces have to say they use a different language because otherwise many would presume it to be English (even in absolutely nonsensical situations, i.e., there's no reason for a Swedish server to be in anything but Swedish, but they need to pointedly clarify that it's not an anglophone space, because English is that invasive). What you're saying is proof of the racism, not a refutation of it. 

Not censoring others' language isn't catering to them.  That is such a disingenuous claim that I don't know how anyone could make it sincerely. 

 It's purely an entitlement problem, where communities are expected to make everything plainly understandable for English speakers (but demanding the reverse would cause a riot, and even just pointing out that English isn't actually special and doesn't deserve its place of privilege, gets pushback, even in leftist spaces). 

#Yes, ""SPEAK ENGLISH!"" is racist.

In the time it took you to reply, you could have read those few sentences.
TL;DR: ""German"" isn't gendered in German.
I'm sorry to inform you that you did not pass the Turin test.
OMG, it's literally three sentences. 

I'm sorry, but this is a bit of a self-own.

The German word ""die"", but English
Thanks for recommending this, I just watched and enjoyed it.
It's a crosspost ;)
While I sometimes use the ""e"" declinators to refer to myself, the whole thing got way too politicized so it ends up being unsafe to use in many contexts. And I don't like ""elle"" at all because it's like I'm she/her'ing myself in French, only that I'm doing it while speaking in Spanish. I would love to have something like ze/hir or xe/xem in Spanish, but what we have instead is just too close to ""ella"" to be truly neutral.
Lol yes. Or Hähncheninnenfilet 😂😂😂

You know people who use mensch instead of man (for example „mensch kann da gut essen“ for „man kann da gut essen“)?
Agreed. Mexican-American here. Hearing “latin-ex” makes me cringe a little.
I don't know if pronunciation differs, but in the US, we pronounce the words la-teen-uh and la-teen-uh, so I've had la-teen-ex in my head whenever I read it. It made the most sense that way.

Someone on NPR said ""latin x"" the other day and I thought they butchered the pronunciation.
I didnt?  I'm not ascribing ""germxn"" to progressive communities either?   It was just an example of people getting offended about a word with gender implications that ultimately don't matter.  Like when Cardiff Metropolitan University banned terms like ""mankind"" and ""right-hand man"".  I am all for progress but pretending people never get silly with it is, well... silly
I'm not saying ""speak English"". I'm saying language gating is a tool communities have, no matter their native tongue. As a generalisation of the right of non-English speaking communities to enforce their community specific rules to speak the community's native tongue, it seems sensible to me to say it's OK in general. It is the opposite of English exceptionalism. Yes, I think English is a language like any other. That's the point.

I aim not to be racist, so I'd like to know what in this view checks that box for you.

la-teen-ex is still wrong; the problem is the x part, i was just typing it out the ""spanish"" way and it got lost in translation
>Like when Cardiff Metropolitan University banned terms like ""mankind"" and ""right-hand man""

Every article I've seen of that has the words ""banned"", ""censored"", ""suggested"", ""advised"". Guess which of those words make it to the headline, and guess how much evidence I can find for those policies actually being made into the rulebooks. Like all the other fringe claims about this shit, it was clickbait nonsense meant to paint an entire movement as being ridiculous because some goomba-brained schoolboard had an out-of-touch conversation that made it onto nightly news and reddit headlines.
> language gating is a tool  

Yeah, most people who gatekeep think it's useful. It typically, is, for their agenda. 

If you're going to keep doubling down, you'll be better off in a space that matches your values and enjoys racial, ethnic, or linguistic discrimination. This is not the place for racist apologia. .... *Duh.*
I had no idea it was a Simpsons reference xD
Don’t join certain bubbles on Instagram then. I had a hard time escaping and, I must admit, i did it for a while as well, before i figured it’s just nonsense.
Thank you for your patience. I realise in retrospect I was being stupid, advocating for a controversial position I'm unsure about in the entirely wrong context. that word discrimination is one I understand, and it got me thinking. I'll keep doing that in private while you use your time for more useful things. sorry for being a nuisance and for threatening the peace of this community.

I still can't say I entirely understand what you were saying, as a matter of full disclosure. I'm not asking you to explain further. just providing mission-relevant information.

This is a pretty good take on the traditional binary gender		"Comments yikes
I mean... yeah. Lesbians love power tools
I Dunno, Seems Less Accurate, I Was Apparently Born Under The Sign Of The Monkey In The Chinese Zodiac, And I'd Love To Live In A Tree, Have A Tail, And Commit Petty Crimes.
I’m here for this take and I also very much regret clicking on the original post.
Lol this is gonna get a lot of ppl who believe in astrology fired up
i appreciate the joke but i'm sure i'm not the only one here who puts more weight in the accuracy of my astrological chart than my agab. lol
yeah, both are equally dumb and baseless
Great take
Not sure about big and strong, but I absolutely have a natural affinity with powertools
And oddly, because of how broadly unspecific horoscopes are, they're probably more accurate
Funny how it's the same community which is both regularily trashing on AMAB ""enbies"", and at the same time pretending they don't care and that AGAB is meaningless.
That's not how astrology works but I get the joke
Just as nonsensical as astrology too
But I think posts like this are confusing because being nonbinary isn’t the same as being gender non-conforming.
Yeah, anyone who hasn’t gone on the original post: do NOT. It’s filled with transphobic comments :/
Can confirm, power tools are the best thing since sliced bread.
Well, sure, but EVERYONE wants that! …right???
I was born under the sign of the horse but I'm pretty terrible at horsing around. After all my girlfriend can't ride me that well. I'm not a very good transportation device XD.
I am reminded daily of how much of a cesspool reddit (and really the whole internet) is
I think both are fine as long as people choose if they want to be defined by them.
Where is this trashing!?!?
I'm not sure I understand what you're saying
It's also not how gender assignment works lol
There is no way in which astrology works. It’s a nice little hobby with no relevance to reality.
Well now I'm wondering what a gender-conforming enby would be like. Name yourself after nature nouns? Roll up the sleeves on your dress shirts? Loud, colorful fashion sense maybe
I don't know, but the description definitely applies to me a hundred percent lol
Fair Point. ~~But They Weren't All Born In The Year Of The Monkey, So I Can Flex On Them.~~
One of the other options is dragon. I'd rather sit on my hoard of gold than eat bananas.
Astrology is a multi billion dollar industry built on the idea of selling people snake oil
I saw several comments here recently claiming that AMAB enbies were privileged, or even oppressors, and I was pretty surprised (I even made a post calling this out)
this post is criticizing how cis people emphasize the binary and think things like interests or physical strength are inherently tied to your birth sex. (ex. it’s stupid that having a penis would inherently mean you like power tools)

what this person is pointing out is that within nonbinary communities, people still construct false binaries around sex. for example, people trash amab enbies and make all sorts of assumptions and binary statements about them. i’ve even seen some people say amab people can’t be nonbinary

hope that helps explain it!
Maybe for you, but some people feel it different from you so...
That's not entirely true. It is possible to make extremely broad statements that apply to virtually everyone based on the stars, and as long as you're consistent with who you tell what, it could be described as astrology being accurate.
Fair. But if someone wants to practice (especially if they are careful to avoid the people who overcharge them) and it helps them deal with the anxiety of the world then I don't want to take that away from them. Its 100% not my thing, I never found it to make sense for me and I know there isn't evidence for it so I've never been into it. I'm also an atheist who just doesn't want to do any religion again or have others telling me who I am.

I just would guess that it would be the industry which is toxic not the practice itself. If that makes sense. I don't know much about the astrology industry but I have a issue with those that use spirituality and religion to take advantage of vulnerable people because I grew up Evangelical. At least as far as I know astrology doesn't demand 10% of your income and call you a sinner.
So is gender
I mean by not coming out and throwing in a touch of that magical whiteness I avoid traffic tickets and fool the Walmart greeter from checking my groceries (which I do pay for...) but it's still super annoying that I'll never actually fit into society as who I'd like to be. Obviously I'd much rather give up my privilege.. it's them, not me.
If you have a male body (or pass as a male) you benefit from male privilege whatever you realize or not. Just like for example light skinned POC who pass as white can benefit from white privilege.
[deleted]
Oh yeah I get it now. I have seen some of that stuff happen in the community. 

Btw fuck whoever downvoted my comment I was genuinely trying to understand what the person was saying.
You can’t feel science pal. Facts literally do not care about your feelings.
Other things being worse doesn't make it fine
Uh. No? Gender is a socially constructed class that people are assigned based off their physical appearance at birth. I don't think you know what snake oil is.
And what if you don't pass as male anymore? What then?
This is crazy, does that mean that as 5'2 110lbs AMAB nonbinary I can come out in a South American transphobic country and be fine because of my ""male privilege""?

I hadn't seen AMAB excluding people here before, I guess not even this is a safespace anymore
1/ Not all AMAB people can choose to present as male ""out of convenience"", and if you think about it for a second this is extremely transphobic to say

2/ Your leap of logic is basically that AMAB enbies are basically men in terms of behaviour, which again is insanely transphobic

3/ How tf is it okay that most nonbinary spaces today are ""safe spaces"" excluding AMABs? Like, aren't these nonbinary too?
Ah I see you're a bigot, good luck with that
hello ben shapiro
If anything, astrology is more of a spiritual practice than a pseudoscience. Let people like things, ffs.
let people be thats all theyre saying
Downvoted for being right as usual
I think in a binary world people are likely to put you into a binary folder. If you don’t pass as afab you are likely still seen as male, or at least more than a female person. ( think walking alone at night…if you are taller, broader shoulders, not wearing heels/dress, you are going to get more assumed agency and less harassment most likely)
That's not what the concept of social privileges has implied, ever
:((( I'm not even amab and seeing this shit totally sucks
Ah, the good old ""women and people we consider women"". Gag me with a spoon.
Also pay close attention to how they will always bring up male and female socialization but never once hear them talk about their white or middle class socialization in nearly the same way.
Agreed! (And sorry for beating the dead horse, but I've been away for the day, and this part of the comment section is making me so sad)

Even for nonbinary AMABs who *can* choose to present as male, they absolutely *have* to present as male if they want the privilege of not getting beat up after a night out. After all, you are much more likely to be assaulted if you are AMAB and presenting femme than if you're a cis woman.

So yeah, some AMABs can choose to not present as their true self to protect themselves. But come on that's not a privilege

I ask, what is the difference between saying to an AMAB NB that they can just present as male if they don't want to be assaulted... and telling a cis woman that she should wear less revealing clothes if she wants to prevent getting raped?
Lmao you’re calling an anarchist vegan a bigot. I believe everyone should live their lives as it pleases them and to accept everyone as they want to be accepted. 

But that doesn’t change the fact that astrology is some grade A bullshit and a billion dollar industry praying on the uneducated, like any other religion.
Ew
If you’d read the whole comments chain you’d have seen that that’s exactly what I’m saying. Believe what you will, but don’t pretend it’s scientific.
I let people be when they're not participating in something anti intellectual.
>( think walking alone at night…if you are taller, broader shoulders, not wearing heels/dress, you are going to get more assumed agency and less harassment most likely)

Here again y'all generalizing the fact that all AMAB ""menbies"" (since that's the new terms y'all have for us, which is transphobic as fuck) are male-passing or dress like men (and not thinking one second that some of those might dress as men out of safety, specifically to not be targeted/killed by people seeing those as predators)
Yeah all I'm hearing in their argument is ""dont wear dresses and you wont get assaulted"" like... ??

Enby doesnt mean fem appearing. It doesnt mean pretty boy could be a girl. It doesnt mean girl-passing. It doesnt mean androgynous. 

It *includes* all of these things, but isnt limited to them.

It means non binary. 

Which includes anyone who wants to use it.
Well, you obviously only know about that kind of TV astrology and it shows... As you said, respect others, even more when you don't really know about a subject! 

Also, hello fellow vegan. But being vegan doesn't take away being being a bigot in other ambits. Be open with what others consider a source of interest.
So, like any other religion, the capitalist organizing of it is the problem, not the individual practitioners. Get ur anarchist vegan head out ur arse
Right?
Yup, at this point i'm definitely Afab-passing.
Actually if you’re a bigoted vegan, you’re not vegan. Veganism is total liberation. 

I should add that I want you to believe whatever makes you happy. If astrology does that for you then I am all for it! But that doesn’t change the fact that it’s wildly unscientific.
Yes, that’s what I’m saying. And the fact that they present it as scientific. WHICH IT IS NOT.
Cool, 🤟🏽
No one's talking about science tho! I don't really read horoscopes and be like ""today's gonna be shit, sorry taurus"" Lol 

I don't ""believe"" in it, and I think believing in it blindly is actually very harmful and I've met people who didn't want to talk to me just because of my signs, which is like... Weird. I didn't choose them right? Astrology is not static, is actually constantly changing as it's just another souce of knowledge. Cosmic position doesn't really matter in the end because we're every sign, because we constantly mutate, and that is something astrology has in knowledge, you have to mutate in order to grow, not just in this matter. Astrology is actually very trans tbh, the way I see it.

I hope I explained it a bit. I actually know just a little about it but I definitely prefer other types of knowledge, just found it really interesting once I got passed the idea that I had before, close to yours. Which is normal too. It actually helped me recognize some stuff I thought was just in my imagination, pretty wild, but that's just my intense ass lol

Just know stars/planets are not telling you who you are at all, they just guide you in the process, or not!

Sorry about the info dumping, you maybe don't care 😅

I have a soft face. And traditionally feminine shaped face especially my jawline, cheekbones, and eyebrows. Although my eyebrows are kinda straight with with a slight angle on the outside. I usually make them dark and thick with makeup. My nose is small and slightly pointy. I have small shoulders. I’m curvy/ small thicc. 5”3, maybe 5”4. Umm...

anyone else struggled with wearing anything remotely smart that fits their gender presentation? I always find dressing up kinda daunting because most formalwear is so gendered, but this was my attempt at dressing up for a fancy dinner the other day 👻		"Looks great! Depending on the context you might have to drop the chain/belt, like if you’re going to an interview for a job. But I think you’d be fine at a wedding as a guest.

I’ve heard people recommend jumpsuits as a good formal wear option for enbies and I’ve been meaning to try it out.
Nice! Really dig the hair! Makes me miss my neon pink hair~
thats a rly beautiful shirt!! i get the struggle i do similar things, although i tend to geberal suit ensemble (i recommend looking for some nice vests)
Yes, i made and then deleted a post about it bc I’m not out yet and mostly dress as my assigned gender to blend in bc i live in a mostly unaccepting conservative small town and i have super religious family. I’d love to figure out more femme clothing that fits me but I also have dysphoria about my body hair and have been thinking about laser hair removal for some time now but idk

Oh and *you look gorgeous btw*
Omg you look handsome babe!!
I had to go to a wedding recently and I hated every single outfit I tried. Felt shit about myself all day. 

Love this outfit on you - I've also just bought some trousers with a similar pattern, so maybe I can wear them to somewhere smart in the future
That's a great outfit, especially with the jacket! I hope you had a blast at the fancy dinner!
Drippy
Cute
Heya friend, i adore this picture, but im stuck on tge shirt. Any chance to get a link for it?
Hard to be formal with colored hair to be honest. It just gives off a certain vibe. I’ve got indigo hair and no matter what I wear I’m almost not quite business-y enough. Fortunately I have a good boss who doesn’t care.
Look’s so awesome 😻🥰
You’re rocking that outfit 😁 I don’t really have any chances to go to more formal events so I haven’t faced that particular struggle so far (though I do struggle of casual-formal wear for interviews and such)
You look fantastic! 

I feel the opposite. I struggle a lot with casual wear but shine with formal wear. I’ve personally felt like it’s easier to blend masculine and feminine when I have to wear nice clothing
Wow 😍
This look is 🔥🔥
love ur style and hair!
holy shit you're so pretty,, gender envy

,, also, any places where someone could buy the clothes you're wearing?
It matters on how formal the dinner is. Honestly, I would wear the same thing.
Gorgeous!
I love your outfit!
Yeah I know exactly what you're talking about. But you did an amazing job without outfit it looks amazing
You're SO cute this looks really nice!
Very nice outfit!
Looking good friend!
This is the style I always want to do on a good day and then I forget and go with my standard athletic wear or for formal in this case, a sweater.
you look so cool!
I love it! I think you nailed it pretty well given that yes most formal clothing is hella gendered, but you worked some magic! 

I fuckin adore that button up btw 😍
GIVE ME THOSE CLOTHES
You look fucken excellent dawg
Fucking slaying
I mean, yeah you look great, but my mind is ALL about that shirt! So f***ing cool!
Really nice outfit!

'Dressing up' can be done by buying high-quality fabrics. I've got a few very comfortable and non-gendered items that look fancy just because they're made with great fabric.
damn, your aesthetic is so cool!! nice semi-formal outfit :)
You look amazing! I equate effort and distinct style with formal/dressy. Formalwear is a dress code for the patriarchy and I’d rather see beautiful people fuck with convention.
Ah yes, the Vi look. So cool!
Your attractive
ok but you look fuckin gorgeous as hell, i love that look real bad
I simply dont dress ""classy"" and just wear a hoodie and techwear pants everywhere lol
At a formal setting you’d absolutely have to drop the chain and swap the belt for a more suitable one. Same with the necklace; i’m not trying to be a dick, I love the goth daddy/mommy vibes, but formal is formal. You could go bolo tie for accessories.
Jumpsuits are the best for formal events! And if you’re too tall for most women's clothing like I am getting mens wide leg pants and a button down in the same color with a belt to cinch it at the waist can create a jumpsuit vibe pretty well too. Heels/jewelry from there as desired!
I always struggle with this. I still love skirts/dresses but struggle with wanting to wear them out of fear of being misgendered.
There’s a reason why my go-to outfit is a black turtleneck with black jeans or dress pants and a black sweater or blazer 🥲
That outfit looks absolutely stunning! Honestly I don’t wear formalwear very much i don’t have much reason to but as an afab enby who is about the same clothes size as my mum, i have a lot of dresses from her but honestly I would kill someone for a suit 😫
I struggle with this way too often
Like everyone’s dream on here, I can’t tell if you’re afab or amab. Love the outfit 🤩
Formal women's blouses and blazers are a nightmare when you have wide shoulders. Anything big enough ends up looking like a huge bag.
I don't bother. It it's formal attire required then I'm not going.
Where'd you get those pants?
Love it!
would you mind sharing sources?
You look awesome!! Love the fit
looks good! i have the same problem
Cool necklace! Where did you get it / did you make it?
Honestly if I ever found a situation to wear formal wear I would just fuck up traditional formal wear with the top part of a suit and a long skirt. Then prob a bow tie and fem hair like pigtails or smthn. Porque no los dos?
Where did you get that shirt
Yeah this is definitely more of a smart casual vibe but I think with a few changes it could work for a more formal setting !
If you're nervous about posting pictures of style (legit), one alternative is to gauge how comfortable you'd be just posting the outfit on a hangar/spread out on the bed. That still carries some risk, but it's much lower. (Discord servers have less visibility, too.) Good luck!
I had laser hair removal on my face and it’s done WONDERS for my dysphoria, it’s one of the best decisions I’ve ever made!
I got the shirt from an independent seller at a con! I’ll see if I can remember what they were called and find their socials
And also the pink hair is awesome!
ahhh thank you! I gotta do a Vi cosplay one day bc I get that a lot
thank you !! 🖤🖤
bolo tie is an excellent call! I have one somewhere with a wolf on that I should dig out

Gendered language being gendered language		"I met a non-binary friend who lives in Argentina, they usually just use ""-e"" as a suffix instead of ""-o"" or ""-a"", like amigue instead of amigo, hermane instead of hermana, etc. Not sure how widespread that is, but they didn't seem to think it was uncommon.

Edit: they also use ""elle"" as a pronoun instead of el or ella
por eso hay que decir nobinarie, con E, independientemente de lo que diga la dracaica rae
As a Brazilian, gendered language sucks!

Even simply saying ""thank you"" usually requires you to use a gendered word. Makes things incredibly more complicated...
I love saying yo soy no-binarie :)
I'm Hispanic and I hate this, you can use ""no binarie"" which is neutral but most people will look at you weird for doing it and some will give you so much shit it's not even worth it if you're not in a safe area
Spanish considers chairs feminine, so it's probably less offensive than if English attempted something similar. Still, I'm entirely in favor of adding explicitly gender-neutral forms to Spanish.
LatinE here! I use “elle” as my pronouns in spanish and -e for gendered words that refer to me! You shouldn’t try and neutralize words that don’t refer to you in conversation since changing the last letter of objects can change the word entirely lmao but when referring to people or myself i use -e!
“her pronouns are they/them!”
I always liked how German has a ""neuter"" pronoun for a word that does not have a feminine or masculine association.
same thing in polish  
niebinarny  
niebinarna
I say no binarie
thats why i hate my own tongue
We're trying to add ə in Italian for this reason
[deleted]
for those who don’t speak spanish,
in spanish, -o is both masculine and neutral.
if you have a group of mixed gender, you still use “ellos” (they, plural)

i heard most latino people don’t like latinx, but i think most non-binary people use some form of  -e

i’m nb and i use -o

yes, it’s annoying, but that’s how the language is structured. and yes, spanish can be confusing.
example: el vestido (dress), la carne (meat), el mapa (map)

(source: spanish learner for two years (planning to be bilingual), however if anyone wants real sources i will find some for you!! <3)
also if i’m wrong about any of this please correct me i dont want to be embarrassing on the internet 😭
We do have the same problem in Italian as well. People usually defaults to the male variant, because we don't have a neutral way to say it (aside from omitting the last vowel)
La RAE puede decir lo que le dé la gana, yo soy no binarie.

Y elles apestan a neftalina.
I am from a spanish speaking country, were everything is gendered. The most common argument that literate people use to stay with the current way of speaking (-o for male, -a for female) is that aside from ""destroying the language"" is that -o is actually neutral. It could have been, and still be like that on the dictionary, but to the common of the people, if you use anything ending in ""-o"" people asume you are referring to a male! So that argument sucks
When Identifying Yourself (Or Others) You Could Probably Avoid It By Saying For Example ""Persona No-Binaria"" (I Think That's Correct, Atleast), As The Word For ""Person"" Is Grammatically Feminine, Not Sure About Other Contexts Though.
Polish is sadly the same (Nie binarna-fem; Nie binarny- masc; ofc no neutral form)
But..but...it defeats the purpose to gender the non binary.. I don't understand gendered language
Meh. The discourse around gendered languages is always from a position of either non-speakers incensed that a language has gendered conjugates (like Greek as well) or academic circles.

Latinx is garbage and cumbersome to say as 'latinequis' when speaking Spanish and I much prefer 'Latines' to the word 'latinx' as 'latinx' comes from primarily English-speaking academia and doesn't conjugate easily at all hence the backlash by native Spanish speakers.

If you aren't a native Spanish speaker or you don't speak another language with gendered conjugates, it's not your place to give commentary on this at all, as this issue is a lot more complex than just simply changing words.

Speaking as a native Spanish speaker who learned English as a second language.
Gemdered language is so stupid. Why is a table female?
Just completely drop the a or the o. Then it's not gendered anymore, problem solved.
(I'm not exactly good at Spanish so I'm not sure if this would cause potential problems, if it does I would love to hear why).
The funny thing is that non-binary is one of the few labels in the LGBTQAI+ community that is gendered in Spanish :''''''''''''''')
Im brazilian and my language is also gendered. And since im a feminine nb i just use feminine pronouns. It aint that big of a deal
Spanish sucks
Spanis : *""Non-binarity have gender""*
NB comunity : *""NOOO^OOO^OOO^...""*
Yeahhhh no. I have a screenshot somewhere of ""his and hers nonbinary flag shirts"".
It depends on who is speaking. So if a man or someone masc presenting was referring to someone who was non-binary it would be no- binario
Facepalm
German has one word for friend and it’s feminine. A (also nonbinary) friend was super apologetic about it (as if they can control their entire language) and asked if that was okay or if I wanted to discuss a possible alternative. They explained that they always, when speaking about me to people in German (like their parents, friend was living in UK at the time) that they only used my name instead of any pronouns and their parents were like “…” I’m fine with it but they and I have had more than one conversation, especially since one of my special interests is linguistics and they have a degree in it) about how ridiculous it is that as much as languages have evolved there are so many that are specifically gendered. (eg. “chair” is masculine in German and feminine in Spanish! wth!)
Yup, that's spanish for ya (south america sucks for enby people istg ;\_;)
Makes so much sense
I’ll be spending the next two months in Mexico for a study abroad and ngl I’m a little apprehensive of all the gendered language but I’m trying not to let it get to me too much and just know I’ll come back and reinforce pronouns again
Jesu Cristo did those colonizers really have to gender everything? My native language has gender neutral pronouns, but yeah the Spanish loan adjectives are almost always in the masculine (cariñoso, tonto, etc.)
I use e insta of o or a
no bini
It's odd but also kinda cool if you're leaning either direction.
As a Spanish person, we usually finish with an -e or -o for non-binary, I've never heard no binaria, like masculine terminations in Spanish also work as neutral
At least they gave you the option between the two
This is a big reason I struggle with identifying as nb and why I'm not out to almost anyone. Imagine everyone's main way of expressing and communicating around you is gendered and you just don't want that.. Nonbinary is already a ridiculous enough concept to some people and now we're forced to change our language for that. I personally don't even mind being gendered all that much because of it, but the fact that people do makes associating with the term so much harder.
No binarie :D
I've had a good chuckle about this the other day. I'm not a native speaker, I'm still learning, and the other day I was chatting with a Spaniard. Sometimes I'm just not sure if I'm actually speaking Spanish or just bastardising French/English, so I looked up non-binary in Spanish. We had a good laugh about the irony of it.

Unfortunately, according to them, using -e as a gender neutral ending isn't widely accepted outside of the community (at least in Spain)...
I'm neither assholes
I’m in high school and take Spanish, and my teacher teaches us to use this e suffix for non-binary people and she generally uses it when referring to groups of people
I love elle!!
Yeah, the thing is that most of the people make fun of it..
Same! I identify as latine as well. It's pretty popular in online latinx/queer spaces and it's becoming increasingly popular in person. I have a couple friends who use elle as well. Super technically latinx is pronounced ""latine"" (la-ti-neh) anyhow since latinx in Spanish is said like ""latin-equis"" and ""latine"" is short for that.

Edit: typos
Latine sounds a heck of a lot batter than Latinx. Also from what I understand, many Latinos/Latinas/Latines don't like it, and I can understand why, seeing as the language is an important part of their culture. I often wonder how NB Latine people feel, though. I know it's different for everyone, but it's like I only ever see everyone but them using it/discussing it
I'm argentinian too! I don't know on Wich part your friend lives, but it is sometimes teaches in schools... But it's not really common- usually people will start mocking you if you use '-e' 

I usually just switch between él and ella, if it's not a safe space y'know
so like no binarie?
At least it's not that colonizing Latinx bullshit.
I’d say most people know about it by now, but not a lot of people use it. It doesn’t help that the official linguistic academies are very conservative and don’t accept it.

In Spanish, the plural is also gendered, and the generic plural is the masculine form. Many feminists said this invisibilized women and started using the feminine form as the generic plural before -e was introduced fore more inclusivity. Some people started using both forms together, as in “todos y todas” instead of just “todos” or just “todas”. That’s the most widely accepted version and even that is rejected by the linguistic academies lmao. They insist on masculine generic plural.

Anyway, you can imagine how they feel about -e. Not a lot of people use it openly and those who do usually get made fun of outside of queer circles.
¡Sí!  Por fin una persona con sentido común por aquí, pensé que solo iba a tener que ver gringues hablando de cosas que no entienden.  ¡Gracias!

Real, siempre me frustra que la gente diga que no usan la e por la gramática y que la RAE no lo acepta pero luego van y no saben discernir entre ""ay"" , ""ahí"" y ""hay"" . Yo no me voy a burlar por eso porque yo también hablo mal a veces y uno no sabe el contexto de cada persona , pero entonces no tiene sentido que se excusen con eso

I think the funniest example is clothes: dress is a masculine word, t-shirt is a femenine word. The gender of the word really has no meaning outside grammar in nouns.

The entire language is gendered for... reasons, down to nouns.
Better up: languages that aren't gendered at all, unless explictably talking about gender but even then also have a gender neutral variant.
The same as in english. I am not sure how many people want to be called 'it' though.
The combat sport I've been involved with uses Italian as the official language. I was really excited when we officially changed the verbiage for declaring the winner of a fight from ""vincitrice/vincitore” to ""vince"" for the express purpose of being gender-neutral
Pro tip: who cares about ""official usage""? Is the speakers who create the language they speak. Official usage is merely a record of how speakers use such language.
Native Spanish speaker here.

Although you are grammatically correct, truth is the -o thing is due to the evolution of the language from Latin. Masculine words in Latin usually ended in -us, and neutral words in -um. So a few centuries later, all became -o.

However, non-binary speakers like myself have been advocating for years for the use of ""elle"" as our pronoun and to end gendered words with -e. Like: le chique bonite.

RAE says we are destroying the language and all that jazz, but speakers create the language, so grammar should never be above people's lives.
Hi, I'm latina, Spanish native speaker (I've lived in Uruguay my whole life) and in my experience in a lot of queer spaces, online and irl (and in feminist spaces too) we use what is called ""lenguaje inclusivo / neutro"" ( inclusive / neutral language), which entails ending gendered words in ""e"" (e.g. amigues, niñes, todes..) and from what I've seen in online spaces a lot of nonbinary folks use the pronoun ""elle"" which is sort of a neutral equivalent to ""they"".
It's commonly thought that it comes from anglo-white academia, but that's just not true. Latinx came from queer chicanx spaces and is based on the use of -x in Nahuatl. People irl would say latine as a shortened form of latin-equis anyhow but was simply anglicized by anglo-white academia when said outloud.
Idk I think that’s an over generalization. There’s a lot of native speakers in the USA that want Latinx used - I encounter them more than the academic crowd or non-native speakers. I volunteer at a program that is run by native Spanish speakers to teach first generation kids reading skills and the native speakers want us using the word Latinx. I have a number of friends who are immigrants from South America or children of immigrants from SA who specifically asked me to used Latinx.

I agree this is not my place to give an opinion either way. I generally just use whatever word I am asked to use.
Tables aren’t actually considered female. Grammatical gender in Spanish is divided between conceptual (inanimate objects/abstract concepts) and natural/social (animals and humans, respectively). So a table being assigned a feminine conceptual gender doesn’t mean people see it as having feminine traits. It just serves as a function to organize and refer back to information
it would cause troubles. lots of words would become unpronounceable
all nouns have grammatical gender in spanish.
But you know what else sucks?

Thinking English is the only valid language. Go touch some grass
el ingles es mucho peor
Do you mean Freundin? There is a masculine version too that is actually the standard version. I personally am more annoyed by the fact that we don't have separate words for friend and boy-/girlfriend so it becomes a bit confusing pretty fast.
It's nice that language is starting to evolve and be more inclusive
Woow that's awesome!! I'm genuinely glad to hear that
it's so shitty. people make fun of singular ""they"" too, even though it's been in english for centuries (and most native speakers use it!). I think they just make fun of us because they want to make fun of us. I recently visited a bunch of friends of mine in tamaulipas and they were really cool about it, but everyone else (strangers) were not. it surprised my friends because they're all cis men. I don't think they realized how much vitriol we face
si, es una cagada
I see a lot of conflicting opinions from latine folks about using the term latinx, many of them saying that those of us who are not should not even be using the term. Many of those people I’ve seen upset about this are queer or non-binary or otherwise non-conforming and still advocate for latine and latin over latinx. I even often see people advocate for latino over latinx without mentioning latine and these are queer people, not cishet queerphobes. Is the most correct, accurate, and safe term for me to use latine then? Or should I predominately ask the person what they use? What if I can’t ask or don’t know?
how being latino is something you identify as?
That’s bcuz non Spanish speakers came up with Latinx. Native speakers use Latine and loathe hearing “Latin-X”
jodeme que sos de argentina!!
yup!
That's super interesting, thanks! 

We have a very similar situation with French (super conservative academy, feminists against masculine form as generic plural, most people saying 'tous et toutes""). 

We don't have any equivalent for your -e. Instead, we use the middle dot · when we write stuff like ""tous·tes"" instead of ""tous et toutes"", and it's now widely used, even by official administrations and the press. For most people, this is just a writing trick, but some of us feminists and queers also say ""toustes"" orally, and this is not really mocked.
RE. idem lol. el lenguaje inclusive es lo más
exacto. es parecido al ingles donde la gente rehusa el they/them cuando en realidad es la manera correcta de decirlo.

>Apoyo la poderosisima -e 🛐

tambien amo la misteriosa X. tanto para poner el genero en el dni, o para reemplazar la E. solo funciona en la palabra escrita, pero se ve re copado
por otra parte, que placer encontrar más hispanohablantes acá!
La RAE no lo acepta por fachas. Usan excusas de mierda como que el sistema morfológico del español no acepta la e, cuando sí lo hace porque sino no se podría decir en voz alta. Ni siquiera aceptan decir “todos y todas”, insisten en el masculino genérico. Ahí está el nivel.

De todas formas, la RAE tiene que ser descriptiva, no prescriptiva, por definición. ¡Elles mismes lo dicen! Metieron “almóndiga” en el diccionario por esa razón en lugar de insistir en el uso de “albóndiga”. No aceptan -e por transfobia y punto, sus argumentos no se aguantan.
Totalmente. Es una cosa que llevo pensando últimamente, que decir “el profesorado” o “las personas” como forma inclusiva no deja de tener género. No hace alusión al género de las personas en cuestión, pero igualmente refleja esa necesidad de clasificar absolutamente todo como femenino o masculino. ¡Así que usemos -e en todes les palabres, sí señore!
Esaaaa!!  the rae should BURN!!!  it's a company that sells dictionaries, never forget that.

E tbm estou morando no Canadá, o que acaba ajudando pelo inglês.

Gracias pelos comentários tbm! E não conhecia esse r/suddenlycaralho, vou passar a seguir.
It’s awful as a native Spanish speaker, because you start using -e to refer to yourself and to refer to groups of diverse gender identities to be inclusive, but then you realize even gender-neutral words are gendered? Like, I want to say “el alumnado” so as to not specify “alumnos y alumnas” and to say something more socially acceptable than “alumnes” but it’s still a gendered word? And then even in just saying “esta palabra tiene género también” you’re already putting gender in “palabra” and “género”???? We’re gonna have to put -e in everything :(

Kinda wrong tho, it means ""wins"".

""Vincente"" would be better
And who makes such records (id est dictionaries)... EXACTLY. Straight cisgender men who quite probably are conservatives too (and transphobic mysogynistic pieces of poop) .  :P
The rae (please don't capitalize their name.. ughhhh XD) are prescriptivists of language, meaning that they think language ought to be used following the rules, however language changes constantly because it is alive, we all make it and use it in ways that are not contemplated by any rules or registered by dictionaries. Societies change and so does language along with them. 😁 But obviously conservatives are oblivious to all this.
omg thank you that is super helpful /gen
go and destroy language!!!!
There is an understanding that using the words ending in -o as a neutral forma in the Spanish language to refer to groups of people do create a form of erasure of women and nonbinary folks, and makes it so that the focus is always on the men in a group. (e.g. if there's a classroom where all the 30 students are women people will refer to the group in feminine (""ellas"", ""todas"", ""alumnas""...)  If only ONE (1) man joins that group, they suddenly are referred to in ""neutral"" plural ways (""ellos"", ""todos"", ""alumnos""), which is also the plural male. The very presence of women have been invisibilized for too long and inclusive / neutral language seeks to change this, there has been some agreement between feminist and queers that ending gendered words in ""e"" is one of the ways to refer to groups of people without invisibilizing women or nonbinary folks.
yes thank you sm that is very helpful!! /gen
¿Y el conjugado plural de latinequis es latinequis o latinequises?

Latines es mas facil a conjugar y tambien explicar le a gente aprendiendo la idioma.
no es lo mismo para la gente que vive en lugares de habla inglesa como usa y lugares de habla hispana como, bueno, tantos otros países. la única gente que vi usar latinx es gente de usa, a la que le afecta *muchísimo* menos la generificacion del español que en los ya dichos países de habla hispana. por supuesto, que cada quien use la palabra que quiera, y eso hay que respetarlo
I do speak spanish, i know 😂 im just saying it's still stupid.
I see. Makes sense.
I'm talking about adjectives which are the type of word labels are. Almost every of them are gendered but the ones in the LGBTQ+ community are not like gay, and every sexuality that ends with -sexual. Except for a few exceptions like non-binary :')

When I say they aren't gendered I mean that there is no distinction between the feminine form and the masculine one.
Okay I got it my bad just don't hit me
They told me that (maybe just in their dialect? I don’t know how much that’s a thing there) the male one was the same word as a romantic boyfriend. Maybe I have that backwards. It was several years ago.
It really is! It’s wonderful to see. Thank you for pointing that out.
It is. Meanwhile in Germany some people are trying to change the language and get hated on my boomers and similar groups..
It seems to me that a lot of misgivings toward the word latinx comes from the notion that it's from Anglo/White academia and not from the Latino community, but as [I mentioned in a previous comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/NonBinary/comments/10azsi8/gendered_language_being_gendered_language/j49blid?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share&context=3), that's false. There's still issues since the x is based on nahuatl and that's more mexico-centric, and accessibility-wise, screenreaders don't register it very well. Language evolves and changes to meet the needs of people. What I do is I call individuals what they prefer, so asking is good, or I listen to how they describe themselves and follow suit. When I refer to the larger population, I say the Latino community or la comunidad latina, and when I'm specifically talking about queer/nonbinary spaces, I say latinx/latine. Others do it differently, like refering to the wider community as latines/latinxs to normalize it. If you can't ask someone what they prefer, depending on what language you're speaking, you can try not using pronouns/gendered language. In Spanish, it can be harder, but using verbs and alternative phrases can help with that.
Etnicites and racial categories dont really overlap that well. You can be a latina from Mexico or a latina from spain. Only one of those would be classified as a racial group. it gets even weirder when you start adding in geographical categories like ""latin america"". You can live in Brazil (latin america), have a latina etnicity and not be counted as the latina racial category due to you comming from Europe.
latine is the word I use to describe my ethnicity in a gender neutral way. I could use ""hispanic"" or ""chicanx"" or simply say I'm Mexican/Puerto Rican, but I prefer latine.
From what I understand, latine people in Puerto Rico came up with latinx to refer to themselves, in english. I'm mexican, and I can tell most people that hate the term ""latinx"" hate it because of transphobia. I am not a fan of it either because it's hard to pronounce, but the people that *loathe* it usually hate 'latine' as well even tho that's the word queer Spanish speakers chose for themselves, because they get angry at any proposed change in language to accommodate queer people. Very few people use -e pronouns because of how much ridicule and humiliation it gets them.
That's what I've heard
JSKAJSJ sí soy, lpm, q ganas de salir e un país tercermundista (?)
Ah yeah, that also exists in Spanish but with /, as in “todos/as”. That’s widespread as well, and “todos y todas” is the verbal version, I’ve never heard “todosas” and it sounds very weird to me haha!

So there’s no gender neutral suffix in French, not even invented? What pronouns do enby people use?
Totalmente. Siempre se me hace curioso como mucha gente sigue sin aceptar el they/them cuando es algo que no se han ""inventado"" de lleno como si se podría decir con nuestra -e. El uso del they/them ya estaba ahí, simplemente se hizo menos o más popular por tiempos y luego fue principalmente reclamado por las personas no binarias( según lo que he leído).

La x también me gusta. Es verdad que solo funciona escrita , pero si, se ve genial xD
Veo la 'x' usar con frecuencia en nuestro diario bilingüe local. Creo que es muy bonita.
Pienso lo mismo!  Es bien difícil encontrarse con otros hispanohablantes aquí, especialmente en subreddits cómo este, así que es agradable que se de la situación :'1
No conozco mucho sobre aspectos técnicos del idioma, es interesante lo que dices. Estoy de acuerdo , siento que al final cualquier razon que dan son excusas y simplemente quieren seguir ignorando la existencia de personas no binaries.  Eso es razón más que suficiente para que se reconozca su uso. Además,  el masculino genérico no es tan perfecto como lo pintan jajajaja.

Yo empecé a utilizar el masculino para mi metiéndome en la cabeza que puede ser ""masculino genérico"" sabiendo muy bien que la gente no lo ve así realmente . Si alguien dice los doctores nadie piensa en un grupo de personas con diversidad de género , solo piensan en hombres a menos que explícitamente se diga lo contrario. En fin, la hipotenusa.
If you want a non-gendered version of alumnos/alumnas, you can use estudiantes (as in, there's only one way to say it, and it doesn't differenciate gender depending on who you're speaking about)

But yeah, its a pain otherwise if you really want to stay neutral.
I mean, you can take it up with HQ in Milan, I'm just an Iniziatə
Estoy de acuerdo, y creo que el conjugado plural es latinequises. Sin embargo me gusta que suene como ""latine kisses"" jeje. Spanglish ftw
Si - en realidad es muy irrazonable por   activistas a fueren de estados unidos a tratan un cambiar al estructura fundamental por uno de idiomas mas hablado en el mundo. En inglés, el cambio es mas pequito - solo uno palabra. Latinx es una palabra sin forma similar en inglés o español - pero es más fácil por la gentle en estados unidos a dicen diferente. Cual manera es el mismo para mi - Latino, Latinx, latine - uso cualqier su preferado. Pero creo que latine es el option eso tiene sentido.
Ah, not me making the mistake of thinking I’m talking to a fellow non-native speaker. 😅 I did my uni thesis on lenguaje inclusivo and relish any chance to talk about it with someone outside my family, so sometimes I forget myself
yeah its sad
>I'm talking about adjectives which are the type of word labels are.

Labels can also be nouns.

>Almost every of them are gendered but the ones in the LGBTQ+ community are not like gay, and every sexuality that ends with -sexual. Except for a few exceptions like non-binary

They all are gendered. The only difference is that ""sexual"" doesn't have a gender termination (-o and -a) because it doesn't end in a vowel, there's no way to specify ""sexual"" is referring to a masculine or feminine word without adding a noun or article that specifies it. You can say ""el hombre homosexual"" and ""la mujer/persona homosexual"". As you can see, it's the same case as ""non-binary"".

""No binario/a"" ends in a vowel, and in this case its only purpose is to have concordance with the noun (as adjectives have to): you can't say ""la persona no binario"" because you're tying a masculine adjective to a feminine noun. Therefore, ""non-binary"" in spanish has to have all gender forms.

It's just important to distinguish between actual gender and grammatical gender. Grammatical gender isn't related to actual gender, the fact that ""no binario/a"" has  masculine and feminine grammatical genders in spanish is just because all words (except those that are specifically for masculine or feminine words like ""lesbiana"", which tend to have a synonym in masculine) need to have them for concordance with nouns.

Don't get me wrong, I wouldn't mind at all that a neutral gender would be introduced and accepted officially, but that's the only possible solution. Even if you add the neutral gender, the masculine and feminine genders would still need to exist, otherwise spanish would require a huge change that isn't realistic and can't be forced on people.
Spanish speakers who use the Elle (-e) are hated on too
Thank you so much for your thought-out reply. I am white and while I’ve heard the notion it comes from white academia and also heard it wasn’t true, I know it’s not my place to try and dictate someone else’s identity and language to describe it. So I want to make sure I can approach it from multiple angles or using other words when I need to while still being respectful and accurate. Those are some really great suggestions I will be following
bom, aqui no brasil o entendimento de latino é quem nasce na américa latina, por isso não entendi como alguém se “identifica” com uma nacionalidade. seria a mesma coisa que eu dizer q me identifico como uma russa *edit: nacionalidade dentre tantos países latinos americanos
> What pronouns do enby people use?

Most of us enbies use ""iel"" instead of ""il"" or ""elle"", and it is widely known even outside queer spaces. Feminists and queers also use ""iel"" when talking about a group of people or someone whose gender is not known. I think it really works like your ""elle"".

> So there’s no gender neutral suffix in French, not even invented?

French can have many different gendered suffixes depending on the word, it's not just ""o"" or ""a"". So what we are usually trying do is to mix the masc and fem versions of the word, just as with ""toustes"". Beautiful is ""belleau"" (belle + beau), author is ""auteurice"" (auteur + autrice) etc. Sometimes it's cute (""belleau"" sounds really nice), sometimes not that much (""toustes"" is weird in French too ^_^), it really depends on the words we are playing with.
Tened cuidado con la x que puede ser capacitista, el lector que usan las personas ciegas no es capaz de leerlo y no se enteran de lo que está escrito, teniendo la e es mejor usarla aunque no quede tan bien (que yo también estoy de acuerdo) ;)
¡Soy brasileñe y estoy de acuerdo!
All good!

I know how Spanish works, it's my first language. Maybe I explained myself poorly, what I meant is that non-binary is one of the few labels that are different in feminine and masculine. If you say ""soy asexual"" for example you aren't implying any gender, while if you want to say ""I'm non-binary"" you do have to imply gender.
por isso a rosália concorrer ao grammy latino é uma piada para nós, primeiro por ser uma cidadã europeia, depois por ao concorrer nessa categoria, está ocupando o lugar de artistas periferizados
>bom, aqui no brasil o entendimento de latino é quem nasce na américa latina, por isso não entendi como alguém se “identifica” com uma nacionalidade. seria a mesma coisa que eu dizer q me identifico como uma russa

i dont know portuguese. but i can google translate!

There is a differense between racial categories, etnicities and nationalities. In most european contries you are the nationality that you have membership in. So if im a member of France and Sweden, i have both the nationality of sweden and france. My etnicity is not necesserarly connected to my nationality (even though most of the time it is). I can be a ethnic turk, with membership in the nations of Sweden and France. Lets now add in my racial category. Im an ethnic turk, with swedish, turkish and french nationality but id be racially categoriesed as a Tatar in Turkey, An Turk in Sweden, A Europee in France.
Spanish has those too, not just a and o! We have “actor” and “actriz”, very similar to “acteur” and “actrice”. But we don’t mix them, we just add -e to the feminine version, so “actrice”. I guess we use the feminine and not the masculine as a reivindication against the masculine generic.

It’s fun to see how different linguistic groups have come up with different solutions despite having the same latin roots!
Gracias por aclararme esa duda. Mira que si me hacía pensar un poco si depronto podría casuar inconveniente a alguien pero aún no habia investigado al respecto . Tienes toda la razón. No utilizo la x pero es algo a tener en cuenta y mencionar la próxima vez que se de la ocasión
oh carioca sibling  kkkkk saludos desde arg

No, it’s okay! I’ve already graduated so I don’t mind sharing it. It’s a pretty short read since it was undergraduate thesis (recently started grad school). If you can read Spanish, I’ll be happy to take out my personal info and DM you a copy of the text
ok, mas onde entra a parte de se identificar? você pode ser turco, ter nacionalidade francesa e se identificar como latino?
>I guess we use the feminine and not the masculine as a reivindication against the masculine generic.

yes that sounds super cool :) sadly, in France, the people who have started doing that are kinda TERF :( so I hope we'll stick with the gender-neutral mixed words (that are super cute anyway!!)

Awesome!  congrats and good luck with grad school!  :D Yes I can read it, Spanish is my mother tongue. 😁
Brazilians view ethnic identity differently than we do in the U.S., but a lot of Brazilians don’t realize that there is also variation between how people see their own identities within Brazil. For example, many Brazilians won’t care that someone’s heritage is from Japan and would say they’re “Brazilian” just like anyone else. But the truth is that many people in Brazil who have Japanese ancestry still care about their ethnic background and may even travel to Japan to reconnect with it. 

In the U.S., many people care a lot about their heritage and ancestry because we don’t have a well-defined “U.S.” culture like Brazilians do. Indigenous identities were often not incorporated with the identities of the Europeans who conquered the land, and the same is true (to a different degree) for the formerly enslaved people who were brought here from Africa. As immigrants came here from all over the world, many of them maintained pieces of their own cultures. So we ended up with a fractured culture instead of an integrated one. The children of Brazilian immigrants in the U.S. often hold onto their Brazilian identities and wouldn’t want to be thought of as just “American” (or “U.S. American”)
>ok, mas onde entra a parte de se identificar? você pode ser turco, ter nacionalidade francesa e se identificar como latino?

Yes, because they are different categories. Identification that relates to cultures are fluid and not sticky in the same way that nationalities are. What is the difference between Western and eastern germany? Do they have the same Ethnicity? Probably. Do they have the same Nationality? Yes. But do they have the same cultural and historical values? Not really. So if a western german moves to eastern germany and then takes on the identity of ""estern german"". Are they doing something wrong? 

&#x200B;

there is a joke in sweden that goes ""Svensken känner sig mest som svensk i thailand"". Translated ""the swede feel the most swedish in Thailand"". Your feelings about  your identity is not stuck in geograhical, ethnicity or nationality.
Ugh ;( TERFs here use the feminine generic but without the -e, for obvious reasons. Many still use “todos y todas” too. Are there a lot of TERFs in France? I feel like Spain has a lot of them, sadly.
gosto da lingua, e brasileiros são as pessoas mais amigável que eu conhecei
me encanta la lengua portuguesa, me encantaría aprenderla algún día
sim, realmente. mas eles não se “identificam”, eles simplesmente são descendentes de japoneses/imigrantes da ásia. por isso que não entendo como se identifica com algo que ou você é ou não é. minha família tem descendência de italianos, eu não posso simplesmente me “identificar” como japonesa, entende?
I'm not sure really. Most of mainstream and radical feminist groups are vocally anti-terf and trans-inclusive, which is great, but the press and TV love TERFs for drama effect, which give them a lot of visibility. Since they are banned from left-leaning spaces, TERFs are starting to openly join the far-right, so their voices are mixed up with far-right transphobia. So I don't know if there are a lot of TERFs and if they really have any power, but they are quite visible yeah. How is it in Spain?
talvez o nosso processo de identificação seja mais enraizado e comum, por isso brasileiros não se “identificam”, simplesmente são
I think it’s pretty similar to the UK. Some mainstream feminist groups have adopted TERF ideology and many politicians and mainstream political activists who have always been feminists are pushing TERF rhetoric in the mainstream, not without opposition thankfully. Most of them are older feminists though, the only popular TERFs under 40 are Twitter and Instagram influencers.

It’s on TV often because there’s actually been a big divide in the government precisely because of this. Our current government is a coalition of two parties, the typical old-school socialist party that is now center-left at best and a more modern social democratic party. The Ministry of Equality is governed by the latter and they just put forward a law that allows people to change their sex on legal documents without needing to medically transition, and the other party is very against this. A trans politician in the socialist party has actually left the government because of this. This has opened the doors to TERF rhetoric on TV, inviting TERFs to debates, the right coming in… it’s pretty bad.
I think I understand, but I am having a little trouble because I can’t copy and paste to Google translate for some reason. But I think this is mostly a difference in how we use language. Most people in the U.S. probably never say they “identify” as Italian-American or Mexican-American. They would just say they “are.” But in queer and trans communities, we’re more likely to use “identify” because we are more conscious of the fact that one person can choose to identify in different ways. But honestly, that is not how I personally speak. Usually I say I “am” nonbinary and I “am” Mexican-American because I really am those things.

I don’t think that any of us believe you can “identify” as Turkish if you don’t descend from Turkey, but some people are who do have Turkish heritage might say they do or do not “identify” with being Turkish. For example, if they were adopted by non-Turkish Americans or if they just don’t feel close to their culture

lookin great💗
Love the look! ❤️❤️❤️
Ugh hair envy 💙

As someone who started growing it from about half an inch in October I know it's going to take a looooong time 😭😭
You're definitely pulling off gender! Awesome job!
I love the way you style your beard. Excellent. Flowing hair. Black on black. Very gender indeed
Looking stunning my friend! 🥰💓
Thank you so much for all of your kind words, everyone. This is my first selfie here and I'm genuinely so happy to feel all of your love and support ❤️
You look so freaking coolio!
oh my goodness AHHHHH!  I'm so envious!!  Looking amazing!!! 
 If only my beard didn't give me dysphoria I would let it grow long, maybe I'll give it a go in the far far future after I start hrt. :c
I get so jealous of enbies with beards! They really can balance gender very well! Long beautiful hair and fem clothes and you turn around and *bam* beautiful with a beard!
Oh hiiiiii
You look amazing in black!! Cute top!
Very Gender (thanks that's my band name now)

Hey now, save some gender for the rest of us! (You look amazing).
Your hair and beard are majestic!
Thanks! It's a mishmash of store bought, homemade, and donations!
You'll get there! This is about 3 and a half years of growth, started from a buzz cut too. It takes a lot of patience but I promise it's worth it!
Thank you!!!
Thanks! I'm so proud of my hair!
Thank you my friend! ☺️

Oh hey, it's fuckin' me.

> **EVERYONE**: So you're a trans woman!

> **ME**: Uhm... Yep.

And that's how I spent an extra year-and-a-half in a *new* closet that I'd once again been gaslit into believing I belonged in. It probably didn't help that from day 1, long before hormones, I passed better as a woman than as a man. (Which is a large part of how I'm an AMAB person who's deeply insecure about their ability to pass as male)

**EDIT**: As for the women's spaces bit, I actually managed to get past it because of that time spent forced into a new closet. By the time I was finally properly pissed and out of the closet, I had already spent well over a year in women's spaces and using female-specific terms without anything bad coming of it. At that point I really couldn't argue that I was ""invading"" those spaces anymore. Also, I actually feel comfortable referring to myself as a lesbian in a way that I'm not sure I'd have ever been if I wasn't gaslit into identifying as a trans woman. (Which is silly because I *am* a lesbian, and being, to some lesser extent, a straight man shouldn't preclude that)

So I guess being forcibly labeled a trans woman had *some* positive effects for me, but that really doesn't make it any more okay.
I used to be super insecure about my enby-ness due to being AFAB - basically it was fed to me that because I am AFAB any exploration of my gender was a cry for attention and that ""men were smarter than this silliness""

It wasn't until I found the reddit enby community with so many AMABs that I felt secure enough to actually, fully explore what my gender meant to me. Every single time a AMAB shares their experience it helps the community so much.
All my love to the amab enbies out there ❤💙
So as someone who’s AMAB, doesn’t have a problem with their assigned genitalia, doesn’t really suffer from gender dysphoria, but craves feminine energy and would prefer to present outwardly as such.....WTF does that make me?? Cause I highly doubt I’m trans.
Also the fact that ""androgynous"" clothes are almost always just AFAB people in men's clothes
Let nbs wear dresses!
Being transfem and still kinda questioning my identity (although knowing I want to be femme just not if I fully identify as a woman or a man) I feel this. Anytime I go to like the r/lesbiansactually I feel like I'm intruding on sacred space and that I'm just a creepy pervert not a valid person. Hell, I feel like that on a daily basis. I worry that I'm just a creepy pervert dressing like a woman to be creepy instead of just to not hate myself as much.
hard relate
So much love for this post. There are a ton of afab nb folks out there (myself included), that I see so few amab nbs

They've been so invisiblised that I just realized I have an amab nb friend whom I haven't even considered as an ""amab nb friend"" and now I'm wondering how I can support them better, because they've exhibited that same feeling of invading others' spaces because they're constantly put in a cis male box 

:(
Ouch, right in my actual fears I have.
I guesse I have to say something now that i have been consistently stealing upvotes from y'all.

Venturing into the LGBTQ+ arena for the first time 8 months ago, and outing myself on reddit 2 months ago, made me realize how prejudiced this community to ""it's own kinds"" is too despite the public rhetoric of inclusion and diversity. I found it incredibly frustrating to be accepted at the start and definitely makes me skittish as a *not fully out AMAB NB PoC*, even though this crew here in this channel has been incredibly supportive.
The joy of feeling invasive in queer and female spaces and clearly not belonging in male spaces is way too real fo me. feeling shut out of all those groups really stunts emotional growth and (for me) prevented the  formation of a stable or even coherent identity. Woohoo! but on the bright side: all you lovely friendos exist and are definitely making my world brighter. Much love to all y'all!
Also, not all AMAB enbies are transfeminine. I’m agender and depending on how I dress on a given day, I’m either treated as a cis guy or a trans woman who’s not trying hard enough.

I’m agender, and as far as I’m concerned clothing and makeup do not make my body any more gendered. Wearing a suit and tie doesn’t make me masc, and wearing a skirt and eyeliner doesn’t make me femme. Deal with it.
You ever notice how the only Enbies who gain popularity online are White, Conventionally attractive androgynous afabs? 

Theres probably a correlation. PoC enbies are also erased from the conversation.
This is too real... I think about this everyday.
Fuck, it's me so hard
oof that second bit about intrusion is definitely a huge factor for my own discomfort.
Yeah, I'm still trying to decide how I'm going to explain to people that I want to take estrogen and grow boobs but that I'm not a woman and that I like my genitals just the way they are. I also do feel like I don't really fit into the queer community, although I think I am becoming more comfortable with that.
Oof.

On top of this I just feel so, like, _aged out_ of this. I didn't identify as non-binary until I turned 35 and didn't really even have a dysphoric breakdown until 34 (male pattern baldness finally hit). Stuff felt...weird as far back as I can remember, but I also knew I wasn't a woman. It wasn't until even my early 30s that I even knew that non-binary was a thing and then I started exploring. 

Strangely, the two non-binary people I met in my life before anyone else were both AMAB. Younger than me by like a decade, but...

And regarding that ""intruding into queer spaces as a man thing"" there's a queer women+""femme identifying non-binary"" marching band in my neighborhood that I _soooo_ want to join but I know I don't present femme enough to be considered and it just breaks my heart.
being amab and nb and non-femme  is kind of a bad time for me.
OP and yall wonderful people in the comments, thanks for posting this. I felt very alone, and didn't realize how universal a lot of my feelings were before this
This has basically been my experience. I wanted to be a femme cutie, especially like femme tomboys (think Tracer) and then spent over a year of browsing r/Traa seeing ""if you wish you were femme/a girl you're trans"" memes. Started coming out as trans to some of my most supportive friends because I didn't realize there was another option I was allowed to use. Then I eventually found this place, and I still don't have any idea how to do the sorts of look I'm going for because scrolling through pictures here shows pretty much nothing but afabs. Please I just wanna look cute. Now I also feel afraid to come out again, as though they'll think I was faking being trans or something.
Fucking hell, that second part hits hard. I constantly feel that impostor syndrome where I'm worried someone's going to tell me that I'm not allowed to be here because I'm just a chaser trying to sneak into queer spaces. Sometimes it feels like I've gotten lucky in some of the trans/NB communities I've joined that have been super helpful and supportive, but... I'm starting to get over some of those feelings and realize that those hostile assholes who try to gatekeep and exclude are a tiny minority that I really shouldn't give any serious thought to.

Maybe it'll finally be easier when I have some financial independence and can start doing what I want without having to worry about my (frustratingly LGBT-phobic) family pushing back.
I have a friend who’s non-binary but just identifies as a gay male bc he knows it’ll be easier than trying to explain it. As someone who’s out as non-binary it’s hard tbh bc I wanna support him being himself
Oh my god someone vocalized this! I'm in no position to show my enby-ness in any way shape or form and yet thinking about this stuff just makes me internally scream
I know at least as many AMAB nbs as AFAB, it's just that they're only vocally nonbinary online, in safe spaces. In life in general, they're invisible. AFAB people have more visibility, but it's  often that good ol' hypervisibility, often making fun of people the cis perceive as women for being ""trendy"" and ""unique"" by daring to step outside their assigned sex. In the eyes of transphobes, there's trans women who are ""deviant men"", trans men don't exist, afab nbs who are ""women who want attention"", and amab nbs don't exist.
Oof... this hits too close to home.
I always try to remind myself no one gets a priority claim on an identity. Just because other people call themselves something doesn't mean I can't if I feel it's right for me.
So what does everyone think needs to change? I am an action-biased kind of enby.

Edit: I think everyone should learn Chinese. It's pretty genderless I think
I ♥️♥️ AMAB NBs.

But the designation of ""Loudly Gay"" makes me giggle.

Also see 'accused of being predatory'

A while back I read some article about the nb lead of a band being found to have assaulted someone. So some of the comments were along the lines of MEN NOW CLAIMING THEY'RE NB TO LOWER PEOPLE'S GUARDS SO THEY CAN BE CREEPS. 

aka 'It's the softboy thing all over again'
Amab is male to nonbinary? Or masc androdgynous? If so uhh, hey what's up
I don’t understand. The LGBTQ+ community is supposed to be inclusive and accepting, not exclusive and make people feel they’re intruding, when in fact then belong...
god i think i've become so scared of being an amab enby and needing a place to belong with trans masc enbies that i've found myself dressing like a trans masc enby and not saying what i was born as just to feel a part of anything and like i have some place to roost, i hate it
When I was an egg I was debating coming out or not and not trans girl mentor said ""if you come out you'll be the only vocal amab enby on campus"". She inspired me to come out by telling me I would fill a huge representation gap. I came out a year ago and suddenly we have four amab enbies, two of which I helped come out.
\>every single amad nb i've met ahs also been incredibly skittish about ""intruding into queer spaces as a man""...

&#x200B;

Geez, way to call me out.
Thank you for spreading this, genuinely. I couldn't have put it better myself.
Also, how ""masculine features"" are like the fucking trump cards of presentation. I'm AMAB, feminine and happen to like wearing a beard. Cis people are like ""you're enby, but, but beard?!""
> skittish about intruding into queer spaces as a man

Oh cool shit so [it's not just me then](https://www.reddit.com/r/genderqueer/comments/bipk3w/do_i_belong_here). I have no idea how this feeling got internalised but I sure do hate it!
My partner is AMAB but people just assume male.
Oh look #2 is Completely and Totally Me
this hits too close to home ouch
oh hi its fuckin me
Idk I mean, the only semi famous enby I know of is Jeffrey Marsh, who’s AMAB and is like 40 (bc imo it’s important to have older queer icons)

smol boob gang! I'm actually really happy my boobs are probably going to stay at A cup forever.
hi awice :3
I feel kinda the same, except I was AFAB. It was really easy for me to pass pre-T because I always had some masculine facial features and an androgynous body. Which is great most of the time, but when I want to present femme I feel insecure because of my big eyebrow ridge and beefy arms, lol.
Thank you so much for typing that out.  I spend so much of my time worrying that I'm required to put up some kind of barrier when I'm around my women friends, and have found recent comfort in the term Lesbian, even though I feel occasionally ashamed to use it.  Seeing someone else experience something similar helps me feel less isolated!
I don't think ever I've related to something more in my life
I have to say thank you for this, I definitely don't want to intrude on amab enby related experiences, but as someone afab this is exactly how I felt before discovering this subreddit. I honestly wouldn't have made an account here if not for the queer spaces on this site. <3
Thank you <3
Thank you too <3
I needed this, thank you so much <3
You could be enby with femme stuff giving you gender euphoria.
It means you're you! If you want to identify as something in particular like non-binary or transfemme, that's cool. Otherwise if you can't find a label that feels right, that's okay too! Lack of terminology does not invalidate your gender identity or your presentation. You do you, darling. 💙

Edit: Thanks for the silver, beautiful! 😘
Wow holy fuck this describes me exactly wtf
Me.
Sounds like me too.  I label myself as nonbinary, but also accept transgender umbrella label (aka not cisgender).  But don't worry about labels, just figure out what you like and don't like and do what brings joy.
Amen
I mean, my jeans don’t have pockets, because of big handbag, so y’know, it’s not just “men’s” clothes. This is because I am whatever the opposite of thicc is, and I buy “women’s” jeans, because my legs are literally too small for any of the cuts on the “men’s” jeans.

Meh, let’s just stop pretending that clothes are gendered and just wear whatever the fuck makes us happy. I don’t particularly want to wear dresses, but I kind of like blouses and stuff that most men wouldn’t ever wear.
My wife has said before ""can't you wear one of your manlier skirts?"" My love of skirts makes an andrygenous look hard but I pair them with tshirts or button shirts :)
r/lesbiansactually was created because r/actuallesbians was starting to come down on terf rethoric. I highly recommend the later for more trans inclusive stuff.
I feel the same whenever I even comment at r/aspergirls, despite almost everything on there being *way* more relatable than most of the stuff at r/aspergers.  (I've never actually *posted* on aspergirls - it would feel wrong to do it without an explanation, and so awkward to do it with an explanation).
Be the change you wish to see in the world, hun! We all make mistakes, whether out of malice or ignorance. I was raised to think gay people were gross weirdos and here I am now, a pansexual enby person happily married to my beautiful trans wifey. It's always okay to acknowledge our own shortcomings. Especially when it comes to how we can be better allies to one another. The important thing to focus on now is that you are aware of it. We can't fix anything if we don't admit there's a problem that needs fixing. 

You know your friend and your relationship with them so I certainly can't begin to tell you what you ""should"" do. I'm only offer a suggestion here as someone who as been on both sides of this type of situation. Just talk to them. Tell them this is something you've realized. And then ask them how they feel about it and how you can be more supportive to them. And just let them talk, if they want to. Cause most likely there's a bunch of microaggressions and bottled up feelings they felt they couldn't share because they thought people wouldn't understand. Or they did share before and people didn't understand then, so they need to reiterate those feelings now with your new perspective. Again, just my two cents here. You do what's good for you both.

And of course, defend the fuck of out them being in whatever goddamn spaces they feel the most comfortable in. If you a have privledge that your friend doesn't, then use it to be their advocate when others try to deny them. I know we all have insecurities and self doubts about our own sense of validity, so the best thing we can do is fiercely protect one another. Your friend is valid and you are valid. Own it and don't let anyone tell you or your friend otherwise. 💙
Nah, I’m sure we’re just gay dudes who want attention. Never mind the euphoria and dysphoria, we don’t exist — and definitely can’t have other sexualities, or gender identities.

But yeah, I relate to this post, and I’m not exactly sure what we, as a community, can do about it. 

:(
Hey. I'm also a not fully out AMAB NB PoC, can I be your friend?
Unfortunately humans are simple creatures and fall back to tribalistic ideas of ""us vs. them"" at the drop of a hat. It's shit and I'm sorry you've been going through that. TERFs, racists, and all other hateful types can step right the fuck off.

If means anything from an internet stranger, I support you and think you're cool and valid. 💙
I am trying to fuck up all these notions here. 80% serious.
[deleted]
It's why my friend sent me the screenshot. So much discomfort.
I've tried to tell people I want estrogen and boobs and my unsupportive parents were confused... everyone else was too but they just accepted it as a valid thing and moved on
Thank you for posting this. I'm 32, amab, finally getting to grips with my Gender Mystery, and feeling wayyyy to old for all of this :(
Just constant imposter syndrome
If you're comfortable, can you elaborate?
Relatable. Dont want to come out twice
Yes, this.
I wish there were more real world spaces where I could go be nonbinary without having to give an entire lesson on what that means to everyone else there. Like, aside from my trans support group which of course is awesome about these things. 

And since no irl cis people ask for my pronouns, I can't just go hang somewhere and get gendered correctly (they/them) without outing myself.
No.  You do what you think you need. Pills aren't a limited natural resource
AMAB=assigned male at birth. It means that, when this person was born, the doctor saw they had a penis and marked their sex as male.
Ahahahaha.

It took me _way_ too long to figure out why I didn't feel comfortable in in cis white gay male spaces and it was really ""oh, yeah, I don't fit into this box"". If there's any part of the LGBTQ+ crowd that has serious judgement about appearance and conforming to gender norms it's them, _especially_ in the midwest.
Can you share how you came out? What did you do? What happened as a result?
Thank you, I actually liked having a little goatee but ever since I came out (mostly) even not shaving for a few days makes me feel bad about myself
Yeah, me too
I'm on Bs and hopefully getting Cs. I honestly don't want more after that because I'm pretty sure I'm going to feel dysphoric if they're too big.
Same. Though frustratingly I went from being dysphoric about my chest being totally flat to being dysphoric about my nipples being too puffy and feminine. And I'm pretty much stuck with that one.

Also, despite my breasts barely existing I still have to always be wearing a fucking bra because of that.

Basically: Life is an unfair hellscape.
Hi wobin :3
It took me a while to be comfortable with calling myself a lesbian despite always wanting to. Honestly I don't think it was until I had been fully indoctrinated in believing I was a trans woman that I felt absolutely comfortable with it... Which is fucking stupid. Incorrectly identifying as a *binary* woman honestly did a lot to break down those sorts of barrier for me, though I can't say I recommend it. 

Anyway, I'm glad if my experience can help someone else, and I'm happy to share it.
> I definitely don't want to intrude on amab enby related experiences

You aren't. This the important opposite end of the same problem, in the same way that a discussion about media overrepresentation and demonization of trans women is inherently also a discussion about the underrepresentation and erasure of trans men. These are the exact same issue and while it's important to give the other side a certain amount more focus due to how little it normally gets, I think it's impossible to talk about it without paying some deference to what this means for afab enbies.
To add on, there's nothing wrong with trying a label and changing it after a while. The first one doesn't always stick. Try enby, see how it suits you, and if it makes you happy, great! If not, no shame in admitting it didn't work for you. Experiment with your identity, or something.
First time hearing of gender euphoria and damn I love it :)
Thanks sweetie 💜💜💜 yeah I suppose my question was more or less rhetorical as I pretty much already identify as someone residing between the binary, out here just trying to do me. Crazy how there just has to be a gatekeeper always telling you that ya don’t belong.  So thankful for this sub. Everyone here is awesomesauce!
Maybe we’re twinsies 👯
I just got a lace shirt and I am living for it
>I mean, my jeans don’t have pockets, because of big handbag

I'm constantly threatening to sew bigger pockets (or any pockets at all) into everything I own from the ""women's"" section. I mean, I never actually get it together, but I *want* to.
So relatable.  Almost buying exclusively ""women's"" nowadays. This speaks a lot to why I want to learn about garment and apparels design despite having none of the academic/formal background.  Who wants to buy from my future line? 🤣
My best friend recently linked me a (raunchy and comedic) post from there, and one of the top upvoted comments accused OP of being a ""Porn sick male"". Which is a big fucking dog whistle, but also just *wrong* because from her post history she was absolutely a lesbian, and probably cis from what I could tell. (Not that being cis ought to matter)

Immediately reminded me why I wasn't subbed there

Thank you for such a thoughtful reply! ♡ I'm definitely going to start paying more attention to the ways my unacknowledged privilege grants me access to spaces that my friend doesn't have access to, or feels uncomfortable accessing. I do tend to get caught up in the ways I'm oppressed by my gender identity without recognizing that I have it easier than my amab nb friend.
Sure
I think they mean on non-anonymous social media - Twitter, Instagram, YouTube etc.
basically looking like and dressing like a cis guy  
makes people think you're cis and can make people incredulous and gatekeepery to you. :(
Oof it really sucks how literally stating or asking pronouns almost instantly outs you as trans. Asking feels dangerous too, like if you ask the wrong person they'll get offended you might think they're not cis and lash out :x 

the only safe spaces are explicitly lgbtq+ welcoming or organized, it seems, and even then it might still be LGBT-but-only-the-""REAL""-transes
It's another hard day of work in the E mines
Gotcha, accurate to me as well then lmao. Thx for the info!
I mean, in a way I do agree with you. But if someone is amab and wants to identify as nb and is truly an ally, then why shouldn’t they belong/be included? I can’t think of one good reason. In the same way, I’m a queer nb afab, working in a predominantly cis straight male kitchen, and I still fit in and get along with everyone. It all depends on your attitude towards a situation. But also, people are always going to be assholes, that will never change.
Now I kind of want to use examples of this to prove to homophobes that the whole ""slippery slope"" idea is totally invalid
Well I used to think I was cis and pan. My agab was something I was borderline comfortable with, and I was misattributing my dysphoria as ""not wanting to look like my father"" or ""not wanting to act like the 'typical guy'"". Eggy stuff like that. For more examples I dyed my hair pastel pink, wore a dress to Second Chance prom, and painted my nails. Things not impossible for a cis male but certainly egg_irl shit.  

For context, my university does these events called Speakout Panels in which a group of queer folk tell their coming out stories and answer questions about the community. I did a lot of those, and so did my nonbinary friend. Now, I listened to my friend's story about a million times. For some reason on the million and first time I heard them explain what being nonbinary means to them my egg finally burst open. That was two years ago. For the first year the only person I told was my LDR partner (now ex), and I drug my feet exploring it, because I was absolutely terrified of what it would mean for me going forward. And honestly, I was intimidated because I saw all these afab enbies that I RECOGNIZED as enbies and was like ""they're definitely enbies, I'm probably not. I'll never be as confident as them so I should stay how I am"". Nonsense like that. I dragged my feet until I met the trans girl I mentioned before. I politely asked her her name and pronouns AS ALLIES SHOULD and after she tells me she asked me mine in return. And.. I paused. After a bit I told her my name, and said my pronouns were ""to be determined"". I dont know why I told her that, but I'm glad I did.  

She spent a month or two patiently helping me come to terms with it. Asked me things like ""if you were on a deserted island with no one to judge you and you could magically shapeshift as much as you want, what would you look like?"" A year ago she pushed me to come out to our friend group because I was clearly ready to come out but ""waiting for the right moment"". I did, and they readily accepted me, and I've been exploring ever since. It was really confusing, because not only would my gender change but how much I feel that gender would change as well so I could never place it. Then my ex showed me the term ""Fluidflux"" and I was ecstatic because it was everything I felt.  

In conclusion, it was a pretty difficult transition entirely because I was scared. My family doesnt know, but my found family at college are incredible and I love them so much because they provide a place for me to be myself. Theres been some bullshit from the local conservatives but my support system is strong and loving. Really it was quite the transition: I used to hate people, believe I had a porcupine dilemma, and was depressed all the time. Now I love people, have formed deep familial bonds with a whole bunch of folks, and am only depressed half the time! Dysphoria's a bitch but the euphoria makes it all worth it.  

If anyone has any questions feel free to comment or dm! I love you all!
Puffy nipples are feminine?! Gender euphoria in 3... 2... 1... UwU
It's amazing honestly. First time I was called ""they"" I was just over the moon with euphoria
Yayy! 

I see a lot of folks getting caught up in trying to find the """"""correct"""""" term to call themselves. And I just think, ""babe, don't worry. It just hasn't been invented yet."" Just cause language hasn't caught up, doesn't mean anyone's identity or experiences aren't as real and valid as anyone else's. Plenty of trans, NB, and gender non-conforming folks have existed all through history, well before us English speakers knew any of those words. So if there isn't a good label for ya right now, it only means you're ahead of the rest of us. :)
Triplets?
That sub has one post??
My amab partner is nb and not out to family etc. I know how that is, for sure. Clothing is just clothing, but anything not explicitly gendered is read as a default- cis. Why is it that when an amab person wears jeans and a tee they somehow are less queer? How is a cardigan and slacks any less nonbinary? Sheesh!
I'm fairly comfortable with either masc, femme or andro presentation most of the time, and it sometimes feels like a catch 22 of ""present masc and worry about being excluded from trans spaces"" or ""present femme and worry about being beaten up in the street"".

Honestly I usually go with the ""let's not have to be hypervigilant today"" masc option.
Right :/ The lgbt places around me have generally been ok so far.

But then, i used to work at a healthcare place that was very inclusive with lots of lesbian and gay coworkers. I remember all the shitty things people would say about our trans patients when they weren't around. :(  They were supportive later on when I came out, but I could never really know for sure if they talked the same about me when I wasn't around. Idk what my point is except that people suck.
This is an incredible story! Thank you.
They're certainly not masculine.
This.  First time doing nothing other than getting nail polish. Or first time getting ma'am while not trying. Felt so right and good
The thing that really gets me caught up is worrying (like the post says) about using terms that I think people who _already_ use it for themselves would be unhappy with me taking on because I'm too new to this, or too masculine still, or not dysphoric etc etc. It's very much internalised BS but it's how I feel :\ I literally [posted about it](https://www.reddit.com/r/genderqueer/comments/bipk3w/do_i_belong_here/) the other day just calling out for someone to tell me I was allowed to call myself genderqueer if I don't think I sit directly at ""cis man""
quadruplets??
So it's r/lesbianactually, which I was aware of but I didn't really care enough to correct them at the time.
Oh you're too kind <3
(Unless they’re on a masculine identifying person; I’m sure they can wear them in a masculine way!)
Being queer is a revolutionary act. It's a rejection  (no matter how big or how small) of the labels society has put on us, whether they be straight, cis, male, female, whathaveyou. To be queer is to fly in the face of the status quo and look damn good doing it.

So as you embark your exciting journey of self discovery, you may find a new way to identify. You may feel being genderqueer is the best representation of yourself. You may learn you're a trans woman or perhaps trans femme. You may find being male is the answer, but now you have the experience to truly understand it. No matter where you end up, you are valid. And even if it takes longer that you may want, you're questioning and journey to get there is still valid too. 

And right now, as you are figuring all this out, you are rejecting society's labels and norms. You're rocking that black and white dress, you're making friends with your inner feminine self, you're talking with other queer folks in queer places, and I'm sure many, many more things. You're just as much a part of the queer revolution as the rest of us and you are welcomed to join in our headpats. 

Also, may I recommend a fashion belt with that dress? I feel like a thicker style belt would be a great accessory and really highlight your slender waist. Just my personal style though. You flault your outfits however is best for you, darling. The fun part of being queer is that all your clothing options are valid too! 💙
Huh... Looking at it briefly they seem okay, nothing like the bullshit at truelesbians. Explicit anti-transphobia rules and such, two of them.
This is hard because I agree with the intent of your sentiment, but at the same time it erodes our ability to talk about these things.

You can be totally masculine with wide hips, a narrow waist, or prominent cheekbones, but those are still features that are primarily characteristic of a feminine body. They're secondary sex characteristics of women, and there are times when we need to be able to talk about them as such. I wish there weren't and we could just say ""sex shouldn't matter so lets stop gendering body parts"" but there are always going to be trans people for whom that language is an important part of how they communicate about and understand their own body. Hell, that's exactly why the person I was replying to asked the question.

I was absolutely too flippant with my answer and could have phrased it less problematically. Looking back at the comment I feel awful about it, but muddying the answer by dismissing the premise is pretty counterproductive.
Yeah, I agree with you, my intent really was just to add on to what you were saying than anything else. 

Like, I know very well that a many traits just kinda are considered masculine or feminine, and regardless of how it’s perceived I feel dysphoric about things like my voice; I just wanted to add that if for example there’s a masculine AFAB person who’s content with their body, that’s totally valid and stuff, y’know?"	bce2t7	NonBinary	1575	1.0	2019-04-12 14:17:41
One reason I love traditional outfits is that we all can wear skirts or long dresses, no matter which gender you’re		"I need a name of all these outfits they look so amazingly cute
""let's go to work"" and then a business suit is hilarious
This made me happy. Thx!
I feel like I’m picking out a cool character in a video game.
this makes my day better just like when my mom bought me an academic-themed hanfu
I love this!
This is so cool! And very true in some cultures it's completely normal to wear skirts for everybody.

Also I really love the second one and then I lost count but there are some outfits I really love. (They look all very pretty but I am just going of my style and what I like especially)
LETS GO TO WORK
Wow I need number 10 (with the shorts) so bad! I've wondered for a while how I could modify a 旗袍 to be be less femme, I feel like watching this vid on loop 100 more times may hold the key.
omg this is so cute and well made!!!  all these outfits r great
This is so cool! The choreography to the music is awesome and hilarious! I love seeing traditional outfits from other cultures.
Lol this is so excellent 😁
I like your poster of the solar system
I'm inspired 😍
This is amazing
i mean, they are still very gendered a lot of the time, just not in the same way
I don't even own this many outfits.
i knew exactly what sound it was before i unmuted it
This video is amazing, wish I knew the names of all the different garments!
Is that a blåhaj on your bed? That was my best purchase from Ikea.
Well I could watch this all day then
I love all of those clothes! Damn I need to get some
Brooo.. I need traditional Japanese clothes now. They all look so nice
I love this!
I replayed this a few times and it just kept getting better. I love it, you are fantastic. Thank you
Omg I love the second to last outfit 🥺🥺🥺
This video is so fun to watch!!
You have the cutest sense of style like holy shit
The last one suits you.
All the outfits look nice
So many smiles from this video!
is that really you in all different outfits?
I NEED THE ONE WITH THE SHORTS OMG THEY ARE ALL GORGEOUS WHERE ARE YOU FROM?
I'd kill for the 6th one (with the black and red skirt) as pants ngl they look swooshy as hell

edit: I can't spell
All those outfits are awesome but that second outfit is 🔥🔥🔥
I love your collection of outfits, but the last one irks me a just little bit: your suit jacket is a bit too large and you would look even more badass if you got it fitted! The shoulders hang a bit and the sleeves cover your hands. You deserve a work suit that makes you look like a boss.
Me too :)
So do I
Happy cake day!
Also, sadly, I would not just be socially rejected but also fired for wearing dresses. They simply aren't traditional for male-presenting types where I am.
Plz I need those pants in the 2nd one
Thank you! 🍰"	h083hm	NonBinary	1570	1.0	2020-06-10 10:21:59
Students who identify outside of male or female can not complete the housing application, despite freshmen being required to live in residence halls. This college prides itself on being inclusive.		"Do they have a diversity and inclusion director? I would message them directly.
The person you emailed probably has no power to fix it, I'd escalate to the DEI director like ultraspiral said.

Don't be afraid to raise a stink on social media or bring it to a reporter if you don't hear back in 24-48 hours, or if they make it your problem.

Your college likely has a newspaper, and I bet they'd love to do a story on this shit. If not, reach out to lgbtq media like [www.them.us](https://www.them.us) 

And if you live in a blue state which protects trans people, this could be a form of illegal gender identity based discrimination, though obs consult a lawyer.
What's the point of having the ""other"" option if that bars a student from living on campus?
Oh, yeah. How inclusive. ""You can pick male, female, or 'other', but if you choose the last, you'll be banned, because we're very inclusive""
If you’re comfortable enough to share the name of the college, even if just through a DM, I’d really appreciate it. I work at a high school as a college counselor and would love to make sure that this college isn’t visiting our school until this is fixed. Of course I totally understand if you’re not comfortable sharing.
“We allow you to choose rooms depending on how you identify, only if you identify binarily of course !”
lmfao dont fill it out! and when they give you attitude for it, bring it up the chain of command that you were discriminated in the housing app due to your gender. i doubt the dean will want that coming out ;)) dont do anything if youre being treated unjustly. you already took initiatve to message and were given a bs answer. what i said is exactly what i have done in the past. if its \*that\* important for freshman to live on campus, they need to accommodate you, or allow you to live off campus under special circumstances. sometimes you cant make a change by being nice. you could help all the future nonbinary people that enter too.
Isn’t this considered discrimination based on *Bostock v. Clayton County Holders*? I know that applies to Tile VII, but the rule is that “discrimination based on…sex…” means gender identity. I’m pretty certain they just admitted to illegal discrimination.

EDIT: Quick edit I wanted to say, if you can and want to consider it, I recommend getting a lawyer before changing anything. I kinda think you got a case here
Sometimes choosing “other” or “non-binary/agender” feels like nothing  but outing yourself on documents . . . I’m starting to lean just toward always checking “female” just to be safe.
Ugh.  How did they answer?
Their reply was (1) very specific & (2) completely useless

I'm sorry you have to put up with their nonsense
Because nonbinaries are gods, and we must be housed in temples.
How can they require you to live in the residence halls? How is that even enforced? That whole thing is just…. really weird. I’m genuinely really sorry
Gender segregation needs to end
My former employer has an LGBTQIA+ dorm building that seems to be an acceptable compromise for students.
If this is Georgia Tech (going based on them calling themselves Tech, email policy, Res Life name, and mention in another comment about the state's history of transphobic legislation), DM me and I'll get you connected with the right resources.
So, Wait, Are You Then Not Allowed To Be A Freshman If You're Non-Binary? That's Outrageous.

Honestly, I Don't Get Why They'd Need To Separate Them Based On Gender In The First Place. Just Feels Like Pointless Bureaucracy To Me.
If this is Tennessee Tech there is a chance if you elevate it to the right people you may get put in Tech Village.
Bring to the dean bro
Then why have ""other"" if you don't allow it? I don't get that one
Office of Equal Opportunity. Should have an access coordinator. Additionally, you may find help with the dean of students office or ombud. From someone who works in a reslife position at a state uni, you really gotta work the discrimination angle to make any progress. In the end, they'll likely say you'll have to pick one for logistics reasons, but you wont have to change how you list your identity
if the school has a good independent student newspaper, I would also get in touch with them in addition to what other commenters have suggested. I worked at a student newspaper in college and this is the exact kind of thing we would've wanted to write about. that can hopefully bring some local attention to the issue
Ok from what little I know about tech, emailing from an external email isn’t a huge issue. It’s not like you sent them some file to download, so that point is moot in my eyes. Also, yeah, if you really want to drive a truck through this, I’d reach out to local media.
This is ridiculous. I went to a big tech college, and they did not segregate dorms or floors by genders (and for roommates you got to choose which genders you were comfortable rooming with, and could choose any/all). Sorry you are dealing with this!!
Why the hell do they have a “other” option if you can’t fucking  pick it?
Sad. That isn't nice. I guess pick the gender you identify with most closely, or the one where you'll get less questions/harassment.
[Inspect element](https://twitter.com/manedpup/status/1393333634694881282) the application? 😈
Ok first of all, why have the ""other"" option then???
Second, this is transphobic and discriminating. Not allowed housing just cus you're out of the binary? What absolute bullcrap
Even the fact that the floors are separated by sex is stupid. Is having a neighbor of the opposite sex really that scandalous and despicable?
Well, in Eastern Europe, it applies for all dorms. You can only choose a room fit for your agab, only with similar people (eg. if your afab, you can only live with girls).
What's the point of having other on the application then?
The college I’m going to has a similar policy, but they asked for “whichever gender I feel most comfortable sharing a bathroom” and to speak with their housing director if I needed any additional accommodations due to my gender.
Theoretically, if there are not enough non-binary roommates, do you have a preference on which gender you would want to room with? I know it's imperfect, but picking that gender will get you the result you want in the end. It doesn't matter what your AGAB is.
Did they answer what you're meant to do?
In a co-ed dorm, there shouldn't be a problem.
Bruh
What the fucking point of having an ""other"" option then?

What a joke.

MAKE THE ""OTHER"" OPTION WORK, FOR FUCK'S SAKE. IT'S NOT JUST A FUCKING PREFERENCE.
My uni was the same way, the first time we filled out the application for dorms there wasn’t an “other option”. Now there is, but if we select it we can’t choose a dorm since they’re all gender specific (my roommate and I are both non-binary so the frustration is shared)
Whoever this person is that responded doesn’t seem to understand what you’re asking, or does but doesn’t believe that there are more than two genders. Damn. 

First, so sorry you’re dealing with this right now. Starting college is already overwhelming, you have to learn so much about financial aid, choosing classes, etc. then to throw this blatant discrimination on top?? 

Second, as others have said you absolutely have a case here. I hope you can find the energy to reach out for help on this to take these mfs down. Finding a professor or instructor to take your side could be a great start because they might be able to do a lot of the difficult work for you (reaching out to orgs or people in power, advocating on your behalf to higher ups, etc)
My work, at the largest university in my state, has locker rooms and absolutely no NB option. We're more inclusive than others in that locker rooms and bathrooms are identified sex, but if you're enby? 

Good luck, hope you enjoy being naked around a group of people you probably won't feel comfortable around. There's individual changing spaces that can be used but no lockers for individuals there.
I bet it's just a software problem. They'd have to create another data set. Instead they just have you pick which one you'd be most comfortable with.
[removed]
Which gender do you want to see more and house with them 🤷🏼‍♀️
I’m newly coming out as non binary trans male. I feel I’m 50/50. I’m nit linger ever depressed since accepting and want bottom surgery only and be put on testosterone. Identify male as I’ve lived just over 50 years as. Time to experience a new bottom. That means I also can’t tick male or female or both at once. Us non binary people are all different and the same. This is a good argument that the university is not practicing equality. That’s discrimination against a marginalised person. Evil really. They need to be able to provide the same things like rooms for say non binary people like us. By doing so everyone no matter of disadvantage etc can study and live the same. That’s true equality. On top of that they are basically putting you in the corner with no choice and forcing you to make a choice of male or female against your will which is a form of abuse and human rights issue. It’s clear they didn’t read your email. What I saw was you writing that you are non binary but you are not sure if both genders or no genders etc. Life’s hard enough. Mind you once I knew I was non binary I felt a little better. Added the trans and I’m fully me. I’m only just coming out and it’s about less than a week. Seriously because I’m just accepting me etc if I was In that situation it could send me over the edge.  I have so much fear people will reject me. Meaning close grit das and family. Didn’t happen but this school would force me to make a choice and that’s not right. Id seem legal advice. Good luck and know we are a family and don’t take those peoples shit on
Start seeing a lawyer
My school is the same, sort of.  We get to select our gender identity from an expansive list, but we also have to share our biological sex.  Housing assignments are based on sex only; gender is completely disregarded.
They do not know/understand the definition of gender. 😑 
I would look into a more knowledgeable institution..
Why is it an option if you can’t be there based on that what the fuck?
We'Re ToTaLlY InCLuSiVe bUt We NeEd To KnOw If YoU'rE a GiRl NoN-bInArY oR a BoY NoN-bInArY

For real, I'm sorry you got this response and I'm sorry that people do not understand what non-binary means. I am glad and proud of you for seeking ways to get this brought to the attention of people who can do something about it.
jesus and i thought my school was bad with being performative
Currently looking
Yes! Or if they don't, what I might do is find a faculty member who either teaches a subject/class related in some way to equality, or otherwise indicates they'd clearly be on the side of reason here. For example, my dad and cousin are professors. If you looked at their profiles on their colleges' sites you'd see that my dad has taught courses that clearly mention LGBT rights, and my cousin mentions his husband in his bio.
""Diversity and inclusion director""? I want to know a place/country where that things exists because I live in Italy and that sounds like sci-fi here
Yes, currently seeing what I can do.

And I live in the state with the record for transphobic legislation so… yeah lol.
Who knows. It’s really just a form design flaw at this point.
Thanks, this is so lovely and validating! Thanks
yeah i read that and went ???
I second this! I was close friends with a trans girl during my time in college (2012-2016) and she basically got her own big ass room all to herself because once her roommate(s) realized she wasn’t a guy, they didn’t wanna live with her. You might even be able to connect with all the other non-binary ppl on campus and discuss ways to further bring this to the attention of higher ups— maybe you can even request to specifically room with other non-binary ppl too! If yall have an LGBTQ club or org I’d take it to them because they should have a staff member in attendance with each meeting. The Queers & Allies club was amazing at my college and where I realized binary gender was a literal construct of society. Hoping you can have some ease in your college housing friend🤲🏽
I couldn't afford one, and I'm still living at home and a minor.
I’m so sorry you both feel this way. I feel similar at times but, thank goodness, less scared (like for my safety) and more unsure. I used to love forms - filling out information in little boxes and all that. But forms can be so dangerous and uninclusive. I feel sad when I think about that. Good news: you’re safe here!! 🏳️‍🌈🏳️‍⚧️💛🤍💜
Lately, same. I’m so scared about what could happen
Im still hitting ""male"" on job applications and housing stuff and it always makes me grit my teeth
They didn’t lmao
[deleted]
Most schools have residency requirements for traditional freshmen (18-19 year olds) who don’t live with their parents within a certain distance. That’s normal. However, the school should have gender inclusive housing.
Not necessarily. I’d say mandatory gender segregation needs to end, but there are definitely people who would be wildly uncomfortable in mixed gender residences, and that’s ok too.
It’s not Georgia
Why Do People Talk Like This? What Is Being Communicated?
seems more they didnt think about it hard enough when adding other.

They only have binary roomates allowed. this isnt too shocking as enbies are kinda rare. 

however, the numbnuts just tied it to the gender variable out of laziness, instead of giving an option when you select ""other"" of ""do you want a male or female roomate?"" they force you to pick a binary gender to identify as just to get housing
Who are the right people exactly?
Considering
I can look into it
I work in higher ed, this practice is actually very common because of FERPA regulations. It's moreso about verifying that any personal information released is going directly to the student, not a family member/other person accessing their email or attempting to make changes to their enrollment or student records.

Edit: just want to clarify I do think this dorm policy is transphobic and horrible!! Not defending them in *any* way.
I think the person they are dealing with is a dumb ass.
“Drive a truck through this” ❤️❤️❤️
They want to prevent bluetooth pregnancy
No. I’ve contacted the women’s and gender center though. If needed I’ll speak to the dean and res life head.
They should do a better job at specifying this if that’s the case. It comes off much differently.
Agreed, database changes for existing fields can be Super Messy, risky, and expensive, especially if there are multiple systems referencing the existing field for gender. Like, yeah, they may have a plan to fix it but it's not as easy as a switch to flip.

The email says that you can't use the *form* without selecting M or F, but presumably there's another way to get into the system, although it may be more likely that they'd put you either with a roommate of a gender you don't mind rooming with, or in a single room like is often done for on-campus students with some types of medical needs. Definitely get in touch with whatever DEI office is available.
Trolls will not be tolerated.
This one is free 💀 

Not like entirely but I have the most scholarships for this one. I go to almost completely free, whereas I can’t do that with the others I applied to.
Also look for the university ombudsman or human rights director. Most universities, at least in Canada, have one - they mediate and resolve conflicts like these and advocate for students' rights.
Gender Studies is also a key phrase to lookout for.
From my understanding, most schools in the US have them, not all of them (probably). Though I am unsure where else they might be commonly found.

The university I currently attend has one, and they are pretty prominent on campus
Most universities in the Netherlands have them now too, although that's a change in the last few years. So they haven't done that much yet, but at least they're trying.
In my uni (uk) each subject has an EDI (equality, diversity and inclusion) officer who helps deal with this kind of stuff, plus the university wide EDI team
My mental health clinic in the US has one!
I mean in the US they, too, still think it’s sci-fi, which is why it’s commonly uncommon. Outside of schools, some big name companies and startups have these Directors as a way to be “forward thinking”. I had one at a startup company I worked for and she was trash. When BLM broke out she outwardly admitted that she had bouts of micro-aggression that she displayed that she didn’t even *know* was her being inherently racist. So lmao. Again, in the US it’s sometimes sci-fi to us too.
Work at a school in the uk and we have an equality and diversity officer and the college I attended had a equality and diversity student team who were representatives from different minorities who would arrange outings and such.
If this is Georgia Tech, DM me and I can set you up with the right resources (posting both here and on the main thread because I know Reddit notifications can be weird sometimes).
Or it is simply performative inclusion with no intent to ever actually back it with solid policy.
i appreciate the effort but not quite inclusive enough 😅
Your state ACLU might want to hear about your situation if you want to try and challenge it.
Your state's attorney general would likely be interested regardless.
Interesting. Wasn’t the same for my college although you did lose out on certain privileges for not living on campus. Thanks for educating me
I think if you applied that sentence to race you might realize how prejudiced it is
As I Am But One Lowly Person, And Not A Hivemind Of Everyone Who Types This Way, I Unfortunately Cannot Tell You Why People Do It.
I'm not sure, I have went there in over 6 years. You could maybe contact the Lambda organization and see if they or their sponsoring professor could help.
Ohhhhhhh ok. Very interesting, and I learned something new today!! Thanks for the info!!
Hehe I got it from my dad and i love it so much! It’s such a fun phrase!! 💛💛💛
Cool! The closest thing to a Diversity and Inclusion director in Italy is my italian professor that literally said to me ""Sorry, I can't use the correct pronouns because as a teacher  I have to follow the school's rules. Maybe I can respect your pronouns outside of the school's building""
or even meant to 'weed out the undesirables' while maintaining the facade of virtue.
Also very possible.
I was thinking this too. But that just opens them up to even more controversy and backlash to have it and not honor it than to just not have it. Or to just outright ask for AGAB instead.
What's the process for that?
I might look into it
It's valid to feel uncomfortable around particular people but using trauma as an excuse for sexism should no longer be tolerated in 2023. I am a transgender man who has experienced plenty of abuse from cis men. Still I do not say that I don't trust men because, as a man, I understand how crushing and dehumanizing those kind of prejudices are.
Yes if I said that about race it would be racist. What is your point?
yes thank you for the scathing social analysis no shit you could have very easily just said why you do it.
That’s sucks. I’m so sorry your pronouns aren’t being respected. Also what the duck (typo but decided to leave it 😜) kind of post-secondary institution (or anywhere for that matter!!!) has rules saying “disrespect queer & trans people, and whatever you do, don’t even respect a person’s pronouns and use the correct ones if you want a shot at tenure here.” Are they also required to deadname or wtf?
We've got similar things in Germany beside focal points for harassment and stuff... But the politics are very complicated, if something happened you can talk to them but actually they can't do anything for the protection of the victim, they can't exmatriculate or suspend the first abuser as this can only be done by the university and they just won't do it...
I would think it could be a bad idea to put trans fems in a male only residence
Every state has its own chapter and each chapter has a contact form. I live in Oregon so mine looks like this : https://www.aclu-or.org/en/about/contact-us

I used to work in the legal nonprofit world and would reply to intake emails like these. Even if it's not something they would want to take on they should be able to point you to an organization that would.
Unfortunately I Don't Actually Know Why I Do It, So Even That I Could Not Say. I'm Sorry I'm Not Able To Be Of More Help To You.
Actually yes. Professors always used deadname with me. That sucks. It's called italian school system
It is, but this school doesn't seem like it would care or even accept that the student is trans.

Maybe the initial scenario I was introduced to the school made me a lot more cynical about it than logical.
My trans femme friend at SCAD (Savannah, GA) back in 2012-2016 was placed in dorms with males… every single guy she was roommates with ended up moving out except the one bisexual dude🤦🏽 Hopefully things have changed but who even knows! I wasn’t identifying as non-binary at the time so things like housing kinda just went over my head. I had already been conditioned into a gendered society since I went to an “all-girls” HS from 7th-12th grades…
I mean putting anyone in gendered housing that doesn't match their identity is a bad idea. Not just women in men's spaces
pensavo che da noi le cose fossero migliorate... mi spiace :( restero' in california
the letter says ""you'll go whichever you identify as"" which looks like they're inviting trans people to identify as male or female... but erasing non-binary people?

omg so many compliments! thank you so much for your kind words. you rock too!!
Aww thanks ❤️
Thank you so much! It's my favourite shirt lol.
aww thanks! 

i needed a short title and have heard people saying that they were ""feeling very gender "" and decided to try it out. 
i am also someone who doesn't always feel gender, and by that i mean that sometimes it feels more like i have no gender whatsoever than I do a gender.
in the moment that the photo was taken i was very much feeling my gender and feeling like i had a gender, and i was also experiencing gender euphoria.

so saying that i was feeling gender just felt like the best way to describe the situation concisely.
thank you so much!!! 😁
oh gosh, why thank you so much for the kind compliment friend! 💜
thank you! that's honestly a huge compliment!
thank you!!
🥰🥰🥰
aww thank you so much!!! 😁
thank you so fricking much! i do try to live the bard life as much as possible and it's nice to know when I get the vibes right
thank you so much for the kind words! 🥰
thank you😁
ahhh thank you so much 🥰
oh hell yeah! thanks!
thank you so much!!
aww thank you so much!! 😁
oh ok, thank you
i've seen it around and just wanted a short caption tbh.
 for me i view it as more of i am feeling really euphoric about my gender. there's also another personal reason, which is that i don't always feel a strong sense, or even a sense, of gender a fair amount of the time. when i took this particular photo  i was feeling euphoric about my gender and was also just experiencing gender instead of the usual meh.
aww shucks, thanks 🥰
Your welcome :]
Amazing hair and eyes!
Thanks so much for you explanation. That makes a lot of sense. I almost never feel a gender. That’s probably why I was clueless. I wonder if I am gender avoidant? I once saw a filter of my afab self with a beard. That was as close to gender euphoria I ever got. Then I got a short hair cut and hated it.
You’re so very welcome!!! <3"	ucoxzx	NonBinary	1546	1.0	2022-04-26 22:48:47

I'm gender non-conforming but when it comes to a certain stuffed shark from IKEA, I conform.		"Do. Do we All own this shark from ikea???
You’re so gorgeous omg!
Blahaj pride
i have to say, you're hot  respectfully ofc
Blahaj is friend to all
Is shark ownership gendered?
And I am so here for your gorgeous self.
So-called ""free thinkers"" when they see a funny shark
I fully intend to take a trip to Ikea at some point (the closest is 328 miles from me) just to buy one of these sharks.
You look so good! 🔥
I'm so jelly that you have the stuffed shark but I do really like your shirt, so pretty
You look great
I have that same shark
We all getting sharks now?
I need to shop at ikea soon
Well,shit. Apparently I need to stop at Ikea.
At least one minimum
Yes. But I only have the small version. And a tiny one I sewed myself.
guilty 😭
Yes.
I thought it just came standard with the welcome package...
I don't (yet) own this shark from ikea does anyone have a link to this shark from ikea?
wtf i do this is wild
I do
Thank you! I just saw your posts - congrats and welcome! You are slaying!! 🤗
Thank you!
Spread kindness, and you shall receive the blessing of Blåhaj, regardless of your identity.
Not at all gendered but very comforting 🦈
I think technically it's been associated with transfems for longer or something? but it's definitely just a trans thing in general lmao
Aww thank you! 🥰
Thank you so much! 🤗
Thank you! I believe I got this henley tank on sale at Kohl's
Thank you! 😊
Is this an enby thing? Do I need to plan a trip to ikea? Should the mods make this shark our sub profile pic?
It’s a really nice shark plush. Perfect size for hugs.
OMFG You actually replied AAAAAAAAAAAAAAA \*Gay panic\*
Nah, that's some recent invention. It's been a trans thing far longer than it's been a transfem thing.
Any time!! :DDDD and thanks! I'll hopefully find it:D
I’m like 99% sure that the ikea shark is an lgbtq icon
Specifically a trans icon
it's because blåhaj loves you no matter who you are, and probably also because a while ago ikea ran an ad campaign featuring blåhaj that was advocating for marriage equality in switzerland (https://www.werbewoche.ch/en/werbung/kampagnen/2021-09-09/ikea-schweiz-und-crk-engagieren-sich-fuer-die-ehe-fuer-alle/)
I'd better be heading there ASAP then  who cares about the hour drive if it gets me this shark dude

South Asian enbies—I am looking for a gender-neutral name		"I have narrowed my search to these. Which one of these suits me the best 🥺

Thangam

Arul

Bala

Ezhil

Muthu

Selvam

Thayn (Thaen)

Edit: Thank you everyone for your help and support ❤️
Can’t contribute to the topic, i aint south asian, but wanted to say that you look awesome
Yoooo u look so cool

nuriyah is a cool name
I am South Asian but I didn't choose a gender-neutral name from a South Asian language :(
Hi! I am a Tamil enby. It's just so good to see you here! Feel free to dm if you ever wanna talk
I'm West Asian, but I like Ezhil anyhow 😋✌️
Ezhil is an amazing name! But it's your choice lovley, and I know whichever name you pick will be amazing❤️
I feel like Nayan would suit you very well. Or Nazar. I dunno I think something to do with eyes would be a good choice of name for you.
Sabin
Thayn is cool!
How about *stunning* (jk, but you look amazing and are androgynous goals)
I dig Ezhil or Thayn for you!
I skim-read the title and somehow got ""astral enbies"" but that still works lol
All names are pretty but I really like Thayn
Muki
oh my goodness you are adorable
Bala
well i feel like bala for no reason but its just a really cool name :)
I am a month late to this post. I found this post when I was looking for tamil enby names for myself. I was thinking Karpagam. But I think I am going to go with Podhigai. All the best. You look great!
Imo you definitely look like an Erin/Arin. Ik those aren't South Asian names but I'm throwing these onto the table in case you like them.
Blaine maybe? (Btw you look gorgeous!)
How about Kai?
Nass
I think either Ezhil or Mathu, but tbh all the names are awesome! I hope you find a name you’re happy with 🤍💛💜🖤
I think Bala suits you best. You look amazing!
i can’t really contribute but i love the name Arul
I love the name Ezhil and i think it suits you! Love the eyeliner btw
i’m thinking selvam ezhil or thayn
Ezhil or selvam?
Bala, Arul or Thayn! Thanks for improving my reddit feed 😍
I like Bala
Oooh the name Thayn is so pretty!
Arul or Thangam seem to suit you best imo (:
Bala sounds awesome.
Arul or ezhil, ezhil sounds bad ass tbh <3   


also HELLO, how are we KILLING it with the eyeliner?
Arul sounds good.
These are all so pretty!
Bala or Muthu! I think Bala feels more you :)
I think bala suits you the best also nice pic!
Arul or Ezhil ! They really suit you !
tamil enby, muthu feels the most gender neutral and most ""name""-like if that makes sense (thaen and thangam are more nicknames; arul, bala, ezhil and selvam are perceived as more male)
Same!!!
That’s alright! Nice to meet you. I’m sure you chose an amazing name for yourself <3
romba nandri ❤️❤️❤️
Thank you! Both of those are so gorgeous 😍 Isn’t Podhigai the name of a hill? I really like it
Thank you very much for your support
Thank you for your advice. I actually know women irl named Bala and Ezhil, which is why I perceive them more as femme names >-< It’s so interesting how names get gendered in different contexts
I’m a Tamil trans guy!! So not quite the same but gang gang
Yes! I only found out it's the name of a hill recently. I used to think it was the name of the TV channel DD Podhigai, haha.

When you speak a gendered language and people you don't know well can't tell what gender you are so they jump from feminine to masculine form 20 times in one sentence		"I live in Poland and because of that a lot of people know because i refuse to misgender myself the most awkward is when people ask why im talking so weird tho
alternative (improbable) good ending: they know and they're doing it on purpose :-)
In German their are debates if you should use ""ens"" (the middle part of ""Mensch"" the German word for human) instead of pronouns 🙈

I mostly use no pronouns like just ""Good day X Y"" instead of the gendered greetings.
In Egypt, some people in the street would use masculine pronouns when they get confused by my appearance (visibly female, just with short hair and ambiguous clothes), but it's to disrespect me. Arabic is a strictly gendered language that you don't even have a neutral way to address yourself, and Egyptians in general don't understand the concept of gender. For them it's insulting to ""misgender"" someone and they do it for people who generally don't conform to norms, like men with long hair or soft voices...

Being non binary here is like living with a nonstop air raid siren.
Everyone thinks I am a man 🥲
American Genderfluid learning German here, if I switch out gendered nouns and articles would that sound weird? E.g: Ich bin eine Mann? Ich bin ein Frau?
Problem solved with “Hey, what are your pronouns?”. Done
Feels good tho, doesn't it?

When you can tell they can't?
I've always wondered about this with gendered languages.
God I wish
Am exmos but not out yet and at church today one of the people went to another person about me ""she- he- he [insert the rest of the sentence]"" which was nice
Only reason they got it to he at the end was bc they remembered that i am the ""son"" (AMAB sadness) so yn
Sometimes when I’m typing in French I will purposefully not feminize past participles that relate to me. Although a lot of ppl make the mistake of not doing it anyways so no one has noticed yet lmao
It's still a win even if the only one who notices is you! Revolution non binaire!
I feel like this is a real thing.. for real i'm so unconfortable with my native language that most of the time i have really hard time to express myself. 
I recently went to usa and i was amazed on how easy it was for me to speak without ever thinking of that !
the nonbinary urge to please fucking normalize inclusive language 😭
That's why we have the super useful word, they.
Honestly my plan once I get fluent in French
This really confused me until I realised you meant languages that have gendered words like in German etc.
I speak Spanish and I just go by any gendered ending (-a/-o/-e) even though I only use they/them in English. It's just like, I'd be setting myself up for long explanations otherwise, not into that.
God I Would Absolutely Love That.. Like The One Advantage Of Gendered Language Lol.
I relate lol, I don't know how how Polish works, but in Italian I can only use ""have"" auxiliary verbs to avoid final vowels, and when it comes to adjectives I just blurt out a mix of ""A"" and ""O"". Or, I defeatedly use the masculine form and accept it as neutral enough, sigh
Really? I use -łom (also in writing in non-formal setting) and so far no one asked me about it. I've been using it only for like a year and I live in the capital tho.
That's how I read it first go ♡
A friend introduced me to dey/deren! Still trying to get used to it but I really like using it. Besides that I also use no pronouns or masculine ones to distance myself from my AGAB lmao. 

So glad my husband and I are only speaking english w/ each other so I can use they/them 24/7 with him.
Oh gosh, I hope you’re practicing HEAPS of self-care and affirmations, my love ♥️ keep manifesting change
There is a neopronoun called ""er*sie"", so you have femine and masculine in one :)
My german is a bit rusty (also American who learned German) so take this witha grain of salt and probably research a bit more after, but in German when you are saying ""I am [blank]"" and [blank] is something like a profession or qualifier that is a uniquely human trait (ex: Doctor/Teacher or German/American) then you omit using ""ein"" unlike in English.

In English you would say, ""I am a Doctor"" or ""I am an American"", whereas in German you say ""Ich bin Doktor"" or ""Ich bin Amerikaner"". And fun fact: this is why a famous line from JFK's speech at the Berlin wall was technically incorrect: ""Ich bin ein Berliner"". ""Berliner"" is slang for a regional donut from the city, so because of the aspect of German grammar I described above, ""ein Berliner"" would be interpreted as ""a donut"" instead of ""a resident of Berlin"" in the context after a human subject in the sentence.

Of course this doesn't address the gendering of the professions/human categories in German which unfortunately I am not well versed in the available gender-neutral solutions... (for those unaware, all the German examples I gave above, the speaker would be assumed male and those words are usually the default in the language)

Edit: sorry I didn't fully address your exact question- got caught up in the explanation. So yeah, I think using the opposite ""ein/eine"" of ""Mann/Frau"" would come off a bit strange unfortunately. Like I mentioned above, German is particularly tricky to fuzz the gendering of, at least in FORMAL circumstances. I'm sure in casual conversation you wouldn't have to gender every word/person in the grammatically correct context.
To be honest if you have an accent and people don't know you then they'll probably think you just can't speak well. So yeah it sounds weird and wrong.

But so does every ""ungendered""/ neutral solution, because they're all rather new and ""made up"" so most people wouldn't even understand what's going on. People have been using neopronouns and even used ""dey/dem"" (not sure if I spelled that correctly), so basically a denglish version of they/them.

Also a little note about your example: der/die/das and ein/eine all things like that are more random and people just got used to that. It's not like we try to indicate gender or any kind of value or information by using these. I think saying ""eine Mann"" would be like saying ""die Mann"". That doesn't really change how we gender or think of the person. Like if we talk about objects then a table is male, a door female, dolphins all male and so on.

Hope that was somewhat informative. I apologise if it was confusing, it's 2am for me^^
Sometimes they ask if i'm ""a male or female"", which makes it worse because I gotta pick 🙃 being non binary is understood only among SOME teens and younger people, but unless you're at pride, it's hard to encounter an understanding adult, or even peer. Confusion works best
French is my first language and honestly I  wouldn't pay to much attention to that in casual correspondence. It's actually pretty brilliant.
Right, because an English gender neutral pronoun that is still not fully accepted across the Anglosphere is applicable to every single language ever
In polish you need to use pronouns non stop you can try avoid pronouns but it's hard and mostly sounds weird so i mostly talk about myself as he
Could you use the E sound as some folks are starting to do with Spanish? Or would it be too much of a stretch for people to understand? My queer Spanish speaking friends do a lot of ""hola amiges"" and stuff like that
Thank you so much ♥️ I'm blessed with an accepting group of friends and a sweet partner. They make life way easier.

Manifesting change and acceptance for all of us ❤️🕯️
Oh how do you use it? I only know how to use der, die, das, ein, and eine so far 😭
Thank you for the info! I didn't know you refer to yourself as a profession or nationality almost like a name.
Not confusing at all! When I learn more of german and more about types of speech and sentence structure I will probably understand it more and may even find my own denglish to use.
Simply say « no » lmao
Yeah lmao it’s just. Pretty impactless tho
Sorry there I go forgetting about non English languages again 🤷
Wait, you speak of yourself in the third person often?
Or is first person (""I""/""my"") also gendered in Polish?
Same
That sounds much less complicated than what i'm doing, but unfortunately E is plural for feminine A (almost always), (while I is plural for masculine O). The only remaining vowel is U. That's goofy... will consider
Younger generations use denglish quite a lot. Sadly it's more natural for me to just use an english word or phrase in a sentence because it made more sense, than it is to use any genderneutral terms.

I imagine german is a tough language to learn. If you have questions or anything you can dm me.
I'm sorry, but was that not kinda implied in ""speaking a gendered language"" in the title?
No in Poland you use pronouns everytime when you talk about your self like 'i did(he)"" means in polish ""zrobiłem"" ""I did (she)""- ""zrobiłam"" ""i did(it)"" -""zrobiłom""
[deleted]
woowww, they really sucked almost all the vowels into gendering things, that's annoying. I hope you find something that works. I've read that Italian has a lot of complicated tenses and conjugational things so I wish you good luck!
Thank you! It's been somewhat easy compared to when I *attempted* to learn japanese. My biggest struggle is the pronunciation of vowels, distinguishing umlauts from regular vowels, and pronouncing Rs.
I said sorry 🤷
Why do I feel like I'm about to get banned 😹
You have gendered combined object+verb.
That's so interesting, and sucky. 🤯
damn 
imagine working your ass off to pass, moving to sweden, and immediately getting called “hon”
That's funny, I'm attempting to learn japanese right now.

I think pronounciation is generally hard to learn from english to german or the other way around. I remember I couldn't spell single letters in english for some time and for example ""a"" in english is kinda pronounced like ""ä"" in german. I can't think of anything that's special about our Rs - all I know is that I can't roll them :D
I prefer English because i can say anything without need to use pronouns like he/she/they i also like idea of xenopronouns
It just feels hard to say the ""french r"" right. What I know is it sounds a little like clearing your throat. Mostly the vowel issue is just hard time memorizing sounds and letters. The e is probably the easiest for me since it sounds so unique.
There's a few languages with no gendered pronouns, though afaik they're all outside the Indo-European family. We should collectively adopt one and exclusively use it in communication with other enbys.
I had to look ""french r"" up - I didn't know there was a difference! Either it's a subtle difference to english, or I'm just tone deaf and don't hear the difference.
Now I'm imagining a bunch of people just randomly starting to learn Finnish, it's hilarious because as a Finn you don't expect to find any Finnish speakers outside Finland, Estonia, and Spain.
Swahili is pretty neat!
Lmao yeah! It either sounds like a dropped are which sounds like ""fella"" compared to ""feller"" or like im going ""aghhe"" instead of ""are""
I think you're doing it right. Funny to see german pronounciation ""translated"" into english sounds :D
Lol yeah best I can do typing it out without being able to record myself talking
I think understanding is easier than talking and a good first step. When I learn Hirogana I go from connecting sound (written in latin letters) to symbol, then being able to type/ know the sound without seeing sound to pick from, and then actually drawing the symbol myself. So far the pronounciation makes sense to me, but I'd struggle a lot more to learn it if it didn't. Also writing is harder than reading. It feels like nothing sometimes, but it really is an improvement to go from reading to writing and listening to speaking.
Thank you! That's great advice!"	wo7a12	NonBinary	1533	1.0	2022-08-14 14:10:02

It’s also my middle… I’ve actually been wondering if I could pull it off 😬
Carlisle
Raven
Asher? Maybe seems fitting
Aaron!

Ezra's one of those names I never think about, but love with all my heart.
Elwyn sounds lovely! Thanks (:
idk about france, but here in Québec Camille (pronounced Kam- eeye) is pretty fem. But my grandad is named Camille (pronounced kam-ill). Which is supposedly masc but people""ll call you the fem version cause it's the only one they heard before.
I was actually just about to say isn't that not the capital of Ukraine
Aspen-Sky works as a hyphenated name too
I thought Morgan as well
Wow I love the story behind it! Mythology is awesome. 

And thanks, I worked hard on this pic (:
🤌🏻
Middle name: Bread
Oh how about Asher
Clyde sounds way cooler than me :b Thank you!
River would be a great choice!
Oh Yes Charlie fits
I always feel that's a more male name mainly because I know a trans guy called Finn I call him my little brother even though he's not actually my brother it's a sort of non bio family thing
""Can you hear the silence""
Kris
Offensive? My friend, this just made my day, thank you!
Idk if dylan is a neutral name but I saw dylan

Val can also be short for a lot of names
Valerian,  Valentine , Valeri,  Valley,  or just Val
be careful theres alotta elves named elenwyn
Dude, so was my grandfather! Is this how i find out my cousins use reddit??
I went through about 50 different name ideas because of that same reason. It's difficult to separate those mental images of those we know from our lives. But that's totally understandable
Exactly why would comparing a non binary person to the Norse god of mischief who is actually canonically genderfluid we're a naturally mischievous people /j
Even my DnD character lol (almost, at least)
Yeah like Chris is a gender neutral name but because my deadname was Christopher and I was named after my dad Chris it's difficult to shake thar mental image"	qwmvmp	NonBinary	1518	1.0	2021-11-18 10:27:32
What are some resources or pieces of wisdom you wish you’d had when you were first questioning and exploring your gender? I’m curious to hear your thoughts!		"[deleted]
That gender doesn't mean the same thing to everyone. I got so stuck in the narrative of ""gender is a feeling"" that I forgot to work on what it meant for me. For me it's much more about the way I present, and then comes the feeling. Before that I kept waiting for a feeling that never came.
I wish I knew that my experience as a black trans person would not always align with white trans experiences.
You don't have to restrict your gender identity just to appease others, especially when they aren't supportive anyway

When I was first questioning, I considered numerous identities, nonbinary, genderqueer, genderfluid, demigirl, etc. But I eventually kind of put these out of my mind, and focused on being a binary trans woman, as I felt that would be easier to explain to my parents

It wasn't

I've since been able to explore my identity more, and while I still heavily identify with ""woman,"" I also see myself outside of the binary, and am still figuring out exactly where I fit, or if I even need a place to fit

I don't feel regret for identifying as I did, but I do sometimes wonder if I would have been able to figure things out quicker if I didn't limit myself like that
I had a reddit account at that time and wish I would have talked about it in an appropriate subreddit.   Instead I just kept it to myself and when I did come out I was berated, so I went back into the closet for a long time.   I'm still not completely out yet.   Like, I shaved my head and dress how I want, but I'm nervous to correct anyone who uses the wrong pronouns, even scared to tell my friends.   I feel like had I just stayed out then I wouldn't be having these difficulties now and maybe Reddit could have helped me through it.
It’s ok to mourn the idea of the life you imagined for yourself when you were still living as and trying to conform to your assigned gender.
That you don't have to have dysphoria to be nonbinary or trans. I was in a transmed rabbithole for a long time before I was able to climb out.

What really helped me was seeing nonbinary people just *being people*. I had previously only seen them on tumblr, and drawn conclusions about nonbinary identity being an online-only thing.
Gender is a journey not a destination. There will always be ups and downs and changes and that’s okay. You’re allowed to change your mind about things or be unsure about things and you don’t have to adhere to a label or definition. It’s yours and no one else’s so just make yourself happy.
That instead of defining your gender based on what makes you dysphoric you should instead look at what gives you feelings of euphoria and comfort

because being trans isn't about suffering its about learning to embrace femeninity, masculinity, abdroginy or maybe all at the same time or none at all, and being happy with yourself, which is why I hate truscum rethoric so much ESPECIALLY as a person with extreme amounts of dysphoria, I still don't think it's a requirement to be trans
Admit its an experiment and admit you don't have to fit perfectly into a certain label. You can be femme and not want to wear a dress, or be masc but still do some training to get your voice higher. Its about what makes you feel comfy in your own skin, not about cis or trans or gay or straight norms.
There are no rules. There can be no “am I allowed?”, “Can I?”, or questions of validity when it comes to someone’s inner world and experiences.
-Clothes are just fabric and anyone who says they're inherently gendered is wrong.

-It's okay to question your gender and explore, even if you discover you're cis.
Your gender identity DOES NOT have to be a large part of your identity. For context, technically I’m agender. When I was a kid non-binary was not past of the lgbt vocabulary where I was. But now I’m the internet age I got real confused by other people equating agender with nonbinary, and all the extreme level of gender performance many trans and non-binary people show. I don’t mean that in a negative way, just that their association and relationship with their gender is a much more significant and meaningful part of their identity than for me. I thought there was something wrong with me, I thought I was doing it wrong bc I was missing out on all this super gender focused performance. But then I thought about it for a second, duh of course I’m not like that, because I don’t identify with gender in general. Gender is not important to me. I do not desire to discuss gender as it pertains to me.

I guess the moral of this story is, however YOU feel, is right. Do not try to change anything about yourself to conform to labels, or to follow trends, or to fit in with social gender peep pressure. Find labels that conform to you. 

Also, I would tell younger me that it there is a lot of internalized lgbtqia+phobia WITHIN the lgbtqia+ community. How’s that for confusing. Just like how non-binary is treated as the new bisexual, “something girls who want to feel special tell other people they identify as.” And to hear that kind of rhetoric coming from other trans people, other queer women, it’s pretty disappointing. So, don’t be confused by that, it’s a tangled sticky web to unravel, there’s lots of overlapping threads of ignorance and hate, not only from cishet people.
Ugh, the picture of this post is so my story.  I went through so much conditioning that I was a boy, meanwhile my head was always conflicted of wanting something, vs wanting to be something.  A BIG part of my journey at 34 is to let myself do the things I always secretly wished I could as a teen/early adult. 

TL;DR: dont let your inner voice be silenced from others expectation.  I spent literal decades thinking i was something I was not.
Stop trying so hard to put a label on yourself and being upset that nothing seems to fit.  You're going to keep putting yourself into boxes that you want to fit neatly inside when you really don't fit in any and are constantly in flux.   Don't identify as trans, nonbinary, gay, straight, bi, ace, or whatever.  Just identify as (my chosen name) and let them experiment freely till they figure it out.  Hell you may never figure it out, cause you still haven't 6 years later and that's okay.

Edit: it warms my heart and feels so validating to see so many others had more or less the same 'best advice'.  The first time someone told me to can the labels and just be me was the most important moment in my journey.
I wish I'd known how little gender would eventually matter to me - or how many options are out there! I transitioned before 'nonbinary' was a term in use and there was a lot of pressure to 100% embrace my new gender, even though it didn't really fit me all the time. It's been almost 20 years now and my perspective is so different. I am just myself, and my gender is whatever.

Also, that you don't need to choose it once and then commit for the rest of your life. Everything else about you will change with time. It makes sense that your sense of gender and identity do so as well. Be whatever makes you feel comfortable and don't stress too much about ""the rest of your life"", if you can.
That you can change your perspective on gender. It's not static. I went from thinking I was a trans woman to realizing I was non binary and now I'm questioning again about what I am. Still working it out but that's something I wish I knew was acceptable when I had the second bout of questioning.
Non-binary doesn't mean androgynous

Non-binary doesn't mean specifically being Agender

Non-binary means not fitting into the purely male or purely female box

You can express as your AGAB most or all the time if you want, and you don't owe anyone gender expression you're not comfortable with, and you don't have to express it differently to be valid. Even if you want to and are just afraid, that's fine. Even if you're afraid to tell people, that's fine.

Knowing you don't fit into one of those two boxes 100% of the time is completely enough.
That nobody can make you feel bad without your consent. If you are confident in yourself and not ashamed or fearful, it is very hard for others to successfully put you down. And 90% of passing is confidence! 

No hiding! Being out and honest and sincere without being pushy or offended gets acceptance a lot easier than the alternative. And the rare hard cases just look like jerks when they get up in your face and you are simply bored by it.

Also, it's completely OK to go and buy alternate gender clothing in your AGAB mode. Nobody actually gives a shit. They may ask you to use the AGAB dressing room if you want to try it on tho. <shrug>  Again, just acting like it is a normal thing to do is fine. You don't need to make excuses or get defensive. You are buying a pretty dress for yourself because you like it and are going to wear it. Whatever.

For MtF: Evidently hormones can work a lot of magic to one's appearance beyond just ""grow boobz"". If one thinks they are ""never going to pass"", and are willing to go the HRT route, they may be surprised. That being said, they may indeed ""grow boobz"", so be prepared for that if you are NB.

Hormones are now covered by insurance in a lot of places, with varying degrees of gatekeeping, so that might be an option to explore if you are interested and don't want to spend a lot of money. Even if you can't/won't do it on insurance, in the US at least there are other options that you can get them through Planned Parent or other places by ""informed consent"" and pay out of pocket fairly reasonable rates.

Also, it's fine to have multiple modes of presentation. It is ok to be on hormones and still have a ""boymode"" or ""girlmode"". Call it non-binary, or gender fluid, or whatever, doesn't matter. You don't necessarily have to give up all of your privilege just to express yourself.

You can live your life in the way that works best for you.

Your choice... is non-binary!
I feel better after reading all of these comments
Don't let gender exploration and thoughts overwhelm your thoughts. I spent far too long thinking about my identity on sleepless nights and questioning if I was faking it for attention or something.

It's not healthy to rush it and want to have all the answers at once. Take it slow and keep on pace.
The podcast Gender Reveal
that non-binary people exist and always have, especially within my culture! 
my culture felt so binary when i first started learning about it as a young teen, and i would get so depressed thinking about how i would just never fit into that despite how much comfort reconnecting to my culture brought me during that time in my life. although i still wish there were more resources available, i’m still thankful for all that i’ve been able to learn so far thanks to the knowledge my ancestors did manage to keep for so long. still, it would have been nice to know there was always a role for me to play in my culture’s stories and teachings as i was growing up learning them.
For me, it was the moment I realized that I didn’t *have* to be a girl. I could be a girl simply because I *wanted* to. I could be a girl who simply doesn’t always wear feminine clothing. If I want to, I can be a boy who *does* wear feminine clothing.

I’m not bound to any pronoun, clothing style, name, haircut, or role because of the body I was born in. I have free choice to explore all of them as I please, and don’t necessarily have to *choose one and stick with it.*

 I am free to just be who I am, at any given time.
I really wanted someone to describe those physical feelings for me since just hearing stuff like ""comfortable"" didn't sound right. 

I wanted more people to talk more openly about the struggles since what I was experiencing wasn't this overwhelming relief but an overwhelming fear due to being (and still am) deeply in the closet due to my family and not being able to trust the people I know. I wanted to hear how they never liked themselves for being nonbinary/trans even though it's a horrible thing to admit to yourself and feels like it is to others but that's what I was going through and desperately needed someone to relate to so I can finally accept myself and realise that's all society telling me that it's wrong and that I'm deserving of love. I needed someone to desperately open up about these emotions beyond a statement of stats and facts.

So yeah, that's the resource/wisdom I wish I had.
I wish I’d known more of what non-binary meant—or even that it existed. I came of age in the early days of the Internet, and conversations like this were very hard to find (at least for me).

The idea that there is something not only in between but outside the spectrum of masc and femme was something I learned very recently. It made my own gender identity come into focus, too, when I realized I could be transfem but still butch. Honestly, that one is still sinking in a bit, but it’s so central to who I see myself as.
#1. Nobody can or gets to define who you are. 
#2. Take it easy on yourself, its hard work getting to know someone. 
#3. Dont compare yourself to others. 
#4. Wait until you're emotionally stable before you date or take on responsibilities (new jobs) because people will take full advantage of your confusion. 
#5. Trust your instincts, you know what's best for you and what you need to be happy so take time to think about what makes you happy every day and focus on those things.
You don't have to look a certain way to be a certain gender. Gender identity and the way you look or dress or act have no correlation. If you're non binary and want to wear a pretty floral dress and awesome makeup, than you're still non binary. Lovely <3
your gender and sexual preference are not connected in any way, shape, or form. you can absolutely explore your gender or undergo a gender transition while continuing to be attracted to the same people you always have been.
You don't owe anyone androgyny as a non-binary person, nor is it more forgiveable to be misgendered if you are masc or fem presenting.
You’re allowed to change your mind when presented with new experiences, points of view, or feelings!

What I mean is, you’re not confined to the first set of pronouns, names, fashion styles, etc. that you chose when beginning your journey! I spent several years identifying as asexual, and later learned I was pansexual. Similarly, I’m still learning what pronouns I like and don’t like and sometimes what I prefer fluctuates. You’re allowed to change things up! Don’t feel bad if you don’t like the name you chose originally and decide to try using a different one, or if maybe one pronoun doesn’t make you comfortable like you thought it might. You don’t have to apologize for changing.

On a related note, it’s okay to not use labels! You don’t have to identify as one thing or another. You’re an ever-evolving experience, and your journey will look different from everyone else’s. There are no rules to this thing. Become ungovernable.
Fuck other people, they don't get to decide who you are. But also, even with that mentality shitty people will make you feel like shit.
I wish I knew what nonbinary was. I thought nonbinary was xenogenders. I definitely didn't identify as those! I closed myself off from a wealth of ways to identify.

For those reading this. Nonbinary is simply not a man, nor a woman. It's everything in between, outside, on top and below those two. Anything you can think of is nonbinary and it's up to **you** to interpret how to put it into words, not the labels.
I just wish I had any resources, I grew up in the really conservative south where even expressing these thoughts caused you to get hate crimed.
There is no way to “pass” or to “look non-binary”! Don’t fall prey to the stereotypes. Every group has them. If you feel that you are non-binary, you look non-binary.
yeah, no, other people really do look forward to puberty, you were the weird one
A lot of people don't have a fixed and inherent gender identity, and there isn't always ONE RIGHT THING to do if you're not committed to one specific transition goal.

My dysphoria isn't a choice, but a lot of the things I do to feel better are. Calling myself genderqueer instead of using a different term is a choice. I COULD settle for just calling myself something else and grow happy with that choice, but I like this choice. I deserve to be able to make that for myself. Going on HRT wasn't something I felt was a black-and-white, right vs wrong kind of thing - it was a choice I made informed of the changes and which would be permanent and which wouldn't if I regretted the choice, and what regrets I could live with. Since my gender identity isn't super fixed, it's more about if I can be happy and live with the choices I'm making- I probably could have done things just fine without HRT but I am happy on it so I stay on it.
For awhile I was very hesitant at telling ppl my pronouns (I would only tell those I was comfortable with). I was so scared at what others would think that I just accepted being referred to as she/her. And that shit hurts. But over time things are getting easier. I know the ppl close to me accept me for me and use my correct pronouns and that’s all that matters. Also wanting to get top surgery and get on a low dose of testosterone is something I used to second guess because I was thinking about how others would see me but now idc. I’m going to transition because I want to and it’s for me. So I wish I could go back in time and not give a shit and just do what makes me happy.
Therapy or a support group focused on internalize misogyny for people identifying as women.

When I started to unpack my internalized misogyny, so much love and acceptance opened up for others and then for myself. It was a really beautiful process, but I’m sad it took me until age 27 to realize what a detriment my biases had on my ability to connect with other people.
Makeup is a skill. You won't just buy some lipstick and mascara and eye shadow and immediately be good. You can't just do it once, focus on how not good it is and think ""I should get some clown shoes to go with this.""  Instead, go ""yeah, it's not how I imagined it would come out, but how do I feel with it on and what can I do next time to improve my technique?""

This really applies to anything, but fucking hell makeup is hard, especially when ou watch videos and none of them are beardy folks going ""this is how you rock a dark lip with a dark beard""

Posted from my clown shoes.
Honestly I wish I'd realized sooner that being perceived as good looking is way less important than being happy and comfortable with yourself
You don’t need to choose between “boy” or “girl,” and you don’t need to have dysphoria to be trans. You don’t even have to feel particularly strongly about it.
Someone kind of mentioned this but it was important to me.. you don't have to experience dysphoria to be a trans person. And there are different types of dysphoria. I don't experience a lot of physical dysphoria but i do experience social dysphoria. Let your questioning journey seek joy in your identity and not be framed around how much you don't like your body or other parts of yourself - my advice.

The second is that you don't have to totally have it figured out. The questioning phase of your journey can ""end"" without a definitive label. I knew i was nonbinary but spent a lot of effort trying to work through other sub-labels but i realized that's just not important or necessary for my identity to be valid. Maybe I'm gender fluid or agender. I'm not sure and that's okay with me ♥️
For me it is era, growing up it was just male female trans, gay straight bi trans - and the world was full of hate so much so i was scared to be me
45 and i have finally been able to be vulnerable enough to go here even amongst the hate in the world still
Probably a very common answer but:
Family means a lot (for better or worse), but they're still VERY capable of being prejudiced.
Sometimes, someone not even related to you can be your biggest supporter, while those that *are* related to you can be your biggest adversary.
This article: https://genderanalysis.net/2017/06/depersonalization-in-gender-dysphoria-widespread-and-widely-unrecognized/
An offline community. I've had to find it and now I'm maintaining it because it's difficult where I live. I wish I'd had a mentor or someone to guide me through the first two years of agonizing confusion.
Unrelated but that picture resonates wayy too much with me
first, ty OP for this. i really needed this.   


i've spent a lot of time thinking about this, maybe obsessing a little too much.  
food for thought: who/how would you be if it was an entirely different world. one post gender, post presentation, post who cares about judging you and you get to just be you.   


sometimes i feel all the genders. i often gaslight myself a lot too, esp bc a big part of who i was before learning all these ""new"" ways to express myself or identify i was super femme presenting (\*and sometimes i really loved it\*! <- this confuses me a lot lately).   
um, so i guess i dont have advice.   
oh! and family used to mean everything to me. my one parent meant so much to me. they still cannot let this go and need to bring up their views about it on a regular. its made me realize i need to see this parent as a human and off that pedestal i had them on as a kid. and if making them happy means i make myself not, its not worth it. its not new in our community for us to find found family. i think maybe its different for many cis or straight that maybe sometimes they can go on living the same life without their truth hindering that, but, if or when the truth for the LGBTQ2IA+ community changes the dynamic in the family in a negative or lesser than way, its okay to invest into found family too.   


I'm mid ish 30s and i've been trying to understand and figure this out my whole life. and i still have no idea and im learning here that its okay . What i \*do\* find comfort in is knowing that the more courage i have to be myself the more im also helping break down gender expectations, and im educating so many around me, that hopefully it will be easier for a few more after me, or maybe more people can see me and know its okay to be ones authentic self as I was not exposed to many people outside of the binary in my life.   


thanks for coming to my tedtalk. im hoping this helps someone. again, great thread, i really needed it.
There’s a book called “You and your gender identity” by Dara Hoffman-Fox, who I think is a gender psychologist? They have a YouTube channel! But their book is great. It’s interactive too, meaning it has spaces for you to write inside it. You can get it as a PDF on kindle!
experiment with different clothes and makeups even if you don’t seem particularly interested in it at first
To know that I could be gay and supported and know about most of the genders and sexualities
“We learn ourselves throughout our entire lives” -random person I met at a car show. Wasn’t even talking about gender but it hit me in a deep way that changed the way I’ve learned to accept myself
try wearing a wife beater under your binder, if it’s not too hot, until you can afford to use KT tape regularly (or trans tape, whatever). if it *is* too hot, put some baby powder on your chest and back under the binder.

i thought my testosterone was causing my bacne, but it ended up just being the material of my binder sitting on my skin. took me 2 years after staring t to figure it out. it hurt lol
DO NOT PUSH THOSE FEELINGS DOWN!!!!!! I would spend so much mental energy trying to rationalize within my mind why I was having these feelings. No amount of mental gymnastics is going to destroy or dampen feelings or dysphoria/questioning.
Honestly, just the knowledge that there were multiple genders. I knew about binary trans folk as a teenager, but I didn't even hear the term ""nonbinary"" until I was 28. I assumed I was cis until then, because being binary trans seemed worse for me than my AGAB, even though I intensely disliked most things about being my AGAB.
For the love of all that is good, do NOT use duct tape for that.  It is not worth it.  Trust me.  Your life is better not knowing the feeling of peeling tape off of your sensitive parts.
It’s ok to be wrong. Don’t force yourself to stick with one label. Gender and expression are what you make it.
Trans binary people have a very different experience from you, as well as very different feelings about pronouns and presentation. And that’s great! Just don’t assume that your wants are universal.
Liking things about your agab doesn't mean you're cis or less valid. 

You don't have to perfectly fit into a mold to use a label cus it's all a messy, confusing spectrum

Don't be scared to change labels or to avoid labels at all when discovering yourself. Finding the right label is half the struggle (or it was for me lol)
You don't have to fit either mold. Who you are and what you like are wonderful and normal.
I wasn’t aware of non-binary genders when I started questioning, and when I did hear about them the explanations were not great. I also didn’t know about puberty blockers or the full effects of HRT, the focus was on adults too not teenagers
Labels are just labels dont stress trying to find the right one just find the things you like and a label will follow. Find out how you like to dress, how you like to be reffered to anf things like that once you hve all that figured out a label will be easy to find
Pronouns =/= gender. Asking your friends or family to try using different pronouns doesn't mean you're committing to that gender and it doesn't have to affect how people perceive you. I know cis butch lesbians who use he/him and cis male drag queens that use she/her. Even before I realised I was non-binary I asked people to use they/them with me because it made it easier to separate myself from my AGAB experience.
You know yourself better than anyone else does.
Knowing what the trans community was and knowing that if there's s god they won't send me to hell if I dare to question their ""design ""
Just someone to explain depersonalization, that was the scariest part

I couldn't look at my face for six months, couldn't wear anything but a Tshirt and baggy pants, dissociating whenever wearing outfits I liked before

Once I changed my name and talked to my therapist about it, found some community here, then I could look at my face and express myself fully
I'm just accepting being non binary and am having a lot of anxiety. Reading yall helps a lot💜
It's okay to not know your gender, to not have a gender, and to experience both of these and multiple genders, all in one week. There's nothing wrong with being gender-fluid and it's actually pretty awesome sometimes.
i wish someone explained that gender theory regards agender as a gender. it would have changed everything.
I wish I would have had the recourse of a queer friendly community. I grew up in a small town, had the idea that being gay (let alone transgender/nonbinary) is bad forced down my throat by everyone around me. It took me moving across the state to Seattle to figure out my gender identity and sexuality, and I still have issues accepting myself sometimes.
Clothing is clothing… there are two reasons to wear it, warmth and comfort. Style is a preference and uniqueness is beautiful.
Don’t let others opinions about your gender sway you. Don’t let people get into your head. Figure things out for yourself and if things move around a bit let it be on your terms. I wish my baby trans siblings luck on their journey. <3
Don’t be afraid to ask for help, especially when you find someone who is from the queer umbrella and has been themselves longer than you have. They will be an immense help and can answer your questions and if they can’t, they may know someone who does know. 

Reach out. Ask for help. Learn and be willing to learn. Be okay with making mistakes. Above all else, be safe in how you go about exploring your identity and sense of self because they are people out there who will take advantage of you and exploit your naïveté and lack of experience. Be careful with who you choose to trust.
i’m still somewhat in the figuring myself out phase, but a big one is even if you don’t feel like you are enby, if you think that you are and it’s causing you that much distress, trust that you are. no one can tell you what you are except you.
There's nothing wrong with me for not identifying with my gender assigned at birth
nonbinary people are real (tumblr transphobes…) and you don’t have to be 100% sure.
It’s ok to be wrong. It’s ok to try things on. It’s ok for the answer to be “I don’t know”
Honestly I just wish there were more trans/NB people in public discourse. I didn't know being transgender was even a thing until I was like 16, didn't know NB was thing until a couple years after that. Made things a lot easier once I realized I wasn't the only person who felt this way.
Just because you don’t feel dysphoria doesn’t mean you’re not non-binary. Gender euphoria is quite powerful. 

Also maybe your curiosity about being bigender after learning it’s a thing is a bigger sign than you think it is. Don’t discount it just because you don’t want to be a man. You’re still stuck in the binary mindset. The spectrum is far broader than you can see at the moment.
The human brain is way more complex than we give it credit for. Sometimes it doesn't fall into the neat ""male""/""female"" categories and is often a combination of the two or none of them or something else entirely.
Two big things: 
A. There are more than 2 genders. When I first started questioning my gender I thought there was only male and female and that made it hard since I didn’t feel like either. 

B. If you aren’t right the first time, that’s ok. If you’re questioning your gender and label yourself as something, but later realize that label wasn’t quite the right fit, that’s ok.
don’t try to put yourself in a box straight away, just explore shit, see what happens, and figure out what it all means as it comes
Be prepared to be surprised by people's reactions to your gender. My loved ones acted opposite of what I thought they would. They didn't fit my experience into their life views, but they didn't make me feel like an outsider. Some of them are uncomfortable with certain aspects, but maybe this is less a gender thing and more a reflection on how we see other adults as we grow.
We don’t need to put labels or words on ourselves. 

We can if that’s something that helps us. Or we can use them to connect to other people, to convey a sense of how we might feel. They can also help with getting medical treatment even if it means simplifying the truth of how complex our gender can be. For example saying one is binary trans to get medical care covered by insurance or make it possible even. That’s also perfectly fine. Lying to keep safe or get treatment is fine. We don’t owe anyone but ourselves the truth about our gender identity. 

Also gender isn’t necessarily permanent. It can be for some people. For others it can be ever changing. Slow or fast. It can change when we learn new things about ourselves. It can change in some dimension and stay fixed in others. And that’s fine :)

The most important thing is, it’s your gender. No one else’s. It doesn’t need to please anyone. It doesn’t need validation. It just is. It’s okay to doubt yourself on your journey. It really is. It is okay to feel doubt around medical treatment. It is healthy to reconsider if you really want and need surgery or hormones or blockers. There is no “wrong” answer. And it’s okay to postpone treatment if you’re not sure. If it’s not the right time. It should be YOUR decision to make. 

Also: be careful around medical providers and insurance, you never know if they are progressive or gatekeepy as fuck. Only voice doubts when you are sure they’ll have no consequences. And if your care providers really suck and are pressuring you either way, it’s okay to go somewhere else :) 

Sincerely, one sad person whose top surgery got denied coverage by insurance because they are non-binary, which they are currently appealing because it’s not happening otherwise.
That there's no need to pick a side. When I first started exploring my gender I was sure I had to be a trans guy, since being a girl just didn't sit right. I was unessesarly confused when the answer was really simple, I just didn't know it was an option at all.
Not sure if this has been said already but the fact that you don't have to express your gender the way society expects you to.
There's a myriad of experiences and journeys. Some have similarities, but they all don't have to be the same. Your experience and journey is your own.

There's no such thing as being the ""correct kind"" of being nonbinary. There's no such thing. You're nonbinary, you just exist. I had so much anxiety trying to fit into the ""correct"" nonbinary trans narrative so I'm not considered a bad enby (I tend to dealing and unlearning internalized model minority shit. Classic flavor: with race and now new flavors: gender. Spoiler alert: >!They taste like shit!< . There can be a spectrum of good and bad people (just like with cishets).

You're not also a bad person for wanting to explore outside of the gender binary. Putting in spoilers cause it be triggering talking about self-hate and self-loathing >! I dealt with a lot of self-hatred and self-loathing because me realizing I'm a nonbinary woman will put me more at risk. And if anything bad happened to me, I should be blamed because I decided to ""become this minority"" if anything bad happens to me because I'm now part of the statistics and at even more of a risk for my parents to disown me. Despite the fact its not my fault, it's literally bigots' fault! It's not my fault if my parents decide to disown me, thats on them.!< Dealing with self-hatred and self-loathing is a thing and will take time. And take the time to work through and heal from it.

Labels are helpful but are not rigid end all be all rules and terms. They're more flexible and fluid than you'd think.

Its not bad to let go of friends if you've seen their transphobia. It can hurt depending on how deep the friendship is. But it's okay if you do. Don't beat yourself up with guilt over it like I did. Besides friendships end (as sad of a truth it is).

Remember our enemies are bigots, the patriarchy, white supremacy and racism, transphobia, and bigotry in general. It's not yours' or others' faults for people being prejudiced against a group.

Do what you need to survive.

Edit: Great way to explore your gender is to think if you were hypothetically in a place away from your close friends and family, how would you express and feel about yourself then. Cause sometimes you don't realize you restricted yourself in fear of rejection from supposed ""loved ones"".

Find a community and friends that loves and accepts you unconditionally. Just keep trying. Especially as an adult (cause it's hard finding friends as an adult). Look up eventbrites, groupmes, volunteering at places, etc.
If you have a trans friend, and that helps you realize your gender, you’re not stepping on their toes or trying to “jump the band wagon” to be cool. Birds of a feather tend to flock together even if they don’t realize what instinctual urge drove them together. And if binary trans (ftm/mtf) is all you know of, it doesn’t invalidate your feelings if you “only feel that way some of the time.”

Had I not been afraid of “messing up” socially, I could have started coming out in 7th grade rather than my 2nd year of college.
Gender means something different to everyone. It took years for me to let go of my obsession with being a ‘girl’.. like goose you were never a girl. You’ve always been you. Own it. 

Also you don’t owe anyone an explanation of your gender lol
It's okay to hide who you are from your family for a little while.  But you don't need to and should not hide who you are from the world forever.  And don't wait another ten years to see if you can get by in a life you're unhappy with.
cis people don't get euphoric butterflies when they're misgendered

cis people aren't typically preoccupied with their own gender. most cis people don't cry about their AGAB or routinely fantasize about being a different gender

if you perpetually hate living according to your AGAB or perpetually ""hate gender"", you're probably trans

if you're devastated you ""can't actually decide to be trans"" just bc you think you'll never pass or that you'll be unattractive, you're already trans and just in denial due to internalized biases

you don't have to have your gender all figured out to be trans. ""not cis"" is enough to claim your transness

nobody's experience of gender is precisely the same as anyone else's- even within the same gender. no two women have the same experience of their gender

many despair over not having the most accurate label possible and thus ""not knowing"" their gender. the secret is that you don't have to. don't sweat the micro labels unless they genuinely help you more than stress you.

focus on finding community and understanding from people who support you rather than finding a label and a possible handful of people who are exactly like you 

you don't have to be a particular gender to express yourself a particular way. you just have to learn what kind of expression makes you most at home in your body. the words often fall into place in time

if you have trans community in person and can safely go to events ir support groups, please try it. trans people are generally so much more welcoming irl than online. the algoritmo likes to push gatekeeping

don't fill your feed with impossible beauty standards. don't compare yourself to them and feel like shit

do no harm, take no shit. be kind to yourself and others. don't tolerate bigotry

take pictures! you'll be amazed to see how you've grown in confidence &/or expression someday

do a small thing (underwear, chapstick, favorite song, etc) to bring you gender euphoria every day, especially if you can't be out. it's a lifeline

false confidence becomes real confidence with practice 

enjoy the journey, even when it feels daunting. there is no final destination, and things can get better
I have no advice as I am still confused lol. I am also aro ace, and I know that’s different from gender but I think it complicates my feelings so it’s confusing.
Being yourself, the majority of the world doesn't care how you identify, just become the best you.
My friend is “fully” trans because he became a transman. I felt like I was only “partially” trans since I didn’t go all the way.

I was happy when I learned about agender, it was an option that let me realize that I just didn’t want to fully transition into the complete opposite.
Supportive parents
Don't be afraid to change up how you look and play around with masc and femme styles
Doing things for yourself that make you happy will always be more important than what some joe shmoe thinks, & if a label makes you happy and describes your experience then feel free to use it
The support of the culture in which I grew up.
That other people's feelings don't come before mine. Labels aren't permanent. It's ok if a label no longer fits. There's more than one way to be trans.
That you don't need to use a label if you don't want to. I use non-binary/agender because it helps me to explain it to others more, but I'm more just apathetic towards my label, while still wanting to transition.
You are not alone, and you are not a freak. That and a safe place to try it out, and learn.
Uhh

Idk

Everything worked out fine, there was no push back from anyone in my life while I explored
All of them. I just wish someone told me that I was allowed to do so like a century ago. I wish I'd had any resources or pieces of wisdom decades ago when I was young. I mean, I knew I was living my life as a lie, but I thought it was because of my ADHD and other non-standard personality traits. Hiding all of that, I hardly noticed I was hiding my gender & preferences, even from myself. I knew I wasn't like other guys, or like guys in general, but I didn't realize why. I wish I had.
Just knowing that non-binary was a thing when I was a kid would have made a huge difference. I always knew I was non-binary I just never had the words
I, an amab, was told ""this is what men should be"" ""this is how men should act"" and I had a night were I couldn't sleep and went ""I don't want any of that"" I had already figured out I was LGBTQ, I didn't know I was under that umbrella EDIT: at that time.
that having a deeper voice might not feel like me :( 
now I’m stuck with a deep voice that is too deep, and it sucks.
I wish that I was told that transitioning, not just from one binary to the other, was a valid and acceptable option.
just worry about being yourself
So this is a weird affirming thing, but I went to a French immersion camp this summer. French is a gendered language and though I was not yet comfortable enough to use the pronouns, it felt great w n they sent a document explaining how to use the pronouns. It also brought me to one of my most gender affirming points, in French, to use non-binary pronouns you need to know if you are all the genders are none of the genders. I am a person who works on binanaries, and for someone, an insutition, to ask if we were all the genders, none, or sometimes both, it was great to have the questions I needed to ask for my growth laid of for me a little, and it was great to get on campus and see that it wasn’t just me. 

I have discovered that I am all the genders, but probably more at specific times. In general, gender words are okay but don’t hit me right. I am currently a “bi-gendered cis female” but also. I am aware that this is a process and I am willing to see where this leads.
The knowledge if you put all the information people need to know up on your social media, in an attempt to answer all questions and control the narrative, people won't read what you've written and will instead make assumptions about your sexuality. I am tired of telling people things that I have already written down to prevent having to talk about it.
I ignored so many thoughts and feelings I had because my own self-image was so bad. If you’re dealing with a lot of negative thoughts it’s ok to question the validity of those feelings. Feelings are valid but they aren’t reality.
You don't have to hate every single part of your body 24/7, want surgery or go through medical trasition to be trans.

After finally accepting that I'm non-binary it felt wrong calling myself trans because I don't want to/can't transition. Even socially transitioning is tricky because I live in a shithole of a country (I want to change my name but I fear I would be targeted in some way).

I thought me calling myself trans was a mockery of 'actual trans people' who went trough expensive surgeries and HRT (even though my gender expression being fluid would've made it impossible anyways and I was experiencing severe gender dysphoria), but calling myself cis was anything but right.

That was in November 2021, now I'm just trying to enjoy living and do whatever I can to give myself euphoria.
As simple as this may sound, I wish I had someone to talk to about it. I didn’t know anyone who was out as genderqueer when I was questioning and that would’ve been so helpful.
Really don't think too hard about it. Go with your gut and experiment. :)
I wish that when I developed breasts, that when I expressed my extreme discomfort at wearing bras (because they accentuated them and made them stand out) someone had suggested I try sports bras or other compression.
Be authentically yourself, you do not (and should not) feel pressure to force yourself to fit a label. Make the labels fit you.
I dont have to look androgynous to be non-binary. There was a creator on TikTok that helped me be more comfortable in pushing boundaries and expectations. I can wear and like ""masculine"" clothing and style and still be non-binary.
You won't feel euphoric all the time. Like most people, you'll probably forget about gender most of the time, and it might even make you a bit uncomfortable to think about.

One of the weird things I experience is an inability to relate to my own past feelings, almost like it was another person feeling them. Experts disagree on why, but something that's really helped is just insisting to myself that it really happened. I think anything less is some kind of gaslighting, or maybe just being consumed by my fears and self doubt.
Ashley Wylde has a really fantastic YouTube channel that really helped me understand my place in the world :) lots of information about gender and labels and defining yourself that can help you feel safe and validated: https://youtube.com/c/AWylde
The religious denomination that I belonged to at the time was wrong. I had nothing to be ashamed of. God loves me regardless.   
Be bold, and be myself.   
Buy good heels, and do so proudly. Fuck anyone that questions me.
That your appearance should make you happy and excited without the need of someone telling you that you look pretty
If you decide to transition medically, hold multiple doors open. Don’t focus on one path. There are multiple ways to get there. 
I wasted 2 years going the official route and came out with nothing. No documents whatsoever. I thought I had to go that route to achieve my goals, but no. That wasn’t true.

Find people who are like you. I’m an Enby and I feel so good around other Enbies! I feel more at home and less depressed. 

I’m still figuring it out but: wear clothes that you like. Of course your safety comes first. But if you feel safe then wear what you want to wear, regardless of your gender (or your perceived gender). Experiment and have fun with exploring who you are :)
If I could, I would tell my past self that wishing you could be Genderfluid means that maybe you are?
If i had known as a child that non binary people even existed i would've figured out i was trans like 6+ years earlier
Being able to *know* who I am better (istg im using the term non-binary as a means to not unravel the goshdarn mystery, that makes fnaf lore seem simple, that is my gender)
[removed]
Its so normal to not know what gender you are if you even feel any gender. There's this idea that everyone knows what gender they are from the get-go but thats just not the case for everyone. Sometimes you need to to do even more resesrch, exploring, trying different names or pronouns or clothes or just sitting with yourself and your thoughts/feelings before being able to understand yourself and thats totally fine.
That I’m an idiot and get confused too easily lol, but where I am now? I’m…not happy but I’m content with what I have (not much at all that’s gender affirming)
That boy and girl aren't the only options.
Supportive parents
That it's okay to question your gender and if you end up deciding that you are cis after all, that's okay. Worry less about the destination and focus on where you are now.
Look for what makes you happy - follow that joy w/out distraction
Gender is a lie. Weave your own tale.
I always assumed your brain and genetics had to be different to be validated as trans but it turns out all you need to be trans is to feel it and that's enough.
I really like the book Is Gender Fluid? from the “Big Idea” series by Sally Hines
That I'm not a freak and have nothing to be ashamed of
tbh I feel like if I'd just known that there were gender options outside the binary (besides culture-specific examples) as a child I would have figured out my deal much earlier. as it is I was pushing thirty before I learned what being nonbinary even was.
Don't care. If it makes you feel happy or you think it will try it. Never be scared to experiment. Even years in don't be scared to.
I wish that you don’t have to look non-binary or any other gender to be that gender. I came out to a friend, and she though you somehow had to, and it just did not help
You dont have to identify a certain way to be allowed to change your gender expression, to be allowed to rename yourself, to be allowed certain pronouns or be allowed to consider medical interventions.
some badass tattoos and badbitch looking clothes like leatherjackets n stuff
That the concept of non binary existed
If you wonder if you're just faking it, most probably you're not. -OT
That cis people in general apparently see themselves in the mirror. (If I knew it was a thing, I would have realized I was trans sooner)
***THAT I DIDN'T HAVE TO CHOOSE BOY OR GIRL. I DONT LIKE THOSE ONES. THEYRE BORING***
You’re you and no one can say anything different
Understand
Honestly? Nothing. I thought of everything, and that was the problem. I overthought, I filled journals and read books and even WROTE my own book, lurked on subreddits and in trans tags, fantasized, obsessively questioning all the while. Some things just take time to settle into.
(spoilers refer to suicide/suicide attempt)

I wish that I just had a positive overview of the community rather than the overview I grew up with (a VERY religious environment and, basically, learned to hate myself, >!which led me to consider suicide twice!<). I'm lucky that I didn't succeed and soon found friends who were willing to support me and show me that positive overview that I needed. That small change led me to be more open about my experiences and to feel more comfortable with myself. Again, I know it's a small change, but it made all of the difference. >!I am confident that if I hadn't found these people, I would've attempted a third time and who knows what would've happened.!<
stolen from twitter “try redefining what gender is to you. when ppl say gender is construct they often never say how the construct is very evident in how ppl define gender in different places today. you are a person in a place and you have the right to define what gender is to you. make it something comfortable for you even if the thing is just throwing it out the window completely. figure out what it is that’s distressing, is it language associated with a gender, the expectations, etc and eliminate that from what you think gender is and adjust accordingly. for ex. if you feel like you identify with everything but the language you can identify as a woman who uses they/them. personally for me life became easier when i realized i don’t identify personally with any gender but have no problem with what i’m perceived as. how you perceive me is up to you because i redefined what gender is to me. redefine what it is to you because trying to put yourself in a box not made for you is uncomfortable. you have the right to live comfortably.”
Gender was made up by a bunch of monkeys that were lucky enough to have the best lips in the evolutionary tree that allowed our little brains to share and compare our stupid ideas and gain pointless validation from our clueless earthfellows.

Maybe I'm generalising...

But no one really knows what they're doing

thisthisthis. feeling like i’m obligated to stick with something is so stifling. realizing that life is ever changing and so are we is so helpful
Ohh I said pretty much the same thing before reading the top comment.  Seriously the best piece of advice I ever received in my journey!
So true! Your current spot in your journey isn’t your final destination ❤️❤️❤️ been thinking about that myself lately
""...human languages are crap at describing things more complex than assembling a tree house.""

John Scalzi, *The Collapsing Empire*
This this this!!!!! when i started realizing that gender rules for male-female were BS and not for me, i neglected to apply that thinking to identity *permanence*
Humans are constantly flowing changing creatures, we dont look the same 10 years apart, why would be think, eat, sleep, identify, learn, etc the same too?
There are people who view gender as how their body should be, or as pronouns, or as clothing. All those views are valid
Yeah i know what you mean. I got way more gender feelings AFTER i started really playing around with my gender expression and presentation.
Thank for this! I have recently been feeling the same way. Like, if I dress a certain way then I feel that way. But also, my mood & state of mind can greatly impact how I present myself too...
tysm for this comment. i feel myself almost tearing up (but cant cause im on t, and for me it does this). I have been searching for weeks or maybe 2 months trying to articulate this to myself. tysm for commenting.
This! I wish I knew this earlier. I was confused for so long because for me, it's mostly pronouns and the way I present. I'm genderfluid between fully woman (monogender) and bigender (nonbinary + woman), so the pronouns change for me and I know it changes when I get euphoria from being refered to as she/they. The feeling of my gender is very week and I mostly can't tell until I try she/they pronouns or have an urge to dress more... Flamboyantly queer if that makes sense?
Intersectionality is real! @ everyone: You can never be truly defined by just one thing.
Yes ❤️❤️❤️
Big same.
This is my exact story. I came out as gender fluid and got such backlash that I was like ok nevermind I'm a binary trans man. I went from one stifling box to another slightly less stifling box. Finally after six years I gave up caring what other people said and I'm so much happier and healthier now.
❤️❤️thanks for sharing! Hope someday soon you can be out and proud and have supportive people in your life!!
This is so true ❤️❤️❤️ Definitely experience this myself
The biggest singular ""thing"" that happened to me to push me towards being confident in my identity and coming out was an older person (not sure of their age exactly late 40s maybe 50s?) in my yoga class coming out. This yoga class was one in a somewhat conservative small city where most people were born and raised there, the regulars in this class (including this person) had been coming for the last 8 years or so. One day the instructor informed the class that this student had come out and preferred they/them pronouns and told us all their chosen name. To be clear this person and the teacher were friends and it was an appropriate announcement for the teacher to make. It was huge to me, them being confident enough to announce their identity despite living their life as their agab for the past 40 some years, while presenting mostly as their agab, and in a community not fully prepared to understand/respect it. Beyond that the reception of it by class was huge to me too, most people struggled with the name and pronoun change and some tried more than others, but there was no gossip or rude comments about it. It was just a thing that happened and was respected. 

Just seeing someone who I know come out and be who they are and have that confidence helped me so much in feeling like this identity is a valid thing and not something I'd made up. That I could come out and still be able to make friends and be respected. 

All that to say representation is huge and meaningful basically.
Can you tell me what trsnsmed means please?
This is so important ❤️❤️❤️
Thank you ❤️❤️❤️ so true!! There is pain and dysphoria but that shouldn’t be the center of our narrative
This is so damn true.
This
I agree very much with this.
Thrift stores in my studies are the best-ish for formalwear, which is peak ""Clothes are just fabric and anyone who says they're inherently gendered is wrong.""

Although I do lament on the daily that wearing a wedding dress on the daily is not only a large financial burden to purchase and socially looked askew at with aisles and cars too narrow for such gorgeous gowns, but also the ultimate ""you can't wear that on the daily"" for most people.

Shame.

EDIT: To make it abundantly clear, my wife of just over a year now is not only aware of my femme clothing tendencies but also supports me in expressing myself. She actually gave me the wedding dress she wore when we got married... so I get to wear that some days.
> Just like how non-binary is treated as the new bisexual, “something girls who want to feel special tell other people they identify as.”

Oh hey check it out, it's that same old chestnut: misogyny! Culture poisons us all.
I feel this. The biggest thing I gained from my gender discovery is that I have much more confidence to do the things that I like, without fear of what others think. I always had a feminine side in me and I never let it shine through. Now there's finally some change and slowly but surely I'm moving towards how I want to be.

When I look back, I'll probably wish I had done everything faster. But for now I'm just taking it slow while I figure out what **I** want and how I'll do it.
Thanks for sharing!! We should all listen to that inner voice. (Also, this picture is actually a panel from a comic I made, you can see the whole comic at @alienby.comics on insta if you’re interested 😊)
I have that issue. Constantly trying to look for signs I'm in a particular box. But I change my mind a lot
Hard same. We go way too hard on ourselves.
Yes!! I love it, can’t wait for the next season
Added to my list! ✅
Thank you for sharing ❤️ this is really important, and true, for us to hear. I hope sometime soon you’ll have people in your life you can be yourself with and trust, but that pain is very real!
ty for this. the definition was helpful to me because i dont feel like i ""fit"" as nonbinary because its not that i dont identify with a gender, even that im still working out, but its that i feel everything in between. \*exhales\* as i release and accept this. again, ty
Totally! This is a big thing in separating gender from sexuality. But once you are happy and comfortable with yourself, you will exhibit more confidence and be in tune with your style, which is attractive 😊
Tysm I needed to hear something like that today it’s been kinda rough lol, this helped❤️.
>I don't experience a lot of physical dysphoria but i do experience social dysphoria

Ding ding! Same. A lot of my battling has been over ""well I don't want top surgery so obvs I'm not trans"" but... I dont like being referred to as a woman. I tolerate it, because I'm too lazy to have that conversation with every acquaintance, but if I can change my hair, clothes, mannerisms to give others that piece of doubt, signal that I'm not a Woman, capital W, it makes me feel seen as my true self. I don't need to go under the knife for that, and besides I like my boobs, I grew them myself. I just wish they weren't a flag that says ""female"". Plus is tbh I feel I'm missing out by not having a penis. :(

I think it's tough because ""I don't like being treated as a woman"" gets misinterpreted as ""woman are treated poorly in society"", and while that's *true*, I'm  talking about ME, not society. The two overlap but they are not the same. (Still a feminist tho ✊)
Totally feel this. My whole family is very conservative! Wish I had some supportive people in my own family.
It’s a panel from a comic you can check out on my insta if you’re interested: @alienby.comics 😊
oh god no 😳
Love this 💙
Wow, lying to get medical gender affirming care wasn’t something I had considered before. Thanks for this 💙💙 I’ll definitely remember this
It’s okay ❤️ you don’t need to understand everything. Just embrace what makes you feel comfy and feel like yourself 😌
I’ve felt this too, but non-binary and agender people are fully trans and are free to use that label if they choose to! 😊 Don’t let people tell you you’re less trans than binary trans men and women. 🏳️‍⚧️
Dang this rings true for me too. Thank you for sharing!!

“Thinking is just a fancy word for changing your mind.” -The Doctor (Who)

Being able to admit you were wrong when presented with new information is the foundation of progress imo. You have to acknowledge the reality of the present if you want to move forward ! Don’t be too afraid to change your mind!
i view gender as a social construct and am throwing it off as i find it deeply stifling. it determines how i am supposed to act, dress, talk, walk, behave, and a litany of other things that society has piled onto gender norms and expectations. 

i have no body dysmorphia, all of my feelings are centered around my self expression and freedom to express however i want, whether that's along masculine or feminine lines. i was so hesitant to adopt the NB label because i didn't think i was NB enough. but i've realized, largely through the help of this sub and my NB partner, that it means something different for everyone. and this is what it is for me.
Off topic: How did you put the pronouns on your nickname?
❤️❤️ I'm sure I will be soon, I just need to get over what happened last time.   I also kind of want to move out of Texas first
Transmedicalism, or the belief that you must have gender dysphoria and seeking medical transition to be transgender. Many transmedicalists do not include nonbinary people in their definition of transgender.
Meeee eitherrrrrrr
Same! Tuck is awesome!
Thank you, that's really nice to hear from someone :)
Happy to help! I hope you feel better. 💖
I tried but i couldn't find it.
My friend transitioning early came with a massive perk of his family being chill with different pronouns, his dad has never once gotten them wrong since I’ve changed them!
Great quote
Hey dude, what you said in the first paragraph is basically the definition of being non binary :) you are non binary enough

You're welcome!
A gender each? In this economy??
YES! Now I want to make a super hero comic about a nonbinary anti-hero taking down a crime syndicate in some big city
Damn
Oh my god please! I would read the hell outta that!
Also we are 💫very💫 anti-capitalist 😌🔥
I have dabbled in making a webcomic before but i’m not the best at digital art. I could write the story no problem though. Just need to find someone to help with the art. I can draw the shit out of landscapes and backgrounds, but people? any living thing that’s not a tree or a plant? God no, I am TERRIBLE at that.
Yeah digital art is so cool and a talent i have yet to unlock 😅 i wish you good luck!
Well if I end up making something, even if it’s just the cover/poster I will let you know!
Fuck yeah, thank you!

Getting back into pole fitness, and I'm loving how androgynous I've been feeling lately. Just wanted to share my gender euphoria excitement with you guys 💙		"How  much did it cost and did you get it setup with out damaging the ceiling?
You look good! I like your hair a lot
You are incredibly attractive, I hope I look like you one day :))
How hard is it to start? I really wanna learn but nowhere around here offers lessons
Gagh give me androgynous body plz, I’m stuck here looking like a lumberjack :( 
You look amazing btw c:
I love the poll!  My current apartment has the cheapest drop ceiling imaginable so I can't get one yet, but I'm starting to get into calisthenics to build up the core and grip strength that the poll needs!  Keep working at it!
thats pretty poggers
Yes! Been considering getting back into pole. When I presented fem, it was super dysphoric for me, now that I am getting more and more comfortable with my body, I think I would enjoy it
This isn’t really related but if you have nb flag clothes you could do a flagpole (it’s when you hold yourself up sideways on a bar) and be a nb flag. Idk just something cool I thought of
such toned thighs! Looking a lot like a fitness goal, internet friend
amazing ❤️
You must be so strong!
You look awesome, like actually though that’s so cool
Androgynous goals right here 👆👆
:))
It cost me about $400 including taxes shipping and everything to order my XPole Xpert (has spinning and static modes) directly from XPole back in March. You can usually find used ones being sold online for much cheaper, but at that time almost everywhere was out or couldn't ship due to covid restrictions. There are also other less expensive pole models too. 

As far as damaging the ceiling... TBD 🤣 It didn't damage my last apartment ceiling (though it did leave a little faint circular ring imprint in the paint it looked like. They didn't take it out of our deposit though or anything.) My new place has popcorn ceilings though, so I've read that I'll need to buy some stuff to fix the broken off popcorn texture stuff once I take my pole down to move out.
Thank you!! I had my first barber experience not long ago, and it turned out better than I even hoped :)
I took 2-3 beginner group pole lessons right before covid/quarantine and since then I've been completely self-taught. I tried a few different pole fitness subscription services to see what clicked and so far Studio Veena is the most beginner friendly program I've found. I'm still a mega beginner lol. The hardest part for me was having a big enough mirror to check your form, which is why I just recently upgraded to 2 big wall mirrors. I think it would probably be a lot easier to learn in person with an instructor or class, and you would probably learn faster. But if you're like me and have to trick yourself into working out by making it fun, I think its not too hard to start :)
Yesss omg I need to be doing way more calisthenic exercises because my core and shoulders have become especially weak from my 55+ hour/week desk job. Every little bit that you do off the pole makes a HUGE difference when you get back on pole. Its crazy!
Omg I actually had the same problem with pole initially!! I started pole when I was still presenting very fem and I struggled with more dysphoria because of it. After I started outwardly presenting much more androgynously (aka more authentically to how I feel inside), its like pole completely changed for me. I fell back in love with the flow and strength of it, and stopped viewing it as inherently feminine. I also bought better sports bras that make my big boobs as flat as possible which was a game changer too. That and I started following male pole fitness people on social media for inspiration, where the focus is less on sexual/sensual styles and more on grace/power/flow styles if that makes sense??
That’s a nice apartment! thought you lived in a house. 😅Either way thank you for replying back so quickly. :-) Definitely didn’t realize they could get that expensive but it makes sense.
I'm not super stronk yet, would it be super hard to lift myself?
For me it's a pull up bar.  I work in a factory and have to spend most of the day bent over examining circuit boards.  I swear I unpinched a nerve just hanging there today.  Keep at it!
Makes total sense! I had top surgery earlier this year and it’s helped tremendously. I was a G cup. Now I have SHORT ceilings ... but hoping I can get a pole in the future. 🥰
I love this. I hope you keep posting!
Oh gosh thank you!!! My bf and I spent all last weekend moving around furniture and redecorating to try to make our little apartment seem bigger, so your comment totally made our day lol. Also yeah I was also surprised at how pricey poles can get 💀
Honestly, yes. The only strong part of me are my thighs, and thats from riding horses when I was younger I'm pretty sure lol. I legit still can't lift myself up with just my arms for more than like 2-3 seconds tops. And even then, I slide down pathetically the whole time 🤣 The great thing about pole though is you can do lots of fun stuff even without needing much strength, which let's you slowly build strength to do even more. I HATE working out so its literally my only form of fitness haha. You don't have to be strong to start at all!
Thank you so much! I ordered my pole! I was worried I would be too weak to use it
Hell yeah, I'm so excited for you!!!"	joass1	NonBinary	1497	1.0	2020-11-05 02:48:04
Idrk what my gender is and tbh I’m just gonna procrastinate it until another day lol		"i seriously love ur outfit omg.. where did u get the collar/choker?
Sometimes when I don't know what my gender is on any given day, I identify as ""existing*
No reason to push it. Just be happy being you.

You might have no gender or many genders or find yours someday. :)
My gender is ""Wait, the gender assignment was due TODAY? Crap I forgot to do it."" And then turning in furious unreadable scribbles on a crumpled paper
Hahahaha reminds me of when I struck up a convo at a thrift store and the girl paused and said “excuse me one sec, what are your pronouns?” And I said “thanks for asking, I don’t fucking know!”
I don't care what your gender is, your style just cries gender itself! You look stunning!
where did you get that bag 😍
Your gender is ""fuckin adorable"". There, now you know. ;P
Who cares about gender? You are cute as hell 😍
Haha same I’m so confused with my gender I’m just identifying as non-binary for now

You’re so pretty btw!!
My gender lately? Vibes
I wish I looked like that damn
Whatever your gender turns out to be, your style is immaculate :)
Me with therapy and hrt
Ive never related so much to a title in my life-
Iconic af
nb + adhd do be the best combo
I'm in love with your look! I think I literally gasped when I saw you, like wow. 🖤🖤
Love it!!!!!
Your AESTHETIC oh my god. You look so fucking cool!!!
My dysphoria has been so bad recently most because of my hight I would kill to look like that you look amazing
Your gender is goth.
I love your outfit and your bag is amazing
Biggest mood ever
This outfit is god teir, 10/10! Need it in my life
Your gender is cool.
Who needs a gender when you have a style that looks that good on you. I absolutely adore that bag by the way.
Big The Craft vibes and I'm living.
I relate to this title so much. And you are adorable.
your gender is badass <3
Love this, my pronouns are I’ll get back to you
Your outfit is freaking sweet! I'd love to be able to rock that look.

Also mood to procrastinating until tomorrow, we aint got time for gender! XD
where’s the sailor outfit from?
Whatever it is, I love it! You look great!
~*Patrick Star voice*~
Is absolutely stunning a gender? lolol

No srsly you look lovely, and I hope you're having a wonderful day!~✨💕🌸👌
That’s my new favorite way to say it now “I’m procrastinating on gender”
Maybe you have no gender, and that's okay. BTW, love the outfit.
Just a reminder that gender labels are just a communication tool. You don’t have to have one or “know” if you don’t want or none work for you. Also agender is a thing. :)
Idk what gender I am. When I look inside I just see void
the way i felt this post in my soul
Omg I love your whole outfit and ur haircut what’s it called? 😁
You are super cute!
Tysm! It’s from a local shop in Vancouver called The Rock Shop (they specialize in band tees and alt accessories)
Ooooh, I LIKE that. I wish we could all just BE.
Reminds me of a character from a webcomic that I read that has a lot of magical shapeshifting. The character describes themselves as ""gender casual"", in that sometimes they feel like being a male, sometimes a female, and sometimes just 'meh'. 😋
LMFAO I’m so taking this
She probably wound being as confused as you! 😋
I got it from a local shop called Deadly Couture but the brand is called Banned ✨
Oh I’ve been there! It’s pretty cool, I bought an MCR wallet, and the staff was all really nice.
cries in aussie
you're a fellow Vancouverite?? Wanna hang out some time, I need to go shopping sometime once I get some clothes money, you seem to have wonderful style

And your awesome looks are beyond reproach.
AND YOUR EYES ARE BEAUTIFULLLLLL!!!!

#YOU ARE GORGEOUSLY FANTABULOUSLY BEAUTIFUL!
I feel like I saw this picture on Twitter 🤨
umm uhh 😳
You're so beautiful and cute and I wish I could look like u but am too scared to come out as nonbinary
moood
What does it mean?
<insert magic the gathering joke here>
Heh
Which part are you struggling with?

Alt? Which is short for alternative which is a fashion style that is not following the mainstream styles, hence it is an ""alternative"" style.

Or is it...

Enby? Which is short for non-binary and is an umbrella term that encapsulates a lot of different genders under the same label. I don't know them all because there are so many and I am still fairly new to the world of LGBTQ+.

Or is it...

The reason why I am keeping it a secret? Which is a joke based upon the fact that I am in the closet and not being comfortable coming out IRL yet.
I bought a red lacey dress the other day that makes me look like a Red-Black Vampire from Innistrad. 

When I put it on, everyone asks if I can tap them for a turn
It was alt, thanks! I thought it was gender related and another label under the nonbinary umbrella that I hadn't heard of.

(Btw I think it's a safe bet to think someone on r/nonbinary knows what non-binary is)
alt is so mainstream its not even alt anymore
Lol, I forgot where I was posting. Yeah, I'm so used to explaining to non-LGBTQ+ folk I meet on the internet and in games, that my immediate response was to break down everything into easier to understand explanation and I never assume anyone knows anything. Glad I could explain what alt was lol. I'm an idiot.
Well it at least started off as not being mainstream but popularity of things change and formerly unpopular styles get popular. It's not necessarily a bad thing though. You can still dress the same and represent the original values of the style.
You’re not an idiot; you’re tired :p
Unfortunately, I wasn't tired. I am a little tired now though lol.
Get some rest then! :p
Lol, not yet :P"	yepv2s	NonBinary	1480	0.99	2022-10-27 11:48:58

Aw thanks! I am unfortunately an adult now.
💕
Ohhh ok thanks that helpful 😊
No I didn't have any makeup on for that one actually, I usually just use blush and eyeliner tho!

Thank you, it's my first time ever having it this long 😊
Ohh, cake day on reddit is when your account hits 1 year 😌

Happy bday tho!! 💕
I'm AFAB and just sorting through my gender identity (thinking gender non conforming or enbie) and I'm much older than you but I love to see people's journeys and pictures. Best wishes from Scotland.
Oh lol, that’s what my family calls birthdays
I wish you the best on your journey too 💞

No way, I just finished at the University of Glasgow before I came back home!! I loved Scotland so much it was the most beautiful place I've ever seen 🥰
Aww cute ☺️
Seriously? What's the chances?! Shoot me a message if you want to chat on insta or fb. If not no worries at all. 

Edinburgh is probably more pretty but Glasgow is better for shopping, nights out etc"	padm7k	NonBinary	1458	1.0	2021-08-24 01:38:20
impulsively cut my hair!! this is the first time I’ve felt true gender euphoria :3		"Love your hair colour and those glasses are lush! 🤩
Yesss you remind me of a cool librarian who has a bunch of plants in their room haha!
Ayy I almost have the same hairstyle! Yet another piece of evidence that this is the ultimate nb hair.
That's a great length, your glasses remind me of the metal gold accessories from Janelle Monae's Dirty Computer (the film).
This hairstyle looks amazing on you! Do you know if it has a name? What did you ask for when they cut it?
It's wild what a simple hair cut can do for us! You look great and I hope you keep feeling just as good.
Gorgeous 😍
you look great!
Very nice haircut. 💖

(I kinda wonder if I should get mine done like this.)
You look awesomeeeeee
Love the glasses and the hair cut. Looks super cute!
HELL YEAH! you look amazing!
I'm in love with your hair color
you look great !
what's the hairstyle called and how is it cut?
Your hair looks bomb...dot com
Is ""bruh"", spelled with the -uh, gender neutral? Because, ""BRUH!!""

You look spectacular!
omg you look like a very very very very very v e r y good looking strawberry and i love it
You’re so cuteee! The middle part frames your face nicely <3
I WNST HAIR LIKE YOURS
I MIGHT SRSLY ASK IF I CSN GET MY HSIR CUT LIEK THIS WHAT IS IT CALLED
Thats such a good look for you!!
The haircut with the glasses is SUCH a cute look.  All you need are freckles and an oversized sweater
Love your hair! It looks similar to mine
thank you so much everyone for your lovely comments! 😭💜
angelic!!
u look good
Oh wow you look amazing I want hair like that
Yay! And congrats! It looks awesome 😁😍
you look great! :DD
awww thank you!! 🥰
You’re not far off 🙈 Studying to be an english teacher and I certainly do have a lot of plants in my room hahah
thank you! also omg yes I totally see it
I don’t know what the name of it is sorry! I spent ages looking on Pinterest for shag bobs/mullets and just showed my hairdresser photos for reference
thank you!! I’m not sure what the hairstyle is called, I just searched shag bobs/mullets on pinterest and saved the photos I like to show to my hairdresser
hahaha thank you!! I think the ‘bruh’ really drives the compliment home
AWWW you should totally do it!! I don’t know what it’s called, I just looked up ‘shag bobs’ and ‘shag mullets’ on pinterest and photos to show to my hairdresser!
that is how I aspire to look 🥺
it’s such a classic nonbinary cut
Yay not just me! Hope you have a great day.
Do you have the pictures saved still? This is kinda what mine looked like when I grew out my short hair, but I didn't keep any pics, and I miss it! It looks great on you :)
How much did you style your hair in this photo
Kool!!
Yeah, funny thing is I'm actually growing my hair out from a pixie cut. I didn't cut my hair like this. It just is, but I still love it.
Absolutely! I can send you the photos :)
honestly not much! this was right after I blow dried it so it was fluffy at the time. I just ran my fingers through my hair once or twice to get it in the position I wanted :)
Sorry but could I have it too?"	pqjt1i	NonBinary	1458	1.0	2021-09-18 10:11:53
Who says you can’t feel “very gender” on laundry day?		"Clearly you do, and I’m jealous! Great look!
You look ""very gender"" as well, I couldn't tell your agab
Omg where...did....u...get...that.. from. Its so cute!
That fit is fire tho
I can't believe how fabulous you look with the beard, I am sooo jealous!!!
You look awesome! 😚
Stunning 🤩
Your outfit is \*chef's kiss\*
Sometimes laundry day is the BEST day for gender, because all that stuff you're usually like ""eh, this is for going out"" or ""too formal"" suddenly becomes viable.

In your case, with AMAZING results.

Also, man, you are really making me rethink my ""well, I want to go on T, but I'm not a fan of facial hair AS it is"" stance. That beard = A+++ ESPECIALLY with this outfit. All gender presentation turned up to 11 today.
I love your corset.
Dress+Beard is my FAVORITE combination. That's what I dress my Animal Crossing character in all the time ✨✨✨
SO CUTE 🥰
Very g e n d e r indeed. Love this look! Wish I could pull it off.
I just love your outfit and this entire vibe!
oh. my  god. i am obsessed. you are astounding, everything about this look rules. keep it up!
You are VERY gender indeed! 👀👀 what a look.
Oh shit. goals
Such androgynous!
be still, my heart!
Yeahhhh this is so good!!! 💜💜
Aesthetic GOALS!
Where did get that corset and how long have you been training your waist?
Thanks! I personally don’t like neutral ambiguous androgyny for myself, I much rather leaning hard both directions and getting the no way a woman could look like that but neither could a man comments.
Where did I get what? Apart from the mesh corset this is all fairly easy to find clothing. Or are you just calling me cute?😊
Thanks! I grew it myself.
Orchard Corset. And I wouldn’t say I’ve been waist training just intermittently wear them, maybe once a week for the last 2 years
that's exactly the kind of ambiguity I meant! You're not neutral, you're very much both, and it looks stunning
That’s my goal too
I could tell! I lean toward neutral ambiguous myself, but still love occasionally playing with gender cues like this.
Oh! I thought it was a whole dress!! I was thinking to myself how cute u looked and i wanted to look cute too 😭
Thank, friend.  Your look is goals.
Right? The more signifiers I have of one gender, the more I feel comfortable wearing or giving off signifiers of (what people percieve as the opposite, even if that's not strictly correct). It just feels better.
Yeah it’s a skirt and button down. And you are already very cute! I mean look at you! So cute! Looks like you would be great to cuddle with too!"	quevah	NonBinary	1448	1.0	2021-11-15 12:01:11
Decided to have a go at putting together a rock concert outfit tonight. Don't think I quite got it but definitely got a huge hit of gender euphoria while trying 😁🖤🖤🌈		"You definitely nailed it! You look so cute/pretty! 🖤
Definitely rocking it 🤘 can't wait for concerts again myself. Will definitely go as my new self.
That's such a cute outfit! 💜
With legs like that, who needs an outfit? You look amazing!
This is giving me mad gender envy, you look so cool :D
your legs look dope in those fish nets! 🖤🤘
This outfit is excellent!!! You pull it off so well and look so happy in it :)
you’re looking sharp!
[deleted]
Wow!! I love it and it looks so good on you!!
you look amazing! :D
so cute!!!
This is getting me so amped for festival szn 🎉🎉
Kudos from this pacific northwestern aging punk rocker! You’ve hit that 90’s grunge look PERFECTLY 🧡
aghh i love it so pretty
Oooooh you go you!
That outfit is the bomb!
Omfg you’re KILLING it!!!! That outfit is fierce too!!!
This look is fire 🔥 and for some reason I’m craving a marmalade sandwich 🥪
Perfect!!
Looking good, I wish I was able to do something like that
Where did you get that top? I love it!
this is SO CUTE very much fits the concert vibe, if I saw you there would def compliment u
SLAYYYY
Dang, your legs hella good in this outfit, friend, suits you well!!
This outfit is awesome! The flannel around the waist help to give a little more shape too! Love it
Hey! A little tip if you need it, if you wanna wear fishnets or anything, but it's too cold, there are special skin tone leggings! You can wear them under those!
Hello cutie! Still up for that drink? :D Seriously, you look awesome! This style suits you! :3
You rock that outfit mate.
You look amazing!
I’m in LOVE with this outfit! You look fantastic! 💙 I might need some fashion tips from you 😳
You got it with plenty to spare! Brilliant look - maybe boots rather than trainers/sneakers for rock?
[removed]
Thank you so so much!! It means an awful lot, especially when it comes from someone as awesome as you! 

I checked out your profile (hope that's ok) and just have to say you're style is phenomenal! I really love what you're doing 😁💜💜
Thank you! You definitely should! You've a few great outfits on your profile that definitely suit that vibe! 😁🖤🤘
Thank you!! 😁💖

Feel like I need to accessorize a bit more and maybe add some black nail polish to really improve it. Obviously if I could learn to do even some basic makeup it'd probably be a huge help too 😂
I mean, I think if I just went out in a mesh bodysuit and fishnets then the police might have something to say about it 😂. Thank you friend, it really means a lot for my confidence to feel such love ❤️
Thank you!! 😁💜💜 (Sorry about the gender envy though 😂)
Thank you! Still can't believe how much I like how they look, I really didn't expect to like them that much 😁🖤
It definitely made me feel happy when it came together as good as I had planned. Thank you so much for the love and support 🥰
Thank you so much! I feel like I could do so much better with this look, but I definitely felt pretty great as it is 😁💜
Thank you so much! This outfit certainly feels pretty amazing! 😁🖤💜
Thank you cutie!! 😁💜💜
Thank you!! It really means a lot to me 💖💖
Thank you!! ☺️💜💜
It would be an unbelievably cute festival outfit actually! 😁💙
Thank you! As a 90s kid, who grew up seeing lots of the grungy style, this compliment really means a lot to me ☺️💜
Thank you so much! 💖💖
😁🖤🤘
Thank you Q! 😁💙
Thank you! I'm so happy with how it turned out and really surprised by how at home I felt wearing it 😃💜
Thanks friend 😃💖. 

Well played for spotting the Paddingtons in the background too. This is the tiny spare room in my house which we jokingly refer to as ""the Paddington suite""
Can't be perfect, not when a dog as cute as yours exists! 😃 🐶

Thank you friend 😊
Thank you so much! I wish I actually had the confidence to go out to a concert in that outfit, but I'm working on it and love like this from people on Reddit is helping a huge lot! 😃

You're amazing friend! Your time will come 😁💙💙
Thank you! 

The mesh is a bodysuit and the rest is actually a playsuit I'm wearing over the top (romper in the US I guess 😉). Bought both from New Look, I think they're UK only, but I might be wrong. 

I really like the mesh bodysuit, it's really great for layering underneath strappier tops/dresses/playsuits and I feel takes away how that style makes my AMAB shoulders look really wide. I can definitely recommend a mesh top (doesn't have to be a bodysuit) if you get the chance to try one! 😁🖤
Thank you so much! Having this sort of love and support for being myself really feels great and gives me a huge confidence lift towards being myself more openly 😁💜

Much love to you too ❤️❤️
😁🤘🖤💜 

Thank you so much for the love! Just checked out your profile (hope that's ok with you) and I absolutely love it! You're so talented, your drawings are amazing, you've got an amazing style too 😁
Thank you so much, friend 😃💜💜
Thank you so much! I feel the look is much better with the shirt tied up! Not only for the shape and added colour, but cos the playsuit is so much shorter than I'm used to!! Guess I just need to build up the confidence to actually go out in one of these outfits now 😅

(PS: You're totally not a human pile of garbage, no matter what your username says 😉)
That's such a great tip! I'm wearing the fishnets layered over some sheer skin tone tights in this outfit, but they don't really add any warmth, just hide a multitude of leg scars. I hadn't considered trying adding leggings though, it's been really cold here this week so it's definitely one to consider! 😁
Hey cutie to you too! Thank you so much for your lovely comment, it really means a lot! Definitely still up for grabbing a drink if we ever get the chance 😉
Thank you so much! It definitely felt pretty damn good!
Thank you so much! ☺️❤️❤️
Thank you so much! That's such a lovely comment, I really appreciate all your love and support ☺️❤️.

As for fashion tips, I just kinda buy stuff that I like/wanna try out. I rarely have any proper outfits in mind. Then I just play with different combos and seeing what works and what doesn't. Most turn out terrible, but sometimes you unearth a real gem of an outfit that just sends your euphoria rocketing! 😁🌈
Thank you so much! I thought boots would be good too, but I don't have any black ones to try with. Definitely want to try this style again!
aww thank you! 💜🌈🏳️‍⚧️
I love adding pops of a light color to all black outfits! I usually go with red but you can choose whichever color you want. You could even add more than one color but it's a good idea to sure that those non-colors go together. I am more gothic but I have some realy cute black bace and lots of different pops of color outfits. It's a really bubbly or rave style.
This is exactly what I was going to recommend to bring it all together! Depending on the venue, I'd try a beanie, a single bold necklace or 3-5 smaller necklaces, and even a little highlighter can go a long way makeup-wise!
Im looking for ideas for the summer and this will defs give me inspo! 😁
You look like you should be in line for Bikini Kill 🧡
I love it when that happens with an outfit! The feeling of throwing something together, trying it on for the heck of it, and then finding gender euphoria in it is truly lovely. I hope you find even more outfits that feel just as cozy as this one does ❤️
Thank you! He is the sweetest! :P
you got this and I hope it all works well for you😁
Aw thank u ! Happy belated trans day of visibility 😎
Yeah typically ""womens"" clothing is ridiculously short. But it is really cute! 

(Yeah I'm over the name now but idk how or if I can change it and I dont wanna lose all my karma  by making a new account)
Great 😄
That's what I was aiming for with the shirt, it's actually more purple than it looks in the photo, but maybe I need to try something brighter. I certainly have plenty of shirts to choose from 😜

Thank you for the advice!! 😁
Thank you for your advice! I feel like I'm getting a bit better with putting together outfits, but accessories is definitely where I'm lacking! As for makeup, I have literally zero experience (other than one absolutely terrible attempt as a teen 😅)
Enjoy exploring different ideas, I'm sure you'll do great 😁
Wow! Now that is a compliment! They are extremely hot! 🔥 Definitely just got myself a bit more outfit inspo 😁😁
Yeah I was just trying out the playsuit on its own cos I hadn't really done anymore than try it on since getting it and thought yeah this could be cute for summer. I just had an idea to try it with the mesh bodysuit under to see if I would feel more comfortable. That led to trying the fishnets and the full grungy/rock vibe which honestly came together so well! 

Hope you get the pleasure of finding that euphoric feeling too ❤️
🥺☺️💗💗
You're very welcome friend 😁. Happy belated Trans Day of Visibility to you too! 😁
I'm a massive sucker for dark purple / nearly black nail varnish! So I'm always gonna suggest that 😅
Makeup is a skill just like any other :) To start, just try concealer, mascara, and highlighter. No need to get straight into brows, lashes, or eyeliner lol

My opinion on jewelry is white folx look best with silver, but explore your tastes with cheap thrifted jewelry or even your friends'! Don't really recommend moms or aunts bc they tend to be old school or out of style 😅
Be careful🤍
I've got no experience with nail varnish (would love to, but I'm not out as NB, so it's a big step and I'm nervous) but co-ordinatiing the shirt accent colour with nail polish could be extremely cute!
Totally get that (I'm not out yet either). When I started with nail varnish I got a lot of comments, like you'd imagine, but people got used to it pretty quick. I don't know your situation, though, so you do what you gotta do 😊

On the flip side, I've hardly got any fem clothes yet. That's my big step that I'm nervous about 😖 Posts like this inspire me 💜
So happy to inspire others to be themselves! Buying fem clothes for myself is honestly one of the best decisions I've ever made! I've not been out dressed fem yet, I've got a day off work on Tuesday though so maybe I will then if I don't chicken out! 😅Shopping for them in person is really fun too!

I'm really proud of you for taking the step with the nail varnish though, you definitely inspire me to be myself too!! You're amazing friend😁💛🤍💜🖤"	ttzbzi	NonBinary	1446	0.99	2022-04-01 19:31:45
Gender Absurdism		"POV: Socrates is asking you what a man is, or a woman, and you keep giving examples but he keeps saying, but what is the *essence* of man? And you don't know, you just don't, and neither does Socrates, so it just ends in an aporia and gender has been proven a lie
Don't know what a gender absurdist is but I want to be one.
Since we're on the point of philosophy, I'd like to point out that Max Stirner would probably call gender a ""spook"" if he were alive today
gender post-modern interpretism
Nice. Would prefer to be a gender cynic. So basically going up to bigots and be like ""Look this dog wears pants, it must be a man"".
Love ""gender absurdist"" I'm gonna be using this
I heard someone use gender creative
""I don't give a damn about my bad reputation!"" Started in my head.
gender egoists be like, gender is a spook.
Ah yes my gender is a picasso painting
Absurdism (among a couple other things) lead me to realize I was non-binary!
Can confirm, read Plato's Republic
Gender has no meaning, one must rebel against gender and make their own
And Marx would say gender is a bourgeois method of oppression
Post-genderism
I mean, why choose to be a gender when you can just strive to live like a dog?
“BEHOLD,  P A N T S !!!”
I'm gender chaotic :P
omg which section
Applying Camus to random things like this is my new hobby.
Yeah, that's exactly how I feel about gender I love this.
But why not go all the way? Why not simply reject gender wholesale? Why must we, after dispelling the old lies, start telling ourselves new lies and call that a victory?

I’ve always found the arguments of the existentialists rather flimsy, more fancy prose than ideas with serious philosophical merit - if meaning and purpose do not exist, then we cannot make them for ourselves - but to extend that to gender is probably even more poorly motivated. We arguably - *very* arguably - cannot live without meaning or purpose, but we sure as hell can live without gender.
He might say gender issues, unfortunately
👀 read Engels the origin of family, private property, and the state. I'm not sure Marx speaks on it directly but Engels certainly viewed gender as a tool for the ruling class.
My dog gets more attention then me, so hell yeah!
dogs are very cute and people are always happy to correct themselves if they assumed the wrong pronouns
gender lawful evil checking in
my gender is chaotic neutral
I don't remember the exact section but you should be able to find it with a ctrl+f if you go to a site with the entire text in English. But in general the entire book is about Socrates having philosophical arguments with Glaucon and others about everything, scrolling through every single possible topic until they practically ran out. It all happens during a festival.

Typical Socrates.

Keep in mind I read it in modern and ancient Greek so some things might have been translated differently but the point is still there.
fellow enby classicist or classics student? Or is it just normal school stuff to read Plato's Rublic in Greece? (I suppose you're from Greece if you read it with a modern Greek translation)

anyway thanks for the tip! haha
Correct, I did grow up in Greece, am non-binary and am (partially) Greek. But it's none of those things, actually. While we do read *a few* ancient Greek texts in school, it's just tiny chunks of those things. The only *full* texts we read are the Iliad, Odyssey, and Antigone. Maybe people who take humanitarian lessons in their last year of high school do more texts, but they definitely don't enjoy it (because it's for university entrance exams). 

In fact, I study engineering. I just borrowed it from my university's library and read it for fun! I love reading books and it was in my list of books I definitely wanted to read. And I did. :)
ohh, that's so cool! I have to admit, I still have to read the whole Republic. I started out as... not such a Plato fan, but my feelings are shifting now hahahaha. I wish I could just (semi-)casually read ancient greek lol, I suppose it's not that hard if you speak Greek natively? Or is it still kina hard?
Beep. Boop. I'm a robot.
Here's a copy of 

###[The Iliad]( https://snewd.com/ebooks/the-iliad/)

Was I a good bot? | [info](https://www.reddit.com/user/Reddit-Book-Bot/) | [More Books](https://old.reddit.com/user/Reddit-Book-Bot/comments/i15x1d/full_list_of_books_and_commands/)
Depends on the person, I suppose. For me, with my very basic knowledge of Ancient Greek, it's very easy to read and understand Ancient Greek with minimal effort. Or even constructed tests in Proto-Hellenic, albeit with some extra effort.

For others, it might be much more difficult."	mg698b	NonBinary	1442	1.0	2021-03-30 02:53:14
"ah yes the ""clothes shopping while in-between genders"" experience"		"Ugh so relatable 😭 also when you put on and xs and it fits in the arms and shoulders but everything else is too tight, and the small is just too long and baggy 😭 amazing art btw! So gunna follow you 🥰
My body is very thicc on the hips. I am more masculine and want to wear mens clothing, but nothing fits. I have to buy 3xl in mens clothing but sometimes my hips won't fit in that size either, since men have more narrow hips
You can find more of my art and comics at my [insta](http://Instagram.com/ashleyloob) / [twitter](http://twitter.com/ashleyloob)!
I have the opposite problem, I'm obese and I've noticed there's a lot less plus size clothing in the men's section🥴
It may be useful to remember that tailors are still a thing and they can be found everywhere. Their work is surprisingly inexpensive considering its utility.
So damn relatable! European and Asian brands at the thrift store are lifesavers in that regard at least.
for smaller people shopping for masc clothing (i.e. i am typically XS women's), shop in the boy's section: teen boys' XS is pretty close to XS womens. (In canada). When I was in the states, i was straight up shopping in the children's section.
And pants that I can't fit in because of my hips :(
Hell, even with a cis male body, it’s sometimes hard to get men’s clothes that fit properly. Not as hard as finding clothes in women’s sizes, but still. Men’s clothes seem to be made for the ideal man, a built hunk with wide shoulders and large torso. If you are skinny but also average height, like me, then you’ll find shirts and jackets that fit perfectly in the sleeves but are too baggy.
Need one coming from the other angle where, ""Nope still too small"" and/or ""Nope still look like a fridge.""
Or trying to buy a skirt with S hips and XL waist.
I am...sadly the opposite. Depending on brand, mens xxl or 3xl. The disheartening part is how many cute things dont get made that big due to the aim at smaller people. But i dont have the drive to lose weight just for clothes.
all men’s clothes look like women’s clothes on me bc of how extreme my figure is.

people are always like “your style’s so unique, where do you shop?” & i tell them it’s just men’s clothes & they literally *don’t believe me*.

“men’s clothes aren’t designed to make you ass look like that, though!” thanks, have we considered my ass is not designed to *be a part of a body that fits your narrow standard of androgyny*?
This is why I love shopping Hollister brands of clothing. They have XS in pretty much everything.
I honestly like more baggy clothes when I’m feeling masc
Aren't all men's clothes baggy?
Your art and use of colour is very nice
Did you draw this? I love it!
Rip — x/xxs?
Women’s extra small still fits baggy on me. I use crop tops as shirt sometimes, and I have to tuck in most of my shirts because they all fit me like dresses.
I regularly buy tshirts from the childs section.
Get yourself a tailor. Minor alterations to a shirt, like taking in the shoulders, aren’t usually crazy expensive and make a world of difference.
Im lucky I'm big tho i have shoulders that dont even fit in some mens clothes lol. Sometimes it feels like my body was made to wear mens clothes. My hips are a touch too big but otherwise it fits good
Maybe more like **one** 'clothes shopping while in-between genders' experience...
my size will never make me a part of this fucking identity
Mens Small juuuust barely works for me if it is close to 100% cotton and I can shrink them on high heat! Lots of guess and check, sadly. :(
This is so damn true. I think I’m gonna start sewing.
I love the way you worded the title.   
""Are you a boy or a girl?""  
""Actually I'm in between genders right now, try asking me in a week and I'll let you know""

I gotta try that response one day...
God mood! Buy mens and it’s always to baggy. Buy woman’s and the arms are too tight.
I feel that so hard! Except for me it's I'm Amab and all my lady clothes look small and uncomfortable 😂
Please I always have to shop in the little boys section 😭
When I try on new blouses, it's always either the shoulders are too tight, or the sleeves aren't long enough.  Then I'm getting into XL territory and there's too much chest room.
I put on the XXL “women’s” shirt and it’s still too fucking tight.

I just want to feel small god damn it is that too hard to ask for??
relateable, i have no freaking idea what the sizes on clothes even mean at this point
Ugh, this, but the inverse for me. I’m relatively large and typical femme clothing options fit me like a cupcake paper on a loaf of bread.
Sometimes xs is too small for me ;(
Yo same
Yepppp. Or how every pair of mens jeans is either way too tight in the hips or super baggy in the leg.
You could try men's skinny jeans?
i’m kinda the opposite. i’m bigger and i really love baggy clothes
Me going shopping.
Haha! I was just at the mall trying on men's clothes. I'm too small to even fit into an XS. I'm teaching myself to sew for this reason. 

Unisex shirts usually fit well. I just hem a few inches off the bottom.
*crying in genetically large person*
Okay, so which one of ya’ll gonna start up a NB clothing brand?
small is too small and medium is too big. I'm in between sizes so I go with the medium lmfao even tho I have a binder and smalls could work it just hh
this is very relatable and this character looks like me, same hair cut and colour. yes i saved this comic to my phone.
Ugh I feel this so hard.
I'm AMAB and I have to buy size L women's shirts, but XS trousers. Lol
I just got back from goodwill and am having this experience!

Found some men's corduroy pants that are 42 in the waist and just barely fit. Had to buy a button down shirt that was a 2xl men's and is super baggy but the only one that fit
Check out Jade Fox (and her fashion channel, Made you looks). She's a cis woman (I think?) But she's got a really masc style and gives advice to others with a ""traditionally feminine"" shape on how to dress masc AF.
Can you sew? If you split the side seam on each side - it doesn’t need to be a long split, just a few cm - it will give your hips some room. (Talking about shirts, not pants)
I've been struggling with this for 10+ years. ;__; regular stores don't usually even carry sizes that fit me in women's OR men's clothes.
Same!!!

doing some paperwork for a new job and they have this option ❤️❤️❤️		"[deleted]
ITT some saying they need to have ""Sex"" and ""Gender Designation"". No. They need to have only ""Gender Designation"" and nothing else.
How can these people be aware enough to include gender designation and pronouns but still confuse ""GENDER"" AND ""SEX"" like wtf this is supposed to be the first distinction people learn
what are the other options for “gender”?
I hope this paperwork was sent to you after a job offer. I’m not sure so forgive me if this is alarmist: 

If they ask for this information before determining whether you get the job (specifically asking marital status), is that not breaking labor laws?

Edit to add (USA info) [https://www.eeoc.gov/pre-employment-inquiries-and-marital-status-or-number-children](https://www.eeoc.gov/pre-employment-inquiries-and-marital-status-or-number-children)
friendly reminder to everyone who says it should say ""sex"" instead of gender, if it's for legal reasons or insurance reasons, it should be ""legal sex"". not biological sex or agab or any of that. people forget we can change our legal documents and change our sex through transitioning.
Dude my job now - I just started 2 months ago after moving to a new city - they are so respectful of pronouns and everyone asks each other’s pronouns when introducing each other. I’ve never had this before. Im also not the only non binary person! Progressiveness like this is exactly why I moved from a small town 🤩 I hope your job is as good about pronouns and gender identity!!
""Gender designation"" what a nice way to tell others how you express.
 heard places do this to avoid hiring trans employees… not that you shouldn’t just I personally would be nervous abt it
Why did the word sex go out of favour for gender? It irritates me to no end.
Why do they need to know that, and wtf is “gender” and “gender designation”
Wouldn't it be sex rather than gender?
How is ""female"" a gender? Is this anonymous? If not I'd be very worried.
YEAAA
My company needs this.  It's based in Texas but we've always been known for not caving into conservatives and being very pro-LGBTQ
They always fuck up sex
Why do they need to know your marital status for a job
So much nicer to see than “Male/Female/Other” on the gender options, there’s so much encompassed in the label of “other” and it rarely has great connotations
What's the difference between ""gender"" and ""gender designation""?
Why do they need to know what you were assigned at birth anyway? Surely it doesn't matter?
ahhh that's so great
Edit: on second thought I don't trust mods to not ban me because they don't understand sarcasm

The way less funny version of my comment: this is actually really offensive and shows just how much cis people cling to birth-assigned binary gender as the only thing that matters
I wish they would put a he/she or him/her. Because sometimes you feel more masc, other times more fem.
This, like i get the intent, and they seem to be trying. Someone just added to a premade programs forms I guess, not actually editing the form so much as adding to it
I think some of them use it for insurance shit rather than internal documentation. So, insurance companies need to get on it
I think they do that because just so so many people (myself) would say yes please. ABG for assigned birth gender could work though
They also have no business knowing my sex. I don't know went this is required in any sense.
Agreed but I would also argue that sex isn't binary
***Assuming this is in the US*** - as long as there is Affirmative Action, sex (and race) are significant. It's a bit of a double-edged sword.
Unless you're in medical, and or need to have surgeries and or other things associated with doctoring because that's important. Other than that just gender designation should be only thing
random question: what do you define under ""everyone""?  (definitly not science i think)
There are reasons why Sex and with that sex characteristics is a thing. Some medications for example do indeed work differently on Humans with more Female sex characteristics than in men because it is mostly only tested on Humans with most Male sex characteristics which is still causing a lot of problems but that's another topic.
Isn't gender designation agab?
In the US, it's usually a mix of ignorance and weird legal requirements that demand stupid things like ""applicant's biological gender"". That leads to workarounds like this. The remaining times are corporate bureaucracy (the process to add a field might be easier than removing one) and malicious compliance by genuine bad actors who are only doing the minimum to avoid being sued.
*corporate ""inclusivity""* 👏
i think there was female, male, non binary, and trans
Not quite. Check out Affirmative Action. It makes one's race, sex, etc. relevant to the hiring process in an attempt to ensure that one's race, sex, etc. aren't used for discrimination. It makes sense when you don't think about it.
Sorry but you might want to rethink this position from the perspective of trans or nonbinary people who are under assault in these states. Unless you can guarantee anonymity this carries extreme risk.
insurance
I mean, if you split gender and sex there's still a problem that unless you put ""other"" your form will never be inclusive no matter what other options are
I think it’s meant to mean “sex” and “gender” but someone was unsure of what terms to use and so put “gender” for “sex” and then “gender designation” instead of just “gender”
I thought that too, I’d get if it was a medical form where that would be important, but for a job placement it seems arbitrary. Are there many jobs where AGAB would matter? I thought maybe a PE teacher if the school has split sex PE classes
tbh i don’t even get the intent of keeping both for a work form. my legal gender is “x” and my body is biologically “both” so i don’t know what answer they think i’m gonna give for “gender” lol
Then it should be ""Legal sex (as on your passport)"" and ""gender designation""
I edited it to clarify.
It's not relevant to a job.
Doctors don't assign ""non-binary""
ohhhh so gender is your identity and “gender designation” is your legal designation
From my understanding, affirmative action does not permit setting quotas or anything like that. It's just analyzing statistics about the hiring outcomes, and building strategies to perform more outreach for specified communities who are underrepresented in the field than expected. So basically any two applicants will have the same rigorous process to go through, be treated exactly the same, and have an accurate chance relative to their skillset and performance to receive the job. It does not make it easier for anybody to make it through after applying, it makes the employer try to get more applicants from underrepresented groups.

For example: an engineering company has a list of job openings, but they don't advertise them online, they only put up application info in a select few bars around the city, where people with similar race or sex or gender or economic background tend to flock to, but not much of anyone else. They might use affirmative action to set goals to advertise in more pubs which are more diverse in customer base, or begin recruiting online or at college events. That way more people even have an opportunity to go for the job, not that they'll have it any easier at all, that is not allowed.
This is actually part of why I grit my teeth and bear it when it comes to doing anything like changing my name on my license or birth certificate.  

Half Price Books tho is incredible from the corporate level when it comes to supporting LGBTQ people.
I’m gonna be honest, that doesn’t clear it up for me lol
I get that, I feel like there’s a big difference between the options “other” and “other, please specify”, one feels like it’s just lumping everything outside of the binary into one while the other seems more like it’s making an effort to be inclusive and allow people to inform of their self-identification. I’d get if people would think that it’s a bit of an intrusive question which could be rectified by a “prefer not to disclose” option
Bruh
I assume it ties into legal stuff, especially at a state or federal level. I can imagine certain things like SSN are tied to a binary identity still, so even if your work respects it, they still need to report the correct thing to the right agencies.
Not every place recognizes x, and this could also go for things like company insurance policies and such. Sex, as far as what is needed, is simply data here for one reason or another.

The only issue I have with this form, is how often these are actually just disguised ""Look at us! We are inclusive."". My work started polling data and really pushing inclusivity...while basically every supervisor is a bigot.  My direct supervisor went on a rant that could be summed up as keep your beliefs out of sight out-of mind
It should be ""legal gender"" and ""crime gender""
Well yes, that was established. I'm just saying that the continued existence of the question is a result of some haphazard requirements.
yes ofc!. It shouldn't be and that i say ""It shouldn't be"" instead of: ""it is not"", it's sad.

You wanna work here... hmmmm what does your Genitials looks like? do you even have one? like.. fuck off dude...
They do assign sex, and sometimes they'll use x
Here you go - a lot of complex history of Affirmative Action in the US is in the [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Affirmative_action_in_the_United_States) article. 


* In 1965, an executive order was signed that mandated federal contractors focused on equal opportunity employment - ie hiring minorities, in part, because they are minorities    
* In 1986, it was ruled by the US Supreme Court that race-based quotas were acceptable    
* In 1987, it was rules that sex and/or race were acceptable factors for job qualification   


Also read about [Gratz vs Bollinger](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gratz_v._Bollinger) - essentially, a point system was giving bonus points to minorities, which pushed out people who were more qualified, otherwise. This was in 2003, which is *somewhat* recent, in the grand scheme of things - this could have significantly affected the lives of us and our parents.

**BUT** Affirmative Action has gone through a lot of changes to make it more fair for everyone. So my info is outdated - it's not as bad as it was - but the fact that we treat people differently based on irrelevant physical characteristics still exists and it's still pretty fucked.

Edit: And to my original response, I was explaining why it's okay to ask one's biological sex, but not whether they want to have kids - because we've mandated it.
when you're married most people share insurance benefits
Then specifying should be optional too...
Yeah I know, feels like the “he a little confused but he got the spirit” with them realising there’s a difference but getting the terminology for it wrong
yeah i’m legally X, it’s just taking a while for all systems to catch up.
So I recently changed my name legally, and unlike my license, which numbers changed, the SS card didn’t. I guess it’s on a basis of truth. I did have issues when I put in my legal sex as F when I started my new job because it wasn’t legally that yet but that’s what I know on this
Yeah, I says it's for an I-9 form so it has to follow some unfortunate legal designations
gah i'm sorry your work is like that :( that really sucks. 

and yeah i definitely have a privilege where i live of being legally non-binary, and i've encountered systems where that's still not an option and then i legit don't know what i'm supposed to put.
Nerd gender and cool gender.
That's good! Now do it for everyone please! :)
It sucks that it's gotta be this way I'll say.
Ahhhhh now I getcha, thank you!
Wouldn’t it be made optional by a “prefer not to specify” option though? Or are you including that as a way of specifying itself?
Yeah but still, a quick Google search would've solved it
Are you from Argentina by any chance?
Ideally, the hiring process wouldn't ask for any irrelevant info until as late as possible because of the human condition and its biases.

Even someone's name can illicit prejudice, while ^obviously it has no effect on whether they can do a job.
Yes, I want an option of picking ""other"" without getting into details. Labels are really arbitrary
nah, usa
Yep
Ahhh I didn't know they had the X there too as we have here in our DNI."	zmudhp	NonBinary	1444	1.0	2022-12-15 19:55:41

"My gender is ""I'd like to be the embodiment of spring without everyone automatically attaching fertility to it thanks"""		"You look as amazing as a field of sunflowers at dawn.
Stay springy!
you look like the type of spring that's all about renewal and change and growth 🌼🌼 you look lovely!!
Same. I recently started to wear flower crowns. Whoever said they are for little girls, is just dead wrong.
As the embodiment of autumn I highly approve ♡︎♡︎♡︎
I do believe you have captured that perfectly. And you look absolutely amazing.
That's really an interesting way of putting things.  I never equated beauty such as you have with fertility, myself, but I could just be weird like that.

Anyway, Avatar of Blooms, please take my admiration and reverence.  🌹

Oh, and I dig those freckles, too!
Wow that's a really good description. You look amazing!
You're so radiant!
Gorgeous, sunny, lovely... I bet you’d look stunning in a meadow in the lull of the late afternoon 💐
You look great! I'm jealous of those earrings
""I am the embodiment of spring- no goddamit, not the fertility thingy!! I am the cruel spring. I am the fight among the males. I am the cruel dichotomy between hot days and cold nights that kills the featherless little birds in the nest. I am the new poison in the insect's sting and in the snake's fangs. Oh yes, I am spring."" 

Sorry, I read too much fantasy. You look gorgeous btw, not at all cruel!
Mission accomplished
Oh my god me too. That’s a wonderful way to put it haha

you look so lovely !! <3

That is so sweet! Thank you!
Yes, that's wording it perfectly! Thank you!
That's just not fair, *everyone* looks cute in flower crowns. I'll never stop wearing them
Absolutely! If not flower crowns, then flowers woven into the hair. Such a timeless look.
Kindred spirits! 🧚🏻‍♂️

(As a side note, my keyboard changed kindred to loved, which is also applicable. You are loved!)
Thank you!
Ohh Avatar of Blooms, I like that! 

AND THANK YOU! I love my freckles so much!
Thanks so much!
Thank you!
That's a lovely visual ☺ Thank you
Oh thank you! The earrings were part of a gift (including a matching necklace) I got for Christmas. My family knows how much I love bees 💐🐝💕
Oh man, no need to apologize, I loved reading this! Persephone didn't become ""destroyer of worlds"" for no reason, after all!
Thanks!
Yesss I'm glad someone understands!
Glad you can relate!
My partner is pagan and pays respects to Hades and Persephone, which has led me on my own journey to commune with Athena. We also love Lore Olympus, so the parallels to Hades and Persephone both from original stories to modern interpretations really resonate with us. 

Thank you for your comment 🤗💕
OOOH YES GOOD THANK YOU!
That's very sweet, thank you!
Thank you!
Thank you! 💕
Thank you!
D'aw, shucks! 

Thanks!
Thank you, I appreciate it!

I often switch between this and “I must exude the energy of a Victorian aristocrat”
So yeah haha
Went thru your entire feed.. I've a crush on you now.. damn.

You're lovely💕
Not just fully clothed, but you can't even see my figure in the photo lol
I hope you can achieve that look often, and if not, I hope the day comes soon that you're able to fully and freely express yourself every day 🤗
Aw haha, thank you! You're lovely too ❤

To be honest you may be right. Cis men like to use insults as a form or flattery. It's like cis women but in kindergarten.

the issue is that they're either a. a fucking dumbass or b. a fucking prick

I dunno about that, but something natural yet neutral fits 'em. [Rowan](https://www.reddit.com/r/NonBinary/comments/rcr5dd/feelin_very_gender_in_thiswhat_name_do_i_look_like/hnxu2rw/), for instance. The mountain ash in my front yard when I was a kid was one of my favorite trees, and I'm a huge goth, so.
Sib says Ezra 💖
100% a Felix!  OP makes me think a little of the character Felix from Boyfriends!
I also thought L for a sec. :)
Ayy I also thought Alistair!
I 3rd this!
KENNNNNYYY
Wait why? I was going to +1 Q.
It can mean bad in Latin and Spanish, but fwiw, in this case the etymology of the ""mal"" in ""malachite"" comes from the word ""mallow"" as in the mallow/malva plant (like marshmallows!), a word which itself can be traced from english to latin & greek to mediterranean...
So named because the color of the stone is like the leaves of the plant
Spanish is the language you're looking for
Same like Cyr!!
ooooh yes, Rowan fits beautifully!
THEY HAVE NAMES?
Immediately thought it had to be something dark academia and it fit too well 😅
I 4th it!
Q is the supposed leader of the Qanon movement.
interesting! thank you for teaching me plant i like plant <3
They do!!! It’s not really explicitly stated in the comic, but…

Jock is Kevin, Goth is Felix, Nerd is Adrian and Prep is Vincent. I think I got them right!
i 5th it!
Oh gadz - right! It didn't even occur to me to go there. I had a friend in college who went by Q
Let's not let them take Q from us
They shall not take my Star Trek references from mw
I Just Know Q As The Guy From Star Trek. Now I'm Gonna Pretend Conspiracy Theorists Think He's Taking Over Our Planet.
TIL. Goth is such a Felix tho.
Yeah I wouldn't have gone there either. I have many friends whose first / last names start with ""Q"" and they go by that. None of us think anything of it."	rcr5dd	NonBinary	1395	1.0	2021-12-09 21:00:49

Where can I get those boots
Is the belt on your thigh just a standard one of those belts cut down to length or is it meant to be worn like that initially? If so where did you get it?
Mmmmmm you look lush
Is this what people call gender envy?
Love this!
Fantastic x
Ahahah thank you!! That’s my ideal gender tbh lol
Ahahah I love that!!
Thank you so much!! I shop secondhand a lot, the top is secondhand but originally from the brand Killstar, they have a lot of gothic stuff I think? The pants are from Jack & Jones, and the boots are Demonias!
Yes they are!! The style is Damned-225
This made me laugh jshfhdjsj, thank you!
They’re from the brand Demonia, the style is Damned-225! You can get them directly from their website, or if you’re in Canada, I ordered them from shoefreaks.ca
It’s just a standard one of those types of belts, I had one that partially broke so I cut it shorter!
Congratulations you succeeded
Right? It was awesome. Plus it was the first time most of my coworkers had seen me wearing a skirt, and none of them have made any sort of big deal about it even now. It was awesome.

I (22) came out to my boyfriend (24) as afab non-binary and he was fine with dating me until I told him I want to get a chest binder. (I also have no idea what flair to put for this post)	"First off, we’ve been together for a month. 

And I’ve explained to him that me having a female chest is causing major gender dysphoria and his response was “if you turn into a guy then that’s a deal breaker.” My bf obviously likes my chest while I hate it. EDIT to add: he also said “no don’t do that. I like your chest.” 

I may delete this post because I know the answer is obvious. I should break up with him if he doesn’t accept me. I’ve given him the weekend to process everything since I’ll be out of town. 

I just need advice.

EDIT: Thank you all so much for the advice. I just need to find a way to break up with him nicely. I’m sure I’ll find another partner eventually that accepts the real me.

EDIT 2: I was straightforward about why I broke up with him and he hasn’t responded. Which I expected. Even though I’m upset that I’m not in a relationship, I’m also happy because it wasn’t a good relationship in the first place. Again, thank you all for the help ❤️"	"Yeah, in your situation there isn't much else to do I believe. The guy is into women, and you are not a woman after some reflection, so it's understandable that it wouldn't fit together. Try and break up as amicably as you can -- you can probably stay friends. If that's any reassurance I'm certain you'll find another partner later who will take you as you are. I wish you well and I hope this goes as well as possible.
you're right on the money babe. find someone who likes you for *you* not the made up version of you they have in their head. if he's only ""fine with it"" if he can pretend you're cis, he's not actually fine with it at all (and you deserve to have your gender celebrated, not just tolerated)
The deal breaker comment alone would be enough to dump him for me. I get that people have their preferences,  but ""turn into a guy"" is a poor choice of words.
You absolutely can find folks who don’t just “tolerate” you and who don’t put themselves between you and what you want to do with your gender expression.

As for breaking up gently, I’m sure you’ve got this. Advice abounds, but just be clear about how you’re not willing to put him before your needs. This isn’t happening because you’re interested in binding or because you’re not a woman, it’s because you two don’t mesh and your boundaries are clashing.
you are who you are and you can't/shouldn't have to change it for a partner, but he's straight and into women, that's also nothing he can or should change. 

this is a situation where neither of you are right/wrong or anything, you just don't seem to be a good fit as a couple.
i’m sorry this happened to you. but i’m glad you’re taking care of yourself and ending it. in terms of doing it nicely, i would say just be straightforward and honest. “i like you, but i need to do what is best for me. if this is a dealbreaker for you, then i’m sorry, but this relationship isn’t right for me.” it sounds like he also doesn’t respect your terms/pronouns, if he insists on calling you his gf, so if you do want to maintain a friendship you might want to have a serious conversation about that. even if he doesn’t fully understand your gender identity, he needs to respect you. i also hope you can start binding to help with your dysphoria! i struggle with the same, binding helps a lot. ❤️
There's a lot of great responses here, but there's a couple of things I wanted to touch on and emphasize as someone who has been in a similar situation. You sound like you have things really figured out on your end, but in case anyone else needs this:

There's two things at play here:

1 - your boundaries and preferences, which deserve to be respected

2 - his boundaries and preferences, which deserve to be respected

The way I see it, people in relationships (regardless of romantic or not) negotiate these boundaries and preferences through communication, particularly ""I"" statements. We can't control what the other person does or wants, but we can state what we need to continue this voluntary relationship, and leave if these aren't met.

You did this - you trusted him with important, relevant information about who you are and how he can best respect you (terms like ""partner"" for instance).

What he did, from an outsider's perspective, is respond - not with ""I"" statements that communicated his boundaries in a respectful way - but with ""you"" statements and ultimatums, while ignoring your needs. IMHO, relationships shouldn't come down to ""do this or I'll leave."" It's much more like, ""This is what I need, and I'll be adult enough to communicate to you if this will no longer work for me.""

The difference is this:

""If you express your gender in this way, that's a deal-breaker.""

VS

""I like you a lot, but I only see myself in romantic relationships with people whose gender identity and expression matches that of a feminine woman. I am sorry that our needs and preferences no longer match up.""

Your gender identity, your expression, isn't the problem and should never be made to seem that way by a partner. The issue is that your have different wants and needs that no longer line up.

All of this is to say -- I'm sorry that you had to try to read the tea leaves of his thoughts and preferences and make this decision for him (though of course it's for you as well). This breakup should've probably come from him, with him communicating what he needed in response to your own communication, not him blasting past your needs, disrespecting your identity, to try to keep the relationship the same.

Anywho, that's my 2 cents as an internet stranger.
Dump his ass
You’re not transitioning to male just from wearing a chest binder lol wtf? Lots of nonbinary people wear binders without being full on FTM. 

I wear a binder during the day, and I enjoy my partner playing with my chest during sex (it feels good to me!) It’s a win-win arrangement for us. I think your bf is being unreasonable. I could see him drawing a line with top surgery, that seems reasonable, but a binder is literally just clothing.
I agree. Being with someone who doesn't accept the true you is worse then being alone. Just be safe and be honest, that's the best way to do it. Good luck 😌
I’m so very glad you broke up with this person (friendly internet hugs or high five) I was about to comment how it’s a serious red flag and he has a stipulation on who you are or are not “allowed” to be- but then re-read the edits :) I’m so so glad you found that out a month in and didn’t waste anymore time.

Especially where chests are involved. I like plastic surgery/conformation surgeries specifically and hate when people mod their chests due to what someone else likes or dislikes. Like you have to live with it and all the pros/cons it comes with
He was fine with your gender as long as je could ignore it. He wasn't fine with dating you, he was fine with imagining you were a cis woman then ignoring who you were entirely and using corrective measures to get you to conform to his vision. You aren't woman-lite. Glad you stood up for yourself and dropped him
Get rid! My partner met me when I identified as a trans man. I wasn’t transitioning any time soon and so was really distrustful of him even being with me (he was previously only with girls). 

He has stayed with me the whole time, only ever respected me, used he/him pronouns without question behind my back and to my face, and always called me boyfriend or partner on my request. I now realise I’m non-binary and he’s adjusted everything accordingly. The right partner is out there for you. 

You can’t really blame your partner for being straight - I can understand where he’s coming from. He didn’t sign up for you to not be a cis woman really. But then he isn’t the best person for you. Glad to read your update and I wish you all the best in the future! The right person for you is out there! Xx
Hi, I'm also afab nonbinary, just wanting to share my experiences with this. 

Due to my transphobic and homophobic fathers side of the family, I was very fearful of my identity and never tried to figure myself out. So I've always been nonbinary, but after a huge wave of dysphoria a few months ago I actually identified as enby and came out to one person, my boyfriend. 

He and I were together for 3 years before this, but it was still nerve wracking especially because he swore he was straight. I was scared shitless coming out to him, but after I did he accepted me. I told him I'm comfortable with any pronouns but mostly they/them. I cut my hair ""boy short"" and have been experimenting with it ever since. He refers to me in whichever ways I feel most comfortable and will say different terms for me that make me happy. He's since said that he's pan (but really is only attracted to me) and has made a lot of validating and progressive comments. 

So, I promise you there is (yes, even men) that will accept you and love you for who you are. I also want to start binding even though my chest is already ""small,"" and I just want you to know I understand. You are loved and you will continue to be loved more than ever. Best of luck, friend!
Just commenting to let you know that there are guys out there who will love you for you. I’m 23 afab non-binary and I came out to my cishet boyfriend about 6 months ago and he has been nothing but supportive. He uses my pronouns correctly and corrects other people (and myself even) when they use the wrong pronouns. He’s helped me find more masc clothing and given me advice on what mens-style clothing looks best on me. I can tell that he still really loves me deeply and supports me and my gender identity. So there is hope out there! You will find someone so stay positive!
Yeah, I think you made the right choice. He didn't love you, he loved your chest
Hi pal. I am afab non binary and married to a woman. My wife has always identified as gay and is not attracted to men in any way shape or form. I have always had severe gender dysphoria surrounding my chest as well. My wife is actually the person who first started talking to me about being non binary. I had no idea what it was until then. She suggested top surgery to me. I never thought about that before either. Due to finances, I can’t get top surgery very soon so she ordered me a chest binder. I’ve asked my wife how she feels about me being non binary and not being feminine at all, and she always says that I’m her person. She doesn’t care what gender I am. My point to you is, you WILL find your person too. Get the chest binder, you will not regret it.
If He's going to get upset about a binder he's clearly got more problems going on.
I broke up with my bf not long ago, but he was a huge boobs guy. I hate my chest, and I got a breast reduction a few years ago. Before I told him about the reduction, he always said that he liked me for who I was. BUT after he found out that I had a reduction, he couldn't let it go. He was obsessed, saying that if we have been together he would have tried to talk me out of it. He would fantasize over my old pictures, and make me feel terrible about myself even though I'm much more happy now. 
I honestly don't believe it's worth it. I gave him a chance, and I told him how much it hurt my feelings when he would say hurtful things like this. But eventually it got to be too much
Much love OP ❤️
Glad to read you put him in the bin where he belongs!!
if they don’t accept you for who you are and how you want to present yourself, then they’re not worth your time. you did the right thing, i wish u good luck on your journey👾
I get it. I (35 AFAB) am dating a man. Luckily he has no idea what being Agender means. But there are other issues to the relationship.    

I plan to leave and go on my own when I can. I have to save up first.
So I want to be clear about something.  While your Ex-BF may have not been nice about it, neither of you are wrong.  He doesn't have to be in a relationship with you if you're not what he likes/wants either physically or mentally.  AT the same time, you have a right to find someone who will love and respect you for who you are.  It was best that you ended things with him.
You're going to find someone who loves and celebrates you in all your enby glory! I'm glad you made room for it.

💛🤍🖤💜
OP people should love their partner no matter how they look. Think of it like this; he wouldn’t like you if you had to get them removed because of a medical reason. Even if that reason was your own peace of mind. He can’t even comprehend you doing the nonperminent solution, so that tells you how things would play out in the future if that is something you want.
Awww! I’m really impressed with you! You identified something that was not ok with you, identified when he said something that was essentially a red flag for controlling your identity, and then you found a way to exit that felt ok for you. I feel like I sucked at making any of those statements because I didn’t want to summarize anything in a way that didn’t feel authentic, but I also want to honor what you did because it’s really hard.

You deserve to be in relationships where your identity is cherished and supported. I would be incredibly sad if I broke up with someone and they didn’t respond too. It’s so hard to move forward with our that closure. 

❤️❤️❤️
A girlfriend I dated had a preference when it came to my hair. She liked that it was long and even though it was sometimes uncomfortable and i thought short hair looked better on me I liked it because she liked it. I cared more about what she liked on me then what I liked on me. I say “what I liked” but because she liked it I didn’t dislike it 🤔.. yuh know. If you care more about what you want different about yourself than what your boyfriend likes about you as you are then that’s cool but is that really the case. Obviously hair is much different so how about this. I’d love to have a vagina (this isn’t hypothetical) but if my girlfriend loves my penis I love the fact and even feel fortunate that I have one. I would think ugh what if I had a vagina then I’d want a penis because I’d know my girlfriend wants that more. Or if your girlfriend thinks you’re an ass wouldn’t you want to not be an ass or would you just be selfish and think “I’m just an asshole this is who I am”. Idk just something to think about 🤷‍♂️ wouldn’t you want to be what your boyfriend wants? Obviously to a certain extent. Like if if he want to be a druggy (hard drugs) and wants you to be one with him then of course but your chest?? I don’t really get what the big deal is and you broke up over it??
P.S. idk maybe I think this way because I’m a very submissive person.
May I commit physical violence?
Hey, I know you already solved the issue but I just want to say as a fellow afab non binary person that I am so proud of you for putting yourself first. Our identify is more important than any partner. You rock.
it’s been a month, break up with him
I think it is really harsh that just because you might wear a binder he would not date you anymore lol. Definitely not one to keep imo, you are not your chest and deserve someone who will like you no matter your chest ey.
All the best, and best wishes going forward.
Really happy to hear you felt safe/comfortable with getting out of a relationship that wasn't working out for you. You put your own happiness and wellbeing first, and that's something to be proud of.
i had a similar situation happen where my friends were dating the male didnt want his significant other to get top surgery. i would say break up with him. sometimes, as accepting as men may seem they may put that and simply use people to get what they want.
I had a similar situation a few months ago where my gf took an interest in a female coworker after I expressed that I was non-binary. She denied everything for months, until we were drunk one night and she said she’d just started identifying as lesbian and didn’t know where I fit into that. Just take your time with yourself and enjoy openly expressing yourself and exploring what makes you happy!
That sucks, but you did the right thing. Better a month wasted on the unworthy than years.
was going to comment then i saw your edits. you did the right thing, i’m around the same age & if someone won’t love you for who you are you don’t need them. i’m proud of you for sticking up for yourself!!
Imo if he presents you with the ultimatum of ""if you become a guy it's a deal breaker"" then he ain't it chief. I get it not everyone's on the spectrum but kinda shitty to be like ""you can't be who you want to be""
break up with him. y’all only been dating a month, not worth it.
I know this has already been dealt with my but I wanted to reinforce that the break up was smart! This exact same thing happened to me when I figured out I was some form of non-binary and started exploring my gender in high school. My at the time boyfriend (now ex) said he supported me but that he couldn’t date me if I ended up being a boy and that he didn’t like when I dressed masculine or even mentioned my dysphoria with my body. Well that ended up being one of the many red flags that I should’ve seen in the early relationship because he became abusive within 3 months of dating and I got stuck with him for a year and 5 months
Best of luck for you to find a better and accepting partner!
Yo this shit why it would take a miracle for me to date a cishet
First, ew. You did the right thing. It’s sad that he said what he did but telling someone that they like them for a part of them that they openly say causes discomfort is just freaking disgusting.

I hope you find people to surround you and affirm your identity. You deserve to present the way you want to, screw presenting to others. You had to do that crap for 16-18 years, you earned the right to be you.
I think breaking up with him was the right choice, but unless you were already digital/ldr then breaking up over message is pretty lame.
I'm glad you broke up with him! Even though he is straight I still think the way he responded wasn't right - you have a right to your own bodily autonomy even if it's something that he personally would rather you do different. I'm straight too and I like boobs more than anyone I've met but if my girlfriend wanted to wear a binder, I wouldn't stop her. It's her choice what to do with her body, just like it's your choice what you do with yours.
my spouse came out as non-binary before i did. i can’t imagine not being supportive of anything they feel, or them not being supportive of anything i feel. if this is causing a problem now, then he’s probably not going to change. find someone who loves you for you, no matter who you are or what you look like.
You've already made the right choice so I'll just say that you cannot hold it against yourself if they don't take it well. Block them if you need to, if it's best for you.
Congrats on the first step of moving on to discover someone who loves you more than the sum of your parts. I wish you all the best, because you deserve someone who can compromise and make concessions for your mental health and wellbeing. You deserve to be reassured and supported, and he wasn't doing that for you. I'm sorry.
Congratulations, and I’m sorry you had to go through that
im so proud of you for making the right decision!! take a biig hug from me (if you want one :3)
Even though the answer is obvious you just got to vent and have people behind your back agreeing with you and makes the situation so much better.
I’m so proud of you for putting your well-being first and not giving in to your ex’s pressure. You will find someone who loves and supports you completely, I guarantee it!!
Oh no after reading this and some of the comments I  just realized I might be in this exact situation right now
good for you for doing that, i know it will have been hard if you cared about him but you’ll be happier when you find someone who loves you the way you are :))
I’ve tried to date straight boys before, it’s not worth it
I can see I'm too late to change your mind and I'm probably going to be the only person with this opinion, but I think you should give your boyfriend some time before going for the nuclear option. I mean, a 1 month relationship isn't that big of a loss (in the scheme of things at least), but coming out as NB is a lot for a romantic partner to process and it's something you may have to do again in the future. When I came out to my wife, she found many different ways to express how repulsed she was by the idea of me being feminine. At one point, I remember complimenting her on a dress and her response was to put on this disgusted look and say, ""did you want to borrow it or something?"" That was about a year ago and, even though she still struggles with my gender identity, she becomes more accepting every day. Yesterday, she freely offered to go out with me in support when I told her I was nervous about wearing a dress to a concert I'm going to. It sounds like this guy may not have been *the one*, but one of these days, you might have someone really great that just needs some time.
You... broke up by text..?
Kinda arrived after the war, but just wanted to say congrats for breaking up. I'm very sorry it had to happen, truly, but I'm impressed you stood for yourself. I really hope it gets better for you!
Thanks. And I will. I’ll figure out a way to break up with him.
Yeah, I’ve thought about that too. Plus he refers  to me as “his girlfriend” and not “partner” like I want him to. And I agree with what you said, I (as many other enby’s) do deserve to have our gender celebrated and not tolerated. I just need to figure out a way to break up with him nicely.
It's not wrong for him to want to be with a woman, because that might just be what his orientation is. But pretending that the OP was a woman after they came out as NB is where he went wrong. If he wasn't okay with a partner who wasn't a woman, then he should have been up front with the OP and said that he didn't swing that way, rather than what he actually did.
>you deserve to have your gender celebrated, not just tolerated)

I like this
>(and you deserve to have your gender celebrated, not just tolerated)

Quote of the century right there.
These are the correct words.
I’ve found people who celebrate my sexuality but tolerate my gender, and people who tolerate my sexuality but celebrate my gender. You’re 100% right, and I hope someday I’ll find (or maybe have found!!!!) the one who does both.
It was for me too. And I know. While I prefer being mistaken as a guy I don’t want to fully transition into a guy. If that makes sense.
I know. 

And I did. I was straightforward about why I broke up with him but in a nice way.
It’s okay and I’m glad I’ve ended it. And thanks! I’m planning on ordering a chest binder this weekend but I’m not sure where to get one from. I’ve heard that GC2B are good ones.
I 100% agree with what you’re saying. It should’ve come from him but he continually misgendered me when I told him multiple times I didn’t like the term “girlfriend” and he wasn’t going to change then I decided enough was enough.
I did
I know. But I eventually want to get top surgery because I want a flat chest.
Thanks :)
Me too! (internet high five) 

And I eventually want to get top surgery but I’m going to wait till I’m financially stable and living on my own since I still live with my parents at the moment.
I’m glad I got rid of him and that’s so cool! I’m happy for you :) and I know.
Hey. And ah, I’m glad everything worked out for you! 

And I know I’ll find someone eventually. I’m also pan so I don’t really care who I date/marry. It just my ex refused to use the pronouns I wanted and stuff. And yeah. I know I’ll find someone eventually
Oh he definitely loved my chest and not me. His other response to me chest binding was “No don’t do that. I like your chest.” And that’s when I knew I needed to break up with him.
For sure. I’m glad I broke up with him.
I wish you luck and hope for you to be free ans independent soon!
I agree. And I eventually want to get them removed once I have enough money to do so.
Lol sure. I actually thought about that too 😂
I’m going to
I know lol
Thanks
I know. When he said that I decided I was going to break up with him. Which I did and I’m so happy I’m not with him anymore.
Yeah for sure. I also should’ve included this in my original text but he also said “No don’t do that. I like your boobs.” So that’s when I knew he liked my chest more than me. 

And I am. Thankfully my dad and siblings and friends accept me for who I am.
I know breaking up thru text is pretty lame. But our relationship was digital.
I’m glad too and yeah that makes sense. Like I get that he likes boobs, heck I’m pansexual, and I like boobs too but just not my own 😂  but the fact that he knew it caused me gender dysphoria and didn’t care was a red flag.
I know. And i did block him.
Thanks and it’s okay. At least I realized it a month and not any time later
Thanks! And I’ll take the hug :)
Oh no! Hope everything turns out alright for you
Yeah.
I don’t think I went for the nuclear option. I came out to him as non-binary before and he was okay with dating me UNTIL I said I’m getting a chest binder. That was the dealbreaker since he didn’t respect my decision and he liked my breasts more than me. So I broke up with him.
Yeah
If you're thinking of breaking up, just straight up tell him something like ""I think we're not compatible anymore, we have different values/views and continuing like this will not benefit either of us."" Preferably *in a public setting* to make sure you're safe. Don't get into a whole ""You hurt my feelings"" thing, it's very tempting but the mature way is the truth, and (based on his comments) the truth is that you guys just aren't compatible. You don't owe him or anyone else an explanation for why you're choosing yourself over a relationship that might not be serving you anymore.

Alternatively, (again in a public setting lol) you could try explaining more about Nonbinary people/the community/casually bring up any Nonbinary role models you have, watch Anthony Padilla's vid on NB people together lol, ect. If this is his first time hearing about all of this he probably has a lot to think about and needs both the information from you and time to himself to think about your relationship. Maybe it's not over, maybe you just need time, patience, and be willing to work together to figure this out as a team (NOT settle!). Again as long as you make sure you're safe, this is an option too.
Even if I’m with a cis person or a binary trans person I still hate the words “girlfriend” and “Boyfriend” partner is jsut the superior term ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
honestly he should know what's coming. you could start calling him your girlfriend until he gets tired of it :3 (this is a bad idea do not do this)
I was in your place a few years ago and I made the wrong choice (stayed with the asshole) out of fear that I couldn't get any better than someone tolerating my transness. Wasted 3 of the best years of my life with someone who treated me poorly.

Anyways, like 3 months after we broke up I met the person of my dreams and every day with him feels like a fairytale, he loves me and is proud to introduce me to his friends and family as his partner, and supports and respects my decisions and bodily autonomy. Been together over a year and a half now, planning on getting a place together in the next few months, depending.

What I'm trying to say is, your person is out there! Life is too short to waste on people that don't appreciate all of you. Don't settle for anything less than exactly what you want in a partner!
I had been with a supposedly young enby and they called me their ""girlfriend"" and it was upsetting. I have learned from dating or knowing many closeted and  not fully open sexual minorities since I have been out that you will only feel bad hiding who you are and as my therapist has said, some relationships do not survive a transition but that is true.
It does :) because you’re non binary. I’m the exact same in that respect. Means we don’t adhere to the binary- which male is. People can be so silly :/
Makes sense to me, I feel that honestly
gc2b binders are very good! i got my first binder from there, but unfortunately i have problems with my shoulders which makes it hard to get on/off, so i can't wear it anymore
My fiance has a couple. The black one fits better than the nude one they got even though they're the same size? It's odd. Just don't be afraid to go up or down a size if the first one isnt just right!
Hell yeah!
Had to comb the comments for this!! I literally cheered ❤️
Yeah. In that case sounds like y’all ultimately won’t be compatible
Aw that’s wonderful! Yeah it’s definitely really expensive. When you’re living on your own too, insurance might cover some of it? Something to look into. I’m so excited for you!!!
Thank you!
Alright! I’ll get me mallet!
Hence why I prefaced it with that lol, I understand in that case. It can’t be helped. You did what was necessary ❤️
Yeah maybe I just understand what it is like because I'm trans lol. I wouldn't want to cause someone that discomfort even if I liked that part of their body before.

I was actually kinda excited to grow boobs at first because that meant I would have a pair of boobs I could play with 24/7 (I was obsessed with boobs even back then) but when it happened I was like ""what the fuck is this"" because they actually caused me great dysphoria lmao.
\*hugg*
Well he broke up with me now so I guess it did turn right
That's... a very last resort thing to do
I agree. I prefer the term “partner” it’s nice to say lol.
I prefer the term joyfriend to partner. Partner is for marriage.
Ok but....lovefriend? Absolutely a lovely term to get called too, just feels SO good lmao~
Lol I thought about doing that. But I didn’t. I blocked him after he responded with “ok have a good life”
Similar boat, I settled for someone because I thought they were the best I could find as a non-binary person. They were asexual, I am not; I wasted almost 1.5 years.

Over 1.5 years later I’ve just found another enby who seems super promising. I really hope this ends up going well!!!
Cool :) and yeah, I know. Heck, my mom is convinced I’m trans when I’ve told her multiple times I’m not :/ my dad and siblings on the other hand are fine with me being non-binary.
Im planning on getting one from there. I need to email the GC2B support people to figure out my size. Since my chest size is bigger than my shoulder width I’m not sure which size to get.
Ah cool, that’s good to know. I’m also going to get the tank binder instead of the half binder, seems like it’ll fit better. And I may get two of two different sizes and see which one fits better.
Yep :) I’m happy and I’m going to order a chest binder this weekend :D
Yeah, hopefully my insurance will cover some of it. And yeah, I’m really looking forward to it :)
Lol I know :) and yeah. Hopefully I’ll find someone better in the future :)
*hugg* thanks :)
They were together a month. Hardly enough to warrant a large break up discussion. Text is very reasonable in this situation.
I'm personally fond of ""datemate""
My husband is absolutely wonderful about gender-neutral terms for me but I think I should have nipped ""snoogywoogums"" in the bud...
Awe that’s such a sweet name 🥺
Spouse is for marriage. I call my boyfriend my partner because we’re past boyfriend/girlfriend/joyfriend, we’ve been living together for years, but we’re not married yet.
Mmmm that’s quite dapper as well
You didnt have to block him.. he was gone. That's what have a good life means.
It’s such a weird thing- that when people learn one definition, they like stick to that a lot of the time, even if it doesn’t fit. It’s such an odd thing to me. Like partially trying to learn and be supportive but half not… 

It’s up to the individual. Like us. Me, I’m non binary and trans. You, you’re afab and non-binary :) both are equally valid. I’m very glad your dad and siblings are on board though, hopefully your mum will be soon too. Don’t see the point in insisting you’re something you’re not
yeah, i had that issue too. i'm fairly sure they recommend going with the larger size, but definitely email them to confirm!
I just want to reassure you they are the friendly staff ever. 

I had a problem thats taken weeks to solve (not their fault, my binder got lost in the Mexican mailing system) and they have offered me the best solutions and with great follow up.

10/10 for gc2b and my binder hasnt even arrived lol
Yeah they have tank ones. Not sure if they're made slightly differently or?
I’m happy for you. I wish you the best
I am so happy for you!!! Good for you for knowing what works and what does not! <3 I also love datemate as a term as someone said. Partner is good IMO bc it is gender neutral but then also I am like yes I am not straight haha.
I respectfully disagree. It leads to exactly this situation, where you aren't sure if they've read your message yet. Text is also a very bad medium for emotional stuff in general. It's cold. It wouldn't be an option to me personally even if we'd been together a week
Datemate is pretty cool! I'm a big fan of ""joyfriend"" personally
My name is Stevonnie.
I meant for me partner seems more serious than joyfriend or datefriend.
I mean he blocked me after he sent that so I did it back lol
So why does it matter?
Yeah I agree. 

And yeah, I know. And like I also want to do low-dose testosterone HRT to look more masculine. Plus It’s such a weird thing to explain to my mom lol.
I'm AMAB Nonbinary and I'm bisexual and polyamorous.
Ah. And yeah, I was planning on getting a size bigger but wanted to confirm with them first.
That’s cool! I emailed them a couple hours ago for advice on what size binder I should get. Should hear a response soon :)
Thank you!
Thanks! And haha yeah datemate is pretty cool too
ooooh I am liking both datemate and joyfriend! I personally ask my partners to call me ""babefriend"" lol
Oh I meant joyfriend, but hi Stevonnie~ I’m willow
Oh yeah, that’s fair!
40% of people like boobs and 40% like twinkies. Why would anyone be mad at anyone for this? Do you like one or the other? Some people like both. That's ok too. But why are you mad at this fella?
Aw that’s awesome!
oh yeah absolutely. good luck and i hope you enjoy your binder when it comes!
That's great! I'm sure they'll help :)
Hoi, Willow!
Partner is for when you're living together but you're not married yet. Two of my coworkers are gay men. Both are very outgoing and energetic guys. One is slightly more feminine than the other one.
Thanks! Whenever it arrives I’ll definitely post a pic here :)
Yeah :) I’ve been wanting to order a chest binder for a while and I’m super excited to finally order one

[Self] Handmade Sailor Uranus Cosplay - Haruka is my Gender Spirit Animal		"Cosplaying Sailor Uranus has really helped me find myself. I started out cosplaying males only, which felt great. But then I realized I was neglecting part of myself. I didn't feel quite right going fully feminine, but Sailor Uranus is a really happen medium for me between how I feel as a person and how I'd like to express my gender. 

It feels great to have characters like this to be our non-binary icons and serve as inspiration and representation 💙✨
Gonna go smooch your “cousin” in that outfit?

Sorry that’s all I can think of whenever I see Haruka anymore lol, great cosplay!
I wish I could give this more upvotes. This story feels so very similar to a path I have been walking, using cosplay as a way to express myself. 


Your scouts are absolutely on point and amazing! I eventually want to go as Hotaru.
An outfit that highlights your artistic and beautiful style so flawlessly.
Didn't see what sub this was in. Immediately thought that's my gender
You look great. 

FYI, calling something your ""spirit animal"" is kinda offensive unless you are from a culture that has spirit animals. It's cultural appropriation. 

https://www.discovermagazine.com/planet-earth/please-stop-using-the-term-spirit-animal
Oh my gods this is beautiful! You are beautiful! You look like princess Diana!

Your cosplay is amazing, and I'm so jealous of your hair.
Yes.
How do you make your legs look that smooth 😭🥺
To say you nailed this is the understatement of the year, I'm not fully convinced you AREN'T Sailor Uranus   
Hoooooly smokes this is so good!
You've sent me into a gay panic, I hope you're happy
Something blocked the upper half and I only saw the legs and thought it was a figurine but then I scrolled and saw your face! Amazing!!!
This is gorgeous! Beautiful photography too!
You look amazing! I love the cosplay.
Those heals! They’re so amazing!
Love the handmade part it looks great on you!
YOU LOOK STUNNING AND AMAZINGLY AWESOME 👏👏👏👏👏👏❤️❤️❤️❤️
Absolutely stunning cosplay 👏👏👏
You look really good
Omg so cool to see indigenous/native american cosplayers!!! Representation is awesome :)
I am in LOVE, I wish I looked half as good as you!
Daammmmnnnn
I seem to want to be a girl even MORE NOW
Yeah, like best friends! 

Hahaha thank you so much 💙✨
It's such an amazing feeling to be able to find yourself and have so much creative freedom. I'm so glad you've had the same experience!!

Go for Hotaru!! I'm sure you'll look lovely 💜✨
Thank you so much!! I put a lot of my heart into it, I'm glad you can see 💙✨
We love representation 😻🌠
Thank you! My apologies, I'll be more careful in the future. Thank you for teaching me 💖
Thank you!! I actually cosplay the princess version too and wear a crown for it, I had at least 8 people think I was Princess Dianna 😹 And it's actually a wig! It's from arda-wigs.com 💙✨
That my friend is the power of dance tights 😌
Thank you so much! That means a lot to me hehe
I've actually gotten that before, haha!! Thank you so much 🌠
Thank you so much! This photo was taken by eurobeat_kasumi_ebk 🌠
Thank you 🌠
Thank you!
Thank you!!
No worries! Most people (including myself until recently) have no idea.
You should probably edit the post and remove the CA. /nm
If you’re truly sorry then you can edit it.
That's a wig!? It looks so natural, that's amazing! You're nearly a dead ringer for Diana, it's incredible.
I really do appreciate the insight. I'm going to keep researching since it's a really interesting topic too, thank you!
You can't edit post titles after posting.
AFAIK, you can't edit post titles once they've been posted.
I made sure to choose a more desaturated color so it would match my skin better. I also put a little concealer in my eyebrows to match the wig more, hehe. Maybe I'll dress up as Diana for real one day!
... in that case they can make a whole new post.
You are correct.
I'd say give it a shot. It'd be very cool!
But then they would have to actually give a shit"	t7a55v	NonBinary	1371	0.99	2022-03-05 14:05:33
Guess who broke my schools Gender structure 💛🤍💜🖤	"My sixth form is running the yearly Head Boy and Head Girl elections soon. I was debating whether I should run for it as my birth sex or not, but I spoke to my form tutor about it (who is an absolute legend by the way). She knows that I have a lot of internalised homophobia and etc from my old school, so she told me not to be afraid of who I am and it really inspired me! 

I emailed my head of sixth form explaining that I am Non Binary and thus I would like to run as ‘Head Person’ or something along those lines instead, arguing that it was more inline with modern gender inclusivity. 

He agreed with me and promised that he would re-make the election structure to allow me to run (as usually one boy and one girl are elected). This is me coming out to my year group and teachers, and everyone that knows about it so far has been to excited that I’ve done such a progressive thing!! 

I needed somewhere to share this because I’m so excited and proud! Thank you if you read this far <3"	"That’s so awesome! It sounds like you have some really supportive people working at your school. Wishing you the best of luck in your campaign to become head person!
""Head Person"" sounds a bit clunky but ""Head Student"" would be so good! It's inclusive and more descriptive of the role. Also if they want to refer to one specific Head Student, they could just say your name
It just made my day knowing that there are people out there who are willing to break the gender norms in our schools.
Thank you so much for your contribution. I will watch your career with great interest. Please do update or make another post as to whether you get Head person or not!
(◕ᴗ◕✿)
That's great! Hope you do well in the election. And hey, even if you don't win, imagine all the other closeted enbys at your school, looking at you and thinking, ""Hey... it's safe to come out.""
Yay!

💛🤍💜🖤
What you did was brave and will help others, too.
🥺🥺❤️❤️
That's awesome!

Good luck!
Great job yo!!
That's amazing! ❤
You should be proud ,that’s awesome ! ❤️
OMG brilliant! I'm so glad your teachers and everyone is supportive! Best of luck in the elections!
I wish I could run for head person ;;-;; I’m a masc nb, but I go to an all female school and sadly they’re very big with having the Only Head Girl thing
People really underestimate how easy it is to change policy at your school. Simply asking the right people can get you very far. I remember, both at my high school and college, just asking for help or accomodations started a few great programs. 

But also remember that you're probably not the only one dealing with your issues at your school, so just by asking, you can help others who are in a similar situation as yourself. Take the steps to ask for help, and you'll be helping more than just yourself.
God your so awesome! We need people like you to speak up and spread hope!
Good work!
great, proud of you 🙈
I am sharing in the excitement! Go you! You are helping that school take the right steps! And congrats on coming out to those people! I hope you are elected Head Person!
Stuff like this needs to happen more, awesome!
We stan
I'm sooo proud of you !
Omg you are so inspiring!! Not only did you advocate for yourself, but you’ve helped with updating traditions for others. You are goals ❤️
You are amazing! So glad you've got good adult allies at your school. Keep being your awesome self!
Congrats and good luck!
Also an older Non Binary person who went through hell within the school system long ago I say thank you. Amazing!
That’s amazing and gives me hope! Well done 💕
My sister's school has 2 Head Students now rather than girl/boy!!!! It's generally understood that the two people aren't usually of the same gender but if it came down to it there's no specific rule about it. Great system.

Good luck with it!!
I'm curious how it will change the game. One head girl, one head boy, one head person, making you automatically the head person as long as you don't lose to any other non binary competitor? Only one head person? Two head people regardless of their gender?

I need answers.
All I know is the title General Secretary has no gender, comrade
Based!
Oh my goodness that's awesome! Great job!!
Omg that's great!!  Good for you 💖💖
Epic. Good luck.
That’s fantastic!! Congratulations!! 😱😱❤️❤️👏🏻👏🏻🏳️‍🌈
Sooooo..... Was ""Badass in Chief"" already taken?
Thank you so much!! My philosophy teacher called me a revolutionary which I think may be the best compliment even lmao
Thank you for the advice!!
I agree, ""Head Student"" sounds less strange. I said ""Head Person"" out loud and it was kind of funny.
Of course, I’ll be sure to update!! Thank you so much for your kind words
Hello! It’s been a while until I could update because COVID held everything back, but we got the election results this week. 

And....

I was elected!!

Me and my good friend were both elected to hold the two non gender exclusive offices as created by my head of sixth form and I couldn’t be more excited!

The fact that the sixth form and teachers elected me just shows that people are getting more progressive and accepting, gives some hope :))
Thank you! I do hope that I can help other people with it <3
Thank you 🥺
Thank you so much <3
That’s so true! Hopefully by making even small changes we can help other people in the future.
I plan to run my election campaign on making the school as progressive as it can possibly be <3
Thank you so much ☺️
Thank you so much 🥺🥺❤️
I hope that all is well for you now! Sending love <3🥺
That’s the system I proposed to my head of sixth form! I think it would work great
The system I proposed to my head of sixth form was two Head Students regardless of gender, but I’ll update it if he makes a different system!
To be fair the title General Secretary is pretty cool
Thank you 🥺🥺
💛🤍💜🖤
Good job my friend I hope your new position treats you well!

Gender Euphoria		"I have no words but thank you for blessing us with these pictures (also that lighting is everything).
These pics are fabulous. Allow me to swoon
Oh wow. Getting Mason Alexander Park vibes, in a very good way.
Wow I swooned fast. 😳
Gender envy o.O
Your making me feel gender envy jeez
Looking good!
omg these are incredibly gender
You look awesome!!!!
These are so awesome nice!!!!
Deeeyummm that last one 🤩 you look amazing!!
Nice photos, I really like the lighting
These are amazing!!
That double exposed picture is something else, well done and congrats!
wow. you look very nice, and those pictures are awesome
love these! looking badass🔥
I love your vibe so much!
The first picture looks like a movie poster. Great!
You look amazing!!

SLAYY!!! you are sooo pretty 🥺🥺 how can one look so gender 🥺🧡
these are so gender 😍
I don’t know how to say this but bro are you single holy hell
you look amazing!
I want to be you :c
! Wow you’re so 🔥🤤
Omg u pwetty! I have similar pants (whatever theyre called in english) and they're da best! ✌️
You're welcome :3 Also those were taken in the context of a test at my school, I really liked that class
Exactly what I was thinking!
I didnt know who they were, looked it up and now I feel honoured to have been compares to them ! :D
Thanks jhfxdrjhrxgfy
Jhfssjgrkhrsrsz thank you
What does that mean?
And I am really happy you think that :D
I had a lot of fun with the lighting, thank you :D
Learnt from one of my classmates, was really cool trying it out :))))
Thank you :))))
I am not but thank you :3
Overalls?
Bisexual lighting 🤨🏳️‍🌈?
um, it's a little hard to define, but I'll try. it's always a compliment as far as I know. it means someone's gender presentation is strong and/or euphoric, especially in a queer, bent, sexual, or gnc way. it's typically used for something that is very masc, very fem, or very androgynous. leather jackets, sharp eyeliner, cute makeup on the cheeks, colorful or well-styled hair, rough edges or soft edges, things that show off secondary sex characteristics (boobs/chests, dicks, facial hair, etc) can be very gender, especially if they conflict with other aspects of the presentation. juxtaposition of traditionally masc and traditionally fem traits is very gender (eg, flowers in a beard, a lowcut tux showing off boobs, a flat chest in lacey lingerie, etc).
Thx!
I love the red and blue lighting and my photos came out so good my whole class asked me to take their pictures with these lighting, most of them used the photos I took for them. I can't explain how much joy that made me feel ! There are some professionals in my class and I got recognised for my work. I made them all take pictures with the bisexual lighting 🏳️‍🌈😎
Thx! Imma start using that phrase!
You can also call them dungarees (British Eng.)

Is mayonnaise a gender?		"If gender is a performance, I believe I need more practice. I'm still unsure as of now.

I've met a few people who are similar to me on [TS Dates](https://datingadvocate.com/ts-dates), and it's reassuring to know that there are still some left who understand you.
No Patrick, mayonnaise is not a gender. Horse radish isn’t either. (Sorry I had to 😂😂)
yes.
gender is a performance, and mine seems to be powered by the 2015 mclaren-honda f1 engine.... hm.
More importantly is it an instrument???
Gender is a performance and I am being booed off stage.
Gender is a performance, and somebody keeps mentioning Macbeth, and I don't know my lines
unironically this
Mayonnaise is the tastiest gender. You're allowed to be mayonnaise. As long as you don't hurt anyone else. Be mayonnaise. Be the best damn mayonnaise ever. You are delicious.
As someone on the autism spectrum I’ve failed it for so long
if gender is a performance i have stage freight
Mayonnaise is a gender but my gender is Miracle Whip
gender is a performance and no one gave me acting lessons
Yes I wanna get 10s across the board!!
Pretty sure my gender is an Ed Wood movie.
gender is a performance and I long to be Rocky Horror
My gender is a 1997 mazda rx7 fd3s 13b rotary
Yes! 👍
That's a shame, I would have gone with horseradish just to make transphobes cry (and feel like their sinuses are on fire).
It's been a while since I've *felt* a comment the way I feel this one.

2015 was also, coincidentally, about when I began reconsidering the thoughts I'd always swept aside about who I was.
Gender is a performance and I remember my lines but my acting is thoroughly unconvincing.
Good luck! Aw shit, I mean break a leg
The one time I will ever shame someone's gender identity
if you’re familiar with the brachistochrone curve, sometimes, after we pass a low point, we find out we have been on the best path the whole time. sometimes, that low point involves a parasocial relationship we’ve formed with a sports entity 💞"	u0luyf	NonBinary	1350	1.0	2022-04-10 17:02:07
Huge gender euphoria: New binder and new undercut - my wife said, she can no longer say for sure what my agab is. ♥️		"You look very peaceful, I’m so glad you’re having a good day ✌️
I can’t tell either 😁 it really suits you btw!
You look incredible, mad gender envy!
congratulations!! just got my new binder as well i know how euphoric it can feel :) waiting on my haircut but yours looks awesome!! 🫶🏼🫶🏼
I can't tell neither but really cool photo and you are looking amazing. It really suits you
As a nonbinary with an undercut, that hairstyle is magic. You looks great! Could not tell your AGAB at all, jealous.
same if I didn't know I wouldn't have guessed
Looking amazing and happy, big hugs!
You look so much like your gender
You look like you're about to cry with happiness; congrats!
You look like a mountain climber bro, like the down to earth kinda person
❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
I love how much happiness there is here
Every time I see agab, my brain goes ""all genders are bastards"".
Looking great! You're radiating with so much happiness it feels contagious!
I totally agree with your wife omg
Thank you! It's 37 degrees Celsius here (99 degrees Fahrenheit), enjoying the summer on the balcony. I hope you're having a good day, too!!
Thank you so much!!
Thank you so much! It's the first time I'm hearing something like this about myself, it's awesome. Thanks!
That's cool, congrats on your new binder as well! What are you planning to do with your hair?
Thank you a lot!!
Thank you a lot! I needed to push myself into that haircut because I grew up being told that looking androgynous is something one should not be happy about. Much thinking and decision making later I so much love the result! So thank you a lot for saying you couldn't tell, it feels great!
Thank you, that's nice to hear!
Thank you - big hugs back to you!
Haha, hey, thank you! Und liebe Grüße ;)
Thank you so much! It's funny that you say that - my wife and I decided yesterday that we want to start working out together and got up early for a training in the park before work and it was arm day today, so most fitting, haha
I’m thinking of doing a short wolf cut or some other shorter and layered hairstyle! i just want fluffy short hair 😮

The fact that so many non-binary people experience gender envy while looking at biblically accurate angels, or vaguely ethereal entities, leads me to the inevitable conclusion that we used to be eldritch beings that now miss their old bodies		"Reminds me of that Gnostic religion (I think Catharism?), where humans are believed to be genderless angels stuck in flesh prisons, amongst other things.
We are the subconcious dreams or memories of eldritch beings. Our lives play out so that they can experience again all that they have forgotten.
Also a side note many indigenous people/tribes etc revered the NB of their people.  Often we were shamans, considered to be more advanced in our spiritual path than our ""cis"" brothers and sisters.  The ""two spirit"" accepting both the masculine and feminine, just so happens in todays society it is hard to wrap the mind around the fact since we are so often considered outsiders.
Oh, yes. I never did feel a connection with humanity, and in fact, I feel a connection to being non-human.
I get that feel when I see Chaos from Hades (video game)
The Christian God was once NB, but Christianity went super patriarchal and edited that out. In Jewish philosophy technically God is both male and female. (Generally referred to as male, but there’s a divine feminine side) Both were seen as sexless, due to their nature of being Gods, but with genders combined and in balance. I figure that explains the androgynous representation of angels. Funny when Christians are being jerks about NB people, cuz y’all would actually be closer to their Gods image than they are.
I'm definitely a cis woman. Like on my earthly form.... I am a witch, and a wife and a femme.... And also my divinity is..... Very very masculine. there is A SUN GOD that lives inside of me and is very much masculine and very much fire and creation and destruction and phallic and shit. But also...

I am a girl 🥰

Is very weird haha.
Yeah probably
Idk about eldritch but maybe old lotr gods
ya i'm just a demon
/r/voidpunk/
Give me the power to shapeshift and you can bet I'll either be a slimegirl or an eldritch entity before you you can say
Haha, yes. You figured it out!
I have a longing for the paradoxical full void that is the universe-- so empty, yet so full of so much
i literally experienced genderenvy over a plant on a cabin i love this confusing life
We nonbinary people want to return to our biblically accurate forms.
Why in the fuck is that actually accurate? Seriously, I may not believe in a god but ... dem angels lookin fineeeeeeee.
Me with Gabriel from Constantine, dream humanoid form
Yes, the inevitable conclusion. The only possible answer
dreams that feel more like memories haunt my consciousness. mortality is a prison, but a weak one. it would be foolish to be ethereal. i am eldritch. i will escape these bonds and haunt the universe once again. and this time- those damned celestials cannot stop me.
Another thing that could explain this is that so many non-binary people also have a angel kintype/theriotype but I do like this idea :)
Seems about right…
Wait, am I going insane? Wasn't this posted yesterday?
yes
this is incredible 😅💖💖
I always think about this but idk if it's a joke at this point or im going crazy ahaha
Real talk tho this is genuinely how i feel sometimes 😔
Yep for me I was obsessed with grim reapers growing up. Biblically accurate angels too
I feel very at-home in this thread!  OP and the comments have just made my day <3
I recently got gender envy from a Sphinx cat in a dress and pigtails. What does that make me?
>so many non-binary people experience gender envy while looking at biblically accurate angels

Transphobic Christians: ***Hol’ up***
I personally always wanted to look like a tall, horned demonic creature with wings
OMG Yes!
This... this actually makes too much sense...
What's a biblically accurate angel
This reminds me of Floaty Space Cat on Instagram and his amazing and adorable trans angels.
ABSOLUTELY
this fits because most eldritch beings are genderless...i like this theory
I have gender envy for Tilda Swinton’s portrayal of Gabriel in Constantine.

Edit: my phone autocorrected “Tilda” to “Tulsa”.
oh i definitely am/was. im nonhuman (this is /srs) like a humanoid vampire/demon/elf kinda appearance but also had more eldritch appearances if i shifted to that
💁 makes sense to me *ascends through the roof*
this is the silliest thing I've read all week
Flesh prison you say? Yup checks out - maybe their is a religion for me after all.
That is my gender.
I'm not sure that it's so much that humans are genderless angels as much as they are composed of both an inherently pure spiritual from either Sophia or the Monad (the personification of wisdom and Big G God, respectively) and an inherently impure material component from the Demiurge/Yaldabaoth who created both humanity and the material world (there might also be a a third psychical component as well, depending on which Gnostic faith we're talking about). The idea being that through Christ (maybe, again depends on which faith) an adherent can aquire sacred knowledge, or Gnosis, that allows them to leave behind their material body and become genderless angels.

Again, this is all dependent on which Gnostic faith we're talking about. There are a lot of them and they're all very different, but some do believe that Jesus was a spiritual hologram and I think that's pretty neat.
Wow I feel sorry for whatever eldritch being is dreaming my life, they’ve got some serious issues to work through /s
like the hawaiian view of gender ! i think it was something like māhu
I believe Native Americans call it Two Spirit.
Me too. I’ve unironically felt like I was born on the wrong planet for most of my life.
same same, i consider myself nonhuman, but im ""just vibing in a human body rn""
AND THAT VOICE
Interestingly, this is similar to the view on gender that I learned from a philosophy professor at a conservative evangelical (very anti-LGBTQ+) seminary. The professor himself had some unorthodox views, as compared to the school itself. 

Anyways, he always said that, while humans were gendered, God was *genderful*, and angels were *genderless*. By “genderful”, he meant that God, or the Godhead/Trinity fully embodies all aspects of all genders. God is full of gender. Humans, as beings created in God’s image, are gendered - aspects of God’s genderfulness as incorporated into each individual. But angels are also created beings, but not created in the image of God, so therefore angels do not have things are essential to the identity of God and human, including gender. Which makes angels to be genderless. 

So, agender representations of angels are entirely theologically accurate (on this view of religion/Christianity). 

Anyways, this is probably not any view of gender/Christianity/whatever that is found outside of this one professor. But I’ll never forget that imagery that he first taught me.
The one quote I wrote down from an asexuality meetup: the woman who said she's ""more certain that I'm female than human.""
definitely cis
Enby Demonic Patrons club.
But really though, this body is confining, I feel like an amorphous being trapped in a static shell. The gender that I am is basically unrealizable in reality, so the best I can do is to seek androgyny and work it out from there.
It was that movie when my crash for Tilda Swinton started, she can have me ❤
I posted this on two different subs :)
Eh, I am right there with you...imagine all the lives they are reliving simultaneously, and no wonder they look a little rough around the edges.
Same
There’s a LOT of Native American tribes that hold a similar view, I’ll have to look at the Hawaiian version.
That’s in my comment, but yes.
me but im autistic LOL
That’s interesting, thank you
Whoa. That’s kind of blowing my mind on a few levels. Like, I am born cis female and also closeted NB…I simultaneously understand what that means so deeply and yet also could never imagine wanting to identify as female so strongly. Hmm.
I know. I just really appreciated this post about divinity that's all etc
So am I :).

Excuse me while I writhe in gender envy		"link is nonbinary icon
Link had been the source of my gender envy since I first played Twilight Princess in 2006 but BOTW Link took it to a whole ‘nother level.
Same, hot damn!
Yeah I saw this on a trans discord I'm on... really wish I could be that cute ;_;
The gender envy in me fighting with the distaste as what I interpret Zelda's eyes as telling me. Hm. Is this just envy and me being upset I'm not built like this, or is it anger? Argh
LinkLinkLinkLinkLinkLinkLink
The artist is fugtrup, btw. Just be aware that most of their art is *much* more nsfw.
I love Link, but Sheik truly was my OG gender bending icon as a kid. That reveal blew my wee NB brain.
Link got them tiny lips damn
I remember when the ""gender-swapped"" link in BOTW first came up. I had already passed that part of the game and given it no thought- I personally mix gendered clothes in my real life- and was surprised when people got hung up on that.   


Maybe in BOTW 2 they will expand on the Enby aura around link since then.
Introducing the new Nintendo Bottom™️
And they call themselves Zelda and everything finally makes sense!
YEEEEES!!!! My thoughts exactly the first time I saw it. Link was literally the hottest person in all of Gerudo Town. Flat chest with a crop top is just *chef's kiss*. So jelly. 🖤🔥👏🏻
Ikr? The old adage that ‘link gives everyone gender envy’ is so true!
Gender envy? For which one?

For me, it's ***YES***
r/linkiscute
I hate Nintendo purely just because this makes me feel like I have accomplished nothing in my transition
Every boys nightmare. I swear I thought I was the only one who thought girls were disgusting
BRING IT TO ME
Wait what?! That’s Link now?!
Wasn't Link originally not meant to have a canon gender so that more than boys playing the game could connect better with the character? But most people just assumed Link was a boy because videogames were ""just for boys"" when the Legend of Zelda first came out? I feel like I remember reading something about that somewhere at some point.
My six year old asked me, while we were playing BOTW together, what Link's pronouns are. I told him most people he/him Link, but there are actually a lot of folks in the community who think Link may be NB.

Cut to my six year old now using she/they for Link. 💜
Link is Link's own gender
G O A L S
I think the look she's supposed to give off there is ""smoldering"". But I'm also autistic so that could be completely wrong.
Zelda/Sheik is my og gender envy too!!!!
*covertly subs* 👀
Link has had so many different reincarnations, I would not be surprised if all possible identities are represented across the eons.

""No sweetie, you can't be the reincarnation of the Hero of Hyrule, you're a girl."" ""HYAH! \*smashes pot\*"" ""...omg you are.""
Omg! That fits pretty well, my headcannon is that pink uses any/all pronouns
Link’s pronouns are Hup!/Hyah!
I'm confused what you're trying to say :D what would a smoldering look mean?

Because to me her eyes are as close to hugging him and telling him he's cute as they are to laughing at him. I don't like that. But that might be projecting
Love it! 
*high five*
To me it looks like she thinks link looks hot
That's good then :3"	10ifka4	NonBinary	1339	1.0	2023-01-22 09:15:34

Reposting this here bc it’s super relatable		"I was really blissfully unaware.

I was actually programmed into not questioning my gender by society. No one told me anything, so I just rolled with it. Born male? I'm male then, I didn't even pay attention, nor I thought I should, because people in here are anti-LGBTQ+ in a way. I still never imagine myself being called with pronouns other than he/him. I started to question when something about having long hair made me feel nice, something changed... demiboy, I'm thinking right now.

Just now that I'm finding out stuff, I'm starting to think about it, however I fear that I might be wrong and as a result misrepresent the LGBTQ+ community, and I still feel bad for having been a bigot in the past. I feel like it was yesterday.

Yet, when going around on the posts, I found someone mentioning that they got asked whether they felt like a boy or a girl, and they replied ""I'm just me"". The fact that I recall answering myself that question when thinking about it, a month ago, made me feel like I was right. But alas, I'm always insecure, so I keep doubting.

I didn't know where to post this, so here it stays.
I relate to this so much
 This is me to a T. Didn’t realize you were suppose to feel some sort of connection to a gender until a friend came out as trans and explained it to me.
Too relatable. Which is why it's so hard to get trans health care, these people trying to understand me in a binary trans way with binary trans experiences... It's not me, sorry to disappoint.
This was literally me until I started puberty. Didn’t care about my gender or anyone else’s, then suddenly I hated my body. Lol
yeah, that

Like what do you mean people have social associations with different body parts?! How in the fuck does that make sense?
As someone whose only realizing I might be NB after coming out as bi  a few months ago as 30.  I never really realized because I was a late diagnosed ADHDer as developed a extreme fear of being perceived as ""weird"" so I subconsciously hid away a lot of thoughts an ideas that were ""weird"" or different when I was still fairly young.
Yep.
yeah that makes sense to me. hell, i thought there was something wrong with me for the longest time after it happened because i didn’t feel right in my agab, i wanted these puberty changes to not happen, didn’t want to reproduce like people insisted i would. my parents filtered everything i watched and banned me from queer representation in media. here i am, moved out of their house, ace panromantic and enby. time really changes things
Yes
Damnnnn
Yup and I hate it
When I was 10 I thought that trans people are stupid because if that's the definition of trans then I'd be trans as well. Bc everyone would feel happy as a boy. And how are you supposed to 'feel like a girl's anyways? No one does that
Wow, that uh, sums it up a lot better than I’ve ever been able to.
I felt this so much. Didn't care much about gender until I grew boobs at age 9.... then the world forced me to care and hasn't stopped.
I had no concept of dysphoria until I had to start HRT and had to deal with bizarreness and changes because my body was failing to do so sufficiently. I have suspicion about being some of intersex person, but I don’t feeling like dropping several grand on testing. Especially when I am just happy to have my life back with the improvements in getting closer to where I was before the health issues caused by (lacking) hormones causing issues.
my autie ass: you feel *WHAT* now?

genuinely tho, took me a while to realise what i felt, mostly because for the most part what i feel can only be described as ""something"" or ""unclear""
Finally, someone put it into words.
i especially feel this bc i grew up in a fundie family, and i was *completely* unaware of Gender Being A Thing until all of a sudden, i couldn't do the fun stuff anymore and i had to stay away from boys and i had to wear the right clothes and sit the right way and keep quiet and smile and if i did that wrong i was a horrible little heathen child who was going to cause men to stumble just because i was existing in a body that was going to grow boobs. ¯\\\_(ツ)_/¯
In a way I was blissfully unaware, but I was really just so deep into the thought of being a girl that I never thought to question myself. Quite honestly, I hated myself and how I looked but sometimes I felt pretty- I had the stereotypical anti-feminine phase but sometimes I could be hyper-feminine and was.. okay with that. Looking back, I never actually liked how I looked, dressed, etc. I liked that *other people* liked how I looked. And then the kid I was dating came out as gender fluid. ..then my best friend came out as non binary. I had an unexplainable urge to cut off my long hair, even though I loved it. Once that emotional attachment was gone, everything went downhill from there (jkjk it sucked but it was uphill cause now I feel comfortable with myself :))
I don’t know why im putting this here lol but I saw some others’ stories and never really got to tell mine.
It makes sense now why I was such a big “trans ally”
Throwback to kindergarten me, who always wrote their name in the boy’s column  by accident, because it never dawned on me that boys and girls’ names had to be separated… I’m still confused why they had to separate us like that🤔
If it helps allot of queer people that are brought up in bigoted homes and/or investments are bigots at first and then become super allys and then realize there own queerness...

It's called Internelized Homophbia and Internelized transphobia...

My gender is female but I kinda wish I was NB so my gender could be wallet & a pack of oreos.
Okay but there's nothing in my pants sooo.... no gender
What's in your pants is your biological sex, not your gender identity. Never let uneducated people bring you down!
My gender is a left hand.
My gender is THE VOID
My gender is no pockets :/
My gender is still nothing because my stupid pants don't have stupid pockets because I have wide frickin hips! XD

Ok also because wearing pants is really hard when you've got a bad hip. But that's sufficiently less funny then making fun of female body-oriented pants.
Yes, pocket lint squad unite
My gender is two used handkerchiefs.
My gender is wireless earbuds.
imagine wearing pants
My gender was a dollar bill but it's gone so I'm literally genderless now .-.
My gender is a phone and a penknife.
My gender is a tissue, fluff and dust
my gender is nothing :O
guys my gender is l e g s
Samsung Galaxy Note9 y'all
Tissues, face mask, pencil ald wallet! Yaaaaay I'm walking chaos
If thats the case, then I’d still have no gender since nothing is in my pockets!
According to this my gender is an iPhone 11, which means I’m attracted to anyone who invests an absurd amount of money into me.

Jk I don’t have a phone.
Currently have no pockets, so I can say with 100 percent certainty that my gender is 100% legs
Hah turns out my gender is a tiny trex with a robot arm
My gender is a bleach stain.
If gender is what's in my pants then I'm pee
My gender is a small sketch book, a pencil, a sharpie and a piece of popcorn
My gender is my phone, a trans bracelet that fell off, a pen cap, and a bitten eraser!
I have earbuds and a face mask...
Ah, yes, the mythical gender: legs
My gender is a lollipop stick
Nothing in my pants but my body. My gender is me and that’s how I like it.
There’s nothing in my pockets.

So I was right, my gender is nonexistent after all
EVERYONE! my gender is 4 highlighters, a blue-colored pencil, 3 acorns, and a cookie
Not to be edgy, but since there is a spot of blood on my pants I guess that makes my gender blood.

To be correctly: O positive blood
Fantastic news - I’ve just discovered my gender is chapstick!  That or legs...not quite sure
You’re wearing pants????
EMPTY! My gender is empty! Seriously that feels fucking great to say.
But isn't it only ""gay"" if you're attracted to someone with the same gender?
my gender is Carmex lip balm, my Adderall i didn’t take and my dab pen
My gender is earbuds and a water bottle
My gender is ""nothing"" ? Hmm surprisingly accurate.
my gender is keys
This is homophobia clear as day.. If you're a woman and like men, that's not gay attraction. That is literally, by definition, heterosexual.
If you're agender, wouldn't that technically make every attraction you have straight? 🤔
My gender is sand
My gender is 29 candy wrappings
My gender is an Android, apparently. 😀 and I thought I am non-binary woman. Well, life is a learning experience 🤭
Mine gender is: a pocket watch, Carmex, fidget, and a mask
Edit: spelling
My gender is some lint, a sock, and a staple. What does this mean for me? Gender is so confusing.
My gender is my phone and 5 acorn tops lol

Congrats ur agender
Your pronouns are a-tchoo and gesundheit.
Or maybe...gender flu-id?
Ain’t nothing stopping you from becoming NB, no one else’s in charge of that
You can be both
in that case my biological sex is 2 dollars and earbuds
Is it attached to anybody in particular, or is it more pf a good luck charm?
Same here!
Damn your gender flexin
Genderbroke?
I think they’re using ‘gay’ to mean anything other than straight, because other words can offend or trigger people easily
Which tbh doesn't cahnge anything i still have no gender lol

Oooh! Please reveal mine! I got post-it notes with stick figure drawings, a piece of toilet paper (it had a cool print on it!), a paperclip, and a pretty leaf that didn't quite make the journey.
yayyy thats perfect lol
Can you reveal mine? I have an unused tissue, a cough drop someone gave me one time that I never used cause I don't like cough drops, a bad drawing I made in class, some origami tiny things, and a tiny bird I made out of clay.
Fair but I think I'm pretty happy as a binary tran. Just means my gender identity is more boring :P

I was bracing myself for *hoarder*, so I appreciate all of these.
Actually identified as genderfluid for a while when I figured out ""male"" didn't fit. But then I figured out part of that still wasn't working... And it was the ""man"" part of genderfluid. So that left me with a pretty clear outcome :P

You're allowed to self determine ;) But I appreciate the capacity to see beauty in a all the little things. I think it's a positive trait that brings joy and colour to your life :)

When someone starts asking about my gender, I just point to the shirt		"As an enby jazz enthusiast I love this
You pull off an androgynous vibe so naturally and I love it
I love it, that’s gonna be my new standard response when someone gives me grief. Also I love this whole outfit you’ve put together! The maroon goes so well with your pink hair, it’s all cute as heck ✨
Me in response: “Nice to meet you, Jazz!”

"I will always be ""No thanks"" for my gender. It's an excellent response to assumed gender binary."		"Ah yes the 3 genders.
Male and female aren’t genders? It should say “man” or “woman”.  Or just say “sex”

You’re saying “no thanks” to the presumed gender expressions and stereotypes that society expects of you, not to biological sex.
Omg mood
I Decided To Check The Comments Of The Original Post, And Surprisingly Many Were Quite Nice... And While Reading Them I Thought Of This: ""What's Your Gender?"" [Obi-Wan Kenobi Saying ""Oh No, I'm Not Brave Enough For Genders.""]
It’s annoying how many forms just don’t give you an alternative answer. I feel irritated every time I have to select “female”
I like this. ""prefer not to say"" while trying to be inclusive makes it seem like you have a problem. This is perfect, just no thanks to any mention of gender.
True, but every gender form I've ever seen listed the genders as ""male"" and ""female"" (often no ""other"" either 🤬)
My school listed genders as 
Male
Female
Transgender
Non-binary 

There is certainly plenty of misinformation flying around
Even the ones that do have “other” feel crappy. Talk about being very literally othered.
That's true, but it is better than nothing ... the best would be to leave an empty space to write your gender tho ofc
~~The Best Would Be To Just Not Ask For Your Gender.~~
Of course - I think they ask for statistical purposes, but the university I applied to didn't even ask for my ethnicity.... it literally just ask for my gender (and had 2 options) yo I was pressed
That Sounds... Rather Annoying, If I Do Say So. Honestly I'd Probably Rather Share My Ethnicity Then My Gender, Especially If It's To Folks I Don't Already Know.
Tbh same, idk how i'd feel replying ""gender? 😅 ah am agender"" to a complete stranger asking for my gender yo nah I'm not even fully out to my irls 😅
Yeah, Usually When People Ask Me What My Gender Is On The Internet I'll Either Just Say It Doesn't Matter, I'd Rather Not Tell Them, Or Just Try To Deflect And Change The Subject.
That's definitely a mood 🤘"	iqqk1u	NonBinary	1294	1.0	2020-09-11 13:33:33
I'm sick of people narrowing down non-binary people to their agab	"Something I often see on different LGBT subreddits is people continuously separating non-binary people into 2 categories: amab and afab.

I'm sick of it, [here's an example of it happening](https://www.reddit.com/r/lgbt/comments/122benp/am_i_still_considered_a_lesbian_if_im_attracted/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=android_app&utm_name=androidcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button), the whole point of being non-binary is to go outside of the binary, no?

I just don't see why agab should be relevant much, by mentioning it, it feels like erasing the non-binary gender identity and turning it into: male lite and female lite.

I'm transfem so I don't understand the entire issue completely but I wanna hear your thoughts on this, I apologize if this has been posted here multiple times in the past."	"Agreed. That's why I rarely mention my agab, it's absolutely invalidating when people make a big show of ""thats my nonbinary friend they're amab ^_^"" and it's like no pls stop, and it doesn't matter in 99% of conversations on here and irl.
I use my AGAB when I'm referring to experiences, usually social or medical, that were influenced by it.
I'm not huge on using afab/amab to describe myself and only will if I absolutely have to. I feel what I was assigned at birth is absolutely nobody's business because it tells you nothing about my gender, how you should refer to me/treat me today, etc. 

People use it all the time incorrectly as well. People all the time will ask questions ""for afab people"" about things like periods, when in reality that is not something that all afab people experience for so many reasons and many people on estrogen experience period-like symptoms as well.  

I'm all for not giving people information on what you were assigned at birth unless you absolutely have to. It's not something that genuinely adds to a post most times imo.
What really bugs me about how some even well meaning allies use AGAB acronyms is the fact that the whole point of AGAB acronyms is to show the concept that one's sex assigned at birth is not something that one inherently ""is"", but rather something that, in the case of intersex people, the community where these acronyms were first coined, the AGAB is something that is **done** to them non consensually by a doctor, not something they inherently **are** biologically. Using these acronyms in the way a lot of people do now, as a biologically essentialist thing, compltely erases the orginial purpose they had in the intersex community.

It's ridiculous how even well meaning allies might say stuff like ""AMAB genitals"" when referring to penises. It's like the fact that SRS exists just completely slips from their mind. Another example is something like when people think they are being all ""biologically scientific"" when they say stuff like ""People with AMAB bodies have a higher tolerance to alcohol than people with AFAB bodies,"" forgetting that sexually dimporphic response to alcohol is entirely due to sex hormone differences that can be changed with HRT causing different levels of alcohol dehydrogenase in the stomach, and not due to one's AGAB.

In the context of the link you provided, it's likely that the person who said that has this mental image of an ""AFAB non binary person"" as being someone who presents androgynously but ""looks more like a woman"" in their eyes due to having estrogen induced secondary sex characteristics.

They don't realize that an AFAB nb person can also be someone who is masc presenting and on T, and may be read as a cis man by this person, obvivious that this is an afab nb person. Conversely, an AMAB nb person who presents androgynous and has estrogen induced secondary sex characteristics from being on E may be read as an ""AFAB non binary person"" by this person because they fit that mental image that person has of what they find attractive in ""AFAB nb people"", not realizing that this person is actually an AMAB nb person.

Cis people are taught by society that biological sex is a boundary that cannot be crossed, and sometimes cannot process the fact that many aspects of biological sex can be changed with medical technology, and that AGAB is not this unbreakable biological boundary like it's made out to be.

Even without medical transition, people don't realize how much gender presentation alone divorces the relationship between AGAB and their image of someone who ""looks more like a woman"" or ""looks more like a man"" when they make essentialist statements about AGAB. Like, if this person who is into AFAB nb people was to see someone like F1NN5TER (a cis man streamer who cross dresses and looks very ""AFAB"" even when not cross dressing), they would probably be like ""Ooooh look at this cute AFAB non binary person!""
Seriously. I responded to that in good faith but holy shit. I don’t think they understand that an AFAB non binary person could have any presentation/gender. They act like all AFAB non binary ppl are “women lite” it’s very frustrating.
I rarely post on non-binary communities anymore. Not sure if it’s because I’m older Gen X/Millennial Cusper but I just find it all exhausting and moronically ironic that we literally call ourselves non-binary and yet seem to be the most sensitive and up-tightly sensitive labelist cohort of humans and found myself more isolated and alone for the ordeal. So yes to answer your question, AGAB is a bunch of bullshit that completely misses the point.
I went through a phase recently where this tendency really got to me. I tried for a while to avoid saying anything that might reveal my AGAB. 

The problem with that is that I value discussions about medical transition, and that's the one context where talking about assigned gender is unavoidable. So I've relented. 

Still drives me crazy though. I am not my AGAB. And neither are enbies with the opposite assigned gender.
It's so rampant even when it's not relevant. Like, I just a post today that was like ""AFAB folks who've had a hysterectomy..."" Why did you need to specify? Who else would have gotten a hysterectomy? Stop putting us in boxes.
Asking someone’s agab is just the new “nice” way of asking what’s in their pants
Reposting this list of ways ppl use the term “AFAB.” First two apply to “AMAB” as well

1. A one-to-one replacement for “female” that completely misses the point in terms of trans inclusion
(see: AFAB healthcare, AFAB bodies)

2. A reductive, invasive, and often unwanted label to categorize trans people 
(see: but are you AFAB nonbinary or AMAB nonbinary?)

3. A label that is chosen, but only to indicate that someone is the “good” and “safe” kind of nonbinary (hello, transmisogyny)
(see: AFAB seeking AFAB)

With that said, I’d prefer my doctor to say “You were assigned female at birth, right” than “Are you biologically female” because I believe the first one has more respect for gender AND sex as things that can change and as things that, when assigned at birth, don’t define your identity forever.
Yeah, I've seen this come up on tumblr a lot recently and it just pisses me off. Stop asking people what their agab is, you're just once again being bioessentialist and asking about genitals. That's all it ever is and it's to separate people into having the Good Gender's Genitals and the Bad Gender's Genitals.
It’s not just other subs. I see posts here all the time where people mention their AGAB. Frequently, but not always, next to the words “for context” but the “context” is almost never needed. Sometimes it is relevant to mention, and this sub should be a place where you can mention it when that context is relevant. But people mention it waaaaaaaaaay too much and I get dysphoric everytime someone drops their AGAB “for context” when the context just isn’t needed to understand their post. Especially when the common element amongst NonBinary folk and the over riding context of communication in this sub is that WE ARE NOT OUR AGAB.
Yeah i see that a lot too, it's really annoying.

Especially for intersex people i would assume, where that doesn't even say much in the first place.
Yeah most of the time I don't understand why people have to specify their gender when it's not relevant to the topic, and it makes even less sense to tell your agab out of context. I don't try to hide my sex or gender but I don't go around telling it to people when it literally adds nothing to the conversation
My hot take is that this insistence within the LGBTQIA+ community on separating AFAB and AMAB nbs is the birth of Terfism 2.0
**laughs in transneutral and and how many times i’ve explained to people that yes, that’s a label.**

they’re also shocked i’m transitioning medically as a nonbinary person with mixed bottom surgery/i’m on all testosterone+estrogen+progesterone
This right here. I’ve never felt comfortable being gendered. I’ve only felt compelled to compromise because I lacked the ability to express myself. Mostly because I’m just a big ???
Fr. I feel like AGAB should rarely be brought up and if it is it should be brought up by the trans person talking about themselves. It is useful in some situations but in most it’s just degrading.
I def think that bringing it up where it isn’t necessary to discuss is problematic. I only really see it as helpful when explaining things that have to do with ones AGAB (for example, binding, types of hrt, things that vary depending on AGAB). Using it as an additional label outside these contexts does totally defeat the purpose of being nonbinary and adds gentials essentially into a discussion where they don’t belong and we’ve been trying to take them out of for a while to view gender more holistically
The thing that makes me most annoyed is if someone uses the claim ""afabs experience x and amabs experience y"" in their arguments. Because usually, that format is describing some privilege that one AGAB got and another didn't. It reduces the conversation to genitals, denies individual experiences that don't fit, and feels like an excuse to misgender people. I hate AFAB being applied to me by other people in a context to say I have important things in common with cis women that I somehow can't have in common with any trans women or transfem enbies. It's okay to say because I'm transmasc maybe I understand something women experience, but not ""you're AFAB so you must get it"" because I transitioned as a teenager and usually, I don't get it. And if I did, it would be as a nonbinary man with empathy for someone else's problems. The way some people use AMAB/AFAB sort of claims that I know more about womanhood than a trans woman actually living as a woman, and I never claimed to know anything about womanhood.
Agreed. My AGAB is irrelevant unless I bring it up, I am nonbinary.
If i dont say my agab a lot of people will not consider what i have to say worth listening to. I couldnt possibly know anything about womens rights issues without proving that i used to be woman. Idk it sucks but i actually (unattached to my socials or whatever) tell different people that i hve different agabs that way no one knows the truth lol. Ofc im honest with my friends but so many people just never find out what i was born as and thats how it should be. The only people who should know whats in my pants are me and my bf.
The problem in that link isn't with the category, it's playing gatekeeping games about whether loving a trans person is consistent with such and such sexual identity. 

Personally -- as much as I want to be a post-gender bog goblin -- my history and life is constructed and politicized for me whether I want it or not. So it's necessary to talk about things like HRT experience and transmisogyny with other people who have similar experiences.
At this point its like they’re saying “the girl nonbinary or the boy nonbinary” and its so frustrating
Yep. Don’t like it when my agab is even brought up, it only seems relevant if someone is trying to pigeonhole me back into a binary gender.
Agreed. Granted, I do lean closer to my AGAB than to manhood, but that doesn't make me a woman. Yes, I am biologically female, but please, for the love of garlic bread (my new favorite phrase), I am not a woman! (usually)

And regarding the linked post, that's not lesbian. How can you be attracted solely to AFAB non-binary people, when AFAB non-binary present in wildly different ways? Some look androgynous, some look feminine, some could, for all intents and purposes, completely pass as a man.
I fucking HATE this. Ppl also talk a lot about ‘AMAB’ nb people and the ways they experience being nb and I’m literally over here like… okay I’m AFAB/intersex and nb but that’s how I experience it too since I’m transitioning and read as a cis (sometimes GNC) man 99% of the time. Why are we still categorising based on AGAB? Why not just say, like, male-passing nb people? Or masc nb people? Same with people who talk about ‘AFAB’ nb people as if we’re hysterical women. Sometimes even ‘nb-supportive’ LGBT people. Lichrally just transphobia and misogyny.
I have also seen people dividing NB people by their birth sex in order to treat them pretty much as “basically female” or “basically male”. I think people often fail to realise, maybe based on their limited experience with NB people, that not all NB people look like their birth sex just with different pronouns or whatever, and even within all AFAB non binary people there’s gonna be a huge range of gender identity and expression. I don’t think you can really say you’re “attracted to AFAB non binary people” when there’s so much variation within them that it doesn’t really mean anything except that you reduce NB people to their AGAB.
we feel the same, honestly have more in common with an ""amab"" nb than others. gender is such a stupid thing and the binaries people try to put forward really don't exist. there's maleness, femaleness, nbness, any amount of things in me and everyone and i'm not an opposite to someone else either because of my agab or my identity.
I personally don’t mind when people tell me they “thought I was amab” because it just means I look neutral enough for people to get confused, but other than that I ignore the whole gender thing entirely and would prefer if others did the same.
I really hate when people bring up agab of others. It's fine to use it for yourself in certain contexts but don't label others based on your assumptions, especially in a non binary subreddit.
Agreed. It feels like just another way to phrase the question ""but what are you REALLY??"" AGAB is waaaay less relevant to most discussions than people are comfortable admitting.
Yeah it's always super inappropriate and invalidating to refer to any trans persons AGAB. Only refer to them as the gender they're currently presenting as and do not inquire them or bring up their AGAB. If people want to refer to their own AGAB that's up to them, not to anyone else.
Nonbinary and trans people should not be referring to each other/referred to in general as their assigned gender at birth, at least in my opinion. Almost seems like outing them in some instances. The only time I refer to anyone's agab, it's mine, and only if 1) it's specifically necessary to the conversation and 2) it's around people who know my agab already. It's kind of an ""I can say it about myself but you shouldn't say it about me"" type thing imo
i try to never mention it, even in irl, unless its absolutely necessary, and 9 times out of 10, it isnt. on the internet i can just *be nonbinary,* and irl, i just kinda try to forget about my agab
Idk but yall but im anbab
Yeah me and one of my friends have talked about how amab and afab pretty much just reproduces the binary. It makes more sense to just be like I’m transfem and non-binary rather than using the agab binary. Even now I’m finding that my feelings around my gender identity are changing more as I’ve gotten on hrt and I’m starting to identify more with genderqueer and gender-fluid.
I agree with you that people shouldn't make that big a deal of it, it does make nonbinary a little less nonbinary. For me personally the amab afab thing is more medical, like it doesn't have an impact on me unless its medical , it describes my sex.
It's so tiring tbh. I mean yeah, It's useful in some aspects, but sometimes it tends to fall in the ""Are you a BOY non-binary, or a GIRL non-binary?""category. And people do it so much, that it feels tiring.
> I just don't see why agab should be relevant much, by mentioning it, it feels like erasing the non-binary gender identity and turning it into: male lite and female lite.

Only online do I have a choice not to mention it. In real life, everyone can tell what my AGAB was. I was socialized as that gender for several decades, and am still basically always seen that way in public despite my presentation going hard the other direction. My agab definitely has effected my path through the queer community since I first identified as a lesbian and identify with the history of nonbinary identities in that community, and still relate to the concept of butch as a gender. I am sure it would have been a very different experience if I identified as a straight male first. Plus for some people physical body parts are important to attraction such as the post you linked. I’m not going to shame people for whom my physical sex characteristics matter, even if they don’t match my internal gender identity. Other times it’s useful to separate to talk about the experience of transitioning away from a certain gender; the things I do to look more androgynous in general will be opposite to what an AMAB person would do.

None of these things are about my gender identity. I definitely don’t see myself as male or women lite, my identity is fully nonbinary. But my body, my history, my socialization, the way my transition is viewed, my physical safety - all these things ARE effected. Identity is only one facet of the way we experience gender and I’m not going to pretend that it is. 

I guess to give an example, trans women are women, but sometimes it is useful for them to mention they are trans or speak to transfems specifically because they are addressing something specific to that experience. I think with being nonbinary this can be even more extreme because you can’t ever really pass as nonbinary so the way you are seen can be even more important.
Personally, I see it as helpful to other people to get a better idea of my experiences, as life can be very different for enbies depending on how they were perceived at a young age, and the expectations they grew up having put upon them.
Exactly! I think some people have a hard time describing their attraction to enbies in a way that’s affirming. And as a commenter on your linked post said, that just means they’re not ready to date nonbinary folks. I have also struggled with this in the past, I have *absolutely* hurt nonbinary friends of mine, but there is just a limit to what’s acceptable. If there is a limit to the amount of masculine presentation that you find attractive *then just say that*! AGAB has *nothing* to do with attraction, not even for folks who like to cluck about “genital preference”. Enbies can get bottom surgery too, and I know several who will and have!
When someone makes a point of specifying their/someone else's agab it just feels like the binary with extra steps
I agree entirely.
It’s just gender essentialism with extra steps.
The only place my AGAB could even be remotely relevant is in the doctors office. And even then not every medical professional needs to know it(looking at you dentists)
but, and just hear me out on this, what if i need to make a bunch of assumptions about someone but i can't tell what their genitals looked like when they were born? what then? /s
God this is like my biggest pet peeve in the queer community.

For real, i hear cis people all the time talking about their trans kids and they ALWAYS seem to have to clarify ""they were born as X but they decided they wanted to be y"", like it matters so much to the conversation. 

Even some queer people seem to do this but are more subtle with it, like I've heard my roommate say stuff like ""my friend she's trans MTF"", which is just so redundant. I know they're trans, you don't have to go stating where they started. 

It just feels like such a violation of someones privacy when people state it.

If you're looking for a way to explain it to cis people easily: ""AMAB/AFAB is something someone can be, it is NOT something you use to group people by."" - I came up with that one when my cis queer roommate said ""I've mostly dated AMAB people""
I strongly prefer that people do not know my agab. It's not relevant and it makes me super dysphoric - it's literally no one's business but mine, my partner's, and my doctor's.
It is, to put it mildly, a bit cringe.
 our biological sex is going to influence how others perceive our genders or how we go through the world. a nonbinary person born male isn't going to have the same experiences as one born female. I don't inherently see what's bad about pointing out the difference in very specific conversations, but yeah I agree that is how it's viewed as and i dislike it alot. Similarly I'll often see it used as diet trans woman/diet trans man which I'm not a fan of either.

 Since you mentioned being transfem it brings back to what I was saying how we're often grouped as diet binary trans. transfem is used to refer to both trans women as well as male sexed nonbinary people who either have a more feminine expression or transitioning in a similar fashion to trans woman. vice versa with transmasc and female sexed nonbinary folks. the issue I've often come across is the assumption that every male enby by default is transfem or every female enby is transmasc. it still unnecessarily forces us into a binary based on our bio sex.

 controversial opinion time!! I don't believe the terms transfem/transmasc should inherently be linked to birth sex. those terms should be self descriptive to the individual, not prescribed by others.
Separating it can allow people to share their experiences of things like hormones and surgeries with a certain genitalia with people who also could have the same results. It's like splitting ftm and mtf they both are trans but have different types of transitions. Nonbinary people can transition. And having a place to share their transition of their agab to the person they want to be. Not every nb person transitions, or transitions the same. But it's nice to see what people have decided and some can even do the same. They could find a surgery for a part of a agab body that isn't commonly put out there or is buried in a sea of things they don't relate to. Some nb people (like myself) join ftm or mtf subreddits to see people with the same body as them and see how different things in transition or with being trans happens to people with a certain genitali.
I maintain that your AGAB is better you and your doctor. Anyone else in your life you tell is optional, or I guess if anyone you knew pre coming out is still in your life.
It’s pretty exhausting when cis people just see you as your AGAB. It’s so refreshing and such a relief to be around non-cis people.
agreed, i usually only mention my agab when it’s in regards to my experience with medical issues (how my body functions) and/or social responses that i still have as a result of being raised my birth gender.
There Definitely Are Contexts Where It Can Be Relevant Information, For Example (Sometimes) When Someone Is Talking About Their Own Transition Or Experience. If I'm Talking About How I Felt Growing Up For Example It Could Be Useful To Know I'm AMAB. That Said I'll Definitely Agree It's Somewhat Overused Too. (Based Solely On The Title Of The Post You Linked I'm Skeptical Of It As A Whole, Although I Suppose Ignoring That I Would Agree It's Not A Good Use Of The Term.)
Yeah I only ever mention my agab if its necessary, which is rarely. Sometimes its obvious bc of context (posts/comments about my own experiences and body for example) but I almost never explicitly say whats going on the pants.

Just know that according to buzzfeed, I'm 8"" 😤 /lh
As someone who is (just literally now) realizing that they're absolutely not cis, I'm also sick of people trying to figure out what they think nonbinary/gender nonconforming people actually are. I personally find myself completely separate from my agab. Yes, I still have the plumbing I came with but I really hate it when people look at me only through the eyes of something I've had no control over -- when they place restrictions and expectations on me based on who they  see. 

I'm not even mad at people asking for my help because I'm amab -- I've had a lot of practice. I'd gladfully walk someone home at night or tell some random man to get lost. Male privilege is absolutely real -- and although I'm always glad to make others happy, I feel moderate  dysphoria being called a ""man"" (or acting as the ""man""). This ""male lite"" is exactly how I have been categorized (even by myself) and it's never fit right. 

I know it's oversimplifying, but I felt like gender was a spectrum -- from m to f -- and everyone was somewhere on that line. I now realize that honestly, I feel so disconnected from the idea of gender entirely. I am just a brain wandering around earth; which bathroom do brains use? Am I a gender? Am I agender? I'm just me -- what is so hard for people to grasp?

\[all rhetorical questions\]
We need to get rid AMAB and AFAB because people are incapable of being normal about it
This reminds me of something that happened at the beginning of the school year. I'm a high school teacher, and I had just played Deltarune at the end of the summer. I fell in love with the game, so I had a wallpaper of Kris as my desktop background, which showed on the smart board before class started. One of my students walked in, and the first thing out of their mouth was, ""is that a boy or a girl?"" I'm afraid to use terms like ""nonbinary"" at work because I live in a super conservative state, so I said something like, ""they're not a boy or a girl."" The student asked again. I don’t understand why people insist on putting even fictional characters in a gender box the second they see them. Kris's gender wasn't relevant *at all* in that moment. It was just a cool image of them.
Tbh I just don’t tell people my AGAB. It’s like a fun little puzzle for them to figure it out themselves
So fucking true, I've been thinking about this for ages!
I mean, all those people talking about afab NB ukuleleplayers are just calling them women, that's it. Whenever some mentions an NB's agab like it's relevant, that's just indirect misgendering.
I use ""afab"" when referring to the social/medical specifics of being Nb, there is a major difference there (surgery, perceptions, etc). But otherwise I'm just ""enby"".
I mean with regards to the post you referenced, it's clear the person is really just referring to nonbinary people with vaginas. They are asking a valid question but I think their wording was maybe a little off.

They could probably just say ""am I still a lesbian if I'm attracted to nonbinary people with vaginas"" instead. Maybe they just want to avoid the vulgarity/admitting that their issue ultimately comes down to genitals.

I find in a lot of situations like this, people are only referring to your AGAB as a shorthand for referring to what genitals you have. Like I have been asked if I would be gay if I dated a cis gay man because I'm AMAB (have a penis), or if a cis straight men is attracted to me does that make him gay because I'm AMAB (have a penis). I don't see it as much as being put into categories as people trying to talk about genitals in a ""polite"" way.
In general, I think it's only relevant when it comes to how the world perceives you or for medical reasons. As much as I would like to be this middle ground that confuses everyone, I present very female (albeit a ""tomboy female""), and I understand sometimes it affects people's perspective of me. 

I understand both sides of the example you give - the poster and your own. The problem I have within the example you gave is that they're being general; they're discussing any ""AFAB NB"" people, not a specific one, which.. to me... seems like they don't fully accept someone's NB identity.
Right that's exactly what people are doing with AGABs.

Transfem/transmasc or AFAB/AMAB are useful terms in relation to talking about transitioning and personal experiences but ya no one but the individual person should be referring to their AGAB.

Especially because a lot of the time people are guessing at which one someone is and doesnt take into account that nb ppl transition.
Same kind of deal at my uni. They were grouping women and non binary together in like book sessions or pool sessions, as if they just see non binary as woman lite™️ (someone in the lgbt society put it that way and they weren’t wrong). They’ve now changed the pool session to have a totally separate one for trans and non binary people after people complained and raised their concerns.
I agree. The interesting thing (to me), is that when I express disagreement that our AGAB should have any bearing on the label we use for ourselves, a *lot* of trans people get really upset. For example, in my opinion, if a person is a feminine trans person, they should be able to access and use the term transfem for themselves, and vice versa with transmasc, regardless of AGAB. I don’t agree that our AGAB (an incorrect assumption about our bodies) should have a bearing on the term we use for ourselves now.
There are so many titles/labels that help each individual navigate through how they themselves feel. Non-binary to me means something different than it does to you, or the next person.  Point being, we each have our own thoughts on what each of these labels mean to us now, and how they relate to us in the past.  There is no point in being pissed off because you don’t agree with how someone else views a a labels context… if it doesn’t work for you then brush it off and move along.  Now if someone is using the terms in order to purposefully discredit how someone feels then you know that person is an asshole.  Idk.  Just how I roll with all the labels where nothing fits anyone anymore.
I’m not entirely sure how I feel about agab but for me depending on the situation I use afab when it’s necessary
Assigned gender is still VERY relevant, even to non-binary people.  We have to recognize that it's part of who we are, not ignore it.  This is why while my gender is non-binary and fluid, I still choose to label myself as ""female"" in recognition of my sex, because it influences how others view me and the assumptions they might make, and so on.

It largely determines what our bodies look like and how they function.

It informs how we are socialized while growing up, the toys and games people purchase for us, the way they talk to us, the things parents allow us to do.

It affects how we navigate through and experience the world - a transfem person, for example, would probably (depending on age) not have experienced things like being told to dress a certain way to ""be more appropriate"" or ""attract boys"".  But, as someone who passes for a cis woman, I've probably never experienced the fear or apprehension a transfem person might have on using a public bathroom.  Etc., etc.

We are certainly more than our assigned gender, but when we're talking about experiences and how we interact with the world, that still has a LOT of influence.
I don’t really get it either. It’s only important in medical matters or maybe in the CICO sub I joined (calories in, calories out) because the metabolisms are different
yeah i only think it’s relevant if you’re talking about something specific to being raised as your agab- like experiencing sexism toward girls/women even if you’re non-binary
From a personal perspective, I agree that agab isn't often relevant in many cases of nonbinary discourse. However, I feel that spaces for it do exist, especially considering that the distinction of sex and gender have been profoundly misunderstood by many people for such a long time. As an anthropologist, the anthropology of gender has always been quite interesting to me, and perhaps from an anthropological perspective I become more open to the distinction of afab and amab regarding certain topics of discussion. In the post you linked for example, I could personally view it as being rather irrelevant, but considering how in many societies, sexuality is often defined in relation to one's own gender, then defining one's sexuality can become much more complicated when you're gender-nonconforming. So people may turn to defining their sexuality based on their assigned gender because it helps to conceptualize their own sexuality. I don't think there's anything inherently wrong with this, but I do feel more terms should either be created or popularized as to avoid the need to rely on one's own agab in this respect. I think this same idea applies in many areas actually, that it's not so much a problem within LGBT spaces as much as it is a product of overall society itself not accommodating the people who don't identify with their agab. Essentially, society didn't think of a way to accommodate us, so we have to use our own spaces, and sometimes include agab discourse to make our gender (or lack thereof) make sense to ourselves.
AGREE. Drives me crazy. If you want to keep a space leaning one way or the other then say fem-aligned/masc-aligned non-binary people, not afab/amab!
Unless a discussion has specifically to do with socialized-female/male experiences or specific medical issues, in which case be specific that that’s what you’re talking about.
This is why I dislike queer discourse that attempts to strictly define sexuality labels. I’m nonbinary and a lesbian, but what does that really mean? It’s just a close-enough label that captures my attraction model, which excludes men, but I’m often extremely attracted to masculine enbies, and if I dated one, that wouldn’t suddenly make them a woman or non-masculine or anything of the sort. It’s just stupid and ridiculous to be so nitpicky; when gender can’t be defined within those strict boundaries, neither can sexuality.
I think it can be a good thing to mention when you're talking about your experiences to someone and your journey. Also to give context about different situations and hardships that one may come by as a non-binary person. Its all about understanding people isn't it? So why pretend like we weren't all assigned a gender at birth and ignore it's influence. Other than that I fully agree with you.
Fr.  Even as an afab person, when people do this, they usually don’t see me as enby, just “butch light” or “dyke lite” and will prob misgender me later, cos deep down they really just see me as a woman.  So yeah, agab is tiring af.  I don’t think it really helps us at all in the end
My partner deals with the same issue when talking to others about me. I had asked her to use they/them with people who don't know me directly, as my gender identity is fluid. She was talking with someone and they asked if her partner was a boy or girl, and she replied nonbinary. Then the person asked ""No, what are they *really*"" which pissed her off because the person had seemed more supportive of trans people initially. I feel like the issue is a total erasure of a person's identity as people only use the correct pronouns to appease someone.
The only thing I think that changes is where life punches you the most. Although I would like to look and consequently behave more feminene (I feel uncomfortable behaving as such when I see myself masculine, I know not all are as such.) I can't, I am expected to not be emotional etc. I have a non binary friend who is trying to unleash their masculinity. Although we have similar concerns regarding the society, and ultimately we are emotionally and mentally similar, we suffer from slightly different pre-programmed minds of our ours.

Though you see I haven't explicitly mentioned our gender at birth, although you probably can infer.


I would say, it has contextual relevance, though it isn't necessary to state when there's not an actual need.
I'm nonbinary, and yes it's a little annoying. I just don't like the amab/afab tags at all and I wish we'd all stop using them entirely.
THIS. And I also see other enbies state their AGAB, basing it on ‘diff socialisations’. It’s fine if you wanna state your AGAB - but I don’t like this explanation, for one- it prolly changes place to place. Never seen my desi guy and girl friends socialise like my yt friends and vice versa. Nothing wrong in either- just that I’ve been most anti-social before finding my identity and just really started talking in general to more people after I started figuring things and feeling more- closer, to me
To play devils advocate, genital preference is definitely a major issue for some people and the only real way to talk about it is AFAB/AMAB. But I agree people shouldn't be posting stuff like that to the sub, as it is insensitive.
Ye that's weird. When introducing a nonbinary/trans person it seems kinda invalidating to say their AGAB. Like i wouldn't want people knowing that bc people tend to use it against me if their homophobic.
People also do this with transmasc/fem, which is why I'm hesitant to use the terms. 

Sometimes if I introduce myself as nonbinary, the followup question if I'm transmasc/fem or """"regular"""" nonbinary (aka enby who presents in a way correlated to their gab), which only feels 2 steps away from whats in my pants.
Exactly! Same. We have ALLLLLL been influenced by our AGAB in social and medical ways, beginning on the first day of our lives. To deny this reality is borderline delusional. I don’t identify as my AGAB, obviously - I’m nb. BUT it has inherently influenced many aspects of my reality and sometimes I need to disclose that if I want to discuss those very real parts of my reality. It’s not ideal - but it’s real. I miss when nuance was a part of discourse. I fear how much we have thrown it out the window.
The problem with that is that it ignores class/race/nationality/literally every other intersection that gives ALL people very different experiences of being ""raised as"" or assigned a gender. What you attribute to being assigned (x) at birth is just as attributable to your income level, where you live, your culture, and your race as anything else. So trying to talk about experiences like they're shared by all people who were assigned the same gender is still not really clarifying anything. A rich white woman who grew up in Massachusetts, USA, and a poor black woman who grew up in the rural Appalachias, are gonna have two *drastically* different expectations placed upon them as women and may have nothing in common based on assigned gender, even if they're both cis women.
Me too! I’m nonbinary (obviously) & I use she/her exclusively, because I’m AFAB, people think I’m cis & I get invalidated a lot as a nonbinary person. My AGAB is super relevant to my experience with gender, I won’t mention it any less than I do because it’s relevant to *me*. I don’t care what other people’s AGABs are if they don’t care, I only care if it’s relevant & something *they* care about. If someone mentions their AGAB, that shouldn’t affect me, that’s their experience & not really any of my business. Although obviously no nonbinary person should be boiled down to their AGAB, that I absolutely agree with.
I don't think people ""forget"" these things. There are alot of humans who don't even know that themselves to begin with. Education is one thing, but how would people even find such info or even end up where these are discussed in the first place.

Being Non binary for me is just existing as a human.  So I agree with keeping Amab and AFAB terms to the minimum until it's truly understood.
Yeah I thought it was a bit odd too, like whenever people talk about that I always wonder, does that really include someone like me who's on T, eventually getting top, and hoping for eventual SR metoidioplasty? I mean my genitalia will be more in-between than anything, but everything else? And then *what*, in that case, would make me more desirable to said lesbian than, say, a transfem non-binary person who's on E and had bottom surgery?

I tend to think that, generally, quantifying your attraction to enbies based solely on our ASAB is a slippery slope at best, and not a great idea, because we really are all so different.
Literally my biggest pet peeve is the ‘woman lite’ idea
I present “woman lite” most times, and still find this kind of mentality upsetting. I would, at the very least, raise an eyebrow if someone had said this to me irl and then said they find me attractive. Just because I present myself as slightly off center female, does not mean I am a female, and I get frustrated quite often when people don’t understand the difference.
Just repackaged terf rhetoric. You know she only sees non-binary people as their agab and nothing more.
[deleted]
Only i'm getting so tired of labels myself as a prime millennial when it comes to this, along with disability as I feel too many people are quick to judge me without giving me enough time to understand my quirks.
I put in extra effort to not give away my agab because it makes me so dysphoric. I didn't mind people knowing in the past because I didn't feel like it mattered, but now I know how fixated people are on it. 

Feels invalidating for sure, but also invasive and perverted for people to care so much.
""People who have had hysterectomys... Yes I'm looking at you AMAB's"" 🤣
Seriously.
I don't have agab, only BEES 🐝
AGAB was started in the intersex community. its basically whatever they decided to put on our birth certificate which would then result in unnecessary medical procedures to fit that gender. it was really only created to help describe the type of medical abuse we received. the trans community started using it but im seeing more and more trans people unhappy with how it's being used
yup. i'm old enough to have seen this type of terf behavior in LGBTQIA+ spaces online for 10 years or more.
Defeats the purpose according to *whom?* From my perspective the whole purpose was NOT just to create a third category just for agender and third-gender persons, but to recognize the fluidity and intersectionality of gender as a constructed thing. This was *explicitly* inclusive of traditional queer gender subcultures and expressions. One of my inspirations here is Les Feinberg, who was a butch lesbian, trans man, and nonbinary person all in one. 

I'm feeling uncomfortable with the repeated ask in this subreddit for people who use words referencing AGAB to only talk about binding, etc.. That comes off as hella essentialist and gatekeepy,
or “socialization” i wasnt “socialized afab” i was socialized AUTISTIC goooooo fuck yourself
100% this. why i avoid stating amab/afab or referencing the agab binary. i avoid people who communicate their agab regularly online or in their profiles too b/c, like you said, it just reproduces the binary.
Uh...question: why'd you capitalize everything? xD

The capitalization somehow activated some kind of dyslexia or something within me, making it impossible for me to read this. 💀
As for the spectrum…….even conceiving of non-binary as a spectrum between ‘man’ and ‘woman’ doesn’t capture what being non-binary means. It’s not androgyny (though some want to present androgynously), nor a third sex, nor just ‘in between’. Non-binary is the entire universe of gender-space that’s not the two binary genders. Non-binary people can embody masculinity and femininity on separate axes, along with axes of other gender qualities not described by masculinity or femininity; more of one does not mean less of the others. Some non-binary people have gender experiences that nothing to do with the binary genders (for example, look up “maverique”).
There are amab people with vaginas, why couldn't they just say ""I'm attracted to non-binary people (with a preference for vaginas)"" instead?
Wait wait, so they made a separate session for binary trans people as well? That's kinda depressing.
The issue is that everyone knows that ""transfem"" and ""transmasc"" mostly mean the direction of transition.

If someone who is afab and says they're transfem enters a transfem space, they will not relate to any of the things in said space.

Now...its a completely different story when we say that one can be trans AND masculine or trans AND feminine.
speak for yourself
This ignores a lot of things, like race and class and nationality, that also impact people's experience of gender. There is no shared ""afab experience"" and the people who insist there is tend to be white cis feminists who ignore intersectionality.

I guarantee that there are AFAB people who had entirely different standards and expectations on them than you had, who had different experiences of sexed bodies and misogyny, who do not view themselves as essentially ""female"" in any way.
I can understand that, for some people (such as yourself), that element of your identity is important to you even as a non-binary person. I mostly just want to add what I think a lot of people tend to forget especially about non-binary people, that some of us can and do medically transition, and that can have a significant impact on how we're treated socially as well as what biological experiences we have.

So for me, I still sometimes have reason to specify my ASAB, but I expect it will become less relevant as I get further along in transition. And typically I prefer to be more specific because even another AFAB person may have different experiences depending on a whole variety of factors. So I'd rather say, for example, ""as someone who was raised as a girl,"" or, ""as someone who can get pregnant,"" than just AFAB.

I also am much more averse to bringing it up in certain spaces, as I find it just gives transphobes (transmed variety especially) more ammo to use against me. People are usually more chill about it in non-binary spaces ime but I also only tend to hang out in the kind of nbi spaces that would be. I'm probably more personally averse to alignment terms (like transmasc, transfem) for myself than ASAB, tbh. But that could just be cuz I'm maverique. 🤷🏻
All of this goes out the window if you actually consider intersex people in your worldview for a minute.
I struggle with how to accept help that is explicitly intended to help women in male-dominated / sexist environments. I usually get read as a butch / gender non-conforming woman, meaning that I have dealt with the same sexism that women do my entire life. I want and/or need the same sort of help and support that women do!

I've been erring on the side of just sucking it up and participating in ""women in X"" type of events, because it's a lot easier than trying to get the names changed to ""victims of the patriarchy in physics social"" or ""improv workshop for people who were trained in childhood to be quiet and deferential"".
even to *some* nonbinary people. for others it isn't relevant at all. the biggest problem I think is using them as generalities or assuming what we have in common because of what genitals we had as infants.
[deleted]
I agree with you about a lot of this. The gender I was assigned at birth is insanely relevant to how I have experienced the world thus far - how others have perceived me and treated me, the privileges I have had or haven’t had, the role within my family throughout my childhood, my socialization, etc. The list goes on. Ideally, sex wouldn’t impact those things. But we don’t live in an ideal world just yet, unfortunately. The reality is, being AFAB means I experience the world differently than I would had I been AMAB. It means that I have been socialized during my most formative developmental years in a way that I would not have been had I been AMAB. It’s delusional to pretend that this isn’t a FACT. That doesn’t mean I’m not nonbinary. I don’t identify as female or male. I don’t view the world through that lens. The issue is, people in our community have absolutely thrown the concept of nuance out the window. It prevents them from acknowledging the uncomfortable grey areas of reality.
I don't quite understand.
What is a ""socialized-female"" experience? 🤔
I've also struggled with this exact (yet opposite) dilemma. I love the term ""queer"" in these instances, but it also requires explanation I typically don't want to explain (to straight people who I really could give less of a f about)
Thing is...it's assuming that all afab people have vaginas and that all amab people have penises...it's better to say ""Am I a lesbian if I like non-binary people with a preference for pussy?""
I agree with everything you're saying, but I don't think that invalidates OP's point. She's not saying that nb people shouldn't disclose their agab, just that people shouldn't reduce a nb person to only their agab. It's one thing to talk about your experiences with dysphoria, medical stuff, etc with the context of your agab, if that context is important to understanding the story. If I talk about how buying bras makes me uncomfortable, that can mean something very different depending on whether I'm afab or amab.  
It's a completely different thing to lump nb people in with their agab, like how if I go out with female friends it's ""girls' night"" but if my cis husband goes with us then it's not. Or ""I'm [straight/gay] but I'd date a nb person if they still look and act like a [man/woman]."" They're completely missing the point of what it means to be nb.
I don't think this is what OP was saying. The post they linked was someone asking if they're still a lesbian if they're attracted to afab nonbinary people, which (hopefully) I don't need to explain why isn't a great or validating way to word it. Nobody's saying what you were assigned at birth has no affect on anything, but the way people use afab/amab is often not necessary or even *correct*. You can use it but also don't get offended when other nonbinary people have problems with it.
In some ways yes, but not entirely. You can't say ""oh because this person was AFAB they *only* have been influenced *this* way"". Many non binary people *do* transition and end up passing as a sex other than their AGAB. A transfeminine non binary person who passes as a woman will likely encounter a lot of the same harassment and misogyny that it common for AFAB people. And in my case, yes, I was AFAB, but you would be very blatantly wrong if you told me I haven't been heavily socialized as male.

Socialization doesn't end when you hit puberty or when you turn 18. There are very few things that are *only* causational down to AGAB. For social things, there will almost always be an exception to any generalized statement you make. You are better off just saying ""people socialized in x way"" rather than trying to categorize it as strictly AGAB.
I don't see how the original post is lacking in nuance. I got the impression they would agree, and are saying it's only \*usually\* not relevant, which I think we all agree on.
I skipped 90 percent of gendered socialization by being autistic and it is infuriating to see people assume that everyone has been socialized a certain way when it is just not goddamn true.
I'm not saying anything about boiling experiences down to a gender. I'm saying that I have experiences of my own that were influenced by the gender society saw me as, just like almost everyone else does. That's how I use it when I do so. I know other aspects of my identity affect me.
Like you KNOW it doesn’t include that when they say “AFAB non binary person” and they’re asking about the lesbian umbrella They’re trying to say someone that’s fem/andro and probably not on T. And I feel like they’re still thinking of them in a binary gender way. Cause even that doesn’t mean they are women lite, and that person could NOT want to be with lesbians for dysphoria reasons. I’m okay responding to ppl like this cause I want to show people how to change their thinking/break down the binary BUT it’s still soo frustrating.
And you know they're excluding non-binary people like me who've been on E for years, had bottom and other gender related surgeries and look like a queer woman. We're not our agab and reducing us down to our agab or asab is hurtful and  in many cases completely misleading.
Verrry frustrating. I’m tired of people trying to make non binary a monolith 3rd gender where our AGABs are still brought into it.
Labels have purpose and are important to have. It’s when labels become stereotyping tools that it becomes an issue. But labels give us the vocabulary of explaining our experience in a way that’s not exhausting or requiring of a college lecture length discussion.

If it wasn’t for the label of nonbinary, I’d still be struggling to understand myself and explain my lived experience to others. And it would have been nearly impossible to find a community of others who are just like me.

That said, reducing people to their labels is an -ism like any other. Sexism, racism, etc.
ABAB (ed: assigned bees at birth)
Exactly. It’s also frustrating because now people tend to only understand AGAB in the context of trans spaces and don’t realize or care that it started with intersex people and meant something completely different to begin with. I’m intersex too and was forcibly altered at birth, so it’s just also extremely frustrating for me personally because it’s something I’ve also dealt with a *lot* too.  

Honestly it’s also often harmful because this distinction is not considered, and often people just want to know *”whats in your pants?”* rather than what your actual biology is.
I’m actually fairly young, and fairly new to queer spaces, I only hold my opinion on this subject because I notice a common ideological root in gender bio-essentialism. But could you tell me more about your experience?
To a lot of us…? It’s okay if you want to identify as an AFAB nb person and if you want to place attention on your intersectionality of AGAB and gender identity, but for a lot of the ways people are using AGAB now they’re generalising incorrectly and it winds up just being repackaged transphobia. Not all nb people look like their AGABs, not all of us are comfortable being referred to that way. Saying stuff like “attracted to AFAB nb people” is weird because one AFAB nb person might look more or less just like a man while another might by androgynous whole another might look a lot like a woman. Would they be attracted to all??? Why would they be attracted to an AFAB nb person post-top surgery, on T, who has had bottom surgery but not an AMAB nb person who doesn’t transition medically. Unless they’re assuming AFAB nb = woman nb.
LOL yeah the ""socialized"" argument does not fit me either. I transitioned as a teenager. ""Socialization"" doesn't end at 15 which is when I came out, even if it was a valid argument.
>Uh...question: why'd you capitalize everything? xD

Well, You See, An Evil Microscopic Weevil Has Crawled Inside My Brain And Is Forcibly Activating The Neurons That Cause Me To Capitalise Words, Whether I Like It Or Not, And Preventing Me From Undoing It. 

>The capitalization somehow activated some kind of dyslexia or something within me, making it impossible for me to read this. 💀

~~I can't read it in the first place so I don't have such problems 😎~~

So that you can read it, However, Here it is with *Minimal Capitalisation!!1!*

> There definitely *are* contexts where it can be Relevant Information, For example (sometimes) when someone is talking about their own Transition or Experience. If I'm talking about How I Felt Growing Up, For example it could be useful to know I'm AMAB. That said I'll definitely agree it's somewhat overused too. (Based solely on the title of the post you linked I'm skeptical of it as a whole, Although I suppose ignoring that I would agree it's not a good use of the term.)
This is generally what I discovered myself; I had thought it was just all of the in-between but obviously that's not the case. I seem to be operating in a completely different dimension than gender if you get where I'm coming from..

Looked up maverique, I can immediately relate but for myself I think I feel more comfortable as just nb/agender/queer. Then again some days I feel more gnc/gender fluid. Ugh gender... why you even fucking exist is my question 😅😅
I agree, that's kind of what I said in my comment aha.
I think it might be trans and non binary grouped together, possibly based on how there’s a trans and non binary society within the lgbt society. Basically any non cis person. It’s only had one session this semester tho. It’s a step in the right direction ig? Albeit a small one
I get where you’re coming from but see it differently. 🤷🏻
Totally - assigned gender is just ONE aspect of intersectionality that needs to be considered. And not everyone is going to have the same experience just because they're assigned the same. But it's definitely something that has a big influence in our overall lives. I just don't think it's helpful to try and act like we live in this magical genderless society where assigned gender at birth has zero relevance to anything. It's still a major factor. And most people outside the queer community (hell, even plenty within) don't think that way either. I am someone who is usually perceived to be a cis woman by the general public and that has a huge impact on my daily life - I wish it didn't - but it does and that's just the truth.
Oh yes 100%! And that's included in this concept of ""assigned gender influences your life and worldview"". A person who chooses to medically transition is absolutely going to have totally different experiences than someone who doesn't. But the whole concept of ""transition"", and not just plastic surgery or cosmetic procedures, is BECAUSE we have assigned gender at birth. Which influenced choice to medically transition, or not. And even post transition, the things you experienced in the past because of the birth assignment, are going to influence how you think and feel about things.

I'm totally on board with being annoyed that it's still such a big deal, potentially using different terminology, etc etc. I just definitely don't think that completely ignoring the fact that everyone has a birth assigned gender of some kind and trying to dismiss it as irrelevant is helpful either. In a perfect world, but that's not the one we live in.
What about intersex people invalidates this? They are also impacted by their personal history - how they were socialized, how they are seen by strangers, their history of how they understand their gender, and their physical body. I don’t think intersex people existing means that any of these things aren’t important it just means some people have more complicated experiences
It doesn't, though, because most intersex people are not aware of the condition until later in life or ever. And those that are apparent at birth, historically have had their bodies changed to match the sex the doctors and parents decide on - many times the parents were not even told - and assigned and raised as one of two genders. I really fucking hope that's changing in current birth practices but I'm not sure, I haven't had kids yet or known too many people closely who have. 

I'm a biologist, I'm well aware of intersex people and do consider them in my worldview. In the case of being intersex, yeah, assigned gender won't really hold true to physiology. But the doctor doesn't say ""it's an intersex child!"", they say ""it's a boy"" or ""it's a girl"" and thus, assign a gender. So you mean to tell me that an intersex person who's raised as a certain gender and then very clearly develop differently during puberty, or find out about the ""procedure"" that happened at their birth, or get genetic testing in adulthood to find out why they're infertile and realize their chromosomes and phenotype don't match - you don't think that incorrect assignment and potential trauma would greatly shape an intersex person's life experiences and how they interact with the world? No, it absolutely would. Hence, assigned gender is still relevant to intersex people because it still happens to them.
It might not make sense to you, or the OP apparently, but it does make sense to this *individual* that made the comment you replied to — and to me another Enby who has every right to identify exactly who I am based solely on my knowledge of myself. To say otherwise is where the invalidation occurs. No one is forcing you to disclose if you choose not to, but to specifically try to exclude folx… that seems all about invalidation and gatekeeping to me. I’m non binary because societal gender norms are an anathema to me. I don’t fit either side, and find myself often fully OUTSIDE them. All the same I have no biological dysphoria. So I reason I can (and do) refer to myself as male, but not a man. Sex =/= gender… but I believe this entire thread is predicated on that conflation. Anyway, I’ll probably get downvoted, but I agree with you @birdydevil!
To me it makes no sense to just pretend that this huge part of my experience just doesn’t exist. 

Like I understand that not everyone may feel this way, but I’m seen 100% as my agab despite my best efforts, my history in the queer community & partners are effected by it, I have a certain body with very gendered characteristics. My identity is nonbinary but I can’t stop these other factors from playing a major role in my life.
But at the same time, if you grew up with, for example, breasts, you are likely to have a totally different set of experiences to somebody who did not, whether you identify as non-binary or not. We might not like to be defined by our genitals, but society will do so regardless.  
I also think for NBs who don't use some form of HRT, a person's sex (NOT gender) does influence your moods and physical experience to a certain extent. People who don't menstruate do not have the massive hormonal fluctuations that people who menstruate do, although that's just one example.  


Personally, I'm totally fine with the *SEX I was assigned at birth (female)*, in the sense I'm fine with the body, hormones and chromosomes that I have. What I'm NOT fine with is the *GENDER assigned to me at birth (woman/girl)* and all the social, behavioural, fashion and aesthetic expectations and norms that come with that.   
I'm really glad this discussion got brought up because I've always thought that there should be both AGAB and ASAB (assigned sex at birth) terms, which would make it easier to talk about experiences that are more related to social vs. physical dysphoria as a nonbinary or trans person.
I'm not identifying by my genitals. I'm identifying by my history, which includes growing up with the intense serophobia of the Reagan-Bush era, dating gay bears, receiving abuse because I did not properly perform masculinity, and loosing my entire youth support system when I came out because of religiously sponsored prejudice. 

Which means that, if we're talking about intersectionality, I have shared issues with many cis queer men my age. And on the other side, I have common issues with many transfem people. 

Being genderqueer for me means celebrating our diversity, not creating an entirely new standard of ideological androgyny.
If you genuinely don’t know… much has been already been written, and written well, on the subject, and it would be a waste of time for me to redundantly try to compose something in a reddit comment.
If you’re trying to imply that there aren’t socialized-female experiences (not absolutely universal ones, there are no universal experiences), then it would be an even bigger waste of time for me to get into that debate.
I hear you! I guess we’re all saying the same thing for the most part. None of us want to be reduced to our assigned genders, and yet all of us are impacted by them in some way. Thanks for your comment.
I completely agree with all of you. This is why it's so much easier dating bi/pan people. I hate how it's so natural for people to reduce others to their AGAB in society and make all of these assumptions especially when people present differently than their AGAB.
People making toxic masculinity something _specific to transfems_ makes me gag lmfao. People of any AGAB can experience that one.
I skipped a lot of my gender's socialization by being socially inept, but I still had parts thrust upon me whether I liked it or not. Actually, my attempt to be evaluated as autistic was influenced by my AGAB.
Being Jewish and intersex and poor and mentally ill from a rural southern area affected my socialization as much as my AGAB. The things that happened to me even “because” of my AGAB were different culturally and a lot of people here would find unrelatable consequently.

People project stuff onto their AGAB sometimes and it’s like no, that’s you being raised with cultural christianity I skipped that one and had something completely different, etc.

Then people generalize and, if you bring up these other influences and point out that it’s not universal (that can’t be distanced from your AGAB because culture affects AGAB treatment for example), they say you clearly don’t get it because they _assume you haven’t suffered sufficiently to ‘realize’ how wrong you are_ and it’s like. You literally have no idea who you’re talking to. It’s rude to assume how much people have suffered because you disagree with them to say the least, and inappropriate.
I think this would've been the best start of the convo. It is frustrating.  We are not a monolith. And being NB is definitely not a ""3rd gender"". And many even non binaries struggle to have this line of thinking  but we will get there as long as the thought provocation to it persists. Even ifnits exhausting. It's a serious matter
I understand what you’re saying and am not trying to discount it, however I disagree that the label of non-binary itself is what allowed you to understand yourself and explain your existence to others. Gender-nonconforming people have done that with and without specific terminology in various cultures for years, and the language has just evolved and changed. Even the gender identities have evolved and changed. And, they might still do so. (I think this is true for *all* gender identities.)

I think a lot of people feel some sort of pressure to find the right fit of a label, panic when they don’t find one, and also enforce other people’s labels on them, whether they are self-assigned or not. And that’s because we were basically all raised in a society that has done that to us since birth with this comphet patriarchy, forcing us to see ourselves and everyone as either a male boy or a female girl, and putting that before their identity as a human being. The labels aren’t the problem, the way we’ve been conditioned to understand gender and sexuality and their labels through the compulsory cisheteronormative lens we’ve been forced to look at the world through is the problem. And it’s carried over as residual in some of the ways people label themselves in the community today. This isn’t a new problem either though, but it’s just more abundant with more recognition, more language, and technology to spread it.
not much to tell. i've been on social media for over 20 years, and started seeing this delineation between amab/afab on people's profiles on Tumblr about 10 years ago. couldn't tell you why people were doing it, b/c i don't communicate with persons who embrace any part of the binary, but i just remember seeing it. it felt really weird at first seeing it, then uncomfortable. at first i figured it just wasn't for me. but then i started seeing people's warnings on Tumblr about the terf-like communication that came from some blogs with amab/afab and from some LGBTQIA+ spaces and that we should watch out.
LOL, I'm not AFAB either. Assumptions like that are a big reason why I feel the need to clarify that I'm a *transfeminine* genderqueer (or genderqueer transfem, play with your food, play with your words).

Somehow, pointing out the awfulness of the linked post has turned into a big ask that nonbinary people *police ourselves* when it comes to language that clearly and succinctly describes the kinds of prejudice we deal with on a daily basis. EDIT: Or language that we find empowering, especially as an act of resistance to the TERF narrative that nonbinary people are cannibalizing lesbian butch and gay femme culture. 

And honestly, I find AGAB language clunky as heck. But the specific word isn't the issue, it's the idea that the ""purpose"" of nonbinary *doesn't include* radical gender fairy support group aunties like myself.
That last question is Big Fucking Mood! 🙌
AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA

Sorry, I'm bad at focusing on big texts. xD
I suppose, but separating trans boys from cis boys and separating trans girls from cis girls reminds me of the racial segregation of the 20th century.

Otherwise, a separate session for non-binary people seems great! :3
I can't, those are kinda the terms that everybody knows and uses.

A transfem space would specifically be for MtF people, whilst a transmasc space would specifically be for FtM people.
My assigned gender has not had the impact on me as an intersex GQ that you think it has on everyone. And I don't see what being read as a cis woman has to do with being assigned anything -- anyone of any birth assignment can be read and treated like a cis woman OR NOT! Cis women of color are so often exposed to transmisogynoir because black women are seen as inherently more ""manly"" than  white women and excluded from womanhood. Like, the suffragettes actively excluded black women from their definition of woman. So like. Assigned gender really isn't what you think it is, and we dont have to live in a ""magical genderless society"" for that to be the case. Im intersex and post-op salmacian, my assigned gender counts for fuckall medically or socially. I was raised as a genderless kid till i was 9, then reassigned female till I was 16, and then I was raised as male till I was 18 and left home. What part of my assigned gender tells you about that experience?

You might feel like it has some huge impact in your life, but extrapolating that to mean it must be that way for everyone is not gonna work.
Because for us (I’m intersex myself), the gender we were assigned is often traumatic and not congruent with our actual biology. I’ll try to explain using my own experiences. 

I was forcibly operated on the day I was born, my body was altered without mine or my parents consent, and I was raised as female/a girl for half of my life until the changes in my body could no longer be denied. I don’t have experiences “as a female”, I have experiences as a traumatized intersex kid who was forced into a false binary that did nothing but cause problems and confusion for most of my life and set me back by about 20 years in both healthcare and self discovery. My assigned gender at birth was not and is not correct nor applicable to my experiences, and insisting that it is because of how I was “socialized” is really just another weird and frankly transphobic statement if you really start to deconstruct that too.
You don’t need to preach at me, because while to *you* we’re just a research project, this is my actual **LIFE**. I don’t need to *imagine* anything when it comes to being intersex, and you can’t invalidate my experiences as an actual intersex human being living with this condition and in this demographic just to validate your own feelings and opinions.

Uh...I'm asking what it is, I don't know what it means. :(

I don't quite understand what a ""male socialized experience"" and vice versa is.
I think the extent to which people identify as having had a typical AGAB experience in that realm varies. 

I’m intersex and the way I was hurt was a bit different than the typical stuff people say when they talk about AFAB vs AMAB nonbinary people. I was coercively assigned a gender. We all were to some extent, but even if people would still assume an AGAB of me it’s very complicated.

The strict lines people draw like that while assuming shared experience (that all AFAB people experience x socialization/experience for example) just because of AGAB contributes to cultural erasure, intersexism, and assumption that whiteness (how many predominately LGBT+ spaces like this one even know what Ungendering means?) and other elements don’t affect AGAB experiences.

The generalizations go haywire when people start bringing up AGAB. It’s not as simple as even many nonbinary people think. 

Many of us still need to work on taking apart the gender binary in our heads and the biological essentialism and (assumed white, assumed culturally christian, assumed euroamerican) socialization assumptions there. Socioeconomic status even affects this. 

An [appalachian kid](https://www.jstor.org/stable/41446780) is gonna have a different gender socialization (and [sexuality socialization](https://www.ohioswallow.com/book/Loving+Mountains%2C+Loving+Men)!) experience than even other kids in the US in like, neighboring Maryland. **Not enough consideration for details that affect socialization are often taken into account casually to ever be truly accurate beyond assumption, unfortunately.** It’s so much more complicated than a “universal AGAB experience.” It’s *assumed* straight forward by AGAB. I could even cite [other](https://www.jstor.org/stable/10.1525/j.ctt1ppst1) [gender](https://www.ucpress.edu/book/9780520271487/dude-youre-a-fag) [theory](https://www.jstor.org/stable/464747) and sociology books and studies on this. 

Important: Trying to be genuine, not guilt trippy here. If you don’t know or see these assumptions in yourself it’s natural to society. But, it’s unhealthy and makes it harder to actually get past gender essentialism. These assumptions have even been acknowledged to have [affected medical studies in a negative way.](https://www.hup.harvard.edu/catalog.php?isbn=9780674725324) The assumptions run deep deep deep.

Edited so there’s not huge paragraphs that are harder to look at.

Edit 2: i have a bunch of academic citations in this post. if anyone wants resources or more citations for my points, feel free to dm me. i would love talking to anyone that has questions, though i’m not a theory of anything professor so some things will be more difficult for me to answer and we’ll have to look for books on it
I could never date someone who isn’t bi/pan because I’ll constantly feel like “oh you’re the exception” or that they think of me as the gender they’re primarily attracted to.
I get that but I usually bring out the training wheels when I’m talking about gender with cis people 🤣 yanno what I mean? I totally agree with your point here, the biggest offense here is their assumption that your AGAB affects your gender/presentation in a humongous way according to being AFAB/AMAB. That’s just the gender binary with extra steps. 🤣
I’m gonna push back because you’re misunderstanding what I’m saying. The existence of the nonbinary label is what allowed me to understand myself, and that’s just a fact.

Without that label, I’d be trying to find the words to describe myself. Id be struggling to find a community. I’d be feeling alone and confused and isolated. And all those feelings would manifest in anxiety or depression or some other form of distress which would prevent me from having the mental space to explore my existence deeper than base survival levels. It’s because of the label that I was able to find others who identify with the label and talk to them and learn their experiences and thus understand my own better. It’s because of the label that I had support and felt calm enough to dive into my own identity and truly see myself for who I am. And while the label doesn’t define me, it was very much needed for me to understand myself. And having lived for multiple decades before finding the label despite knowing for myself exactly who I am (and feeling generally okay saying I didn’t need a label to know for myself), I can assure you that having the label still made a world of difference in me understanding my own identity.

As much as people want to act like labels aren’t necessary, they are necessary for communicating ideas to each other. It’s language. It’s how humans share thoughts.

I get what you’re saying, too, but I feel like you’re discounting the very real benefits of labels when used properly. They are tools, and in the hands of different people, they can be used to heal and help - or harm.
I don’t get what you mean by policing ourselves? Wasn’t the linked post someone applying terminology to us, not us to ourselves? 

I also don’t get what you mean by “the purpose” of nb not including radical gender?? What is radical gender? Wdym by “purpose?”

Intersectionality is definitely big but especially with regards to nb people the waters get murky specifically because we’re not a uniform group of people and we’re very hard to generalise. And it’s just so easy to use specific language when talking about groups. Like, why not just say you’re attracted to fem nb people? All fem nb people are fem… not all AFAB nb people are. Or if you’re talking about reproductive health, why not just say “nb people with [body part]?” Bc if you’re talking about breasts, then there are transfem people with them and transmasc people without them, so AFAB and AMAB don’t work. Some AFAB people have had hysterectomies so you can’t say AFAB people if you’re talking about uteri. Same with AMAB people and testicles. I guess I’m just confused why not be specific when talking abt other people? When it’s yourself Ofc that’s one thing, but otherwise I don’t get it. 

Also, I assumed you were AFAB specifically because of the Leslie bit. (And also honestly because I’ve seen a lot of AFAB nb TERFs say really similar stuff; not saying you’re one at all but my mind kind of unthinkingly linked the two. But that means it’s my mistake, so I’m sorry).
I didn’t really think about it like that but you are right, it’s a bit dodge for them to separate trans and cis binary people like that. I suppose they just wanted to create a safe space where people could feel more comfortable around other non cis people. I hope it gets some adjustments so it’s not so segregated like you say
Okay? I’m saying we’re not going to agree and leaving it at that. I’m well aware of the standard argument.
So basically what you've just told me is that you didn't experience having a boy/girl gender assigned at birth the way 99.something% of people do. That's great for you. And that also influenced how you grew up, and interacted with the world, and developed your identity, and the things you think and believe today.

I am read as a cis woman because I am AFAB and have chosen to forego any medical transition. This is one of the ways that for me, personally, my assigned gender influences my life daily. Is that going to be the case for absolutely every AFAB person? Certainly not. It's just an example.

But EVERY SINGLE PERSON'S assigned at birth gender IS GOING TO INFLUENCE THEIR LIFE in *some kind* of way. And even if it doesn't seem relevant now, it still had an effect on an individual's past, which has a play in shaping their present.

I don't know how I could make this any more clear.
I guess I don’t really understand where the disagreement is

I said this 

> They are also impacted by their personal history - how they were socialized, how they are seen by strangers, their history of how they understand their gender, and their physical body. I don’t think intersex people existing means that any of these things aren’t important it just means some people have more complicated experiences

And then you seemed to give a lot of examples of being impacted by your personal history, by having people view you as a gender you are not, being impacted by your specific biology etc. So I’m a bit confused what you’re objecting too. The fact that intersex people and non intersex people have different experiences is part of the point I’m making ig; that there is a lot more context to our experience of gender than just the identity portion
- I'm not ""preaching at"" you, you came at me with an accusation that I'm not considering intersex people, and I explained that I do.

- I didn't once ask you to imagine anything, that phrase appears where? 

- ....I'm not making any attempt to invalidate your experiences, that doesn't even make any sense.

?

And even I don't know for sure whether I'm intersex or not, I just don't have strong reasons to investigate all aspects of it.
If this can only be GNC, then is the requirement to be non-binary that one has physical dysphoria with your body/hormones? I've read multiple discussions on this forum indicating that this is not the case, and that physical dysphoria is not required to be non-binary.
okay sorry! i’m so used to people picking fights 😬
It just means those things that are common to most people growing up assigned male/female. It will vary a bit by culture, but there are still the overall expectations: for someone seen as a girl, that marriage & kids will be a priority for you, that you’ll be a good caretaker, that it’s valuable for you to be physically attractive. These examples are super super basic; it’s basically the entire way the world views you and treats you based on your perceived gender. Someone’s primary caretakers might be unusual and cause them to have a somewhat different experience, but the rest of the world will still adjust their expectations and perceptions based on which gender they think the baby/child/teen in front of them is. It shapes who you are and how you see the world, and also provides a range of common experiences, which is why it’s often relevant in gender discussions.
> **Not enough consideration for details that affect socialization are often taken into account casually to ever be truly accurate beyond assumption, unfortunately.** It’s so much more complicated than a “universal AGAB experience.” It’s assumed straight forward by AGAB.

I think it's a huge leap to say that talking about AGAB is some universalizing generalization. (It's understandable to making that leap since a lot of people on social media do likewise.) Rather talking about all of our various factors, dimensions of privilege and disadvantage, is a way to be accountable for the uniqueness of our histories. I don't say ""I was raised as a boy, and therefore I can speak for all people who were raised as a boy."" I say, ""I'm a late-transitioning transfeminine and white person from the American midwest, if what I say is *not relevant to you, you don't have to agree.*"" 

In discussing my gender history, I'm inviting discussion of shared and not-shared experiences. But there's no way of making sense of my personal gender history without describing forms of abuse that were tied to growing up masc, white, and queer in the American midwest.
Well that's why I agree. That specific comment was perfect. The statement is we are not a monolith. We are not our AGAB. And even if they are stuck in the binary, we are not obligated to have their lense of seeing things. We should be respected as humans for just being humans, not be focused on out AGAB
So that means people like you would’ve never found those things before the word non-binary existed? Because they did. But I’m not looking to argue. At least you feel like you’ve found community. I have not found labels to do the same for me whatsoever.
> I don’t get what you mean by policing ourselves?  Wasn’t the linked post someone applying terminology to us, not us to ourselves?

Many of the responses have also addressed self-identification. ""Using it as an additional label outside these contexts does totally defeat the purpose of being nonbinary and adds gentials ...""

> What is radical gender? Wdym by “purpose?” 

First of all argument up-thread was that using language that describes our AGAB or gender history ""defeats the purpose of being nonbinary"" (nevermind the essentialist language underlying nonbinary as a state of being). I find it more than a bit rude to jump into a thread and do context erasure. 

Note that this particular argument comes up on a daily basis in this space, not just with AGAB language, but also with sexuality labels, butch/femme and transfem/masc as well. 

""Radical gender fairy"" is a play on the term ""radical fairy."" Radical fairies are a gender-inclusive and gay-centric movement, with a smidge of ""radical queer"" along the way. Both are movements that reject the idea that sexual and gender liberation are entirely separate things. 

My point is I'm not less nonbinary when I reference my gender history or *contextually* use terms like ""fairy"" or ""auntie"" to describe different aspects of my existence. 

> And it’s just so easy to use specific language when talking about groups. 

Some of that specific language is going to reveal aspects of our gender history. I experienced 1. anti-gay discrimination 2. in the 1990s 3. as a member of the Boy Scouts of America 4. in the American midwest. That's four facts about me that help to contextualize my reaction to ""groomer"" language in 2023. 

None of those facts is a claim that my experience *defines* or *represents* anyone else who shares those facts. It's a starting point of discussion. But I can think of no other way to explain why ""groomer"" language is *personally* offensive *to me* without reference how that label affected me as a young adult. 

> Also, I assumed you were AFAB specifically because of the Leslie bit.

Yes, you did.
No, I did have an assigned gender at birth. Your assumption that my experiences mean I didn't is the problem im talking about here.

Being assigned female impacts you in certain ways, sure. But there is no quintessential ""afab experience"" that we can group people by, is what I'm saying. All people assigned any gender will have very different experiences regardless of sharing an AGAB. That's why the idea of ""afab and amab enbies"" having distinctly separate experiences and being two coherent categories is a problem, like what's being talked about by OP. You and I might both be AFAB but we have probably next to nothing in common based on that. So someone being attracted to ""afab NBs"" means literally nothing.
You're absolutely fine to use nonbinary. She's just generally shitty to nonbinary people (and by the looks of things, trans people in general actually). Check her post history and you'll see.
I see, so people who have grown up as a boy would be expected to be tough, to be able to handle pressure, to be able to handle male-on-male bullying, to ""man up"" during sad/negative times, and so on...

I myself was raised as a boy but never quite fit the image, I was bullied harshly for being gentle and liking girl things, I remember one time when I was 8, I was forced to kiss another boy cause ""boys will be boys"", they would chuck rocks at me, they would spit on me and so many other terrible things...

But in your original comment...why did you only mention female-socialization issues and not the male ones too?
I said often earlier on the post, not every instance. I wasn’t going to qualify it every sentence tbh. Also you qualifying your experience as that plus **white & masc & midwest** means you’re inherently **not doing what I was critiquing.** The other aspects that you could talk from and examine would include like, socioeconomic status etc.

I’m critiquing people who are like, “This is an AFAB experience,” and “This is an AMAB experience,” as a binary without admitting other factors contribute to said experience like being white etc.

You speaking for yourself is not a generalization of everyone who is AMAB. I’m talking about people who say, “This is an AFAB experience,” not, “This is _my_ AFAB experience.”
Humans logically know all expiriences are unique, but also know there are huge societal pressures, that vary around the world and family to family, however there are similarities as no person lives in a vacuum of life experience. Such as being queer AFAB that is not intersex, I relate to cisgendered women more than cisgendered men in various aspects of my life, especially when the typical non-lgbtq person probably sees me as women, weird (to them) women, but they still see me that way. So larger society puts different expectations on me than a AMAB person, and then my family puts additional expectations that differ from my AMAB siblings, the place I live in also add variety of expectations (being a more conservative Canadian city). 

I can deny these expectations, and do regularly, but they still exist and affect me. The expectation that I'll wear a dress to my cousins wedding, not every AFAB,  nonbinary, trans or cis, would have this expectation put on them by their family. However, it is still influenced by my AGAB, as an AMAB person would have different expectations put on them. And there will be 'consequences' for denying this expectation, such as relatives being unhappy with me, mybe harrassing me. This is a relatively small consequences so I'll likely deal with them, but if I was AMAB and wore a dress those consequences could be larger, as in being disowned, because in the western world a AFAB dressing masculine is more okay than a AMAB dressing feminine. However in some cultures me being AFAB and dressing masculine can have larger consequences.

 Every person has multiple intersectionalities in their existence that change how things affect them, and AGAB is one of them, being intersex or not is another, race and is a big insectionality. And these intersectionalities highly influence each other. The variety of intersectionalities people experience should be talked about, as it creates better understanding, and AGAB is included in that. It doesn't mean that one is reducing themselves to their AGAB when talking about the experience that involves that, it is just a different way in general of experiencing being nonbinary.
So here you:

-have told me I’m rude for forgetting what the first comment was about because I have a life and was preparing dinner for four people

-seem to be being aggressive because I’m not constantly in online lgbt spaces and don’t know all the relevant terminology and frequently discussed arguments

-keep acting like I’m saying it’s bad to reference your personal ‘gender history’ when I’ve said multiple times now that that’s not an issue at all and that what I’m talking about is when other people group us up in gender essentialist ways

-were very condescending to what was an honest mistake which I genuinely apologised and took responsibility for

This is not a conversation I would like to continue. Have a great rest of your day or night.
Got it, thanks for the heads up!
Because I had a brain glitch and meant to write female/male and didn’t 🤦🏻‍♀️ I edited it now!
I’m talking about assumptions that are so common I could link a reddit comment right now, not saying people can’t talk about themselves. **You saying that personally, your AGAB affected your experience, is not what I’m talking about.**

AMAB and AFAB people do not have the same expectations placed upon them universally. However, people _assume_ all AFAB people to be dyadic when you say AFAB. People _assume_ all AMAB people were socialized to suppress their emotions. A common experience is **not** a universal one. The reason people assume these things is because of transphobia, cissexism, racism, and so on. No one is saying AGAB doesn’t affect people. I’m saying there’s no **universal way** that AGAB affects people.

EDIT: (This gets into semantics which I won’t critique for in others, but personally my stance on how to talk about this is to name the beast. **Why would people call it an AFAB experience when you could just call it misogyny or transphobia?** A _lot of the time_ (not ALL the time) when people talk about it it’s not “an AFAB” thing. It’s misogyny. It’s not “an AMAB thing” it’s transmisogyny or toxic masculinity or whatever. Why not name what you’re experiencing instead of implying all AFAB or AMAB people experience your experience? 

This also clarifies speaking when _say for example,_ a passing trans woman experiences _misogyny_ instead of transmisogyny because people assume she’s a cis woman. That experience would be identical to what many people would call an AFAB experience. Therefore, to me it makes more sense to just say I’ve experienced misogyny.)

People often use arguments as such to imply **all** trans women have a “masculine socialization” (some trans women would say yes, **others would definitely not**) which is transmisogynistic as many women have pointed out. I suggest [Whipping Girl](https://www.sealpress.com/titles/julia-serano/whipping-girl/9781580056229/).

This affects how people talk about things. An intersex AFAB experience is no less an AFAB experience than a dyadic one, but people _assume._ Generalizations like that genuinely only work if you assume a “default” AGAB experience exists. It does not. It’s _erasure_ to call any particular AGAB experience universal.

Your perspective is addressed in my citations that I can tell you clearly did not look at. I’m against **generalizing experiences** to be universal, not speaking from a personal perspective.

Your experience will reflect pressures that YOUR society puts on your AGAB, your family, your class, your geographic location, as example. You cannot separate being AFAB from the other elements of your life and surroundings. The crap you experienced because of the expectations around you were affected by things that are not universal. That experience won’t be the same for me and you and others. That’s the point. 

EDIT: BTW I’m from a rural rural town in southern Appalachia. The closest place that does HRT is hundreds of dollars of gas away. I’ve experienced severe oppression on all of my own cross-sections. I’m **not** just speaking out of my ass just academically here when it comes to these things as someone who’s never experienced anything. I’ve experienced severe misogyny and transphobia and intersexism and exorsexism and so on. I don’t pretend _how_ I experienced those things are universal.

AGAB is most useful when discussing medical procedures… And even then you _have_ to specify if someone is proceeding with medical stuff like HRT. Do you know why this is important?

AGAB _usually_ decides how much adrenaline is put into your heart. **This is flat out dangerous.** The amounts of epinephrine do not change depending on size, it’s very dependent on how much estrogen/testosterone/progesterone and so on is in your system. If you are on HRT and now predominately use E, if they give you the “AMAB” dose of adrenaline it could do some damage. Likewise, if you take T and you get the “AFAB” dose it might not be enough. **Medical science didn’t account for that because they ASSUME AMAB and AFAB is much more clearly defined than it is.**

This is also why as an intersex person sometimes medications don’t work as expected on me. The assumptions flat out contribute to death, lmfao
I apologize, this has been a rough conversation and I need to step away and join a trans gaming group. Thank you for your apology and I wish you well.
>Why would people call it an AFAB experience when you could just call it misogyny or transphobia?

Maybe it's because I tend to look at speech acts rather than semantics, but I don't see what the difference *in effect* is between describing CAGAB and ""naming the beast."" Saying ""I'm CAMAB"" and ""I was a gay Eagle Scout"" both reveal the gender that was assigned to me in my teen years. The same is true if I talk about relationship abuse from that period, or how internalized homo/biphobia influenced multiple life choices. 

It was *my* assumed-male experience because I was living as an assumed-male person at the time (dropping ""at birth"" because that might be a hangup), and systems and institutions involved acted differently towards assumed-male and assumed-female persons. How do I ""name the beast"" of historical institutional discrimination and bias against LGBTQIA people without describing both those policies and my relationship to them? Which in turn, invites assumptions about my CAGAB?

And there's cases where the name, shape, and hair color of the beast is not anyone's business, invasive, and potentially retraumatizing. I reserve the right to be vague about sexual assaults I experienced living as an assumed-male person and will refer you to the body of research, journalism, and cultural studies regarding assumed-male survivors and rape denial. 

So honestly, it looks to me you are splitting hairs between two linguistic forms that are used the same way, say a lot of the same things about personal history, and not being used in the ways you are criticizing. I think there's more essentialism being brought into this discussion with the noun form of ""enby"" than there is with CAGAB.
I literally said in that comment _the sentence **before and after** what you quoted_ that I don’t get on people for verbiage.

Here is the full context, bolding new for emphasis, italics the part you took:

> EDIT: (**This gets into semantics which I won’t critique for in others, but personally my stance on how to talk about this is to name the beast.** *Why would people call it an AFAB experience when you could just call it misogyny or transphobia?* A lot of the time **(not ALL the time)** when people talk about it it’s not “an AFAB” thing. It’s misogyny. It’s not “an AMAB thing” it’s transmisogyny or toxic masculinity or whatever. Why not name what you’re experiencing instead of implying all AFAB or AMAB people experience your experience?

> This also clarifies speaking when say for example, a passing trans woman experiences misogyny instead of transmisogyny because people assume she’s a cis woman. That experience would be identical to what many people would call an AFAB experience. Therefore, to me it makes more sense to just say I’ve experienced misogyny.)

**What I do personally is not me thinking other people are stupid or wrong.** Your example is incompatible and not equivalent to the example I made. In conversation I try to assume people have a reason for things, but nuance is hard to come by. 

I’m not sure how to be more clear than I already am. The way you chose to take the comment out of a sandwich of disclaimers on either end is not ideal to having a conversation that’s genuine.

I also explicitly said [in response to your comment that you talking about that stuff is **not** doing what I’m critiquing.](https://www.reddit.com/r/NonBinary/comments/122imf4/im_sick_of_people_narrowing_down_nonbinary_people/jdsu7vs/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf&context=3)"	122imf4	NonBinary	1285	0.99	2023-03-26 10:56:18

Not familiar, but I'll look that up. I saw it on a list of gender neutral names somewhere and it's been kicking around in my head as really striking.
oh there’s a core band called make them suffer and on their album neverbloom, morrow is the main guy’s partner who left him

the whole album is very allegorical and i doubt morrow was a real person, but i still think the name and the story of the album are really cool. if you aren’t into heavy stuff you probably won’t like the album but you can read all the lyrics here: https://genius.com/Make-them-suffer-neverbloom-lyrics

✨My Gender Journey✨		"My mom told me that everything I do makes me look uglier but it’s literally just because we’re not sticking to traditional beauty standards and some people just don’t know how to handle that
Fifth slide: looking like an amazing enby!
Ouch! 

Well, I'm starting out at ""ugly boy"" so the only place I can go is up.
The meme was fun, but I glanced at your profile and you look like a really beautiful enby. I agree with u/galactictesticle (what an username! <3) about the traditional beauty standards we stop sticking to when we come out as NB (or, you know, sometimes even as lesbian).
I finally got the prosthetics to make my bodyshape more hourglass and look natural and then I'm like holy fuck I hate how I look even if I might pass lol

I give up. I'm just gonna throw on a dress with no prosthetics and keep my beard and do my makeup and call it a day/transition
either way, I'm sure you are a beautiful person.
Ouch. This one hurts 😅
This comic was my entire childhood lmao

I more think of it like we are a very rare type of bird that is trying to be attractive to a very rare specific type of person, and that very narrow slice of the population will find you gorgeous. 

I think one struggle that is universal is trying to find the right look that we resonate with and pull off. Does Jonathan van ness push my buttons? Nope. Does he slay that look? Hell yes.
Lol this was my experience when I tried a binder. I thought I’d look masc but instead I looked like someone with weirdly squished breasts.
Same here lmao
me too my friend 😔
People always tell me “you were so hot as a girl, now you’re ugly”. And it’s usually cishet dudes telling me this so it shouldn’t matter to me. But it makes me wanna go back sometimes.
I'm slowly transitioning to pretty boy from average boy. But I'm sure I'll hit ugly girl soon enough lol
Ugh same dude. I was looking through old pictures for a birthday present for my parents and I realized that I look way better as a girl. And the thing is that I think I would look okay as a guy too, but just not as this awkward, in-between thing that I am now. But also I don’t want to be a guy or a girl so I guess I’ll just be ugly lol
You don’t look like an ugly girl :) you’re very attractive honestly. I do get the pretty boy vibe from you so your effort is not in vain. Honestly don’t worry about what other people think. They’re uglier by default for saying mean things. Appearance isn’t everything and when it comes to standards in society, lots of people don’t even get it right either. Everything is so glorified when it comes to the right “female image”. People expect you to do so many unnecessary things and for what? Honestly what good comes from trying to stick to societal standards of beauty? If people just expressed themselves how they felt most comfortable without worrying about other peoples opinions, we’d have such an amazing world of fashion and culture. Your hair is awesome btw
There’s a beautiful  freedom in being (or becoming) ugly.
excuse me i would like to call you out on lying! i looked at your profile and all i saw was a very pretty person! 

i hope one day you may see the beauty in yourself, you're a really pretty enby:)
i’m afab but i grow a little bit of facial hair (think little baby rat stache, sideburns, and chin hair, like a 14 year old might have). after i realized i was nb i decided to stop shaving/plucking/doing anything with them. i’ve gotten a lot of people on the internet that try to make fun of me for it and each person i respond with “yeah that’s the point idiot”
Looking through your post history I see a person doing the hard and scary work of figuring out how they want to show up in the world. I can't understate how strong that makes you 🤗. 

I also promise you don't look nearly as bad as you might think 🖤. Stay curious about what presentation style(s) feel affirming and over time it should get easier to believe yourself (I'm on this same path, I know it's hard some days)
Ngl I struggle with thoughts like this
This is too relatable.
Same except ugly boy.
I start out an ugly girl. More on this story as it develops.
What does an ugly girl look like?
Beauty is subjective.
Fucking same.
Everyone just thinks I am a butch lesbian. I can't figure out contouring for the life of me. 

My hope is getting my hair on a masculine braiding schedule and keep wearing masks (My hair is so sh*tty it won't even stay in braids. I have breaks at every single length from scalp to waist, and half of my hairs aren't even long enough to fit into a traditional ponytail hair tie, so yeah, it needs to be a regular schedule because everything is just gonna keep falling out and dreading, otherwise.).

Sadly my body language, mannerisms, and way of speaking only seems to get girlier and girlier (Or at least more obviously girly when they come out) and I don't know anyone who can help me fix my walk.
I feel it haha. I’m sure you’re beautiful in your own way!
Gosh this is a feel. 
You look fantastic though and I'm sorry your brain is telling you awful things.
[is this not what an androgynous pretty boy looks like? i think you need glasses :(](https://www.reddit.com/r/toastme/comments/sh558n/im_starting_my_first_ever_salaried_job_tomorrow/)
I literally felt this meme in my SOUL
Personally I think you look like a very handsome enby 🤷🏻‍♀️
I did some checking on your profile and found an incredibly attractive person, definitely a pretty boy 😍
I was somehow able to progress from cute boy -> ugly boy -> ugly girl -> cute girl -> butch lesbian, and now my goal is: sometimes femboy, sometimes butch lesbian depending on how I feel. 

Gender stuff takes time and effort, but you'll get there as long as you keep working at it.
Haha awe
Oof same
Haha...ha... Same 😭😭😭
Lmaooo this hits
I don’t think I’m ugly but I think I just look like a punk rock girl to most folks when I’m trying to tow the line between genders… gotta get rid of these damned breastacles.



Also there are some days where I feel equally hyperfeminine and mask and what ends up happening is a skater skirt over top of a tank and pants (jeans or cargo) covered by a button up and sometimes a smudge of eyeshadow that probably makes me look like I’m on drugs, nothing matches and my socks are probably two different lengths, same with earrings and jewelry. It makes the icky feeling in my stomach go away but ends up looking like a 2001 fashion disaster but worse. I don’t usually go outside on days like this.
Same here, I try really hard to feel comfortable in my skin and express myself and my mom is like ""are you trying to be as ugly as possible?""
Agree, they should show it
Hey, me too! We can ascend together!
Same
Thank you for this, your comment honestly cheered me up a lot. I really appreciate you looking out for me. 💜
Ugh thank you for saying that. But that's just my face, the rest of me is a bit if a catastrophe.
You just gotta remind yourself that some people have a very narrow minded opinion on beauty. Also beauty doesn’t have to be the most valuable trait! We’re so much more than what we look like!
I try to shove my hairy legs and armpits in my mums face as often as possible. She. Is. Horrified. But she made them hairs just like she made me, damnit. My rationale is that someone has to break her of at least a few of the bullshit traditional beauty standards, otherwise she's going to go on thinking she's ugly just bc she's not a vogue model. Honestly, it's really hurtful to feel judged by her but if I think of it being for her own good (and mine) it gives me the motivation to present my body a little more how I want, rather than how society wants it to be. I've also had a friend or 2 mention that they feel inspired to be themselves when they see people present non traditionally and I think if I (we) can help people by just presenting how I (we) want, then it's gotta be worth it.
Yeah after cutting my hair my mom kept telling me to grow it out or to get it professionally cut. She tells me to quit ""labeling myself"" like that's the point mom.
I’m wishing you the best. I really struggled with what you’re describing in the OG meme & I still feel that way sometimes. You can take this with a grain of salt because everyone is different, but I think what ultimately made the biggest difference for me was recognizing how aesthetically attractive I found other nonbinary people & gender-nonconforming people. Appreciating other people’s bodies & style made it easier to appreciate mine. 

It took a long time to stop projecting my own internalized homo- & transphobia as a feeling of secondhand embarrassment (in response to somebody expressing themself in a way that went against implicit and explicit gender norms)….but with enough time, that melted away & I now find so many more people attractive. 

Like others have said, physical attractiveness is not the most important thing, but I understand valuing it. I know that I value it for myself. But now that I don’t *expect* attractiveness (including conventional gender presentation) from other people, it’s easier to be kinder to myself about my own appearance. 

I haven’t like, transcended societal expectations completely lol. Obviously societal expectations don’t just vanish overnight, and we’ll always be influenced by them by virtue of Living in a Society™, but it’s still worth allowing yourself the space & vulnerability it takes to unlearn painful patterns of belief. It may be a cliché, but you deserve to feel happy & at home in your own skin!

Asking people to guess your AGAB reinforces the idea that Non Binary = androgynous	"Please be advised this is my opinion and formed from my own experiences. I don't speak for everyone but I do speak for myself and I feel something needs to be said.


Being Non Binary doesn't equal androgyny in any way shape or form.


It's not a fun guessing game. It's not a competition of who can be the most ambiguous. 


All that does is reinforce the idea that the ""best"" non binary experience is the most androgynous. 


This is not true for everyone. If that's your way of experiencing your gender, cool. If confusing people on your AGAB validates you, okay. But spamming 'Guess my AGAB' is frustrating and invalidating for those who don't or can't experience it that way. 


Personally it makes me avoid this subreddit for the most part in favour of non image subreddits. 


Reinforcing the cis-expected ideal of being non binary through consumption of media is harmful.


Curvy, fat, hairy, bearded, buff, masc presenting, femme presenting, you are all wonderfully valid people in however you choose to be seen (or have to be seen if you are not comfortably out, we see you, you are loved and valid as you are). 


Googling non binary people brings up pages and pages of young, slim androgynous people who all can pass for whatever gender they feel like. That doesn't even come close to representing the rainbow kaleidoscope of people who are non binary and struggle every day because people expect them to 'look' a certain way when they don't. 


Look at me. Listen to me. You owe NO ONE androgyny.


You are wonderful as the magnificent human you are."	"Thankyou. I get really frustrated by this and similar sentiments. Same w people who describe their androgynous clothing choices as “enby” ..
Mhm, I've always had a problem with ""guess my AGAB"" on this subreddit, I've voiced my upset about it in different ways as well, ei. focusing the idea that non-binary people are either amab or afab and taking away from the fact that the non-binary identity is supposed to be a safe place from the binary.

Yes some non-binary identities include the binary but this is literally just ""do i look like a man or a woman"" 😐

tldr: it perpetuates the idea that people with penises or vaginas look a certain way
I always comment “non-binary!” And pretend I didn’t understand the question.

I agree. I actually don’t enjoy trying to investigate your AGAB—it’s dysphoric to have to assign gender to someone. I’ll gass up anyone who needs some validation—but don’t make me participate in gendering like that, youre missing the point here.
The current obsession with this kind of validation really worries me as well. I get wanting validation and wanting to share your gender euphoria, don't get me wrong! But there is better ways than ""guess my agab"". 

I have been completely silent on this sub so far and afraid to come out generally, cause I am deadly afraid of this ""gotta look androgynous enough to be enby"" mentality resurfacing. Even, if it isn't meant to reinforce these ideas... it's still happening and intent =/= impact.

As someone hyper femme in presentation and someone okay with their birth gender traits, personally I am worried of being pushed away and excluded by my own community. 

I do understand wanting to be validated for not looking like your agab, I get high off that too. But asking people to actively put you back into the binary just seems like it's defeating the whole purpose of being NB...
Thank you. These posts make me sad because my body looks incredibly AFAB, no matter how I style or dress myself, and I am constantly misgendered by people who KNOW I'm nonbinary. Asking people to guess their AGAB just pushes the stereotype that nonbinary equals androgyny, and not all of us want to or can achieve that. Nonbinary is not the way someone looks.
Thank you for this post! Those “guess my AGAB” posts drive me nuts. I’m currently pregnant so my AGAB is pretty easily evident, but that doesn’t make me any less nonbinary.
>Googling non binary people brings up pages and pages of young, slimandrogynous people who all can pass for whatever gender they feel like.

Omg, THIS. For real, that's the big reason why I feel invalid as an enby soemtimes. It REEKS of thin privilege and pretty privilege when it's unrealistic to expect every enby to look androgynous when it's just isn't possibly for a multitude of reasons.

Ofc, I'd like to present more masc/androgynous but without putting myself in harm's way. For me, I live and grew up in a very hetero-normative, East Asian oriented family and society. I'm very much expected to perform and physically present as my AGAB because of this. I can't exactly openly express my enby-ness without fear of being ostracized by my family. My family already had a pretty negative reaction when they saw me wearing a binder once.

It's straight-up safer for me to present as my AGAB. However, I resonate with the sentiment that every enby doesn't owe anyone androgyny no matter how they physically present themselves because people can have a lot of different reasons why they simply can't do so.
Yeah I agree. Its a really annoying trend and I think it is undermining a lot a nb people's experience
Yes! I've come close to leaving this subreddit and a few others a few times because while I understand the thought process, there have been days where my feed has just been a non-stop barrage of ""guess my AGAB!"" ""Do I pass as ___?"" ""Do I look masculine/feminine?""

I hold no hard feelings towards anyone who takes part in those trends, but they make me feel like...idk like I'm on the outside looking in on an exhibit on gender expectations rather than a member of a community (since I for various reasons will probably never appear androgenous as defined by most people, even if I wanted to)
Agreed, it's like passing for enbies. But the emphasis on passing is toxic as fuck, and all you're doing is shoving binary shit into enbies faces -_-
I think people really underestimate the diversity of appearances across AGABs, especially considering that plenty of nonbinary people can and do use hormones and surgery to change their appearance. As a result they don't realize that when they 'clock' someone's AGAB they're often going off stereotypes and 'vibes' that draw from bioessentialist and transphobic generalizations.

And honestly trans people are like the worst people to ask about AGABs, cis people IRL often just have a few visual/physical details they use to quickly assign gender and they don't pick up on all the little trans-related signifiers the way we do. If you ask this forum you're going to get a skewed response one way or the other.
I also don’t like seeing these “guess my AGAB!” posts, because to me it seems like someone compulsively posting, “Hurt my feelings! Trigger self-consciousness about my gendered traits please! This is digital self harm!!”

And I do not want to help them do that, or normalize those kinds of posts. Thanks for sharing your thoughts on this and getting a conversation going.
I was just thinking this this morning! Those posts get so tiring.
I see both sides. I think for those of us who desire androgyny it's a useful bit of feedback, because it may be desirable to hear that others can't tell what our AGAB is. I *wish* people couldn't tell I was AMAB right away, but sadly that's not going to happen any time soon.

At the same time, being non-binary isn't a singular ""door number three"" that leads to a singular presentation, identity, or experience. That's where I think a lot of the struggle comes for some of us... we're being treated like a homogeneous group when we aren't. Androgyny is one of many options beyond the binary, but it gets the lion's share of the discussion.
I agree 100% and it can be damaging if people don't tell you the response you're looking for
I'm starting to feel the same, I'm glad people find it validating but it's feeling like dividing people into girl nonbinary and boy nonbinary which is...not a nice feeling for me, even if I don't think people intend that. 

I really wish posts asking could be filtered.
i wish the selfie flair wasnt even an option honestly my feed is just spammed with it.
It feels like at some point too that it turned into a compliment fishing game. Mostly afab individuals asking everyone to guess their agab and the commenters fueling the fire with “omg so androgynous I can’t tell agab!!” Because that’s clearly what the OP is looking for.
True. It’s also transphobic. And yes trans people have internalized transphobia, everyone in our culture does to some extent.
I wish a rule could be added by mods to ban those sorts of posts.
“guess my AGAB” always feels like binary trans people asking “do i pass?” 

like okay, sure, fine, i get that you need validation, but **we need to break down why we feel like we have to force ourselves into boxes for the cis gaze** and asking if people know what your AGAB is not only reinforces what you said about nonbinary people being forced into androgyny but also that there is a “standard” for the typical chromosomal sex expressions. you dont have to pass, you dont have to be androgynous, you will be much happier dressing for YOU and not for validation.
Ya I wish there was a rule against them they do rub me the wrong way
Thank you! I strive for androgyny myself, because it smooths my dysphoria, not to make some kind of a statement. All non-binary folks have different ideas of what it means to them (beyond the barebones definition), to be non-binary and the great diversity of our community shows in the diversity of presentations. I think this should be encouraged!  I *don’t want* people to guess my AGAB; for me, that’s part of the point. But I have limitations to how far I can go with androgyny, and I frankly don’t want to feel I’m “doing it wrong”; so I will *never* ask anyone to guess my AGAB. I also feel like that undermines you anyway, if you *are* trying for androgyny. So please stop doing this.
it also really sucks for people who want to present in a neutral way but can't for whatever reason. i'm chubby + the way my fat is distributed gives away my AGAB in most cases, even thru clothing. I wish i could present neutral, being assumed to be the gender associated with my sex every time people look at me hurts + thin enby folk who never have to think about that just don't get it.
Thank you. As a fat person, the standard concept of ""androgyny"" is completely unachievable in any way for me, and it's very telling how that too has such a narrow acceptable standard that is, as always, a slim, able-bodied, conventionally attractive white person. 

I'm not willing to spend the next thirty years hating myself for being an enby that doesn't look like a ""real"" one of us any more than it was worth spending my first thirty hating myself for not looking enough like a woman.

And I'm DEFINITELY not about to let colonialism or antiSemitism pressure me into cutting my hair. Long hair isn't feminine in *any* culture from which I descend.
Personally, I only ask people I know irl if they can guess my agab, and only because I’m a transmasc enby so both “no clue” and “amab” are really euphoric for me. I WANT to be androgynous, and it helps to know what irl people close to me think. But yeah, I understand the frustration, and posts asking you to guess someone’s agab can be really frustrating because it feels like they’re asking you to do the very thing we’re working to fight against: putting people in birth assigned gender boxes by appearance/presentation. I don’t like guessing agab on those posts, it just feels *wrong*. Honestly I wish the trend would shift from “guess my agab” to “how do I look/do you think I seem masc or fem?” Because it makes it clear you’re asking for opinions on presentation and not for a gender box many of us are trying to avoid being put into.

Besides, answers to “how do I look?” often end up being so much more diverse, entertaining, and validating than just “guess my agab”. You’d be surprised how creative some people can be describing your aesthetic, and how euphoric it can feel. My brother once told me I had “ninja business eboy energy” and I have never received a more chaotically affirming compliment in my life.
See I do feel valid a lot of the time when I confuse people regarding my gender, but I also rage against expectations so I don’t want to only be seen as valid when presenting Very androgynously, I want to be comfortable in anything all the time and not feel like wearing a dress makes me more woman or wearing a suit makes me impostor or whatever mean crap my mind cooks up to stew in. 

Androgynous style is generally where I can find most comfort even on my super bad days, other times I can only feel comfortable in a T-shirt hoodie, jeans, skirt/tutu and two lengths of socks with a mismatched half face of makeup and possibly a hat or cat ears, I call this look “a hot mess” because it looks as strange as it feels. I’m still valid on those days even though they leave me feeling like garbage. 

I’m still valid when I feel like wearing a ball gown and a full face of makeup, I’m
Still valid when it’s a sweats and hoodie with a blanket cape days too. 

I don’t know if it’s healthy for many of us to have others take a guess at our appearance because what’s to be gained from that? Feeding the imposter syndrome or encouraging a specific style to validate non-binary genders thus creating a tertiary gender system instead? 

I don’t know for sure, I just want us all to be happy and healthy.
Some groups have a selfie day, so folks can avoid the group on that day if they don’t want to be spammed with it. Which could help since so many people insist on asking transphobic agab questions on their selfies. we could ask the mods to not allow questions like that and put it in the group rules. But Reddit mods tend to be super conservative and let a lot more questionable/problematic content through than I’ve seen on other platforms.
The AGAB bit does rub me the wrong way. But for some of us wanting to look androgynous is a goal because we are dysphoric, or we do get euphoria from it. I want to look totally unknowable. I love it when people just refuse to place me after trying and land on stuff like ""person"", ""parent"", etc. If I could look like an inhuman abomination beyond the concept of gender I would. I don't owe anyone androgyny but I owe myself the happiness of being a mindfuck.
Thank you for all of this :). Androgyny isn't available to everyone nor is it the goal and we don't need to make people think it is.
Yes! 🙌 I’m non-binary and while I’ve expressed my gender through androgyny in the past, I present much more feminine these days. It doesn’t make me any less non-binary, it makes me a hot non-binary individual in a skirt. 😜
The tendency for people to really struggle to understand that a term whose definition is rooted in a negation or exclusion doesn't imply any thing specifically brings me seemingly endless frustration. 

Like, ""non-binary"" implies that one is not, well, binary, so it excludes only two gender identities. How is the implication of that so hard to understand? It's like, basic set theory
I have only been here for a short time, and I myself am still looking for my own identity so I might be a bit out of the loop, but I'm seriously surprised about the fact that people are actually asking us to actively misgender them? Or try to put them into those very boxes we all are trying to escape? For me being non-binary is about the freedom to be just who I am, live without those binary gender norms. To be my gender regardless how I look. 

Asking other people guess your AGAB feels to me like a way to self-harm, and that makes me cautious. Why on earth is there, on this sub, this strong need to compare us to the binary genders? It also might be just that speaking about AGAB is seen more like just speaking about femininity or masculinity, but frankly I do not like that progression. AGAB holds much more than just an aesthetic. And to many of us that 'more' is hurtful experiences, and invalidation as ourselves. I personally don't see any reason AT ALL for other people to try and guess which binary gender was thrown upon me at birth. I really hope that people would just see me as non-binary, because my AGAB makes no difference to them. It's simply just not relevant to anyone with whom I'm not willing to share it.

I feel like I might get where this idea comes from: seeking validation by asking others to define yourself and looking for ways to make yourself look more androgynous. But I also feel like this is not the way nor the place for it. This sub is supposed to be a safe space for non-binary people, and in my opinion guessing other people's AGABs (even when asked) does not controbute to that. Instead, it creates a harmful narrative of 'being able to see someones AGAB just from looking at them', and it also increases the amount of attention that we direct to the way people look. 

I myself hope to look androgynous. That's an aesthetic I like. I know that this desire to look androgynous often intersections with being non-binary. But ultimately, that has nothing to do with my gender. Whatever I wear, however I have my hair or body hair (I don't know how to say this? In my first language these are two different words, sorry if this is a dumb way of saying this!), whatever is the shape of my body; I'm still non-binary. And this is why I feel sad that here, on this safe space of being non-binary, the emphasis we put on looks is so big. I'm by no means confident or sure of myself most of the time, so these 'guess my AGAB' posts are often triggering as they steer my attention back to my AGAB and the way that I look when I'm not prepared.
I think I can see both sides here. I understand why asking someone to guess one's AGAB might be upsetting and/or problematic, but a lot of people want to pass as androgynous and that's probably their way of checking if others see them that way. Yeah, I know there are better ways, I don't wanna defend anyone here.
No, being non-binary doesn't need to equal looking androgynous. But I don't see anything wrong with *wanting* to look androgynous when you're non-binary. But you're right, there are better ways than asking others to guess your AGAB.
I personally don't feel comfortable being gendered and I want to look as androgynous as possible. Someone once told me they can't tell what my AGAB is and I've never felt so euphoric before. Looking androgynous is the only way I can feel comfortable about myself, and whenever someone tells me that I don't need to be androgynous to be non-binary, I feel upset. Because, like, yeah, I don't need to be, but I *want* to.
NB pop culture can be summed up to exactly that; super slim, white, androgynous people. That's all you see. It makes me feel so invalid as someone who is just coming to terms with their non-binary-ness. I won't look like that, and a lot of the time I don't care to, so people won't see me for me. 

""Guess my AGAB"" feels kind of icky for lack of a better term. I'm glad that they have achieved the presentation that they want but like... 🙃🙃🙃
Hmm. I see this happen most often with binary people who are seeking validation of their gender but, in doing so, normalize binary gender presentations as the default. Many of these folks seem to be earlier in their transitions and the commenters assume based on feminine or masculine presentation how their transition is happening and validate them based on that. It ends up erasing many folks who either aren't able to or aren't interested in performing traditional masculinities and femininities. 

I'm... less bothered by it in nonbinary spaces. Because nonbinary identities are so diverse, there are many of us that are leaning towards masculinity or femininity, but also many more of us who are leaning towards both or neither. There are, of course, GNC binary trans folks, but I kind of got the impression they aren't the people asking these questions in the main trans subs anyway.

In our case, while it ties into often alienating and harmful ideas about AGAB, it makes more sense and feels less frustrating to see it in nonbinary subs. I genuinely have no clue what presentation people are going for, as even overt femininity or masculinity doesn't often relate to AGAB. It feels like it's more likely to be a combo of folks trying to get validation about how their presentation is working *and/or* their body features. I also can't say I've noticed this specifically being something androgynous nonbinary people are doing more than anyone else here, but I might be missing something.

That being said, I am an androgynous-presenting nonbinary person who has done this before, and it seems like regardless of my thoughts it hurts people here, so I appreciate the call-in to the folks here who do this and I know I will not do so in the future.
I was going to post about this today too. I'm trying to escape from a gender binary, so posts which are like ""yeah but guess what gender we were born as"" are super confusing to me, it shouldn't matter???
While I personally like the androgynous look, I completely agree. Non-binary comes in so many different forms it's not fair to expect looking androgynous, or hot, or slim, or young... I want to see different forms of expression, I want ALL people to post their pics and feel valid, because they are. 

A non-binary ""look"" or ""canon"" shouldn't exist, and people shouldn't feel the need to compare their own expression to others.
>Curvy, fat, hairy, bearded, buff, masc presenting, femme presenting, you are all wonderfully valid people in however you choose to be seen (or have to be seen if you are not comfortably out, we see you, you are loved and valid as you are).  
>  
>Googling non binary people brings up pages and pages of young, slim androgynous people who all can pass for whatever gender they feel like. That doesn't even come close to representing the rainbow kaleidoscope of people who are non binary and struggle every day because people expect them to 'look' a certain way when they don't.

This space, as with many NB/gender queer spaces, are really, really good for my gender dysphoria. And really, really, REALLY bad for my everything-else dysphoria. So thank you for saying this. It struck very close to home for me.
i don't want people to guess my AGAB, but i feel compulsed to say what it is anyway
Yeah. I know I don't want to be androgynous most days.  I usually just don't interact with those posts cus I know for a lot of people it is people seeking validation and I don't wanna upset anyone by being potentially too honest. It's usually a bunch of young people who seem to be wanting support from the community
YES thank u. I spent a lot of time and energy upset that no matter what i did i could never look androgynous… it really impacted my self esteem and confidence and still does tbh but i intentionally put less time and energy into worrying about it - androgyny cant happen for everyone and thats ok. the type of androgynous people that get all the love are usually thin and white anyway
I've noticed a strange obsession with agab from a lot of non-binary communities online. I think there's points where it's worth discussing your agab and how it relates to your identity, or how it affects your public perception, but the vast majority of the time it's unnecessary and it feels very gross. I understand that people trying to get others to guess is just so they can guage how androgynous they are, but in my opinion it's really not good to put so much focus on agab in non-binary communities.
Thank you so much :] I struggle to pass like nearly everyday and this made me rlly happy tysm <3
This needed to be said! *hats off*
Fr. Sometimes ill look for clothes that are labeled/presented as ""masc"" or ""femme"" but thats not to say that ""masc/femme"" clothes MUST go on ""masc/femme"" people bc like,,,,, thats not how nb works. I kinda flip flop between a more masc or femme mindset, and i like to reflect my thoughts and feelings in my clothes,

Tldr: imo that^ is v different than asking people to misgender you based on how you look as an nb. It doesnt make sense to me.
Thank you
It also feels horrible to ""investigate"" someone in that way. I don't want to subconsciously or consciously be focusing on someone's AGAB. It feels like saying ""regardless of your gender or lack thereof, you are really A or B"". I don't know these people. I don't know their journey or their dysphoria. I don't want to inadvertently contribute to it.
the main thing stopping me from accepting that i was nonbinary was my love for my long hair and tiddies. But then i realized i could have all those things and still be nonbinary. 

thats The Experience for me
I'm really surprised those posts are still allowed
Do we have a mod team here? Can we ask that one of the rules of this subreddit be “no asking what people think your assigned gender at birth is?” 

It would also be nice if we didn’t have daily “name me” posts, but I know that’s a losing battle. Maybe just one day a week where people can ask for name suggestions.
What non-image NB subreddits do you normally go to, cause I have similar issues as you wit hthis one
I mostly just worry it’s closer to self-harm than affirmation
I mostly agree, although I also see the benefit to people who find those things validating for themselves getting that kind of feedback. It's a very individual thing, I guess, and what is validating, affirming and euphoric for one person can (unintentionally) reinforce those harmful and potentially invalidating-to-some ideas for others. But I do stay away from those posts because it asks people to look at someone from a perspective of ""Hmm, what typical male or female traits do they have?"" which...makes me feel gross lol. For the reasons you said, essentially.
These posts have not been  sitting right with me either, thanks for articulating this so well. 

I’m sick to death of people making assumptions about my gender based on my body so seeing a bunch of folks line up to do just that to someone else is distressing
I love this post.
Thank you, I needed to hear this. I just want to be myself.
I agree 100%. Those posts bug me so much
Thank you for saying this. I'm not sure if someone has suggested it already, but it'd be nice if there was a subreddit specifically for those posts. To my knowledge, there's a subreddit where binary trans people post their pictures to see if they pass or not. I don't know if it's non-binary friendly or not, but perhaps people can post there to see if they pass as androgynous or gender neutral or not.
A friend of mine and I were actually discussing this earlier, and I said this:

“You shouldn’t have to pass, no, but passing as your gender changes the way people perceive you—and that’s what I want. The perception without question. I want society to look at me and actually see me.”

That said, maybe this is what others are going for? “Would society see me as my gender?” Not really understanding that for us…. That’s not always a possibility. How are others supposed to see that? 

Idk, I’m just noodles in a trenchcoat
I only reference my AGAB if I’m talking about something that requires it for context. Telling people to guess your AGAB is weird, IMO. It’s basically telling people to guess your genitals.
I'm 6'5."" Thanks for this post.
Your experience is valid, though there are people who find empowerment in being ambiguous and have historically done this. I'm not butch but it's apparently been a set of values in their community for a time that and while we're fighting our fight to dismantle what we see as harmful expectations, we should be careful not to trample upon others' struggles.
THANK YOU oh my god these posts make me so uncomfortable. Why are we normalizing guessing people's AGABS. Plus when I look like someone whose AGAB gets guessed correctly, I feel shitty about how I look.
I can see both sides of the issue, tbh. On one hand, it may seem counterproductive, but on the other hand, it may help someone move their representation in the direction they want it to go. For example, say there’s an AMAB nonbinary person that feels incredibly dysphoric being addressed as he/him and being called sir. If they post a picture and ask if they pass as female, and people say no, they can take steps to adjust their appearance so they feel more comfortable in their own skin.
This is just my take, and I understand not everyone may agree or even respect it.
Yeah.. it's especially hurtful for people who will never ""LOOK"" androgynous because our bodies tend towards looking ""binary"" for lack of a better term. I keep thinking that I should do things to appear more androgynous but fuck it. I'm not hyperfemme or hypermasc or anything I'm just me and my clothing choice has nothing to do with how I identify.. mostly just what looks right on my body type.
I feel the same way tbh. I sometimes doubt whether or not I'm nb like, am I some faker or poser just wanting to be special? I look cis and all I ever see are androgynous nb people being represented. I understand there's no right or wrong way to experience gender, but it's also really hard not to fall into the trap of ""if I don't look androgynous enough then I'm not truly nb"" because of how prevalent nb = androgyny is.
Thanks, i think I really needed that today :,)
<3
Well this androgynous non-binary feels pretty excluded in general and not necessarily by this post. Where the hell do I even belong?
I’ve been struggling with this recently. I’m not sure if my desires to change my appearance are to reflect how I actually want to look or to appease other people’s idea of “non-binary” so I don’t confuse them when I tell them I am. Especially as a curvier AFAB, who still presents “femme” most of the sometimes
boy infighting sure is fun :(
Thanks, I really needed to hear this today. 

As someone who was AFAB and has the enormous rack to prove it, dressing to look androgynous just isn't an option. Even if I wear men's clothes, I never look anything but ""female"". Most days if I'm out in public, I end up wearing dresses because they hide more of my body.

I've been struggling with my identity a lot since I started questioning it, and reading this has definitely made me feel like less of a fraud. Thank you.
Agree with all of this and the comments add on additional thoughts I agree with, but I also feel like it's transphobic to binary people. ""Guess my AGAB"" instead of ""what binary gender to I look closer to"" feels kinda icky bc it implies what genitals you were born with reflects your appearance today and subtly implies trans people do not pass and all (cis-)passing people are cis.

Plus any emphasis on ""passing"" in general is cringe. If you want to pass, if you want to be stealth (or as best as nonbinary people can be stealth), that's a fine and valid goal. But it's also the dominant narrative online and drowns out all other perspectives and gives people the idea that that is more valid that others (which then leads to truscums) so while those experiences are valid, it's important to lift up others moreso.
I feel like it reinforces more than that though... Like it just reinforces gender guessing and clocking people. I don't really like it and that's MY OPINION.

But again I wouldn't want to be clocked or perceived as anything. By anyone! Not even fellow nonbinary people. I dress however I want and hope they respect it. I can say what my AGAB is but like only if I trust their cool and safe.

Like its not as dangerous here because no one can actually physically hurt you here but someone fucked up can come along and troll on you and harass you about this stuff.

Idk maybe I'm over thinking this but I was raised when we didn't make games out of our real identities (not that they aren't fun just that we preferred to be safe). Again I'm also from the time we threw shit at peoples heads at conventions (i always thought it was stupid but im also a pussy and wouldn't like that happening to me) and stuff so like I know if I'm overstepping I can happily sit my ass down.

AGAIN my opinions, my concerns.
Chest feeding parent that goes by she/they pronouns and mom and presents mostly fem and I’m non binary
Hey, so this is something I just contributed too and I have thoughts.

First off, I'm sorry for how doing so might have affected you. I hadn't heard anyone complaining about this before, and haven't seen many posts of that type. So this is the first I've seen of this being a problem. But that doesn't mean it isn't one.

But it's worth noting that in my case, what you are talking about completely misses the point of why I did it. I know I don't owe anyone androgyny and I know that that's a harmful stereotype. Usually I actually present high femme. But today I had a rare day where I feel comfortable toning it down.

I've been on HRT for 5 months, and I want to know how much of a difference it is making. Judging that from the inside is unreliable because dysphoria, and asking people who know my agab or can figure it out based on context risks bias. But if I use a photo from one of my most androgynous days there are no context or presentation clues. People only have my body to go on. I'm not looking for people to think I'm super androgynous, I want them to say I'm one way or another because it will tell me something about where my transition is at.

The point is that you are making a specific judgement about what people are doing and why, but you and I have no idea how many people have the reasons you assume, how many have reasons like mine, and how many have other reasons entirely.
I was 100% thinking this last night as I was scrolling this sub
But some people want to look androgynous. Some people are more fem, others are more masc, and some people are androgynous. 

Asking what people think your AGAB is can help a lot, because if someone says one thing and you want another, you can ask why and possibly change that. 

Or get validation that you look the way you look. 

Some people don’t like it, that’s fine, don’t respond and keep scrolling, but there are a lot of non-binary people who want to look andro, regardless of what other people think. 

For example, I don’t wanna be seen as a girl or a boy. Either makes me cringe. So hearing why people assume I’m a boy or a girl can help me identify things I could alter to look more andro. 

If’s not for everyone, but we can’t invalidate some people just because others don’t feel that same way. Non-binary is a spectrum. 

This should be a safe space for everyone, no matter your AGAB. However, you saying ‘not everyone wants to or can experience it this way’ is making it a less safe space for people who do want this, because you’re basically saying that if you want to be andro you can’t because ‘it’s a stereotype’. 

There are people here who menstruate, they should be able to freely ask questions about that, or there are people who want to know how breast growth will be on E. Not everyone wants or can do anything with these questions. Not everything will apply to everyone. That’s always been the case, and it will always be the case. 

I get what you mean, it’s a LOT of these posts, but some people WANT to be andro. I am not a boy, and I am not a girl, and I don’t wanna be seen as either. Both give me extreme dysphoria, and you are basically saying I’m not valid, because you are saying that it’s a cis-expected ideal and it’s harmful. But it’s not. It’s not because of what anyone else thinks, it’s because of what _I_ think, it’s because of what _I_ feel. 

We don’t owe anyone androgyny, that’s right, but you are saying that as if we’re not allowed to either want it or be it. I want to be andro, that’s how I feel inside, so I wanna look that way on the outside. Yes I am valid if I look masc or femme, I get that, but that’s not what I want. 

If you don’t like these posts just keep scrolling and ignore them, they are not for you, just like posts about menstraul problems or boobs on E is not for everyone either. You won’t be able to relate to everything and that’s okay, but saying ‘you are valid the way you are’ but then in the same breath saying that ‘being androgynous is harmful and invalidating’ is cutting out every non-binary person who feels that way. Not everyone wants it, not everyone who wants it can have it, and that’s okay. Some people are poor and can’t buy a certain thing. Does that also mean people can’t post about getting xyz then too?

Besides, a lot of people want to look the opposite or their AGAB and so they wanna see if people perceive them that way yet, so it isn’t even about androgyny a lot of the time
I understand the frustration with this, and I mean no disrespect, but I'll offer a counterpoint: a lot of us ARE aiming for androgyny. At least for me, I find it hard to know how other people perceive me, and my goal IS for people to not know my AGAB just by looking at me. I'm not sure how you would suggest I go about figuring out if I meet my goal, as a lot of my close friends and family also find it difficult to give feedback, given that they have known me as my AGAB for 20+ years.
Lot of enby folks do prefer to look androgynous, though. So being read as ambiguous encourages them.
What about this? I ask for feedback from people to guess my gender because I'm curious how androgynous I really look. I keep discussions of my actual gender out of that conversation.
Obviously the sentiment here is right and I ignore those posts too, but most people are asking that because they want to pass.

Like why are we blaming people for being dysphoric and not society as a whole for shoving us into binary boxes and only *maybe* accepting Nonbinary people as they are if they're the right kind of androgynous? It feels very victim blamey
A lot of people seem to not understand that NB ≠ trans as well.
My opinion is that it is too complicated.   I am a guy who enjoys dressing up and being a girl at times.  If I sat here and tried to find the exact name for it I would drive myself crazy with the psychoanalysis. 

I also find that if I do not express the same opinion as others I get jumped on as a conservative nut so I do avoid the conversation most of the time.  I'm just enjoying being me and could care less about the title other people think fits me.
wow, you just spoke from my soul. thank you.
This is great. I'm never going to be slim, willowy or 20 again :( So those pictures don't help much when looking for advice etc.
Agreed. Clothes don't have gender, it's fabric. 


I wish these posts were barred from here. There's literally an androgynous subreddit, they don't need to bring that horrible guessing game to a place where AGAB is not relevant or desired.
It honestly feels like an extension of the “boy enby or girl enby” question and it’s so frustrating and invalidating sometimes. Fuck my agab, let me be me.
Almost everyone's agab is the same to me - an accident of nature. And almost everyone's gender and presentstion is also the same to me - a willful construction of beauty. So that's what I usually comment. 


And it all annoys me because this sub should be at least aware of the existence of binary trans people and the fact that judging a person's agab by appearance is pretty impossible.
i told someone ""idc about what genitals the doctor stared at and labeled, I just wanna know how you did your eyeshadow.""

I agree... It's dysphoric. It makes me uncomfortable even misgendering my gf for her own safety. (we live in a great neighborhood for white cishet families but a bad neighborhood for well... us. I hate it here.)

If you need validation. You need validation.

If you want people to guess you're assigned gender then STAY that assignment./sarc

No but seriously we're trying to stop this gender hunting behavior why do anyone want to participate in it?!
Oh wow, I hear you. That’s been my experience with this sub too - my birth gender traits are very obvious and there’s not a whole lot I can do about it, and generally speaking that’s perfectly fine with me! I genuinely still get euphoria from looking like my birth gender sometimes, or from certain birth gender traits if not others. But going through this sub and having that notion of nonbinary=androgynous hammered into my head over and over is honestly really depressing, because I will never look androgynous “enough.” My body just doesn’t work like that. I love celebrating others in their euphoria and validation, but I wish people on this sub would share their gender euphoria in a way that doesn’t invite and reinforce invalidation of mine and so many others.
Fun fact: you look very nonbinary! I do not know what you look like but you are nonbinary so the way that you look is very nonbinary 😁
I always feel too understated to be believed as nonbinary by online community standards. I don't have piercings or cool dyed hair, I don't dress cutesy or gothic or punk, I don't own fishnets or cat ears (no shade, I love those things! I'm just in my 30s...and tired...and I don't want people to look at me. Ever). I wear tshirts and jeans, or sometimes leggings if I'm not feeling hard pants. I am zero percent androgynous and don't try to be. I wear makeup for funsies, but it's usually boring. I'm also afab and have extremely long hair that I will never cut cause it's culturally important to me (plus in my culture long hair =/= feminine. But try telling that to western gendered beauty standards!)

I'm like the enby equivalent of a plain bagel.
Reminds me of the “non-binary check” audio with the beach bunny song that was popular on TikTok a few years back.

As if there were a “right” way to look NB.
Yeah it took me years to realize I didn’t want to achieve androgyny bc of the stereotype. Even after I was well into my social transition. I kind of didn’t think anyone performed/expressed gender in the way I was interested in, and it would be considered weird of me to do that. 

(Funny story but it was a podcast that made me realize what exactly I wanted out of my transition and gender expression! It just suddenly clicked in my head that I’m allowed to do that and it’s totally not weird. If I hadn’t found that podcast I’d still be trying to look androgynous and be stressed about it)
There is no way for a body to “look AFAB,” AFAB is a term to describe someone’s assignment at birth. People who were AFAB have all different bodies, hormones, even genitals. Sorry don’t mean to sound rude I just feel like people using this term so much like that perpetuates that term as describing cis bodies that were afab, ignoring that afab does not indicate what a body can look like years from birth.
This is WatchMojo dot com's top 10 most nonbinary pregnant people:

Number 1: this person 😁
The internet thinks nonbinary people are supposed to look like elves from D&D
The thin privilege is so real!!! It's so invalidating.
It's a large part of why I largely stay away from most non-binary specific subreddits. I feel super uncomfortable with this trend of androgyny == non-binary, and putting such emphasis on the value/existence of AGABs. It makes me feel excluded from the non-binary community
There’s less transphobic ways of asking for validation. Like “felt androgynous in this outfit what do you think?”
YEP! THIS! I feel like they are literally asking to get hurt if they don't get the right answer and people on this sub just HAND IT TO THEM SOMETIMES?!

Its dangerous. Its really dangerous
I get wanting to get feedback, and it's completely valid. However, there are other subreddits where people can get a AGAB guess fit check, spaces where it's not going to cause harm because that is the *purpose* of those spaces. 


 You are right in that the androgynous ideal takes up the most space, and that's something I would love to see change.
Androgyny recognizes a binary.
I think this could possibly be accounted to r/trans closing image submissions, so people are flocking to different subreddits to get their praise. (Which is valid, but only when done respectfully to the subreddit they're on)

EDIT: As I posted this, image submissions seem to be open again on r/trans :)
>mostly afab

I agree with the sentiment here—but I genuinely hate when people with vaginas are targeted to be the problem. This phenomenon is true across all sexual organs. Let’s not single out vaginas.
I haven't internalized transphobia...  there are a lot of us that haven't.
It’s transphobic and notice they are mostly younger white thin people.
This!! It sucks too cuz I actually started to like my body (curves and all) but right around the same time I realized I was non-binary, and I worry people will only see my AGAB not what I actually am
(You being general)
r/NonBinaryTalk is one I frequent!
I love this answer.
Then that is a question for subs like /r/trans or /r/transpassingsafe or /r/MtF or probably a bunch more subs that I don't know of that are meant for those exact types of questions.
As a curvier AFAB I’ve been struggling with this recently. I present femme most of the time (bc that’s what looks best on my body) and I’m scared I won’t be seen as my gender (or lack thereof lmao)
I really really feel this. Sh*ts hard :\ trying to not fall into that trap all the time
There are multiple other subreddits where you can get valuable, validating feedback on what you want to pass as. I don't feel like a space that is specifically aimed at outside the binary is appropriate for a binary/androgynous fit check. 


This is supposed to be a space where we can cast off the binary and the cis expectations and celebrate each other as the people we are inside. 


I don't feel that you are seeing the harm that you are helping perpetuate by participating in that in this space.
You could just ask if you look androgynous, masculine, or feminine without mentioning AGAB. The guessing posts come off as showing off or compliment fishing for skinny white AFAB people who pass as androgynous.
No harm meant here, but if you’re concerned with your presentation (which is perfectly valid), then why post on a sub that deals with identity? That seems appropriate for an androgyny sub.
My concern is that generally people confound androgynous presentation with non binary identity. Both are valid, but they are separate issues.
But what does passing even mean in a nb context
This isn't criticism of people who are feeling dysphoric. 

and how exactly do you 'pass' as nb? THAT ideology is what is being criticized in this post. We don't owe anyone androgyny and perpetuating the idea that you have to 'look nb' is very harmful.
About clothes and gender, I was at Goodwill today to buy clothes (mostly for my kids, but I bought a few things for myself). Anyway, even though the adult clothing is gender separated, they are no longer doing that with the children’s clothing! Not a huge deal, but it’s progress.
Yes and like if you’re doing it to see if you practiced a technique/style the way you wanted it to come off then just be like “hey how did I do with [insert style choice]? How can I improve for [goal]?” 

This could be for clothes, makeup, posture, etc… like make it a learning opportunity for tips and tricks rather than a guessing game, get some tutorials in the comments or something rather than just a bunch of dysphoria for the OP and the commenters.  
I got no problems giving someone tips on color coordination, how to do eyeliner, or tying a tie type of stuff or even something like set the shoulders to look more confident. 
Stuff like that I think would be more helpful to people than guessing.
Me too. Are jeans and tshirts gendered? No. But people see my secondary sex characteristics and assume I’m a woman in a man uniform.
Aww thank you ❤️
They aren’t? Damn I just wasted two days getting these silicone ears just right.
Way too many fucking elf ears on enby subreddits. I don't get it. I cast magic missile at the enby
Exactly! It's so infuriating omg

I feel like it's more difficult to pass as androgynous when you're not stick thin but you see thin privelege everywhere including here sadly and it's hard to escape it
Yeah discussing agab feels very binary ya know
this is tempting me to create a “no passing” sub or something along those lines for trans people who truly want to just vibe and not worry about passing or androgyny or AGAB presentation or anything like that
I think the best way to solve this problem is with a convenient list/masterpost for all these subreddits and make it easy to share that link underneath then! Do you have a full list?
I'm in complete agreement with you there.

I will say that I do think there is a spectrum of ""non-binaryness"", and I'm not sure what proportion of that crowd is androgynous or seeks to be. That is the main point of discussion and imagery that I see tied to being non-binary, and I'd be curious to know how proportional the visibility is to the share of the NB community that are androgynous. Presumably my experience isn't representative of the overall community, but so far I've personally only met one person (my partner, interestingly enough) who isn't androgynous and doesn't want to be. I know that other types of NB folks exist, but I've only ever encountered them online.
I use ""androgynous"" and ""gender neutral"" interchangeably, but perhaps that's at times reductionist or problematic
Can we not conflate AGABs and genitals.
Glancing at your post history, heavily disagree with this assertion.
That's mostly my problem too. People want to avoid talking about race and class, but all these folks idolize white ideals of androgyny without taking into account that different cultures have different ideas of what is considered feminine or masculine, thus different ideas of what androgyny might look like for them. 

Gender is also a function of time. Pink was considered masculine pre WW2 and high heels were invented for white male aristocracy. Those ideas have shifted dramatically over time. 

It also feels like their idea of gender is directly tied to capitalism rather than a sense of how they move through the world. Their gender now feels like it's just a costume performance to irritate or ""confuse"" others, rather than a sense of moving through the world as their true selves. Your sense of self should be independent of how others view you.
the loudest ones are white, thin, AFAB, and yeah, younger, but they are the loud *minority,* i think saying “mostly” erases a lot of AMAB nby people and nby BIPOC. its not that its *most* its that the rest of the community isnt being amplified
I would argue that's more a problem of the type of atmosphere and userbase the subreddit (and Reddit in general) has cultivated, instead of blaming or generalising transphobia by race or other demographic.
Very true.

Thank you for the positivity.\^\^
I think it’s fine to ask how to present in a certain way. But asking people to guess AGAB is kinda bragging for people that want to be unclockable, and no fun for anyone if it’s obvious. If we exclude any discussion of appearance we end up creating an environment that says this is the right way to be non-binary in another way.
I’m not sure that this is a universal experience, but sometimes I feel it can be difficult interacting with other trans people (especially in a trans community). It’s the idea of homosexual vs bisexual, as in one is more valid than the other. It’s obviously not true, but it’s a fear that at least I have. r/NonBinary is a safe haven for nonbinary folks, but those other places could not be
As someone else suggested, you could link a master post to those subreddits so people know where else to go. Currently, if I wanted to ask such a question, I wouldn’t know where else to do it.
It’s the way people are asking for validation that is problematic. Non-binary identities are diverse, what’s the point of trying to push people into binary trans spaces? Some of the responses feel like people trying to push their idea of what “real” non-binary is
Well I don't feel like you read my comment.
That's fair. I don't usually mention AGAB either, just asking for people to guess what I'm going for, if that makes sense. 

I'm just a self-conscious, somewhat overweight white AMAB transfem enby that doesn't want to tip the presentation scale towards ""male"" at all even when presenting androgynously 😅
I thought I was keeping them separate? I definitely don't conflate the two; I've never actually asked for feedback about my appearance on this sub (or any other non-binary sub)
It's different for everyone, but most people are either shooting for androgyny or at least strangers being unable to tell at first glance. Which is why so many people are asking if strangers can tell.
We don't owe anyone androgyny. No, and I didn't say anything that made it sound like I thought we did.

But the people asking the questions op is criticizing obviously *want* to look androgynous.

Telling trans people who want to pass that they have nothing to pass as isn't exactly helping anything.
Hey, that's awesome!
Lol
I am a simp for magic missile. Fun fun spell mmmmh
That and even accessing gender affirming surgery is significantly more difficult or outright impossible for lots of fat people 

Many doctors have BMI limits and it’s bullshit
It’s transphobic! If y’all know of a non-binary subreddit where it isn’t allowed plz let me know.
That would be absolutely rad and based on the response to this post I'm sure plenty of people would join
r/NonBinaryTalk was created a while back specifically to host discussion without selfies or memes.
In my own circles, there is noticeable overlap for genderfluid/flux and GNC folk and being neurodivergent, especially autistic. 

Androgyny is more rarely someone's identity than it is the language used to balk binary presumptions. You can represent a lot of kinds of people by trying to not represent A Man or A Woman.
I didn’t realize that my choice of words would have that impact, and I sincerely  apologize.

As a non-binary person AFAB and with the current climate on regulating uteruses— I was trying to explain that singling out one assigned gender over the other was not right to do. Especially if they have bodies that are being targeted and historically are more targeted/have less rights. It makes me feel singled out as problematic simply for being AFAB. 

If you have suggestion as how I can say this better, I’m absolutely open. Thank you for saying something ♥️
Well, all that me and lots of other people in this post are saying is that these types of posts make us feel very _not_ safe in this sub. And for the record, the other subs I linked are safe subreddits for non-binary folk.

What I think you fear is transmeds/truscum, which I can tell you are not welcome in the overwhelming majority of trans subs. I know that non-binary people are welcome in the majority of them, because I often feel more comfortable in them than in this sub.
Yeah I feel you, I get very dysphoric about most of my masculine features. You should be able to ask other non-binary people about your appearance without it being a big deal. The format is just kinda annoying, and pushes the you need to be androgynous to be valid idea, and focuses on AGAB too.
Ok, I misunderstood that you post that in the non binary sub. My apologies for the misunderstanding. Thank you for posting them in the appropriate places, though. I’m always glad to see these issues being kept separate, even though we all have to admit they do intersect frequently.
I'm not sure most ppl are shooting for androgyny though and it's that assumption that makes it problematic
r/NonBinaryTalk is a discussion-only sub, no memes or selfies.
someone else in the sub said there are other nonbinary-specific subreddits that ill have to check out, i also have no idea how to run a subreddit

(…though i guess id be on par with most reddit mods in that respect)
im okay with selfies, im okay with memes, i think a sub with just discussion would be incredibly boring and not conducive to a happier community because theres no goofy aspect if that makes sense
If you're going to apologise insincerely, I'm not going to want to respond sincerely. But for now I'll give you the benefit of the doubt that 'insincerely' was a typo.

Your problem came from picking out the phrase ""AFAB"" and responding to that phrase with a specific genital term as if the two were perfect synonyms when they are two separate things.
I mean, the point of said posts isn’t to invalidate you or anyone else, it’s to make someone feel more comfortable
Agreed.
Oh they do for sure. I remember coming out to my mom a few years ago and explaining that (at the time) I wanted to present more fem and she said ""if you were actually non-binary you'd want to he androgynous"" as if she knew anything about non-cis gender identities. It affected me so poorly though that I didn't even know what I was. Thought I was a trans woman for a while but that doesn't quite fit all the time. 

I do my best to avoid conflating androgyny with being non-binary :)
I'm going off my experience of seeing people who say they're trying to pass. Most people who are trying to pass are going for something like that. I didn't say most Nonbinary people in general.
Thank you!

Even if I truly do appreciate the andro look *in others,* it is not what I am aiming for, nor what I want to have to scroll through constantly, especially not the ones that are just pure thirst.

I know that the best way to describe myself is agenderfluid and that for me, this is based on how I feel, and not so much how I present or wish to be perceived (though hot dang do I love it when others affirm my gender and address me with anything that's not my AGAB) but I still feel like the NB community is also part of my own. And again, I've nothing against andro, and I similarly feel like andro belongs with NB, but all I wanted from here was discussion, not constantly ""Guess my AGAB"".
I’m sorry my apology came off as insincere. I thought explaining my thoughts would help you understand my intentions. It was unsuccessful!

Listen, until you just commented that, I have actually always conflated these two things. I’m not justifying it, just explaining I haven’t ever had anyone correct me before this moment. I assumed someone has a vagina because they are afab. But you’re right to correct me. Thank you, and for giving me an explanation even when it didn’t feel like it was coming from a good place.

I stand with the sentiment that we shouldn’t generalize afabs or amab. Saying “afabs do this or Amabs do that” but you’re right to correct the way I said it. I will work on this, and the assumptions I made. I just needed someone to tell me. 

If you think it’s appropriate I’m happy to delete my comments and rephrase. Also happy to keep our discourse.

Thanks. ♥️

Edit:

I see my typo! I fixed it. I’m so sorry, that came off SO rude with the typo.
I mean to help with this people get assigned a gender and dont even really have the ""assignment genital"" for that gender. Intersex people can be trans and enby too and they get a lot of shit.

If that helps you visually see why AFAB wouldn't just be a vagina. I have a friend who has a ""cloaca"" but like he got assigned AFAB for some reason? Idk. Biology is never as basic as people try to make it and it only makes things more confusing.

This might not help but if your brain runs on ""medical reasoning"" like mine then it may help but sorry if it doesn't. Medical reasoning would only go so far tbh
This is good context for me to have and to think about this differently next time. Thank you. I was projecting my own experience being AFAB and having a vagina. This was a good reminder not to do that. I appreciate your additional help understanding
Nah nah its okay! ❤️ I totally understand. This month and year and... well lets say that this time on earth has not been very good to anyone AFAB. Especially not these two weeks. It's kinda rough and raw and I get it. I do.

We're gonna make it out of this okay? One way or another.

My college assignment is gendered :(		"Yikes... it would be more reasonable to give everyone the option of choosing which thesis they wanted to write on, or maybe assigned by last name? A-H gets thesis 1, I-P thesis 2, etc.
Dude, what is with this making the ""females"" write pro-feminist topics but making the ""males"" write anti-feminist topics? This teacher really wants to reinforce in men that women's oppression is just their perception and isn't real >.>

I would go higher up to fight this assignment, especially if the school has a code about inclusion. There is just so much that is wrong with this assignment
If you have an LGBTQ friendly university, the office of the ombuds may be able to help. Not sure about where you go, but where I went to school they were heavily invested in advocating for students. I can see that the instructor was attempting inclusivity by saying it’s your “gender identity” rather than just saying “sex” or “gender”, but this feels rather hamfisted and I question the necessity of bringing gender into the equation at all—splitting groups based on name + birth month would have worked just as well without making anyone uncomfortable.
Damn sucks to be a man or a woman, they have to do thesis assignments!
It's not only gendered, it's heteronormative. You can either try to discuss your point with the teacher or you can choose a sex that's not the one assigned to you at birth and encourage everyone in your class to do the same. The point of the assignment is being able to argue what love is or what is not with supportive statements and everyone should be able to do that.
I once (2009 or so) had a college interviewer ask me (then female-presenting) what a Disney Princess I would be and I said Mulan and asked if she also asked the boys the same thing. She said she asked them what superhero they would be. I said Nightcrawler and crossed that school right off my list.
""According to your own gender identity"" and then proceeds to be weirdly heteronormative. Lol
I don't for one minute condone it, but I wonder if the creator of the assignment believed there would be better empathy if females wrote about the challenge from a female point of view and likewise for males 

It's incredibly outdated and non-inclusive to do something like this ☹️
Pretty sure this is straight up a Title IX violation even if you ignore the existence of trans people
I could see where the instructor was coming from if and only if they were instructing the men in the class specifically to empathize with and write from the perspective of the narrator, who is a woman. It's incredibly easy and reductive to tell the men in the class to find reasons to argue that the narrator's husband is actually doing what's best, or that there's a literal supernatural explanation. This is just a poorly-designed assignment all around, and forcing a gender divide is the icing on the cake. If you're gojng to enforce a gender binary in the reading of a text (which you shouldn't) it ought to at least be with the goal of teaching people to interrogate the text from a different perspective than what their unconscious bias might direct them towards.
That is the most bizzare assignment i’ve ever seen…
As a college professor, what — and I cannot stress this enough — the fuck
Guess that means you get a freebie for the assignment?

In all seriousness, that's absolutely not cool. At a minimum they should apologize, let you pick which one you're completing, and change the assignment for the future.
What a weird way to assign things out anyways? Just let students pick one of the four! Plus it seems super sexist hoe those prompts are split regardless
This is so stupid. Why not just split the class into 4 groups and give each group a thesis statement? What's the point of dividing people by gender and birthdays????
Low key the way they split it up is kinda sexist too because why do the girls have to write about oppression but the boys don’t
Why TF not split it up into 4 different birth dates instead of gender?
Can you email your professor and ask them if you can do the assignment differently? Like having the option to choose any question you want to work on.
There are better ways to divide the class into four parts.
I’m a college professor (15 years in) and this honestly the dumbest structure I’ve ever seen for an assignment this prof needs to take a fucking workshop on Transparent Instructional Design and Assessment like fucking asap 

Also this probably why I never talk to any of my colleagues lollllll
I love literature. I love analysis and criticism and interpretation. If I got this assignment, I would tell the teacher to shove it up their ass. It being gendered is absolutely horrible, no doubt, but it's also a terrible assignment because it forces interpretations of the story, some intentionally wrong, into students that may be unsure what to take from it. It's like making someone write a paper about how the mob in Shirley Jackson's ""The Lottery"" were correct to do that they did; it entirely goes against the point of the story.




And yeah, because I was AMAB and don't try to not look masculine, the teacher would expect me to do one of the ""male"" topics, which I wouldn't be able to do because I have a functional brain and know that those interpretations are bullshit. I get trying to teach critical thinking and seeing other perspectives, but would anyone try to get students to argue FOR the men in A Handmaid's Tale?



I'm sure the teacher thinks they're being inclusive by saying ""according to your gender identity,"" but they clearly don't understand that much about different identities. Or the point of the story. Good luck, OP. This class might be tough.
What class is this? Being assigned a thesis statement at all is weird to me, even if the point is to make you look at the writing in a specific way. Your teacher's writing is also... rough. 

The unnecessary gendering is definitely a rotten cherry on top, I'm sorry you're dealing with this and hope you can safely navigate the situation and conversation with the teach! There are many other ways to make four groups, I'd just split into groups of three months each, irrespective of gender(/sex, which the specific wording they used seems to indicate and kinda icks me).

Edit: Just realized they did say 'gender identity,' so B for effort haha! It was the Male/Female wording that triggered my last response.
Oh boy, I feel this. I'm taking a language class and while practicing a conversation as a class, my professor was like ""women read for Mary and men read for Takeshi"" and I was just frozen 😂😭
I guess that means I dont have to do the assignment. There’s no thesis on here for me.
Assign everyone you perceive as boys the role of defending the patriarchy, gaslighting the protagonist, and making up some ghost stories to avoid respecting a woman.  Yeah, great idea, fearless leader 🫡 And should the boys also write a list of punishments they'll use when assaulting their wives some day? Only when the females try to escape, of course!

What a shit professor.  What's the lesson here??

""Symbolism is when everyone's wacky ideas are equal, no matter how sexist, and stories like the Yellow Wallpaper are full of 10-12 clues about why feminists are wrong and Steven King's Rose Red was the real oppressor the whole time!"" 🤡
...even outside nonbinarism I'd be asking professor why the prompts are gender segregated.

Also, in general, assigning theses is bad teachering. Should be grounds for professional repremanding.
Honestly I would look at your university's policy on lgbt issues and consider reporting it if you bring it up with the professor and they don't change it/even acknowledge it. (Or just report them upfront if you're uncomfortable talking directly to them about it, which is what I would probably do. Definitely the option that will make you look like more of the ""bad guy"" possibly but hey.)
If they wanted four thesis choices why didn’t they just split it in groups of three months?
Alright. Alternative selection.. no matter which gender. If you were born in January-June you can choose from either: 

>John is not genuinely interested in helping his wife get well; he truly loves and cares for her, and thinks he is doing what's is best for her, against better judgement.

>The yellow wallpaper represents the oppression the narrator is under from her husband--the space they live in is, in fact, sinister with a bad history, and the narrative is in danger of the male-dominated world in which she lives.

And if you were born in july-december

>John truly loves and cares for her. His intention is to control every aspect of his wife's existence in order to maintain his own position of power under the belief that he is trying his best to help his wife get well.

>The house and the room represents sinister spaces with baf histories, the narrator I'd under oppression from her her husband who had been possesses with the male-dominated world in which he lives. They are both in danger from metaphorical figures outside and behind the wallpaper which possessed the husband psychologically.

Really mess with them and then when they ask, say ""well i don't fit into the ""male"" or ""female"" category specifically so I made the prompts reflect my gender identity by mish-mashing them."" And then send along the other three prompts for their use on future assignments and say ""you're welcome.
Oh lucky you! You don't have a paper to write :)
This screams title 9 violation
Okay wtf “according to your GENDER IDENTITY” and then goes to list FEMALES and MALES. 
Do they even know how language works? 
I have had forms to fill that ask for my sex and it kind of irks me but at least they ask for my SEX.
Yikes. It's not just about the gender options here, it's also which genders have been assigned which viewpoints
Email time!

Hello, professor. Seeing as I don’t fit into any of the given categories, it is evident to me that you must want to give me an automatic A for this assignment. I appreciate this generous offer and accept. Unless the language on the given assignment document changes, you will not be receiving an assignment from me, as I will be accepting the A. Thank you very much. 

That’s what I would do ngl
welp i guess you don’t have an assignment to do 🤷 if they’re assigning based on binary genders they’ve assigned you nothing 😎
You should directly ask the prof (via email) what you should do.

Always via email, always get it in writing
That sucks, friend. I am in school right now and I’ve just started politely emailing the professor and asking what nonbinary students should do when stuff like this comes up. I usually get an overly apologetic response and an updated assignment. I live in a liberal area though, so YMMV.
Ewww this is so cis- and hetero-normative. Wtf
Welp, I'm neither male or female. Guess I get to skip this assignment.
That is dumb, also if they wanted to break it into quarters they could go off of birth seasons, or random lots, or literally anything else
Why the fuck are they referring to, on paper students as males and females anyways??
Ew. Why Tf is this necessary. NGL I would refuse to do it and talk to the dean about it but that’s me.
Legit, my lifelong indignation with bullshit like this should have been a very early sign that I was non-binary.
I don’t like how this is laid out. The females have to pick one side (that homie isn’t at all interested in helping his wife, and being toxic for lack of better words, and the males are to pick the other in which he’s the “good guy” and actively loves and wants to help. I just don’t like that, and it gives me ick vibes. 
Also, if you’re ballsy enough, I’d tell the teacher my gender identity is none, but I’m also very sassy and petty. But honestly, I’d have a conversation with them at least, because that’s not entirely fair for you to be forced to pick one.
i guess that means you don't have to do work then
They could have just done the first letter of first and last names and gotten the same number of options.
That's unfortunate
Be cheeky and write from the perspective of someone (or something) else but follow the required points to the assignment for both the gender options.

Write from the perspective of a house plant or something explaining the issues objectively. Sometimes professors appreciate creativity in their assignments. And you can use that to say “hey my gender wasn’t included so I fixed it for you.”
This seems to be intentional transphobia from my perspective. It instructed students to do the assignment based on their “gender identity” but then immediately referred to terms easily recognizable with biological *sex*. What class is this for??
Not only that, they're telling girls to take the perspective that the man is manipulative and telling the guys to argue that he's good intentioned... breeding attitudes of suspecting others and being self righteous rather than trying to understand how other people may have good intentions or how we might be in the wrong... idk just feels a bit off to me.
Say fucking what... That assignment is COMPLETELY fucked up.
FUCKING BULLSHIT. Also I vote since they gendered it on husband vs wife that nonbinarys are now the strange wallpaper that is driving the wife mad.
So your comments show it’s Comp 2, and for writing for “the humanities”…

Choose a section, (I’d personally choose the “sinister spaces” avoid sex/gendered issues)

Write your chosen thesis statement at the top..

Then explain why you chose this thesis statement (in my mentioned choice it would be because it’s the only non gender based viewpoint)

Then do the assignment.

Also….wait to turn in till last minute, see if you can get a response that actually helps you fulfill the assignment.

And a final bit of fun, here’s a story…comp two…had to write about my “weekend waste”…mainly food and trash based…

So I made a roast chicken for Friday, chicken soup Saturday, and ate leftovers Sunday….a few bits of plastic bagging for the chicken and veggies, and some degradable trash…that was my paper…

I got “talked to” by that teacher because “most people can’t eat that little”…I was on food stamps at the time, and I never eat much because of swallowing issues….I just shrugged and said “I did the assignment”….I got a passing grade on it…

Write a decent paper, that YOU can feel proud of, AND that feels like it fulfills the teacher’s expectations….if you get singled out for it go to the administration and file an issue.
Sounds like you gets to choose whichever argument you prefer 😎 and if the teacher gets angry see who can make a bigger deal out this obviously sexist/transphobic assignment.
You could try reaching out to the EDI department.
They could probably do something about it , or maybe emailing the teacher? Good luck!
This giving me huge “She uses they/them pronouns” vibes. They tried to sound inclusive, but then missed the mark completely.
Not only is this ew but I read the prompts and they specifically gave only ""female"" students the ones that go deeper into the underlying message of gender roles and oppression and they gave the ""male"" students the ""everything the dude does is justified even though he treats her like a child because he *loves* her"" and ""it's not her husband's neglect and oppressive behavior that made her lose herself, it's the evil house even though the house was very clearly a metaphor"" bullshit readings. Not only it it cisnormative and forcibly reinforces binary thinking, but it specifically reinforces sexism by intentionally discouraging young men from thinking about sexism and it's effects and different ways of showing. All round gross.
It also looks sexist AF.  Women have to write about resenting their husbands and men have to write about their experience as Doctors?  What the fuck?
I hate that story so them adding some weird binary and hetero rules to the thesis is some double level bs
lmao, no instructions for enby folks means no work for them

sit back and chillax lmao
Tell the professor that the instructions were unclear, so you burned it
Flex on the professor by writing two papers. (not a serious suggestion because holy crap)
I guess you don't have to do the assignment! 😬
Guess you don't have to do it then :D
This is actually disgusting in general wtf
Boooooo!
I FUCKING FEEL THAT! I know it’s not necessarily the same… but every damn job app I’ve put in only provides male or female.. like it’s 2023… GET WITH IT
The horses name was Friday
🤢
powermove: dont do it
*FEEEEEEMALES*

That's something to report, yes?
yikes. I'm sure they could've just split the birth month into 1/4ths or just assigned them randomly.
Looks like you don't have to do the assignment then
Do the opposite of your agab to spite the professor
You don't need to do the assignment ig
Dude I HATE IT when when things are pointlessly gendered. Like seriously. Something else that pisses me off is boys versus girls. Or anything that differentiates girls from boys. I mean, there’s a small difference but nothing much, and there’s no point in changing things due to gender. Especially when you’re nonbinary or something else. Like what tf am I supposed to do? Split myself between the two groups??
There is also a bad rapresentation of men. All in one basically ahah
Just pick whichever you like best I guess. But I hate shit like that, just let people choose their own thesis instead of ""oh btw you were born a month premature from July? Fuck you, male post-July is your assignment""
How is this legal?
That's a really weird way to assign school work
Noooo :(
this professor sounds sexist or something.
This seems so needless why not split it up based on birthday and split the year into quarters
Non-binary people don’t have to complete this assignment.
YIIIIIKES. I’m a college prof and this would never occur to me. Why doesn’t the prof just split it ALL by birthday? Or by last name? 

If you have the spoons for it, consider giving this to your school’s EO (Equal Opportunity) officer. LMK if I can help you figure out who that is or what to say or anything.
If you have the time, you could do all of them just to prove a point to your teacher/prof and then end the assignment with an explanation that not every person identifies as male or female. I’m such a try hard though, I know that solution might not work for everyone
Well that's obnoxiously unnecessary and intrusive.
Looks to me like you’re excused from the assignment. Automatic pass.
this made me remember why i dropped out of school 😅
OOF. If they weren't gonna add more than male or female, they should have done it by sex assigned at birth. Whatadumbass teacher.
[deleted]
[deleted]
I guess you’ll have to do them all lol
In addition to the shitty gender stuff, assigning someone a specific topic to write about is how you get way more students to hate academic writing. I’ve always found that picking a topic I was genuinely interested in to be the best. Seems to be a bad teacher all the way around.
It would take a while, but do both and turn them in and if the teacher asks why there are two just say a random word or nothing.
Ewww this is such garbage.
Say you can not do the assignment because you're neither.
Guess that means you can get both the male and female option then
Is this like when someone finds an item without a price tag and says “I guess it’s free!” You just get to skip this assignment, I guess.
Looks stupid anyway!!
Every time I have to pick male or female on some form, I just sigh and pick the closest thing to what I’m feeling that day. But being forced into a gender based on someone else’s expectations would really piss me off. Sorry you have to deal with that OP.
This shouldn't be allowed. Is there someone you can report this to?
Yikes
This makes me sick…
🤮🤮
is it only me who understands why its okay to do this and also why its not okay.
Ew
wtf they do this in college too? middle school shit fr
Fight the power
What was the reason? I mean... just WHY?
That is such a bizarre way to assign prompts to someone. Assuming you’re in the US, is this a community college? It looks like something an adjunct would do.
Just ask where is my assignment
If that were my class, at this point honestly I'd just pick a completely different angle / lense through which to analyse it, and go absolutely ham on making it legit and meaningful. Come up with something that fills the assessment criteria that isn't either of the shitty binary options lol. I did this a few times for my creative writing degree, naturally not all of my teachers liked that whatsoever (and admittedly I failed one class because of it lol but that dude was an asshat). But some of them thought it was snarky but well done 😆 and I got great marks

However as someone else mentioned it's awful that the split is such that some of the ""males"" (ugh) are literally arguing pro abuser stance but ok. The person who designed this assessment sounds like they would literally be the last person to give a fuck about this ...

Edit: yikes I just noticed too it says ""According to your gender ***identity*** ..."" and then completely leaves out other identities lmao ok
Yay, I have no thesis 🥳
I would politely point it out to your professor and explain to them how it made you feel. They may just be unaware, which is not an excuse. However, it provides a great opportunity to make them understand.
I'm guessing the plan is to pair up people who were assigned contrasting theses.  But you could also do this randomly or by last name or even by birth month alone.
Or hell just organize it by the four seasons of which you were born, much easier to work with
There are 1000x more sensible ways to divide the class into 4 groups. I’d be disappointed but not surprised to see this in elementary school but college???? Also deeply weird how it’s set up so that the men and women get different assignments- and how the “female” prompts both are about how it’s a feminist text while the “male” prompt is how the doctor/husband are in the right or the house is to blame(?). Idk the vibes are off
You know I thought about this too and almost said ""they should have it swapped"" and then I decided it actually wouldn't be better to make female students defend John's medical abuse and decided that actually. It's a terrible prompt either way.
I immediately thought this too, it seems geared towards reinforcing any biases students are already likely to approach the text with. Just a poor way of assigning topics all around.
I don't think any of the theses are particularly anti-feminist (and I actually think the fourth one takes the narrator the most seriously, accepting her experience at its face value), but I do agree shoving all the analysis of symbolism for oppression onto the women in the class is bizarre and... shitty, for lack of a better word. 

The ""male"" topics are also a lot more superficial, analytically. I hope it's just a case of thoughtlessness or legitimate ignorance, but they kind of get off much easier.
Yup, i'd go higher up!
My thought, too. I got such a weird feeling when the first statement for males was in defence of a man that is supposedly supposed to be dangerous or toxic. My only guess as to why it was divided that way was to make sure all of the statements were used?? It’s still way over complicated. 

OP, do none of them lol. Or flex on them and do one from ‘female’ and one from ‘male’
If there's not an ombudsman office, Student Life should also be able to help mediate issues between students and the academic side of the institution
Reach out to the EDI department of the school. They are usually helpful. I work in higher ed and when going through the university website looking for something, I found very gendered suggestions for students on how to dress for an interview. I sent it over to the EDI department of the university and it was fixed pretty quickly.

ETA: Your university should have an EDI department as most accreditation boards are now requiring the university and the individual colleges and/or schools to have an EDI department. They are pretty much required now no matter what.
More genuinely, I'm finding it hard to believe that the way this assignment is structured is doing a good job of teaching about the book. 

If this book is meant to have multiple interpretations, to me, that can suggest that the subversive material is being obscured, at least in part, intentionally to give plausible doubt to the people who the work can influence, so that they may defend it from the people who would suppress it. To put it bluntly, those people don't exist anymore. It seems.. crude? Ineffective? To separate modern students by gender in an attempt to recreate divisions that were naturally formed in the unique cultural climate that this book was written in, doesn't seem like a good basis to analyze how a contemporary man or woman would have read this book.

Why not explicitly structure the assignment to say ""I want this section of students to find evidence to support X argument. Given that evidence, I want you to research the cultural climate of the section of society that gave way to this interpretation on the book, contemporary men and women, and analyze how their life experiences might have influenced them to take X argument."" Any modern student, regardless of gender, could complete every one of those prompts in this hypothetical structure. I'd take it up with a gender studies professor, in or out your institution, and see what they think.
I giggled. 😆

It's like the thought that non-binary people aren't bound by laws in some countries because the wording is always ""he/she"" ... 🤭
Yeah I emailed my teacher about the possibility of me getting a non gendered option for a thesis so I will see what happens \_o_/
Perfect.
And why would they assume they'd all want to be a superhero?? Are supervillains not cooler?
Brilliant responses from you tbh 👏🏻
Even if it was a matter of empathy it should've been the opposite: let men do the anti-patriarchy and the female POV thesis, and the women the male POV. (I agree with you, I just double disagree with the professor)
Oh it definitely is.
title IX?
Legit. Given that it's significantly less challenging for the average cis man to lean into the whole toxic-masculinity-abuse-bias lense as opposed to literally anything else kinda makes it seem like this assessment was designed to academically favour at least that 25% of the class tbh
I like your thinking. I was like: Time to work twice as much as the other students ^^. I guess it depends how OP sees their gender
I get a feeling this teacher wouldn’t have made this gendered unless they wanted someone to challenge them on it, but maybe they just weren’t thinking.
Putting an additional mental burden on the ""females"" who now have to confront their own experiences with oppression to support the thesis, while the ""males"" aren't required to do any extra work addressing internalized experiences with gender.
For real. Like the year is very nicely divisible by 4 ffs...
I did email my professor about doing a different thesis, but they are out of office for a few weeks right now so I don’t know if I will get a response
By months, for example lmao... JAn-Mar, Apr-Jun, Jul-Sep, Oct-Dec.... I mean this is not rocket science.
> it forces interpretations of the story, some intentionally wrong, into students that __may be unsure what to take from it__

This is *such* an important point.

The students are not doing this assignment for giggles; they're doing it because it's part of the *learning.* What are they *learning* from this assessment?

When a person is actively taking instruction for a skill they do not yet possess, they are very easily *positioned* based on the instructor's actions, expectations, and biases. This is especially true in a high-pressure institution like a school where students have to learn *right* and learn *fast* or else they fail – which can have lifelong financial, social, and/or career consequences for some, on top of the regular emotional & social trauma – so they're more likely to hit the ground running with whatever they can grasp and hope that'll be enough.

It's one thing when you're heavily experienced in critical analysis, as you fundamentally understand that there are multiple different conclusions to reach and all of them have unique merit that is separate to one's own personal opinions and biases. But when you're literally still learning how to analyse and write about a piece critically, a polarising assessment like this is more likely to *position* students to accept a singular interpretation as ""correct"" and learn interpretation bias going forward ... *especially* given how polarising abusive men vs. silenced women is as a political topic and how traumatic the class is going to be after this. I hope there is *zero* in-class comparison of perspective because it's going to end up with the men insisting they're right and the women being (re-)traumatised tbqh

That was a bit of a rant sorry lol

I miss when the point of studying was to actually *learn,* rather than to rush through hoops at breakneck speeds to prove you're slightly less incapable of doing a shitty entry level job than the next schmuck with the hope that one day you'll be able to buy food without doing a job that makes you want to die inside
I saw you already emailed the professor, OP, but if they're willing to take any specific suggestions, I'd recommend allowing students to form their own theses based off a choice of leading question. 

For example: 

Please choose one of the following questions to answer as the thesis of your paper. There is no wrong answer to these questions; feel free to go with whichever fits your own opinion, or the opposite of what you believe for a challenge!

Does John (the narrator's husband) care for the narrator and legitimately try to help her, or does he have no intention of helping and is only exerting and expanding his control over her life? Please provide and analyze 10-12 pieces of evidence to support your thesis.

Are the figures that the narrator witnesses outside and within the wallpaper purely symbolic (if so, what are they symbols for?), or are they real entities that she ultimately finds herself possessed by? Please provide and analyze 10-12 pieces of evidence to support your thesis.
The class is composition two, we are learning how the write for the humanities.
Depending on genderfluxity I'd either read none or both 😆
Lol if I was braver
Title 9?
I have had to fill out such forms, and as an intersex person, binary forms get old fast.
If I were in school now, I'd absolutely be doing this. I didn't know I was non-binary at the time I went through uni but I had a few of these and it is very clear to me these days why I hated them ... lol egg moments

(also nice username 🥚🐺)
It's completely fucked up.
It’s for comp II
I agree with your point.
Genius lmao
Ya at my job I left it blank lol
Thanks, I need this
May not be, especially considering the gendered nature of the different writing prompts.
I was going to try and get into contact with someone at the school, but my mom (who I live with) got mad at me.  She said I haven’t given the professor enough time to fix it herself. I emailed her yesterday morning, but haven’t gotten a response. Wich I was expecting because she is currently on sick leave, and will be out for another week. We are supposed to finish this wile she is gone.
The instructions specify ""gender identity"" in the instructions, but then lists sexes under the prompts. From what was written, I don't think we can assume that this professor knows how to distinguish between sex and gender. The content of the assignment is about gender and it's repercussions, so I think it would be giving this prof way too much faith to say that splitting a group of people based on sex for a gendered topic wasn't meant to conflate the two.
I'm interested in hearing what might possibly make this okay
Oklahoma
I’m sure it’s just a coincidence the men were all asked to identify with the abusive husband and construct arguments in his favor!
Last name, birth month, favorite color, astrology sign, draw a slip of paper, roll a dice, literally so many different ways they could have chosen to do!
Gender is a terrible thing to pick for this considering it's rarely a 50/50 split when it comes to college classes. Most classes lean heavily toward one or the other. Biochemistry and ochem were the only classes I took where the split was about even.
I don't think academics should make you argue only for points you agree with, but instead teach you the different ways one may interpret any piece of media, so I don't think having both sensible and completely insensitive interpretations of a story as an assignment is bad in and of itself. But then going ahead and assigning these interpretations based on gendered viewpoints so that everyone gets the one they are more likely to agree with is just dumb.
But isn’t this about The Yellow Wallpaper story? A story in which a man imprisons his wife within a yellow bland room because of ‘hysteria’ until she actually goes crazy and starts hearing voices? In the end she has a full mental break. 

Having the guys write a thesis about how a man has the right to imprison his mental distressed wife seems very anti-feminist.
I would argue that it's very much anti-feminist to ignore the overt commentary on gender that The Yellow Wallpaper is making and instead read it as a literal haunting. That reading strips away all of the context of the story, which is rooted in Charlotte Perkins Gilman's experience being treated much the same as the narrator was (which did not, to my knowledge, involve ghosts) and finding it utterly soul-crushing. Ignoring the gendered aspects misinterprets and defangs a very pointed feminist piece.

And IMO the other thesis given for men is even worse- the closest you can get to a non-awful interpretation is that John means well even as he's hurting her, but that's still abuse apologia, because it's focusing on the allegedly good intentions of an abuser instead of the harm their actions cause. This is especially offensive considering that it's excusing away the trauma the author actually experienced.

Also tone doesn't always come through well in text, so I just wanna say that I'm not trying to rip you a new one or say you're an antifeminist or anything like that. I'm upset with the shitty assignment and the awful theses it gives, not with you.
There were certainly contemporary women who took the side that the woman was being genuinely cared for. It's hard to notice water when you're a fish. There were certainly contemporary men who took the side that the woman was being oppressed. Men might be collectively motivated to maintain their privileges, but it's always up to the individual whether or not to take it. 

What benefit would the modern student take from taking the book out of it's historical context and substituting an echo of the modern student's position within gendered society, across an artificial line that wasn't held the reception that this book was originally received in?
Please update!
Go the chaotic route: Your thesis is about how the husband and society are trying to force the wife into a heteronormative life in which she feels her role as ""wife"" and gender as ""female"" does not align with who she actually is. Thus showcasing the fact that by the teacher insisting on using binary gendered language to assign the thesis topics they took are forcing a narrative upon you that does not fit, thus becoming the husband in the short story.

Side note, I've always loved The Yellow Wallpaper for exactly the fact that there are so many ways to interpret the story without ever being explicitly right or wrong.

Edit: grammar
This. Men don’t need help sympathizing with John.
I agree I was doublely disappointed that male was assigned sympathy of the male protagonist. If the goal is to challenge preconceptions about the world, this assignment is not doing that.

For OPs sake I hope not 😬
$5 he gives the best grade to whoever makes suffering under sexism sound the most glamorous and pretty and hot
The four seasons!

12 months!

52 weeks!
You probably may, you never know. But it sucks that the assignment is based on birth month. Like it would make more sense if it was first initial or last name initial type of thing that you could decide.
Discrimination based on gender
I’m a professor myself. I would recommend that for the credit, you do the assignment, picking whichever gender you think fits you best on the day you’re doing it, or whichever gender’s prompt you like best at the time, or else flipping a coin since they’re all shitty prompts. As for reporting, you could wait until you talked to the prof after her return.
idk how to say it without getting cussed out or called transphobic. i can see both perspectives, both reasons why the other is wrong or why they are right. 

i dont need people to tell me why its wrong, i know why its wrong, i just understand that people always think its not a big deal. ive already accepted that people arent going to change, ive already accepted that people arent going to empathise with the lgbtq community. or maybe they simply cant empathise, they dont know that its a big deal. they always say ""suck it up"" because they think its fine. now i want to say that the truth is, its not a big deal, but i know i cant, and i know that it isnt for some people.

its a way to make groupings more fun and interesting,  i realise that, and it works considering how boring school work is. 

i realise now i may or may not have phrased my first comment wrong, what i mean is that i believe it is wrong, but i understand from their perspective on why its okay.
Yeah where the fuck was the critical thinking in designing this assignment? does it not make more sense to have the men think about why the husband is being patriarchal and controlling and to have the women look at why the husband might think he’s trying to help even if they appear uncaring?
Not only that, but the author wrote something called ""Why I Wrote the Yellow Wallpaper"" and she confirmed that it was about being treated badly by male mental health professionals. The fucking author herself confirmed that the main character is the victim and John was a POS.
(Not relevant to OP at all but) I am heartened somewhat that it's the sciences that are evenly split 😊
Thesis Defense and Interperetation Lessons Should Not Be Mixed.

There is a difference between ""Here is an assigned thesis defend it no matter how fucked up it is"" and something like ""Here's an interperetation try and dissect how someone would come to think it and then discuss how defensible you find it.""
This assignment actually surprised me most because of its limited interpretations of the story. I always thought of it as more nuanced than all of these - it's about more than power to John. It's about the societal expectation that a man be able to care for his wife in a way that makes her well, especially being a doctor himself. He actually thinks he is protecting her from herself and ruining his reputation by keeping her in there under the guise of love. It's more complicated in the sense that John is acting on society's expectations at the time for the best way to provide care, which turned out to be damaging for mental health - seclusion and ""bedrest"" for depression is the opposite of helping. It not only addresses feminism but also the medical model of Healthcare. Beautiful stuff. Really loved reading it in college and discussing it. This assignment reeks of misogyny and a lack of understanding that we exist.
Just adding here…

https://www.nlm.nih.gov/exhibition/theliteratureofprescription/exhibitionAssets/digitalDocs/The-Yellow-Wall-Paper.pdf

In case anyone was interested.

I also assume it’s THIS story that the assignment is about…

This site is a free version of the story where I am, hopefully also free for all….
That is the story and the plot, yes. I think we're interpreting the prompts fairly differently though, the one about John caring for the narrator and being well-meaning says nothing about having a 'right' to imprison his wife; I interpreted it as having the potential to be an analysis of intent vs impact, and is more of a character assessment than anything.

I don't disagree that having the men of the class write in defense of a man who clearly abused his wife is tasteless and potentially harmful, but John's motives are a valid topic to write on, and the prompt doesn't imply his actions were justified at all-- that's an entirely different thesis.
Yeah, the guy in this shitty thesis assignment must be related to Mr. Rochester from Jane Eyre?🫣
I guess I was reading too far past the prompts' face-values, haha. I thought a literal reading could be an interesting twist, and figured the class had likely already gone over the actual intentions of the story and commentary that Gilman was making, so I saw the prompt not so much ignoring what The Yellow Wallpaper says as a fiction, but playing with what it would mean as a real journal, as it was written in-universe by the character of the narrator... if that makes any sense. But that completely ignores that in-universe the narrator is experiencing hallucinations and the implications that come with that.

I agree completely about the prompt about John, I was thinking too much about what **I'd** write if given this assignment, and I would've taken the impact vs intent approach with a focus on impact, but ignored that the prompt does not set a student up for that, and definitely frames the feelings of an abuser as the focal point.

I appreciate your thoughts!! It sucks a little to realize my interpretation was naive, but that's not your fault and I took no offense from reading your perspective. I appreciate the clarification of tone as well and want to echo it haha!
The idea that there wasn't conservative women or progressive men, would be very reductive.
Minor update I still haven’t received a response
Okay but I actually love this angle for analysis.
Noted, thank you.
>what i mean is that i believe it is wrong, but i understand from their perspective on why its okay.

Okay that makes more sense for sure. Yeah it's clear that from their perspective there's nothing harmful about how it's done

But nahhh ... splitting them into groups is all fair and good, but doing it by gender this way – as well as tasking half the males with *defending an abusive husband* – is just not even remotely a good way to do it
this was exactly my thought. if they're going to gender something like this at least use it to broaden people's mindsets a bit
In my moms english class she does a lense assignment where everyone is randomly assigned a lense and she says its really annoying how painfully slow it takes some guys to understand a feminist lense.
If this is about Charlotte Perkins Gilman, i just learned that this author was very very racist even for her own time. I'm bringing this up bc i think it's important not to divorce an author from their work even if their work does have value not tied to their bigotry, especially since their bigotry may even seep into the work. You know, the easiest example is Rowling where you may like the books, and they teach some generalized good values but also have anti-Semitism and racism weaved throughout. If someone recommended Rowling today I'd wonder if they didn't know about the bigotry or didn't care. (I'm not saying this about you or anyone else in the thread I'm just saying all this in case someone wants to read the book, that they're aware!)
Depends on the science but definitely when taken overall! Comp sci, physics and to some degree chemistry are still male dominated. Biology is female dominated (I say this as a trans guy who's a biologist, although I'm a bioinformatician, so I did pick the most male-dominated subfield). So classes like ochem and biochemistry which are taken by chem majors and bio majors (all premeds in general) end up more evenly split. 

It's really the humanities and social sciences that lean the most heavily toward one gender. My little sister is studying speech-language pathology at the same school where I did my undergrad and every. single. student. in her cohort of 60 people is a cis woman -- not one man or trans person. Part of it is ofc going to be a product of the fact that there are more women who get college degrees than men so when a major is female dominated, it can be *really female dominated.* But I also think there's less stigma for women in male-dominated fields than the reverse. ""Breaking down barriers"" vs ""intruding"" or [insert homophobic slur here].
Yes exactly this. ""Support or oppose this interpretation"" it involves more thought to it as well. If I *just* have to support a statement it's easy to do becausei just have to pick out a few supporting points and defend it. But if I'm faced with needing to support or oppose it. I have to think about which option would be most sensible to defend given the informstion on hand, and not just make the argument to support it--but make the argument for why you are supporting it instead of opposing it (or vice versa).
Yeah, I can see where you're coming from about the second prompt. Like, the more I think about it, a literal haunting doesn't necessarily detract from the piece thematically. Like, if you read it that way, John's still ultimately responsible- he brought the narrator out to the house, insisted on putting her in a haunted room, and ignored her (correctly) identifying that there was a ghost. Plus that creates room for interesting parallels between the ghost of a woman who presumably also suffered under misogyny ultimately harming the narrator and the other women who help John control the narrator- I think you could get a solid analysis paper out of that reading.

The prompt's still complete dogshit because the instructions are all about finding evidence for the haunting rather than analyzing what it means, but thinking about the story in the lens of ""this is all real and the narrator imagined nothing"" is interesting food for thought.
Thank you for this heads up! I'd forgotten all about that tbh
Knowing how male-dominated sciences are in general is what make it so warm to me to hear it being relatively even in some sciences 😊

Yeah the humanities you've described matches with my experiences too. Ugh, *intruding.* Can't wait for that to be a relic of the past

I'm blushing 😊
No both of you
No need for this infantilizing
sure It's very floofy
That's literally not what I'm doing. Have fun being an ass
Dude this is almost the dictionary definition of infantilization. Telling them they are extremely small and need to be protected? Do you not see that?
It's literally a joke. I'm not saying they're tiny and incapable of protecting themselves and therefore need someone bigger and ""stronger"" to do everything for them and make decisions for them and whatever else.

I said wow you're small and cute and jokingly said I would protect them and you decided to take that and make it into something serious. That's your problem"	fn43mg	NonBinary	1268	1.0	2020-03-22 18:10:20
It’s….. a tooth brush why did they gender a TOOTHBRUSH		"It's clearly because man have sharp strong teeth like a rock 

And women have delicate weak teeth like a flower 

Therefore different toothbrushes 

/s
Regardless of gendering I don't think a pack of 12 toothbrushes for $7 is something I want to own
I like that they're Shadow the Hedgehog colored
r/pointlesslygendered
I'm gonna be honest, if this gets cis men to brush their teeth regularly they can have it. 

(Also, question: does anyone else find the whole ""manly"" grooming products thing patronizing? Surely the companies that are like ""men use soap too!"" are aware they're insulting their target demographic a little, no?)
We'll, now I know ergoFLEX 💪🦅🇺🇲is a word and it's hilarious 😂😂
Instructions unclear. Used one of these toothbrushes. Now all my teeth have little moustaches on them.
That's a good deal tho. 12 brushes for $8? I'll take it.
Is brushing your teeth considered too feminine now?!?
Every dentist I’ve ever seen has said sensitive toothbrushes are the best, so I hope these are as sensitive as male ego ;) 

I do like how these would fit my “goth chic” aesthetic tho
Cmon’ that ergoflex, rubber grip, heavy duty toothbrush has to get ur testosterone flowing /s
How else would you get men with toxic masculinity to improve their hygiene?
r/pointlesslygendered
Not cool man
Gendered products are absolutely wack, but like. If it makes men brush their teeth, it's helping at least.
Because for some reason ""chad alpha-male meathead"" is more of a marketable demographic than ""non-binary person""

Sad how the world we live in works
They don't even look like a good dental toothbrush, they look like the 4 for 99p ones I'd use to do absolutely filthy things like clean motorcycle parts.

That said I think the current toothbrush I have is an oral b with overly fussy decorative pink overmolding on clear. Because I've always used the pink toothbrush since someone made a stupid joke about buying bulk on eBay and not knowing what to do with the pink ones and got the kind gift of 10 sealed pink Colgate toothbrushes in some kind of attempt to mock me.

The Petrolheads are not ok.
yes i am a MAN and i am so MANLY that i snap FEMININE toothbrushes with my BARE HANDS. i need a toothbrush that will not BREAK under the IMMENSE FORCE of my MANLY MAN HANDS.

(j)
# Why must people gender everything?! thing's aren't innately gendered. I'm looking at you Spahish language! inanimate objects are called it/it's and that's it!
It's 2 am where I'm at and my brain is now screaming - are cis people ok? While I am sighing in 'really?' Because this is just so silly and beyond ridiculous now.
😭
Fellas, is it gay to…
*checks notes*
…use a unisex toothbrush?
a MAN toothbrush for MEN. a MANbrush if you will. for MANLY MEN!!!  


seriously tho, why do they do this????
Is saying man made really gendering. It just means it was made buy a guy. Unless I'm missing where it says ""for men""
obviously its for men that only want man things in their mouths .
I am more worried why there are rubber grips toothbrushes.....
YES NOW I CAN BRUSH MY TEETH LIKE A MAN
I bet men wouldn't have to buy 12 toothbrushes at a time if they stopped mangling them to death
Ah, yes. I need a new toothbrush, but not just any toothbrush. It's gotta be one of those Man toothbrushes. I don't want people to think I have female teeth, they need to know I have Man teeth. 

(This is just a joke, don't take this seriously)
I would buy this for my friend but only because they have a massive tool collection and it would be a fantastic gag gift and I expect them to then find a spot to put it in their collection
Hate
Pink bristles? Literally unusable
It’s just marketing for manly men who think brushing is for pussies unless their toothbrush looks like a black widow
To trick men into cleaning themselves
Its a MANS toothbrush, you can kill things with it.  **Rawr.**  They look like an expensive tool brand!  They are red, like BLOOD, and black like the gunge under your fingernails! Don't worry about ninjas ambushing you in your bathroom again with MANmade EGOFLEX Toothdestroyers!!1!  

(Channeling my inner Mike Judge, there...)
What kind of maniac buys 12 toothbrushes at a time.
How can a True Man™ use a brush which has _pink_ prickles?
Cuz it smells like minty wood in an arctic gorilla leather butt crack that is covered in gas
I just read this under the man made logo
""makes you a better man"" how tf can toothbrushes makes someone a better man?(despite the hygene part(i forgot that hygene is not MANLY and oNlY FoR GiRlS))
Whatever will get men to brush their teeth
For marketing. You can say the same for clothes. There’s no women or men’s clothes. They’re just clothes. They just happened to be marketed to men or women. For a number of reasons. 

Reason 1. Hiding bulges. 
2. Bigger chest flexibility. 
3. Fabric type assuming the person is wearing a bra. 

The list goes on
You could put an MCR sticker on that n I'd buy it tbh
marketing and stereotypes
Aggressive marketing sadly works quite well in the general market.
Hahahaha, feeling really glad about gender neutral toothbrushes in my country rn
To bait fragile men into buying them.
ahhh i hate it
I have played a game when hanging out with friends where we take turns trying to find the most ridiculous product which has a version marketed as “tactical”
I mean, don’t all men want a toothbrush that matches their pack of Home Depot drill bits? (I legit thought this was a pack of tools for a split second when I saw the photo)
""BECOME A BETTER MAN"" babe it's a toothbrush
Wow. This is so dumb 😂 as a “man” I tend to grip things with the strength of Zeus so I must have a rubber grip toothbrush. Ya know, for the steel strong teeth that men have…compared to the delicate teeth of a woman 🤦🏻‍♂️ Good god this world 😂
Why do I need 12 toothbrushes at once?
When your genders' stereotype leans so heavily into lacking basic self care that men are marketed to buy a years supply of toothbrushes so they know they should be changing them more frequently
Because it invokes a sense of belonging to things you normally associate with ""man"". Particularly, in this case, it's about the toothbrush being durable and well crafted.
Well, I guess that rather than eliminate the pink tax, they’ve decided to give a black-and-red discount. Cool, cool.
Clearly the toothbrushes identify as male. Don’t don’t shame them
...damn they cool as fuck tho
Id buy that simply because i never have toothbrushes to replace my old one with lol
What else will I use to brush my man-teeth
It’s so they can make the exact same ones but pink instead of red and charge extra
It's like the dude wipes, I hate the branding but there are useful for keeping clean when I go hiking.
Cis people and Capitalism surely is a wild mix, but at least we can laugh at all the bullshit it brings.
Rubber grip, so you don’t drop it while shredding your gums.
From the same mindset that makes the Squatch soaps popular.
Holding a mic to a cisman’s face: “Does brushing your teeth make you feel like LESS of a MAN?” 🤪
Real men brush their teeth with 10W40 motor oil mixed with high octane fuel. A regular non man toothbrush would disintegrate under such manly conditions.
Marketing
Shadow the Hedgehog can finally brush his teeth and all you can think about is GENDER!
Cause men teeth STRONK. Haha, but I honestly have no idea.
🤣
Red is pink for men
who tf needs 12 toothbrushes, likes 1 will do me for a year
It's times like this I recall the first Spongebob movie where Mr.Krabs was being interviewed and was asked what prompted him to build a second Krusty Krab next to the original: ""Money!""
Idk but the colors are sick
not enough cis men brushing their teeth i guess and ppl got fed up 😭😭💀💀
Real question though: who tf needs 12 toothbrushes?
That color scheme is very suspect, too.
r/pointlesslygendered

I do like the color scheme though
So they could sell men one with pink bristles. You know, so when he bleeds from the gingivitis, he can't see it!
Is this the secret for how to get vampire teeth?
Men’s teeth are so hard and sharp that they literally just use a brass wire brush
I know this is a joke but my partner (M) has way sharper teeth than me and idk why lmao. I think i brush mine too hard??? no idea
When ur amab but your dentist says you have 'soft teeth' 💅
That's $8, friend. Always round up and you'll end up better off with your spending! 😊
They'd be great for detail cleaning, however!
In a family of 5 with constant company (friends staying over, family staying over etc) it’s perfect for us 😭
I'm ftm and I love anything red and black, these are rad haha

While I completely agree with this, Nivea mens moisturiser smells so much nicer than most non gendered moisturiser that it’s almost worth the dysphoria I get from owning something that says “men” on it


Almost
Wait, cis men DON'T BRUSH REGULARLY??
It also depends a medical condition gets in the way of me brushing my teeth regularly. I try but it just doesn't happen as much as it should. I thankfully am able to keep my breath from smelling bad at least. Can't say the same for a cis female at my job it's terrible!
manhood is when you walk around smelling like liquid ass and stale gym socks /j
Not just any word Simone went out of their way to trademark it lol
THAT’S WHAT I GATHERED LOL
if it works it works
To be honest Lumin is skincare that's marketed towards men got me as an AMAB person to start looking after my skin...

Before I came to the conclusion I was non binary I'd get very defensive about using anything feminine, and the possibility of euphoria freaked my little egg brain out 😅

Not ""fussing around"" about my appearance was one of the first superficial toxic traits (that I'd learnt being raised male) that I actively broke, and it kinda started my journey. I don't use Lumin anymore because they are expensive and I do find the whole back and white ""mens"" marketing a tad cringe, but it was a good stepping stone.
It’s the brand name, right under that it also says “become a better man” so idk if not directly then implied
That one’s good
Too late, my perception of you is now greatly flawed. /s
I mean this packaging is definitely an anomaly here, most normal dental products are….. just dental products lmao
True
It all depends, some people may have stronger teeth because of genetics, the way they treat their teeth, the way they eat

All of that influences it, that why some people have sensitivity on their teeth and others don't
100%. It’s an actual marketing trick to price things like that, and it tends to work. 

I actually had a clerk mock me when I rounded up a while ago. Like, yes. I round because those three cents don’t matter. And also because that’s math.
That's how I base all my purchasing decisions, regardless of gendered products. ""Does it do what I want and well? Does it smell good? Is it affordable for its use?"" Personally these toothbrushes wouldn't be on my radar because I buy a pack for my gf and I to use and they're all the same color, it would get confusing.
Yeah, as a person with coarse facial hair some of these brands in the UK are pretty useful, like bulldog has a beard shampoo. I find the name cringe as hell but they also make a nice face wash 😅

Skincare for bearded skin is a little harder to figure out! It just sucks they sell it at boots (a UK drugstore) in the ""mens toiletries"" section, when it really doesn't need to be there. 

Also axe/lynx whilst I personally dislike a lot of their scents, their pride one is quite nice
Oh, I get it. All Nivea products smell amazing, but their ""men's"" products are in another league. I use their men's deodorant and it smells like being gently hugged by a drugstore.
Just cover the label with tape or a sharpie, or use some sandpaper to rub it off.
Not a cis anything, and not even AMAB, but I have really bad ADHD and depression, and remembering to brush my teeth is a constant battle/struggle. 

My bf is cis and he has the same problem, but again, it's entirely ADHD related. 

Idk if that explains anything or makes any difference.
From the sample I've lived with, one of them would only use these types and only when his fiancé was around, and the other just wouldn't until he ""felt like it"" (whatever that means). That being said I have an extremely small window into that, I assume cis men care about their health and appearance to some degree overall. I've just noticed it's less frequently
I sure hope so
From my limited experience, they just don’t enjoy being hygienic. All through my childhood I had to endure my mom telling my dad “go brush your teeth please your breath smells bad” and my dad going crazy over it, berating her and emotionally manipulating her over it. All because he was lazy. But my dad has always been incredibly unhygienic so it’s an extreme case I think.
cis males tend to be less good about personal hygiene and grooming because of the stupid gender stereotype that personal hygiene and grooming is somehow feminine (I really don't understand this one, and I probably never will).
Oh yeah totally. I have autism and depression so I understand the extenuating circumstances that would lead someone to not brush their teeth. I'm moreso referencing the fact that cis men tend to not take care of their overall health statistically. Married cis men tend to do better overall and live longer because they have someone else reminding them they need the doctors and dentist, ect if they can afford it. Witnessing it irl has definitely opened my eye too.
Don't worry, some laundry company is gonna use that tagline on their laundry pods For Men™️
Manhood is overrated.
Oh okay I didn't see that
True true, still such a weird thing. Just like how Kinder eggs™ are now sorted into boys and girls eggs when they used to be for all kids
And also the tax puts it over anyhow
nobody in customer service should be mocking customers for any reason, but especially not for the methods we use to help us know how much money we're spending. $18 is way easier to remember than $17.97, for example, and ensures that at the end of the day, you have a little money leftover instead of a little less money than you anticipated.
Even then married cis men tend to avoid the dentist and doctor. My dad has been for a while and has some medical issues that need attending to. Granted the doctor did tell him that one of his issues was because he is overweight which is kinda true but he took offense so he hasn't been back
It’s kinda pixelated so understandable
My old roommate did the same thing. He gained something like 80lbs in 4-6 months and his doctor was like ""this is alarming"". He told me about it and I leveled with him (I had undiagnosed PCOS since I hit puberty and was obese, diabetic and had cirrhosis of the liver before anyone would actually run the bloodwork to see what was wrong, took a decade of being told to ""exercise and eat right"") but he wouldn't accept any help. He continued to ignore his doctor mandated diet (unrelated to the gain, he has ulcers and needs a bland one to not throw up blood) and took it personally that the doctor called him ""fat"", but didn't advocate to find the cause either. Like he just quit. Idk, personally I'd fight to find out what's up, no matter the outcome. He had full coverage health insurance too, so it wasn't a money thing.
To be completely fair though my mom had a similar issue with her gallbladder and gallstones the problem was that doctors couldn't determine what was wrong and one gave a medical term that meant she was making it up so she immediately ended all doctor's visits until she was in liver & kidney failure. She told my dad she felt like she was dying and he rushed her to the ER where they said if he didn't bring her in she probably would have died before morning. She was in so much pain and the doctor even apologized for making her take a urine test before giving her pain meds as her pee was black.They determined it was gallstones causing an issue at the ER after finding them with an ultrasound that a doctor she had previously saw blew off taking after a nurse suggested it as her gallbladder felt enlarged. Well it was at the ER; 3 times it's normal size and was pushing against other organs. It was the scariest time in my life as I was only in 6th grade when it happened! This all happened over the course of 4-8 months of terrible pain for my mom after losing weight at a rapid rate which should have alerted doctors that it was a real serious issue not some fake BSing.
That's so horrible, I'm glad your mom is okay. That's happened to me and my mother conversely. Being disabled really opened my eyes to what doctors are actually willing to do, which in some cases is the wrong thing. To be clear, I encouraged him to follow his bland diet, and possibly get a second opinion or referral to another physician in network. He said ""yeah but that's too much work"". That's the consensus I've seen with cis men. Even my dad, he won't go for a physical or dental checkup unless my mom does all the legwork and he just has to show up at a time. It's definitely based on upbringing imo, my mom had me involved in my medical care from an early age cuz I'm disabled and have to be. It's a great skill to have but some traditional families don't expect their boys to do that stuff,
My brother doesn't expect to do his own stuff and it infuriates me. I do all my own stuff even though I have crippling social anxiety. He has no excuses! My dad raised us to be expected to do our own things. I do have a problem with procrastinating on stuff but I still try to do it. It took 5 years for me to schedule an eye doctors appointment. The doctor's office appointment was pretty easy so that was about a year as I am supposed to. Dentist? I still have to find one that takes my insurance"	10aeslh	NonBinary	1259	1.0	2023-01-12 23:45:14
Clothes have no gender. Skirts should be for everyone.		"Your body type is so perfect for that skirt, i hope you have more like that bc daaaamn. Its absolute fire on you, esp with the turtle neck. Second pic is my fav, i really love those shoes
Agreed.
That skirt may not be for everyone though - - it was clearly made for you!!! 🔥🔥
Skirts are so flowy. Everyone should get to feel the joy that comes with that fact
You are sooo cute!  Would you be upset if I saved your picture to use as inspiration for a drawing?  I would love to draw you!!
You are absolutely *rocking* that skirt my friend! I also really dig your beard, if thats okay to say - you're looking snazzy as fuck!!
All of this is amazing 😍
Agreed!!! Men in dresses and skirts which extend to Assigned Male At Birth are fab!!
The skirt is cute on you. But have you tried other sweaters like turtle necks? I think a normal round or v-shaped neckcould benefit you more 😘 If you get easily a cold neck, you can still use a neckerchief. That's also a nice opportunity to give your look a little thrill like in a signal colour.
Living for the skirt shoe combo in the second one!
I mean, my clothes have a gender, but yours don’t have to
Absolutely could not agree more, fuckin' killin it too btw!~✨💕🌸🤘
True! True! True! It took me a while to realize that and when I did, it was such a relief.

You look awesome, btw!
i love these outfits, the colors are so good! i'm obsessed with the leggings too, you're killing it
You look amazing babes
Definitely love the skirt!! Super cute my dude!!
Agreed! And that outfit is adorable 🥰
A beard and skirt are a very solid combo
Exactly!! Looks great on you!!

I made this comic about a holiday movie that has special significance in my trans journey, especially since this time of year is when many of us have to hide the most! What’s your favorite queer coded holiday movie?		"The image of Vixen from this movie has often come to mind in times when I’ve had to mask my true self to fit in. Sometimes it’s safer this way, but it always kills just a little bit inside… I long and live for places where I can just *exist* as the creature that I am—my natural habitat, with no need to hide. My heart goes out to everyone who has to hide part or all of who they are to make it through this holiday, or cannot be with their families because of who they are or who they love. Stay strong, fam! We’ll make it. ❤️🏳️‍⚧️🏳️‍🌈
That's so cute!! It works really well.

Did you know all of Santa's reindeer are either girls or trans boys? Both male and female reindeer grow antlers (not just males. It's a common misconception. Most horns and antlers appear in both sexes) Male deer lose their antlers in november (after mating) and female deer keep their antlers until may. Since Santa's reindeer have antlers at christmas they can't be cis boys. I love that fact
On my gosh, I loved this movie growing up, and this is such a brilliant way to represent dysphoria that I never even thought of ❤

I always loved the scene right before making the disguise. ""Take my socks off?""
Favorite queer coded Christmas movie would be Rudolph. It's been my favorite since I was a little kid and rewatching it's no wonder why.

Rudolph has to hide an unchangeable part of himself to fit in, and once people find out about that aspect of him they mock him and drive him away. Afterward he creates his own found family with Hermy and tries to find a place he can belong and where he won't be judged
[deleted]
❤️❤️❤️
I wouldn't say it's queer coded, but it makes for a good metaphor.
I can totally relate, its back to prentending to be cis while at the family get together hosted by some MAGA chucklefucks. 

The food is good though.
Just watched this movie tonight, by complete coincidence. Mrs. Claus is a trans icon in it too! She has a whole song about how she could do Santa's job, with a line something like ""I've fantasized about it often"". Oh, have you, Mrs. Claus?

Not to mention the Miser Brothers are about as queer-coded as you can possibly be in a Rankin-Bass claymation joint
Hearing people be so matter of fact about the damage done by ""masking"" always makes me feel better about being so fucked up from a lifetime of anti-autistic damage from the world around me. I don't WANT to mask. It's not good for me. I shouldn't have to pass as straight, as cis, or as allistic, nor should my primary concern in life be how upsetting my queerness (or autism) is for everyone around me to perceive.
I did know that actually!! Also, in other types of deer, while females don’t usually grow antlers, some does with higher than normal testosterone levels sometimes grow antlers too! Thanks for sharing this ☺️
Absolutely!! And the island of misfit toys, super meaningful to me. Love it!!
Tokyo Godfathers is the best Christmas movie I’ve ever seen
I believe Hana is also a trans woman, as she refers to herself as a woman (although others misgender her throughout the film.)
I LOVE this movie!!
Absolutely! Definitely picked that up when I watched it this past week!
Nature is so cool and interesting. Especially when you come across trans-affirming animals like reindeer, lions, hyenas and sea horses \^\^

Lol thanks, really all it takes is hours of makeup.
You're sweet, I tell you if I am either I definitely drew the short straw
Thanks, I got it done last week, pretty proud of how it looks
Some of it is just eyeliner, the rest is alcohol based makeup

Validating neighbor		"My first thoughts: heartwarming... cool neighbours to have, surrounding the home with positive, uplifting energy...
That Ending Is Classic. ""Good Talk, I'm Gonna Go Get Pet A Dog Now.""
I love validating old people. It’s just so sweet!
I love this its very heartwarming
I doubt old people would say pupper
Am shitting myself at OP awakening an elderly persons understanding of non-binary and also that elderly person responding with basically “actually yeah dude same”, because that’s the exact same way I came to understanding I’m NB. Lol love it.
Soooo cute 😻 I love your neighbors for being so supportive and understanding 🥰
Omg please GIVE THEM YOUR HAT! (or get them one for themselves) How wholesome.
and then everybody clapped
r/thatHappened

People aren't that kind. Full stop.
Yeah, and I hear people saying often ""I am too old to understand."" when it comes to gender, but here is a person whom is old and they are like ""that is so cool.""
my second one:

""I diagnose you with egg."" (to the elderly neighbor)
it was surprising to say the least.
My MIL is in her 70s and calls all dogs puppies and puppers. Picked it up from me and my niece lol. Anyone who has regular contact with someone else will pick up at least a bit of their slang and mannerisms. Usually without even realizing.
That's what my grandfather calls dogs 🤷‍♂️
Not sure how many people you know, but I know a lot that say it. It comes from the baby talk part. ""who is the cutest pupper wuppers."" ..... really I have no idea why they say stuff like that to dogs in baby talk
Aww people thinking their generation invented everything… you know pet/baby names for animals and small children have been used for generations right? Probably since humans started using language…
yeah, and anyone would remember this long a conversation word by word. Nice story though.
Wow, I really didn't think about that part of it. Glad for your buddy.
i can make it, it is just a bit of work. embroidery.
Why would everyone clap? It was a convo between 3 peeps.
Yeah, this. Never happened. People aren't like that.
this is just not true. people can be nice, and even old people can be non homophobic. woww, shocker
now I am just sad for you.
That sounds like my family. My mom usually corrects herself but my dad uses the ""old"" card. I get referring to me as my AGAB for several decades makes it easy to mess up but all I ask is to at least try.
Yeah I got a ""I don't understand that stuff"" and ""humans have to have a lable for everything"" from and older coworker and I had to stand my ground.
Agreed. I started typing something a little similar but I didn't think I was expressing myself well so just kept it to 'cool neighbours instead.
r/nothingeverhappens
..... you do realize we have cellphones. And they could have been so excited that they posted it after it happened. This is someone's facebook post that I put down. And also... there are people with photographic memories and such.
They're trying to say that this is a r/thathappened made up post. It's sweet but I don't think an elderly person would ever use online slang like ""puppers""
Yes trying is way more validating then not.
you never met elderly peeps whom baby talked their dogs?
Oh I have for sure, but not using zoomer slang, ""pupper"" is super recent millennial/ gen z term"	x6lsj0	NonBinary	1227	0.99	2022-09-05 17:21:30

Eeyyy i have those same pins!
How long have you had that hair color? I had it for a few months but maintenance was impossible. Is it worth the upkeep for you? Looks great on you btw.
That’s bananas.
Piercings, shirt, and hair all 10/10, you’re killing it today wow
Give it a good what’s for, you glorious enby🤘🏻
That’s so weird, my name is actually The Gender Binary 🤷🏼‍♂️
I know this is going to sound like an odd compliment

But you look exactly like a character I write? So enjoy the fact you look like an enby supervillain. Cause you look awesome
Your hair looks great! If you wouldn't mind sharing, what brand did you use?
i lobe your pins aaaa
Well, your photo is smashing - so, success?
That shirt is bananas! B-A-N-A-N-A-S!
~~not the only thing I'd want you to smash~~
Dayum you look cute
I can't tell which is hotter; your body or your attitude! 😍
you look so amazing omg
Your hair, piercings, and shirt look amazing! I also love your pins.
I wanna steal your look
Missed Accomplished
Do you mind if I potentially use your picture as a reference for how I want my hair colored? I've been searching for a good example and yours is easily the closest to how I imagined mine.

quick edit: oh my god we have the same belt
Okay you're amazing af, goals 👌🏻
But also I need your ""fuck off"" badge so bad lmao
You'd make an awesome queercore singer. I mean this as a compliment!
Oh. Geeze. My heart... You're way too cute in the most badass way possible and dangit you make me want white hair again even though yours looks more grayish blue. It's lovely. It's just so much work!!
those pins are just...wow i lov them
Ahhh I love that shirt!!
What an icon!! I love your hair dye!! What brand do you use, I tried using a dye from Ion but it didnt show up even though my hair was super light :(
Sick style dude....dudette.....FUCK!
Great hair!
Thank you!
Hell yeah, I’m cosplaying him at my next con.
Thank you! ^^
wait they actually do-
Me too, I got the non binary pin.
I’ve had it about a month or two now. And for me upkeep is actually really easy. Once a week I just put purple shampoo in and leave it for 30-60 minutes. That stuff is magic yo.
And thank you!
Thank you! I actually feel pretty euphoric today!
Hell yeah!!! I wanna hear more about this character. ^^

Now, the purple shampoo is the most CRITICAL step. It’s not hard but without it your hair won’t be silver at all.    
Just lather a TON throughout your semi-wet hair and leave it in for 30 minutes to an hour, that’s stuff is MAGIC.    
To maintain the color I redo the purple shampoo every two weeks, every week would keep it from fading better but it’s not necessary. It’s super easy and I love it!    
Personally I would recommend using a hair mask once a week to keep your hair soft be bleach kinda fucks it. The Pantene hair mask works wonders.    
Good luck! I’d love to see some more silver enbys on here!

Ah, thank you so much!    
I keep mine silver by leaving purple shampoo in for 30-60 minutes every week. It’s really easy. ^^
I'm not OP but had my hair a very similar color. I mostly used the L'oreal Feria gray dye. Sometimes I would mix in a small amount of Manic Panic Ultraviolet or Shocking Blue into it to change the tint. 

It was super easy to maintain, I only had to touch it up once a month. The hardest part was keeping the roots dyed.

Edit: I have dark brown hair. But unless you have naturally pale blonde hair you might need to lighten or bleach it first.
Thank you!!!    
The trick is purple shampoo, without it there is no silver.

Thanks broski. I think dude is gender neutral but everyone’s opinions are different :)

So supervillain is an interesting term for them cause it's their job. Quite literally, punch clock villain, hired by a group known as the Paragon (for a shorthand compare them to other super hero groups like the avengers or Justice league) 

But they were hired to basically feign being a villain to make the ""heroes"" look better, while really they're a bunch of scummy bastards. 

They got into this line of work because (not kidding) they were an acting student at University, got their degree... Couldn't find a job with student loans... And look what showed up? Mutant powers. 

So they made the best of a bad situation. 

As for appearence, when their powers emerged their hair and eyes took a silver as well as some freckles when feeling high emotions. In their ""Alice"" persona they cover those up but I'm getting ahead of myself.

So their ""personas"" of sorts. You have them as they are truly. Al, that's what anyone who actually knows them knows them as. 

Then you have ""Alice"" play up the sweet innocence a little more, she presents femme and that's the persona they show to the public to actually let them live without yknow having people attack this villain. 

And then you have Antithesis. The Miraculous Thespian, the terrible villain. The counter to your heroics. The owner of many titles and lover of metaphors. Antithesis is a cross between a magician and a actor. Known for showy ""performances"" involving many explosions and acrobatics. As well as appearing nearly invincible and being able to leap and walk on thin air(I'll explain in a little bit) and laughing in the face of even the strongest heroes. He has an adoration of anything showy that would grab your attention, glitter and lights, loud sounds. The perfect distraction. 

Al's powers are actually a set of three metre square invisible force fields that they can bring anywhere in their arm's reach. That's it

But that's VERY adaptable. They can make a show out of blocking an attack, walk on their own force fields. Or use the end as a blade. 

Originally this all was an act a big performance... But the path of villainy is growing on them, desiring bigger and bigger stages... And those Paragon... They're just getting in the way. 

So anyways, you reminded me of them and they're kinda known as a bombshell in universe
Awesome, as soon as I have the time I'm gonna look into those products and try to get my silver enby on, I'll be sure to post a pic if I do, thanks! :)
I have naturally bleach blonde hair but I lightened mine anyways to get the color to stick better.

amazing!! your hair and smile are gorgeous 😍
Congratulations! It’s so Important to have older non-binary people visible in the world, we so often get seen as just dumb kids following a trend. I’m happy when people show the world that dumb adults can follow trends too 😛
""Better late than never""
im so proud of you for making it through such a draining process of becoming happy with yourself. you really are a role model
Congratulations! Its great to see older non-binary people becoming who they were always supposed to be. I wish you the best in your transition! 💜
I love your hair! I'm also a purple-haired nonbinary!! :D welcome
I'm seeing this right before going to bed and my heart is now full!! I love seeing content like this!! You go be your authentic self, it will inspire so many to follow!!! 🥺
Beautiful
I’m so happy for you!! Congrats :)
Damn that color is vibrant. I wish I could pull off colored hair.
I'm so happy for you!! 😄
I am so glad for you, and hope you find your true self soon. 

You go girl
Oooooo I love your hair! Since your hair started growing out, are you gonna keep it purple or let it grow a bit more and change colors? My purple washed out and left my hair blueish green, so I leaned into it and redyed it a dark jade.
congratulations!!!!
It’s never too late to be your true self. Congrats!
You are now my hero. :)
 role model, thank you for existing 💕💕💕
41 and transitioning here. Hormones are a big step. Congrats!
Congrats!
I have that quote in my room! makes me feel much better about myself when I look at it ❤️
Must redo the hair though :) the grey is definitely past the roots!
Thank you
You can! There are so many colors available that you will think match your complexion & style perfectly. Just gotta dive into it. Even if afterwards you *feel* it doesnt match you, it does, dont worry. Besides, its hair. It'll grow back. If it doesnt, wigs exist lol
If you have hair, you can! And if you don't, vibrant wigs are a thing :D
I'll be keeping it purple, I have enough of the dye to do 2 or 3 more applications, and it lasts really well :)
Thank you :) hope I can live up to it!

it do be like that		"Gender is like a cardboard box: some cats like them because they provide comfort and safety, other cats like to rip them to shreds.
[removed]
I'm firmly team ""NO MORE GENDER"". Gender has caused me nothing but anger, frustration and resentment in my life.
Genders for some, tiny agender flags for others
I can see that other people are having fun with gender, and that's great. I want people to have fun. But I think I might never understand. Like, what does it even *feel* like to have gender? I've heard that even cis people can experience gender euphoria, but I don't think I ever have. I don't get dysphoria from presenting in ways I was socialized to do, but doing so doesn't make me *feel* like a woman. A while back I panicked a little after realizing that, but not knowing whether I could be non-binary since it sounded like they have gender too but in more different flavors. 

Now I'm mostly annoyed with the concept of gender because I can't figure out if I have it. I could just be a cis person who hates gender *roles* and overthinks as a part-time job. Then again, I'd certainly take the option of having a dick if it were offered (like a genie situation, * poof *), but then again again, I can also make do just fine with my assigned equipment. I've given up for now trying to figure it out, and I tell myself I don't have to know for sure because either way I don't really care to change anything about how I live or how I am perceived.
Yep
Secret third button that says: ""Sure you go do your gender or whatever but leave me out of it.""
*presses both and embraces the chaos like a real mischief goddess*
We should as a society stop forcing people into boxes without having to abolish gender, hell, make more genders if you don’t fit in any, and society should respect that, just gotta deal with the constant explaining
Make it that version of the meme where they’re pushing both buttons and smiling triumphantly and I’m in.
For me, gender *presentation* is fun but that doesn't mean I have a gender or anything. It's like playing dress up.
no 👏🏻 more 👏🏻 gender 👏🏻
I love this analogy! I'd be like a hyperactive cat who jumps in some and shreds others and then gets bored of it all.
Sometimes it's the same cat
I couldn't agree more. When I say things like gender should go away or gender shouldn't be relevant I really mean that it shouldn't be put on IDs and Passports or that people should treat you differently based on Gender.

I don't really mean that it should go away entirely, it just shouldn't be as relevant and legally binding as it is.

Edit: Why was this removed?
I feel you!! I'm the same way most of the time... But then I'm like ""damn I'd love having a mustache, so masc."" Or ""wouldn't it be fun to make this look more fem?"" I wish clothes and looks were not defined as masc/fem at all. Love all genders, hate the concept of gender. NB stuff u.u
I mean no more gender but also try out every presentation combination imaginable, y'know?
All the genders or none of the genders, it’s all good.
You don't need to change anything about yourself! The thing I love about NB is that it includes agender people too, as this identity also exists outside the binary.
Although I do think that gender should not have a place on things like documents, i.e. ID cards and Passports, I'm not talking about an ex I'm talking about just not having a gender category there at all.
You can like all that stuff and still hate gender, those things aren't gender, they may have a perceived connection to gender but that perceived connection is an artificial construct.
And you absolutely can do that, presentation ≠ Gender.
Sometimes I think that having ""sex"" on documents is also completely useless. Why do they need to know about our bodies?! Like a friend of mine said, ""so they know how to exploit us better.""
Yes, but gender euphoria... Some of those things, as a gender fluid NB person, make me feel euphoric specifically because they make me feel like a masc/fem/andro person. Sometimes I really do feel like a guy, and it's great. Sometimes I love feeling like a girl, and these are different feelings to me. Obviously, genders are social constructs, but someone that (for example) transitions to become a woman will likely receive euphoria from the trappings of that gender. Shaving my legs gives me massive disphoria, but a transfem friend adores shaving her legs and presenting fem, specifically because they feel great about being a woman. 

I wish none of the ways in which we present as people were gendered, but, socially, they kinda are. It's so weird and complicated.
That's pretty much it, it's mainly used for exploitation and discrimination (both cis, trans, and enby alike).
I see, I kind of wish I could understand a bit better. I wish there was a way that somebody could explain how gender feels to me, then I might be able to understand these things a bit better, maybe also why they happen.

&#x200B;

>I wish none of the ways in which we present as people were gendered, but, socially, they kinda are. It's so weird and complicated.

I very much agree with this, the idea of society seeing things as gendered feels very weird (and sometimes dumb) to me. In a way though we do have some power to change it because we're society, so hopefully in the future it will get better."	zqfpp7	NonBinary	1201	0.99	2022-12-20 05:34:56

(Both are supposed to be compliments, btw.)
Holy fuuuuck I love your hair it looks so fluffy
I love your blue hair. I miss mine!! T.T
Omg, is this a sign I should go back to blue!? Because 😭😭😭😭💓
Your hair is sooo nice! I love your glasses too!
Yay! I've been ready to be done with work and gender all week.

PS I love your hair so very much.
those glasses look so good on you
Bootieful, the 'do, the spectacles, the metal, you are beautiful, or handsome, or breathtaking, whichever term is more socially acceptable for wherever your gender is on the spectrum 🌈
Seeing this has made me miss my septum ring even more than I alresdy did.
Also, LOVE the hair!
This might sound a little weird...but you look exactly like an original character I made a couple years ago, who was the reason I realized I was nonbinary!! :o

Anyway your whole look is GOALS 👌👌
Love your look!!
Are you blonde? I can never get my hair that bright and I'm a brunette
Cool hair!
I love your vibe!
NICE, I had that exact hair color a while ago! Lovin your vibe here.
A true hero, thank you!
OMG you're soo cute

Can I have your hair please?
Cute! I love your hair and glasses!
you're so cool
Finally
I have the same glasses but in gold lmao
you kinda look like chloe moriondo!!
I thought it meant we got second gender for free.

thank you!
thanks :')
Yee, thank you!
just doing public service here!
ahh thank you!! I would give it to you but I kinda really like having hair, sorry abshd
I know that's probably meant to be really nice but it's giving me dysphoria tbh agajdkd
i think it’s actually both
I'm weirdly feeling that I'll figure out soon, but every morning I still wake up being not sure.

Thanks for the offer for help, I'll might use it soon.
Damn, that's fair
ohmigosh i’m sorry!! i was gonna say you look like if she had a brother but i didn’t know if you would want to be seen as more masc!! sorry!!
don't worry, you're fine!! thank you for replying :') I pretty much just want no gender attached to me at all ahsndn but being seen as masc is definitely better"	co2tah	NonBinary	1206	1.0	2019-08-09 14:04:23

Love the outfit!
Sorry, I don’t speak water. (Making a joke bc I don’t understand Celsius. Wishing you more lovely weather days!)
Did the tattoo hurt getting it?
You look fucking awesome!
Respectfully whistling at you
You’re right about that.
Your tattoos are so fucking cool!
Super freaking cute !!!
I would like to say I love you. Seriously.
Cute!! 😍😍😍
👍
That outfit is fucking amazing, magazine worthy! You ate and left no crumbs!
Oh my gosh you are stunning, like wow
Ass for days
I love how simple but awesome those tats are!
lord have mercy
I love how you change so much with those glasses. Usually people who wear glasses look weird without them but in this case you don't. Not really the clothes but like the smile and it doesn't seem forced, the euphoria of feeling great and beautiful of yourself
I love your outfit!
Curious since you are using celsius weather instead of fahrenheit you probably live in Canada. Also from the building architecture and things being spread apart unlike Europe where buildings are closer. Your environment gives Ontario vibes but not downtown metropolitan area
happiness looks beautiful on you
Looking fucking fantastic right there.
Right?? I just got new shorts etc, this weather is awesome!
Oh gosh. Sorry I was not expecting to see ass…
Whoa, that's a lot more trunk than it looked from the front 😅

i like when i walk down the street and guys dont know if its gay to check me out
Oh my gracious 😳
ty sm i honestly really like my butt its v gender neutral
thank you!!!
nope honestly one of the least painful tats i’ve gotten
thank u! i love funky sunglasses
i’m canadian but i live in the usa
this is so kind!
i am sorry
I personally would check you out. Ur queerness and just outfit is so much to put me in a gay panic state 😂
I would respectfully check you out. And as a genderqueer trans man I wouldn’t have to wonder if it’s gay bc it always is😂
Best vibe. Best.
Would you want the same reaction with girls or just guys? I feel girls do more comparisons rather than guys thinking how to get with someone. I don't know if it's society patterns of cisgender society
Priceless 🤌💋
Oh wow. I planned on getting tattoos too but I chickened out.
Okay fair enough stay safe out there in the wild world
idk i think in life im perceived more femme than masc do i think if girls checked me out theyd def know it was gay? idk tho im just a genderless blob
Holy cow, you look incredible!!!

What about gender anti-matter?
My genderfluid is in a cauldron
Sorry but this looks like Gayle from Bob’s Burgers
fuck it, ionizes your gender
Important to note how they are always cool reagardless of state 😎
Sorry i have to be '*that person*' but gas is still a fluid. So is liquid. Both gases and liquids (and also plasmas, kinda) are fluids.

Anyway, apart from the physics terminology, nice meme. /gen
Not pictured: me.
I showed this to my boyfriend and they said yes they're a fluid
I’m a gender vacuum
We need some gendergy rep.
Gender Ether? Gender Fifth Element! ^_^
large hadron gender collider
gender fire eta wen
Whenever gender and antigender collide, they destroy each other, releasing huge amounts of energy.
Mood
I am the gender plasma
Your wish is granted
And gender quasi-particles
Damnit. I was gonna call Gender Bose-Einstein Condensate.   


Guess I can take Gender Neutron Degenerate Matter
#Black superionic ice: A state of matter that can exist under very high pressure while excited by super lasers.

ᕕ༼⌐■-■༽ᕗ


Also ""Degenerate Matter"" sounds cool.

But I think some of us are also gender Superfluid.
That still exists in the regular states of matter. As far as we know. We haven't made enough to check most states, but as for plasma it does behave the same, just with opposite charge.
why you gotta gatekeep plasma with that kinda? they're just chilling being an ionized gas
Classical or quantum field theory?
Me too
magnetohydrodynamics isn't normal fluid-dynamics, say what you want
Classical? I’m agender
man just let plasma be who they be, they're just out here plasmabossing
Yeah, so absolutely no gender. If it were quantum field theory, we'd be talking small fluctuations around 0, so some gender, except nothing concrete, and always in a state of flux.
if you classify plasma as a fluid, then solids are too

tectonics come to mind

or glass in old church windows
glass isn't sloped in church windows due to the glass drooping down over time, it's just how the the glass panes were rolled. It would take an inordinate amount of time for a glass window to actually sag.
In *old* churches, that time is sufficient. Yes most churches aren't that old, and the look of the glass there indeed comes from manufacturing. It takes about a millennium for noticeable optical changes to the glass due to drooping. But while 1000 years is a long (you may even say inordinate amount of) time, it is not as long as some churches have stood for. Also, modern glasses are a different story, of course.

Amorphous solids (like glass or rock) tend to shift over long timescales. It really only depends on the timescale, anything amorphous behaves like a liquid if you observe it for long enough. Crystalline solids don't exhibit this problem, but they tend to be much brittler and erode away much faster than any of those timescales.

Plasma, on the other hand, is not governed by the laws of fluid dynamics alone, instead it is governed by the laws of fluid dynamics *and* electromagnetism. Hence, [magnetohydrodynamics.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetohydrodynamics)
I assure you that it's because that's just how the glass was manufactured, it's an urban legend that it flows enough to cause a visible difference

This man gives me gender envy		"Pretty much all of Arcane is severe envy 😭
I just rewatched that show with my partner

Now I'm gonna cry because of a simple picture aahhh
Viktor reminds me of orochimaru in boruto.  


Fuck gender, i am here to do SCIENCE
Transmasc Viktor 🏳️‍⚧️
Viktor is just so skrunkly and I love him
I want to look like Viktor, and Jayce, and Vi, and Caitlin. Is that so much to ask?
When the show first introduced him, with his cane and his sexy accent, I was fully ready for him to be a villain, but when he stepped up to support Jayce and be his ""partner,"" I fell in nonbinary ace love with him pretty hard.

Is it weird to want to be both Viktor and Vi at the same time?
I prefer pre time skip Victor tbh

Also the envy chara for me in Vi. Made me start doing pushups even xD
That man looks tired
who dat?
Same
Omfg he’s literally me
SAME 😭😭😭 him and Vi istg
Big same.
same omg.
Jinx gives me gender envy
consumption chic
vICTOR ALL THE WAYYYY!!!!
who
Whered you get a pic of me!?
I’d have to say for me personally luz or vee from the owl house, gives me the most gender envy
That's my Instagram and Tumblr profile picture. The exact shot
Yes
Same
Anyone with naturally straight hair gives me gender envy
brainrot
Last time i rewatched it Sevika made me feel things i didnt feel the first watch. Dunno if it was envy or attraction tbh, pan enby problems 😅
Honestly Frr! And they all make me so attracted to them too
Don’t worry I be crying with you
HE DOES THO
Skrunkly is a good word
all at the same time too
Nah bro I want to be a mixture of them 😭
>I was fully ready for him to be a villain

>!Just wait for the second season ;) Source: League of Legends lore!<

>!It's actually not that black and white, but I'm looking forward what the producers decide to do with Viktor's arc!<
That's my secret, Cap. I'm always tired.
A character named Victor from the show Arcane on Netflix. Highly recommend. I’ve never played League of Legends before and don’t intend to; the series stands on its own as a phenomenal story, and the animation is sheer art. Think “Into the Spiderverse” level art.
Just watch Arcane it's so goddamn good
Its Viktor from the show Arcane
Lemme join.
lol thank you for the validation 😆

Watching this show triggers truly problematic levels of the ""do I wanna make out with this person or do I wish I *was* this person"" phenomenon...is there a shorthand for that, by the way? It feels so common there ought to be a  term for it.
literally me I wanna look like Vi.. but just be a complete supergenius
Yeah emphasis on arcane being separate from league, leagues cast of champions have an extreme amount of lore unrelated to the game and Arcane is based on that lore

Reason, Emotion and Horny. The 3 Genders!		"And even this is a spectrum.
i may not show it but i literally have no fucking clue what i'm doing
4. Spite
My actions are mostly guided by what other people tell me to do. I don't make the best decisions by myself.
Yes is* the only correct answer

edit: a word
wheres the option for anxiety
Head... I've been around
This much more complicated, suited for an essay exam rather than multiple choice.
are those the only 3 options? not very aroace friendly
I'm gonna be honest, 70% of the time I spent with fluffy Boyfriend I am guided by the horny
How does this work for those whose “genitalia” either no longer works or works like the opposite?
Most likely my head. I barely thought like this when I was in my 20s and was too occupied to overthink and analyse myself.
Wow the Lake Trio are alone different than I remember them being clearly
As an asexual who represses all emotions, ill go with head. Wait no, not like that!
Gonna have to go multi choice here
If games have taught me anything, it's to follow the enemies.
can confirm, gender is horny
Head. Head's the best.
As an Overthinker Philosofical Intersex person...I TOTALLY AGREE.
Living cool, being hot and giving no fucks. : - ]
5. Spit
I played the trumpet for eight years out of spite. Good times
Pretty sure spite is the only thing keeping me going lol
true
4-Joystick
Ah, the ears. Most powerful decision making tool
The only correct answer is the friends we made along the way.
Now that you've done your tour will you *head* for the exit?
You really think Cis people stop to think about those things? : /

(But being real, it was just a metaphor, u know, right?)
My head heart and genitals work in tandem pretty well I think.
Is that a misspelling of philosophical or intentional?
Not sure what that means, but, neat.
just the ""giving no fucks"" part, personally

edit: spelling
Promise? 😏
Out of spit too, I'd imagine!
Hahaha! Exactly!
Theoretically I would be willing to accept a ratatouille type situation where someone sits on my head and pulls my hair to direct me.
lol
Yeah, that’s not the way my brain works but I get it"	111qo9z	NonBinary	1180	0.99	2023-02-14 01:54:10

Mohawks have no gender		"Exactly but no if I was to get one it'd ""defeat the purpose of going on estrogen"" according to pretty much everyone in my life
That's cool as heck, especially with the cherries
Such a bad ass outfit!!
I got a deathhawk that turns into a mullet when needed. Also you look badass af
Damn right
Mohawks are hands down the most gender neutral hairdo! Like bigass mohawks are so cool no matter who wears them (I haven't been able to set a big one myself xD but I'm scared to cut my hair as I'd look masc)
Niiiiice
Hell yeah 🤩 and you look good!
You look cool
Love the cherries! 🍒 ❤
How can someone looks this good? :O
I adore the cherries that is so so rad /pos
[deleted]
Awesome photo! 

The post title is verbatim, something said in my therapy session. I’ve been avoiding doing anything w my hair bc I’m scared to draw attention to myself, but avoiding self expression is contributing to depression and anxiety, too. 

You look rad; you’re an inspiration!
I’ve wanted a Mohawk forever but I know it wouldn’t fit me,,, thank you for loving this for me you look so cool ugh
Not unless you apply Sentience Powder

And even then it's not a given
You look amazing
I, too, have a green mohawk 💚 love it
THE CHERRIES ARE SO GOOD
actully they do. there from the gender of 


rock an roll 🤘

THE CHERRIES love it:)

the cherries are sooo cute!!
Fierce 🔥

  LGBT is the best <3
No gender, just creative energy, individuality and freedom. You look awesome, and I’m glad you are confident with your look.
No gender, but they have a race, and it sure ain't white 🤡
🙄 those people need to shush,  they suck . You'd look rockin with a Mo 😍
punk girls/guys/peeps are awesome.
Ah yes, estrogen is exclusively for growing hair longer.
just do it fuck them do what you want it’s your body be free
Binaries gonna binary. Just ignore them and be yourself. Taking estrogen doesn’t mean you have to be conventionally feminine. It’s a hormone, not a contract to be a girly girl until the end of time.
>deathhawk

Didn't know what that was!! So cool.
I'd love a big thick mohawk , like the days of MySpace emo mohawks 😍 my hair is way to thin though,  so classic punk mo it is 🤘😎
🥰😍
Shush you look cool:3
☺🥰 naww thank you ! You're wonderful
Awww 🥰❤ you're lovely! You're the sweetest
🥰 I was terrified before I started changing my hair too,  start with little things , a few years ago I started with a dyed strip layered under more hair so it was a secret colour and now 😎 I'm rockin my Mo' 

You're wonderful and amazing and you've got this ❤
❤ you'd rock any and all hairstyles,  I know it 🥰
A sentient mohawk... that would be SO COOL 😎
Yeees!!! Mohawk family 🥰 keep rockin it !
🤘😝
I’ve only ever seen misinformed white people calling it appropriation. They typically cite reasons like, ‘the style is sacred to the Mohawk Nation,’ which, if you do any research, is blatantly untrue. 
The “mohawk” hairstyle isn’t even from Mohawk culture. The men of the Pawnee nation cut their hair in a similar way, but styled it completely differently. The association between the spiked ‘mohawk’ hairstyle and the Mohawk Nation was invented or popularized by the film Drums Along the Mohawk (1939.) The film stereotyped Native American people as violent, uncivilized, etc.
During WWII, some US paratroopers wore ‘mohawks’ and painted their faces to intimidate the people they were fighting, clearly making use of the same offensive stereotype used in the film. The hairstyle became popular with US troops in Vietnam, then with certain art subcultures, until it was picked up by punks in the 70s. Today, the hairstyle is almost completely divorced from its origins.
No one looks at a punk and sees an offensive portrayal of an indigenous culture.
At this point, calling it a ‘mohawk’ is the only way it is still associated with indigenous people. A different name would be better, but as it stands, it doesn’t seem to be doing significant harm.
(If an indigenous person said that my and other punks use of the term ‘mohawk’ made them feel unwelcome in the community, then I would change my language and encourage others to do the same. But this hasn’t happened.)
As long as you’re not trying to dress up like a native american, having a ‘mohawk’ hairstyle isn’t hurting anyone.
Me having a bleached , neon green ( that glows in the dark!) Mohawk isn’t harming anyone.
I know but to be fair it might mess with the vibe I'm going for
It would probably spoil the sorta tomboy vibe I'll be going for
Exactly
It's more the principle of it I wouldn't like one
Exactly being feminine all of the time just means I'll be uncomfortable all of the time I wish I was a cis woman though I would be sooooo much happier
Yea deathhawk is just       *t h i c c*       mohawk
I personally just don't have the skills to do it, but my hair can perfectly stand in a good 30cm (11in) spike. I've always had loads of hair, helps alot with integrity :p
nothing more tomboy than a punk haircut in my opinion.
I’ve had a similar thought as well—I wish I were simply AFAB. Then being my brand of non-binary would be much more understood. 

Still, we can’t change our pasts, or the circumstances of our birth. All we can do is move forward and try to present as closely as possible to how we feel inside. 

I presented hyper-fem for years because I wanted to be accepted as anything other than male/AMAB, and it was just the default for transfem people. It felt comfortable, but never entirely correct. It was good for me, though, because it helped me stave off dysphoria until I became passable enough to feel comfortable trying more androgynous/“tomboy” looks. 

I’m not saying you should do this. Today’s world is a bit more understanding of being non-binary and not conforming to gender norms. Still, if you think it helps you, then go for it. 

Just keep in mind that spending years trying to be something you aren’t may help you avoid dysphoria and make peace with society, but it won’t bring peace within yourself. Ultimately, peace with yourself is the most important thing. 

**It’s okay to be outside the binary :).**

I’m not sure how helpful this will be, but there is a subreddit called r/mtfbutch, for trans women who are more androgynous or even masculine presenting. Most people there are binary identified, but a lot of their experiences are something that may be relatable for you. 

Sorry for rambling. I really hope you get to a place of peace with and confidence in yourself.
I wish I could grow a deathhawk!! I looooove them 😍
The dream ! 😍 it takes me about an hour of patient work to get 2-3 inches of hair up so I totally don't blame you , the effort it would take to make a massive mo would kill me 😅
Yeah but long hair also means I can switch it up whenever I want
As someone who goes for the tomboy look pretty intentionally: agreed. The Mohawk absolutely fits the aesthetic :).
Thanks I always thought I just liked masculine presenting women turns out I just wanted to be one at least sometimes
Ah yes, that might have been the problem for me xD
I tried making a mohawk and I gave up after it turned out as a big spike after about an hour
Maybe I should get help involved and spend longer on it xD
you could have REALLY big spikes.
Nah you clearly don't know the people of Scotland butch women are fairly common here especially among the working class but anyone who has spiked hair longer than 2 inches is made fun if
2 inches is  0.16 RTX 3090 graphics cards lined up.
im literally working in Dundee right now xD I've lived here ten years xD
Good bot pat pat
Oh well that's Dundee Dundee sucks Glasgow is better

i’m a recovering anorexic and experience both weight-related and gender-related body dysphoria but today i feel really comfortable and attractive and good and i just wanted to celebrate that with you guys ‘cause you get it. ❤️		"You look amazing!! 💛
You look so gorgeous!!
we have like the same body!
Beautiful indeed!
I struggled with eating disorders too. Thank you for sharing. It's tricky sometimes to try to separate if the dysphoria I'm feeling is more due to my gender or my other body issues. But for me, the more I accept my gender, the less I notice my other body issues. It gets better, is what I'm trying to say. Keep on keeping on.
i struggle with the same things. im recovering from an ED right now and it can be really exhausting to fight not just one but two different voices in my head telling me my body is wrong. so much of my disordered eating was fueled by my gender dysphoria (and vice versa) so sometimes it can be hard to separate the two. 

good on you OP, i know firsthand how hard it can be. i hope things look up for you :) you look great and you should feel great too
My gender-related body dysphoria is directly linked to my weight (bc ""curves"") and I've struggled to keep things on the right side of orthorexia-shading-to-anorexia ever since some well-intended fool told me that not eating would stop my period (like that was a bad thing!) so, yes, I absolutely get it. I'm so glad you're feeling good!
Heckin proud! Thank you for sharing your happy moments with us ❤️
Damn it. I thought *I* had the best username. I was mistaken.
I unfortunately know those struggles, but fortunately can be super empathetically stoked for you! *happy hugs* 💜

you look awesome! keep going, you look amazing and I’m proud of you for getting through all that you have 💙
Hey, I’m going through this right now due to gender dysphoria too. My treatment team doesn’t seem to understand trans people but its nice to hear I’m not alone. I wish you all the best in your recovery!
I have the same issues, and I'd love a body like yours. Funny how that works.
Cute hair!
I feel this so much. for a long time I thought the only reason I wanted to look thinner was because I have weight-related issues and disordered eating but a lot of it is because I want to have a more feminine frame and an hourglass figure. I'm still trying to figure out what I want to do with myself but I really admire your confidence in posting this!! you look fantastic and I'm glad you feel comfortable with yourself
I’m really struggling with the same thing
You look stunning!! So happy for you that you’re recovering <3
Shit you have an incredible body. It's so good you are beating anorexia. Keep being badass

whoa we’re like siblings! I have the same body type and am also recovering from disordered eating. isn’t it the worst how the tit situation hits on weight and body dysphoria at the same time? So proud of you for living your life in spite of everything that gets thrown at us!
I love your tattoos
Hey! I’m also recovering from an eating disorder myself. I’m going back to treatment for the third time but I’m still holding onto hope. I’m not glad we have eds but I’m glad we can relate as enbys with eds. Stay strong and hold onto hope! We got this! 💚💚💚
Thanks for sharing 🤩 you’re awesome!!
You look fantastic!
u look rlly nice uvu im glad you are recovering ♥️
Beautiful! You're amazing and wonderful!

I'm also recovered from two EDs, and I understand the struggle of battling with both dysphoria and dysmorphia. I can personally say that I am there with you and am so proud! Stay safe! <3
awesome tattoos! what are they?
You are so adorable. I’m also non binary and I suffer from an eating disorder as well. I’m doing pretty good and maintaining my weight as of right now. Hit me up if ya wanna talk.

Wow, good for you. There's not enough money in the world to make me drive a bus. I'm a nervous driver and the thought of operating something that big in town makes me break out in a cold sweat!  I drive tractors all day, but city driving makes me panic. You're looking great!
Ayyy, sign me up 😎 lookin swag btw
Your look is so cool! -also looking at you reminds me of a pretty nice person that I worked with at an ice shop while graduating. She was a really good soul, caring for people and cats. I always enjoyed talking/joking with her.
I thought it was “taking your gender to college” and I thought that was a good idea too. My gender isn’t currently very educated.

I tried on my girlfriend's dress and it made me feel euphoric. This hasn't happened in years. Incredibly based gender development 👅		"Honestly, your girlfriend should just accept that it’s your dress now because it was freaking made for you. The color plays perfectly with those glasses and your hair, how could it NOT be yours? and that’s coming from someone wearing one of their girlfriend’s dresses right this moment (with her permission after I raided what she no longer wore 😈)
You actually look really good in it. The colors match extremely well too!
You looked really cute and comfortable, hope you’re having a good time.
Mad gender envy!! You look great and the cardigan is cute with that outfit too!
I use they/ them pronouns
STUNNING!😱
ahh so awesome! I wear my husband's clothes all the time but I would love if he wanted to (or could lol) borrow my clothes too!
You look incredible! Good choice on the dress!
You are ROCKING that dress! I just hope your GF isn't too jealous of how amazing you look in it.
You look great in it.  👍💕
Hey it suits you well!!
Nice, you look amazing!
Nice, it looks good on you too! My sister was mad when I borrowed her clothes at times in the past, eventually I got my own, but the skirt of hers I used to wear was so nice and good quality! A-line, dark green, denim fabric, maxi length
You look great 🔥 I really like your hair, what do you tell the stylist when you go get a haircut?
she would NEVER let me pry this dress out of her hands, but i'm insisting she puts it in her will for me 😌
Exactly
Yep. Seconded. Cute dress and fits your style perfectly. 👍
thank you!!! ;_;
that's so sweet thank you! i'm wearing it again tomorrow hehehe
thank you so muuuch :'> 💖💖
Thank you!!
you wouldn't believe me when i say it, but she looks even better in it 😩🔥
thank you!!! :>

ugh that sounds fantastic
It's an undercut that's a bit grown out :)
Yup. I don't believe you 😉 wear it with joy!
You're welcome.
It was a really nice skirt! Mind you that was 20 years ago or so when I was 19! My sis was 15 or so at that time when I was borrowing it, wouldn't fit it now since my butt has gotten bigger on hrt!"	rc5t7d	NonBinary	1152	1.0	2021-12-09 01:04:19
The 3 genders: male, female, They/Them/Thier		"r/therewasanattempt to be inclusive, but points for trying at least
Why not just write nonbinary instead 🤦🏽‍♂️
they're a little confused but they got the spirit
I had yesterday: 

""We welcome all genders and races. Please fill out this form to join""

further down:

""Gender

o MALE

o FEMALE""
At least they tried, better then most websites
I applied to a place that had exactly this. (Chain restaurant with a state in its name.)
I'm fascinated that they wrote the pronouns and then never thought about how the other options were not pronouns.
Lol, hey y'know. I applaud them for at least trying
Ah, yes, I am them... Multiple people, you see.
They tried. They tried so hard.
Another day another reducing non-binary to a third gender :(
Covers more bases than saying non-binary and sounds a little better than “other”
The cis be like that 💀💀
Ehhhh. . . good enough to get the point across.
ooh, so close.
*Sigh*
*AHEM* “You can’t just break the English language”
i think other would be best. non-binary can be an umbrella term for genders outside gender binary, but when you propose it as the only three genders it loses that effect
My pronouns are this/that/the other
god bless these tryin gen xers lol
It takes a lot of meetings to schedule the meeting to propose changes to the application form before the meeting to vote on changing the form. Then there's the design meeting to select the possible options on the form before it's sent to committee to have a meeting to....

It's better to just ask for pronouns. I learned the hard by asking a guy what his gender was
I got ""male/female"" and ""miss/Mrs/Mr/master"" for a plane ticket. They were required fields.
I think this was the same chain
imo the best solution to these kind of question (IF they must be asked, but tbh they are usually unneccessary) would be to have ""male"", ""female"", ""nonbinary"" and ""not specified"" at the options. Nonbinary is a broad umbrella term and ""not specified"" (or maybe ""other"" as an alternative?) pretty much catches all other options. Maybe add ""prefer not to say"" as a fith option, because sometimes our gender is no ones business.
""Confidential"" was the best option I saw about that 😂
I like ""other""
you could get away with ""male"", ""female"", ""other"", and ""prefer not to specify"".
Or just straight ""None of your business!""

Kinda nervous to post this. I’ve been questioning and playing with my gender for a while now, I’m not quite brave enough to wear this out in public yet.		"You look awesome tho! Hope youre confident enough some day soon!
That’s a pretty awesome outfit in my opinion lol killin it
You look amazing! I would be hella impressed if I saw someone rocking that outfit.

Don't be afraid to take things at your own pace. You don't need to go all or nothing, you can play with your presentation little by little if you need to in order to build your confidence. Knock 'em dead!
YALL THAT BELT 

I mean that whole outfit is fuckin perfect but THAT BELT
Wow, I think you look incredible!! Amazing outfit! 😍
It counts if you wear an outfit while doing chores.

But also, this is why goth, punk, etc. spaces mean so much to me. It can be rough to dress in a way read as GNC when you’re out around tons of gender conforming cis ppl.

But at shows and dance clubs and even some arts spaces? You can’t “tell” who is dressing up and who is being themselves.

I want us all to be able and safe to wear our favorite outfits out every day, but in the meantime I am so so grateful to have had access to spaces where being a freak makes me cool.
Pretty cool lookin!
Love this outfit. Hope you can wear it out soon.
Good luck! Omg you look fantastic in that btw!
You look stunning!! Love the chocker
You look super cool!
You look cute as heck
Okay, this is a whole damn look and I would love to wear something similar. You’re rocking it!
You look  amazing!!!! Don't be scared to wear whatever makes you comfortable.

I looooove your top!!! You look great!
I like the clock thing on the shelf. Hope all went well, outfit looks awesome.
THAT BELT IS FUCKEN SICK! YOU LOOK GOOD
Ah!! You're so cute!!! Don't worry about being brave enough yet. It's totally ok to wait until you feel ready and safe to start expressing yourself. You are still valid and lovely  💛💜🖤And when you do feel ready you're gonna rock it. 😁😁
Badass aesthetic
🤤
Holy shit you look amazing. The outfit is perfection. You're absolutely killing it. Here's to gaining confidence!
You lookamazing! Take your time, there is no rush. Go out when you are ready

Gender is Optional		"I mean, in a way, he was wishing you gender euphoria.
I’m opting out of gender. Where’s the settings page?
""Enjoy your gender!"" is my new favorite farewell.
Gender is out of stock today, sorry, but we're getting a new shipment in on Tuesday :/
This is adorable. I used to work in a pharmacy, a lot of pharmacists and techs are great people. At my place anyway, they were mostly there to catch the (way more frequent than I would have thought) doctors fuckups, help stressed out patients figure out their shit, and just generally be kind to all the lonely old geezers who needed someone to chat to.

I'm gonna start going by M for a little bit.
gender isn’t fun :/ kinda wanna not
I think in every way
It’s [here](https://youtu.be/dQw4w9WgXcQ)
understandable, have a nice day
I'd feel a bit awkward.
Yeah. He was probably just super socially awkward, like I am.
😐🙄

Ya Rickrolled me. I should’ve known
The thought of being able to opt out of gender made me click so fast. Congratulations, you done fooled me
Poor guy probably took all that extra effort of making unnecessary social interaction bc he wanted to support someone, i feel him
Heehee
I've experienced something kinda similar to him except stupider. Someone said ""See you later!"" but I processed it as ""Have a nice day!"" so I imagine you can guess what I said...

Need to re-dye my hair but am feeling very gender in this		"Looking noice
I want my hair to look like this but in blue/green! Any tips or brands you can recommend?

You look stunning!
Looking great. Are you by any chance familiar with or inspired by Caduceus Clay?
you look amazing! (also i'm delighted to see i'm not the only one enjoying elf ears)
Everything about this image is 💯🔥
The hair + ears immediately gave me Amity vibes.
You look really cute but I NEED that necklace, where did you get it, it's so cool! (≧▽≦)
Love the spell jars! 💫🌿🦷
Yo I want that exact color for my hair! Whole look is tight btw!
Hi, really like your style!
Love your collar (I might have it tattooed on myself)
Kiss
So cute!!
Understandably so, giving off lots of gender envy here ngl
What's in those mini bottles?
Love your shirt, LOVE your hair!
I love your look! That shirt is amazing!
You are indeed looking Exceptionally Gender ™️
Hello NURSE!
Love this look!
how did you get your hair to not lay flat? mine always does
I LOVE EVERYTHING ABOUT THIS LOOK
Gender envy: achieved
You look amazing, OP! I honestly like how the faded hair looks a lot, I'm sure when it's fresh it looks even more awesome
Aw thank you so much! the texture is not from any product that's just my natural locks, as for the dye I've been using Arctic Fox recently, it can fade a bit fast depending on the colour but I still like it a lot because it has a very wide range of colours, it's very environmentally friendly, and vegan
Not that I'm aware of, I'll Google that
I also have the same elf ears, but I want to buy ""fancier"" ones for the next ren faire 😊
I got the transgender symbol necklace off of Etsy let me get you the link, as for the jar spells I made those myself and the chain is just one I got off of Amazon I think
Trans necklace: from this shop https://www.etsy.com/uk/shop/Androlucious

Tiny jar necklace: www.etsy.com/uk/listing/800079315
Jarspells, am a casual witch
Nurse?
Thickness and curls. That's how it is naturally.
It's normally a pretty vibrant purple, there should be some photos of it on my profile when it's freshly dyed
> it can fade a bit fast depending on the colour

No kidding, last year I did my hair half pinkish-purple and half green-blue, and it felt like the green-blue was never going to wash out, but the other half faded too quickly!
Thank you so much ( ꈍᴗꈍ)💕
Apparently I'm old.

Sharing this here because I can't post on my socials	"Hi! I'm Hollis, sorry for awkward unused account, but I started a new one due to it being possibly unsafe to post from my other account since I'm not completely out. 

Anyway, I'm recently out as non-binary/gender non-conforming to almost everyone. My partner and basically all of my friends know, but my family that lives 8 hours away is pretty outwardly transphobic, so I don't really have an opportunity to post about it or change my name online etc. for now. 

I started a new job and I guess I just didn't expect seeing my name tag with my name and pronouns to feel so good. I just wanted to share my excitement with people who would get it 🤠

I've included a selfie cuz why not 🤗"	"That's so cool! Good list of things to enjoy too 😎
This is a great format for a name tag and wish I had one like it just for like normal life and socializing.
You seem like a super awesome person tbh… if you need a friend or emotional support or whatever I gotchu
+20 to your house for the Sailor Moon shirt too
This, and you, are incredible! It’s the little things right!? Go you!😍
As someone who does business online with Noble Knight. Good on em!
Score!   

ngl, I'm the kind of person who's relieved to be at the point where I can take your pronouns on your nametag for granted and just focus on the inexplicable apostrophe for RPGs. Rock on, this is awesome!
thats so rad!!!
Ayyy, that's amazing
That’s so awesome! 💛
Hollis! Love the name, what’s your favorite Pokémon? 🤔
Everyone in the world should wear a name tag like this
You seem like an individual of taste and style, glad to hear you've got this boost 😎
Great name
Hiya Hollis, nice to meet you. Love your style. Good list of things you enjoy 😊
Hollandaise got that sauce
Hell yeah let's go punk rock
Congrats!!! That’s huge! Seeing it printed on something official can feel so so good. Wishing you the best with your new job!
🤘🏼🤘🏼🤘🏼
Wtf do you work at Noble Knight???
my dear friend’s name is Hollis! So cool to see another nonbinary Hollis out there!
Eyyyyy fellow nonbinary Hollis!! We also have very similar interests (though I'm more into musicals/showtunes than punk music, although that is great too) so this is kinda like seeing a strange mirror
I am very happy for you and wish you all the best! I hope the people around you are supportive and help you deal with your transphobic family, even if you never come out to them :)
Yo Mx. what do you think of Fallout New Vegas?
Congrats on the coming out as your true self to almost everyone.

I'm not out to many people so I get the whole not posting on socials (dont think anyone knows im on here)

Lucky you getting to be around your hobbies/interests while making a living too lol
Thanks! I work in the hobby industry, so I'm lucky enough to be surrounded by all my fun interests while making a living 🥰
Honestly yes, should I just wear it everywhere? Maybe add a little ""does not enjoy being touched"" note and we're golden
It's wild how many times I've had my breath taken away by very tiny things like this over the last several months!
Hell yeah! So far I think they seem like an awesome place to work. I just came on as the purchasing manager 🤠
The way my eye twitched when I saw it. Lmao
BIG Mimikyu guy lol. Love that sad little cutie
Would certainly streamline the social interactions I have lol
I do!
Honestly I couldn't have a better support system! Thanks for your positive vibes!!
BIG fan! I'm about to run a fallout-esque Eberron campaign in fact
Yayyyy I love this for you and hope it doesn’t stop!💛Isn’t it crazy how much goodness people can do and spread when they treat us like people instead of freaks!?
Let's pretend it's a possessive or a contraction. ""This newest RPG's class system is ass!""
YEAHHHHHH good stuff! My partner adores Mimikyu. Always glad to see another fan. I love Joltik personally. I want a pocket full
I was just there the other day!!! I looooove how queer it feels and I’ve been trying to spend more time there! Nice name tag!!!!!
Eberron? What's that? 

(And yes I asked cause the name tag had interests)
That's awesome! Vibes are definitely great. I unfortunately won't work in the store front as the purchasing manager, but I'm really happy with the environment so far!
Eberron is a sort of steam punk d&d setting! Sorry, I've worked in the gaming industry so long I operate like everyone knows what I'm talking about sometimes
I've played enough DnD and have nerdy enough friends to get part of it. Please literally tell me everything I'm curious now and needa unwind after a long day at an FRC competition.

What gender neutral names do you think would fit me? I dont care for masculine leaning names. Ft. My handmade estrogen injection bottle earrings! 😀 They/she.		"Idk why but river looks like it would really suit you

Edit: just saw the other comment that says the same thing, apologies!!
Any opinions on August?
Juniper (June or Juni for short), Moss, Basil, Skye
Is Violet too fem?

(Feel free to call me out for picking something obvious because of your lovely purple hair. It's stuck to my brain now though)

I also think Clover or Parker could be good. Love the earring idea
I like Avery for you I think! Lots of great options in here already, too
I think I'm mostly leaning towards june or juniper.🤔

Thoughts?

Regardless, y'all have been so wonderfully helpful❤️❤️❤️
Ive never had such a positive response online to any post before!
I think Erin, Alex, or Valen would suit you.
i feel like Nova would be a very pretty name. i feel like Evelyn (Avi), Maria or Mae would also suit you
Viv/Vivi, Jess, Lynn
Robin maybe? Your hair is super cute by the way.
Morgan, Rain, Moon, X the Eliminator,
Ally maybe? it sounds more feminine than masculine but i’ve definitely heard men whose names were Allan or Alexander been called Ally for short. and it’s a name you could play around with the spelling a lot on
Cool hair :) How about Rae (or Rei) or Raven? Or as I see your current initial is J, you could also go with Jaye, Jae or Jei.
Talynn? 

Jean

Amber (more fem imo)

Lorne
Pocket
Ember!
Idk why but the second I saw you I thought June or Junie but Idk if you’d like it it jus felt right in my head when I saw ya.. but it doesn’t make much sense unless your born in June I guess I think it doesn’t matter tho
Bailey? Its gender neutral but i had a friend who was a girl named bailey growing up so I think it leans more femme but that’s just me
Juno? Mercury? Rowan? Robin? Kerry?
  sage
Kinda getting ""river"" vibes
Tillie
How about Ally or Ali? Also the injection earrings are absolutely incredible I might do the same with my pill bottles
I get Lena, Lana, Leda, Lina sort of vibes 👌🏻
Eider, Mackenzie, Aster
May or Addy
Heather comes to mind for some reason
Ugh, there was a really cool graphic novel in the last year that you're really giving me vibes from and it had character with a name I feel like would really fit you, but I can't for the life of me remember the book or name. So really I've got nothing. You look really cool though!
I'm so excited to finish off my second bottle of T so I can make similar earrings! They look fabulous 😁
i think Erin would be cute!
You really look like a Payton to me! You could also play around with nicknames, like Pay, Tonton- cute things like that! Also, your style is soo cute! <3
I get a real Kelly vibe from you!
Aron. I see an Aron
Ellis, Jay or J! Good luck with your journey :) (ooo maybe Journey??)
Alyx or Alix is what popped first into my mind
Alex? is it to masc.
awesome!!
Lexi?..
I get J or G sound… like…Juneau, Glen, Gilly, Joyce 💜
You look like me but not, so Misti?
Vic, or Vikki, Viki etc
Ashee!!
Sage, Lily, or Joyell
Willby
Eden
Maybe something adjacent to Luna?
Everest. Aerial. Salem. Lyric. Ellis. Eden. Aiden.
moon (idk if thats gender neutral but it looks like thats your name)
Sherbert? idk im not very good at names, gl tho :]
Rynn? Also those earrings are amazing
I love nature type names for neutral names.

Brook
River
Forrest
Fern
Faun
Ferri
Sigourney
Ash
Archer?
fig
Amethyst
First off you look beautiful 💕💜
Names I would pick for you would be something related to space or nature so: Mars, Nova, Star, Luna, Cinder, or River!!
Novalie or Laciya?
julianna, take my deadname
Salt
june, riley
love your earrings by the way!
These names might suit you: Eri, Ali, Emery (i would say jess but thats my name haha) 
Also maybe something nature-y, like Berry, Forest or Winter
A J name, definetly a J name.
Jasmine (more fem but I thought it would fit)
Oooh how about Moss? Something nature related cause your beanie had shrooms on it 

Aspen, Juniper, Fern, Wren, Raven, Robin, Ruby, Pearl…. a gem related name
Rose!
I'm getting Nova or eclipse
River, or Darian..but I'm leaning towards River
So, you look eerily similar to me. We do our hair the same, and seem to have the same fashion sense... So I just dug up my old name shortlist, because it seems whatever suits me might suit you;

* Nebula
* Nova
* Athena
* Zephyr
* Phi
* Autumn
* Callisto
* Vix
I don’t have any ideas but I have to say that I love your hair!
Amanita is a nice name. Idk it's also the name for a genus of mushrooms, so your shroom hat made me think of it.
Infinity, Sasha, Luz
I always loved Lucas... I always tought it was a masculine term but one of my friends sister is named Lucas so I got the confirmation its a gender neutral name :D
Charlie?
100% Taylor
Dani or Ran
Hmm Oslo?
Im super naive with this stuff but has the estrogen changed your daily mood??
Farrah,
Sparrow,
Faye , and
Lex
Kale
Willow
sky/skylar :]
Hmm, I'm feeling Lyric vibes.
Robbie
Eevee is the first thing that came to mind but i'm not sure if its considered neutral
idk if this would lean one way or another but for some reason i thought jett like joan jett even though i'm not wildly sure how others would perceive that name :')
August!
Clover! Or Cloe!
Marion/Marrion is imo a pretty good name with they/she vibes
Omg so cute!!! You look like a Jessie or Kat.
I’m really feeling June
First thought was Iris though it may be more on the femme side. Not sure if that would be a dealbreaker
chloe fits
Sparrow
jessie, rose, casey maybe? It's a little on the masculine side I think but I've always liked that name a lot tbh
Toph
I'm thinking plants, herbs . . . Sage? Juniper?
I’m getting gemstone vibes, maybe something like Jasper or Topaz?
Roz.
Autumn would fit you nicely
amber
Jess, Sera or maybe Diana :) Awesome earrings!!
Clover sounds nice^^
Sage/Saffron (idk why herbs n spices come to mind!) 💜

p.s. maybe Saffron isn’t gender neutral, idk 🤔
carter or roe
Idk why but I though Esther when I saw you! :) if you like more old fashioned names haha and dont mind how fem it is
Sophia
You look like a Juniper or Jupiter :)
Fern
Rose and pearl, not very gender neutral in retrospect but that's what I thought when I saw you
Jade?
Dee?
Eden!
Your earrings are the best
Lex/lexi i'd explane but i don't know why
Hiraeth, Rain/Reign, Seven, Zero, Venus. I hope that helps! <3
jade
when i first saw you i thought of the name jules
I get a Petra vibe!! A bit fem but in a badass, sci-fi way.
For some reason the name Rowan popped into my head as soon as I looked at you! I also love Juniper, suggested by other commenters. :)
* Aspen
* Goose
* Arson
* River
* Lotus
Willow!

I looove June & Juniper- both suit you really well 💜

I agree with Erin!
Oooo nova is cool:)

Or maybe June? My birth month is June and my initials would stay the same with  J.
Btw. Its a year later but wanted to let you know, I went with Juniper lol
I like Vi as a nickname for violet
Lol thank you!!!
My name is Eryn and I love it
Other non gendered names are Birdperson, Sun Eater, Crack Dealer, or Terrorism. Keep the names interesting, don’t let the cishets know your true intentions
Oh snap how perfect! June is lovely for ya junie just means born in June so that is perf too. So odd that THATS instantly what I thought hmmm 🤔universe connection amping up this year?.. hope so lol!
No worries, I'm [in the habit](https://www.reddit.com/r/NonBinary/comments/ptdgok/made_earrings_to_match_one_of_my_favorite_shirts/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share) haha.
So do I, these are also names I've considered for myself being someone who also uses she/they pronouns! ❤
eheheh also nice earrings!
Lol jkjk
Damn, you right.
second this
I dunno why but I really like Pebble.
I like June the most for you I think
maybe juniper could work as well!! i love that name and it suits you
I was thinking you look like your name should start with J! June is beautiful :) or Jessie
Ooooh yes I love that, too!!!
I literally came here to say June… so weird that you were considering!! I say go for it!
June is super cute!! Love it
I think June would fit you nicely
June is one of my favourite names, and I think you do have a June vibe going on, so I vote for it.
Junie or Jeanie!!! I think it’s fun and playful and cute, which seems to fit ur personality!!
They could b nicknames for juniper too!!
June is lovely!!
Gotta keep them guessing!
Lmao, thos earrings are awesome! Also, you're handsome 🥰
P e b b l e
It's smol and unassuming, but surprisingly hard to ignore

I wish it were possible to be SOCIALLY androgynous	"A common thing nonbinary people talk about is wanting to present as androgynous so that people couldn't tell whether they were men or women.

Honestly, giving it more thought, that sounds like the *dream*, and I'm jealous of anyone out there who has truly achieved this effect.

The issue is, I have little interest in physically presenting androgynously. I like having facial hair, wearing gender neutral clothes (which are really just men's clothes when you're AMAB), and I'm naturally muscular/broad, so I'm pretty much doomed to be perceived as a man for the rest of my life. Even if I grow my hair out, painted my nails, feminized my voice and used make-up, I'd still be perceived as a man, just a gay one.

Unfortunately, socially transitioning to nonbinary without presenting as androgynous is impossible. Like, what am I supposed to do? Tell people, ""Hey, could you please just *delete* the part of your mind that sees me as a guy? Great! Thank you!""

I only feel like my gender (or lack of it since I'm on the agender spectrum) can only ever be affirmed by other nonbinary people. I was in a group with them earlier today at my college and it felt significantly less annoying than being considered 'one of the boys' or 'my friend who is a boy.'"	"Within a small group of friends that I have known for 10+ years, yes, being socially androgynous is possible. 

Most of the world just has no idea outside the binary genders.
As an older enby, maybe I can provide a different perspective. 

Before I knew what non-binary was, I was presenting socially completely independent of presenting in a physical way - in certain contexts to certain people.  In a way, they were seeing me more clearly than (at the time) I was seeing myself.  I related to some people in a way that was inexplicable to them (and me) and wasn’t categorized or limited by gender boundaries.  You probably have examples in your own life too.  

How you look is only part of the equation, but finding those affirming social relationships/situations can be difficult.  Part of that is recognizing them when they happen, as well as accepting them for what they are.  Sometimes you have to parse meaning from language that isn’t affirming, because people may not have the vocabulary to describe what is.  Also, sometimes affirming language can be taken the wrong way because of where it comes from or even one’s own toxic internal dialog.  

This isn’t to say appearance / presenting in an authentic way is secondary, but often we present in subtle ways socially and sometimes people pick up on it.  

I’ve had the good fortune of inhabiting spaces/situations “unsuitable” or “unorthodox” for my chromosomes.  Consider if you have as well. There was certainly a lot of bad too, but after some reflection I found the good.   Even the bad can be affirming, as rejection by binary structures can reinforce one’s authenticity.  

The representation of something isn’t the actual. The actual you doesn’t have to present or represent yourself in any specific way.  Even struggling with wished appearance vs reality can be affirming - though I understand that it isn’t much of a comfort.  The thing is, you don’t have to present physically to be “seen”.  It does make it easier for some people, but how you present is for YOU, not them.  

Finally, androgyny comes in lots of forms.  I’m only saying this next part because there seems to be a sense of futility and sadness about appearance.  Please ignore if I’m wrong. 

Silhouette can make a big difference.  Fit and color can help too.   Winter is coming and winter wear lends itself to androgyny.  Leggings, an oversized sweater, and a cute beanie can really work.  Belting the sweater can create hips.  Gloves or arm warmers can make you hands seem smaller.  Layers can really work in your favor too.  At the very least, it’s a cozy way to hang out at home.  

Sorry if this is rambling and all over the place.  It’s a bad brain day for me but I really felt compelled to reply.
I used to want to be referred to as andro until I realized its a binary term... it exists between the binary of man and woman. I am outside of that. The only way for people to see me for who I am is to socially stop labelling people ""man"" or ""woman"" automatically.
Even if you did present in an androgynous way people will still make assumptions.  I’m AMAB, and people are more likely to assume I’m a woman than ask me or guess I’m non-binary. I’m still seen as a man most of the time though.

Your best bet is with queer people especially trans, and non-binary people but it’s no guarantee. Most cis people don’t think about this sort of stuff, and when they do it’s usually a fantasy they made up or misinformation.

Hopefully you get to know more people who will understand who you are, and that will help with most other people not getting you
Same. I’m afab and find the idea of top surgery and changing my beautiful closet of carefully chosen pieces for beautiful outfits very daunting, but I want more than anything to be able to slip in and out of being ‘one of the bros’ and ‘one of the gals.’
This is what really gets me when I am at work ""male to male"" recognition terms like dude, mate, buddy. My friends don't gender me, my family doesn't gender me, I mostly exist in a genderless void and then bam, ""sure thing buddy"" pulls me right back to my hideous male flesh sack.
I hope one day we'll get there. They gender neutral will be as much of a class as male or female, that social customs of behaviour from and towards people without a gender will become as established as those for men and women. I'd love to say, bring on the day where the classes and customs don't exist for any gender, but they seem to be quite important to cis people and I wouldn't want to deny them their gender expression like mine has been. 

I do present androgenous, people do ask me my gender or get it wrong. And I love those moments. Cis people think they've offended me, but I can explain to my friends how awesome it feels to just be free of any judgements or expectations placed on me by my gender. 

I hope that you get to experience some moments like that. It's nice to have them with the queer gang. Bit by bit the rest of the world will catch up.
I'd say try some of the small changes on for size first like you mentioned the growing out hair, make up and nails if you haven't tried them. I personally I perceive them more as things that push you towards androgyny rather then gay male presentation.

Growing my hair out really helped with a lot dysphoric feelings which was a relief so I'd try the small actions first to see if that helps.
Put everyone around you on enough psychedelics that their visual systems stop trying to guess genders from faces. I've had that effect before, and it was really interesting.
Check my profile to see my presentation. Even if you do try to present androgynously, people will try very hard to find anything to push you into one of the binary boxes. Even while presenting as masculinely as possible and I pass perfectly fine, my voice is enough for people to push a label on to me.
I've been having this issue but with voice dysphoria. I want an androgynous voice but it is a narrow line to hit. 

For reference, women have a voice range of 255-165hz to be perceived as female. Men have 155-85hz. The range for people to be unsure of your gender is 165-155hz. That is tiny, and your voice will fluctuate out of that range naturally when speaking.

So I dunno what I'll do yet. Part of me fears how people will perceive and treat me, and this change is permanent so no going back when you start. On the other hand, it sounds kind of cool to have a voice that you can pitch up or down and be perceived as whatever gender you want in the moment.

This doesn't even account for loss of voice quality during puberty and whether you can regain that quality if you stop midway through puberty....
Are we the same person?? Honestly I haven’t had much luck with men not treating me like “one of the boys”, but just being a masc person who doesn’t try to fuck or be weird with any woman who just *exists* has helped with women. I’ve just always been treated better by groups of girls.
Growing your hair out and shaving thoroughly might give you a more feminine look pushing you a bit towards androgyny. Although as you explained that's not quite what you are looking for.

It might help to find a very mixed friend group. Some women, men, and enbys. Then it's less likely that you are seen as one of the guys and more one of the group.
most of my friends are opposite my AGAB for that reason. makes it easier for me to feel like I'm an in between.
I feel this as an AMAB with a beard. I still wear eye makeup and nail polish on accepting circles, which helps me, but it's hard because I work with people with intellectual and physical disabilities, and it's not a concept I bother to bring up there. An elderly individual I work with calls everyone ""big boy"" as a tell of endearment, which sucks. 

I've definitely started hanging out with more accepting people and that's boosted my self esteem in some ways. DnD is also a very accepting place once you find the right groups, and bring able to play whomever you want helps
Social transition without physical transition is possible and still very valid!
Yep. Curvy AFAB here and even with my SEVERAL They/Them pins on my work vest (one right above my name tag)......I STILL get called ma'am/miss. Or Miss Orion. Super frustrating.
Heavily related to this. Although i already have long hair and am not as interested in painting my nails but yeah I’m quite stocky and a bearded amab as well. I know that i would like to get laser removal surgery for my other body hair (whatever isn’t my face and my private areas, i have never enjoyed having body hair everywhere since puberty. Although i have always enjoyed my facial hair. But yeah I’m very afraid that I’m going to get hate crimed if i dress and present in an alternative way to my assigned gender
Yeah, huge agree. My ideal gender experience is that I present however I want (which is often v femme) and no one genders me. No luck so far lmao
As an aside, havinf facial hair and a large body does not preclude androgyny. Look up ""positive"" vs ""negative"" androgyny (I dislike the words themselves, but what they describe is useful)
Saaaaaaaaaaaame!!!
My partner and I are both nonbinary, and we've created a safe space where gender is irrelevant. But outside of our home, it's definitely still a challenge. It is annoying when people who know your nonbinary still treat you as your agab. I do hope for a world that is less caught up in the binary and open to not assuming anyone's gender.
I think I understand what you mean. I don't often care to present androgynously- I love ""feminine"" clothes and colors, and I'd usually rather wear them. But I really wish that I could have people know that I'm nonbinary anyways, instead of the constant misgendering.
The thing is, it’s as simple as cishets (and other cis people) being real allies and unpacking their cisgender structure of society and language. It is *possible* to have people view you as a person first, and then not assume your gender identity based on appearances. I have had interactions with some cis people where they were able to not push a gender onto me from the get go. But most cis people enforce this societal structure on themselves and everyone around them every single day, sometimes every single moment. It’s ridiculous to me how much gender is mentioned or applied when it isn’t relevant. It’s not on us to do the work, it’s on cis people to stop forcing a social construct onto anything and everything they see. Non-binary people are just way better at doing that. And so are many trans people, although I know that transmed people exist and sometimes disregard non-binary people and their thoughts and identities.

What cis people don’t usually understand, I think, is that this will literally benefit all of them to express themselves and their gender more truthfully as well. It’s literally a win for everyone who matters, and the only ones against it are discriminatory and enjoy the way society discriminates on the basis of gender.
What helped me is meeting knew people who only knew me as nonbinary and have only known me as using they/them pronouns.
this resonates so much with me. I’m working to appear gender ambiguous to attempt this social transition to nb and man it’s fuckin hard. my voice, my mannerisms, it’s like everything about me that isn’t my appearance still gives away my agab…
The one place I've had real success is online. When people can't see your face or body and can't hear your voice, there aren't so many assumptions to be made. I volunteer with OTW (who run AO3) and so many of us are queer and even nonbinary, it actually let's me be... me.
Have you considered hormonal therapy? <:)

You have androgynous vibes through the post if that makes ya feel better! /genpos 

I totally understand that struggle tho :( sorry you have to go through that it’s not fun /gen
I'm a very curvy afab and the degree to which I relate to you is SO strong. Like. No. Don't perceive me as female. Make is better but still wrong
Spend enough time with other nonbinary people and it's totally possible to create another category of gender in your brain. Sadly many of The Cis will not see you that way, but fellow nb people will, and good allies. I see my fellow nonbinary friends as nonbinary no matter their presentation. I dated a trans woman who at the time identified as agender, had not had medical transition, and wore ""men's"" clothes. It still felt different to me than dating a cis man, she didn't have a \~man\~ vibe in her personality.
That's why I want to buy a binder, for example. I finally managed to find some good fits. But boobs = woman.
And even then some women wear men's clothes, right? So.. yeah.. I kinda want to be called ""sir"" at least once or see someone being just unsure.
I'd love to be able to be as androgynous as possible ❤️
I feel the exact same way excet I'm afab. All I can hope for is that at least my close friends will treat me that way one day. I'm so over society treating me loke a woman because of how I look, and I like how I look. I just wish I was seen by everyone as in between...
i feel like i have social androgyny but it might be harder for AMAB people
I have transitioned physically to a middle ground and I generally wear clothing that's neutral or androgynous, however it hasn't helped socially at all. I'm still either perceived as male or as female, just weird looking enough to get transphobic harassment. I still have to constantly come out to new people and almost all still misgender me as whichever they initially saw me as 

I also wish it were possible
Have you seen the SNL character Pat? After watching that and seeing the potential comments you’d get from people trying to work out you biological gender ….. you may think twice
2 suggestions:

1) Be active online under a feminine or androgynous name (andro names tend to be assumed masc, so caveat emptor)

2) I'm really thinking of getting an androgynous if not outright female fursuit.
I'd say that I pass as Androgynous somewhat well. I've noticed some people will either guess M/F, Use neutral, or just ask. It really all depends on what you're going for.
Categorizing people into the binary genders is so ingrained into our society that it really doesn’t matter if you look “neutral”, unfortunately. I know a couple of people, including myself, who can achieve that effect of confusing people, but in everyday life cis people will just try to find one or another characteristic to choose if you’re A or B to them. When I and the SO go out we’re girls to people because hair and makeup even though no tiddies, when they’re not wearing makeup sometimes they’re read as a guy, my hair mostly makes people call me a she and I never know if they’re clocking me or if they think I’m a cis woman. It sucks, but I guess all we can do is be ourselves and hope this binary structure gets at least more flexible in people’s minds in the future.
Hanging around with other non-binary people is great 😊
This is one of the only reasons only my closest family and friends are allowed to use she with me. She/they/fae are my pronouns. I like she, it makes sense to me.

But you won't catch me dead in public with a she/they pin. I'm not giving anyone permission to see me as a woman. They/them or nothing for strangers.
I hear you. I would love it if everyone jut defaulted to 'they/them' for me, and was able to just see me for who I am.  But  the society I live in is overwhelmingly binary, and the typical first impression most people get of me is 'butch lesbian', or rarely, 'twinky gay man'  both of which are incorrect on multiple levels. Those that know me, those that matter most to me, they see me and understand me. But it would be nice to not have to explain in order for people to see me and understand me, to just be taken as I am as a first impression.  Not gonna happen, but I can dream.
It works if you are in a queer community. I don't really have a problem perceiving people as nonbinary no matter how they appear. The trick is to only know queer and trans people. Maybe that sounds impossible, but I generally spend nearly all my time in the company of queers, so it is possible to find.
thank you for posting this, i literally write about this all the fucking time but haven’t been able to actually… get the words out right, i guess. i actually even got banned from another non-binary subreddit bc i was trying to ask about this & was upset with people telling me that i needed to effectively go back to starving myself or else i’d “always be a woman” & “wouldn’t be androgynous without severe intervention”.

all i wish is that presentation didn’t matter. nobody’s presentation matters to *me*, really. i just wanna be able to be whatever i say i am in the moment; i just wanna be genderless. but my body is so sexed that it even hypersexualizes baggy men’s clothes, & that’s all people in both cis & trans spaces focuses on.

fuck the haters, we’ll get there one day. we have to. 💛💜
I relate to this. Physically I want to transition to a masculinized body, I want a flat chest and the bottom bits. But socially I want to be seen as non-binary, or like, close to man but not quite. Both gender boxes are awful and I wish The Cis would see me as non-binary. Though not like they did when I was an egg kid. It's funny (read: depressing) that people knew I was different *so they isolated me completely*, both girls and guys. So like, I mean see me as different in a welcoming way, to be exact.
Agreed, I like being sexually female but would prefer social androgyny
this is so relatable 🥲 i feel this so heavily but on the AFAB side
Personally I don't identify as either but I too like having a beard (don't like how I look like a teenage girl without one even though I'm 26 lol) so I kind of relate, but when I use the bathroom or whatever it's just easy to default to being a man, I'm very hairy all over so any time I wear shorts or short sleeves everyone can tell what sex I am.
I absolutely relate to this, but I guess on the opposite end? I present pretty femininely/feminine leaning, and I like when I can recognize I look pretty, but at the same time I wish others would see me as androgynous
FWIW I've had a bit of success here by playing fast and loose with how I refer to myself. I'm AFAB and present femme but I say shit like ""you can try to lift me up but i am a Big Boy"" or ""this kid just kicked me in the dick"". Sometimes people try to ""correct"" me but once I explain they generally roll w it and after a while they might do the same.
I can say, it will be a possibility someday. For the time being I have to be perceived either as a transfemme, a gay guy or an old lady. It wasn't the idea I had, but in the end it's still androgyny. Would love to be perceived as, something neutral. But it hasn't happened to people's minds yet.
Stay on reddit.
I say lean into your enby friends, and allow them to help you in this way. If your core group is all enbies and people who truly understand who you are, then as your social circle spreads it will be more as who you truly are, not as a misconception of you. For some folks they refuse to even consider the idea that their views on the world and other people could be slightly off, but those people make for shite friends anyways :p
Keep doing what you're doing. One day, a child will come up to you and say ""Are you a boy or a girl?"" and it will be the only affirmation you'll ever need. I'm AFAB, giant tits, like I think I couldn't look more feminine, but one time, a kid couldn't tell, and that was all I've ever needed. 🧡
hey sweetness, so sorry you feel like you’ll be misgendered your entire life 😔 it’s really not fair that our natural appearance causes people to gender us and treat us according to that assumed gender. it’s a daily battle and i feel for/with you ♥️

in my personal journey, i’ve come to a place that i daily have to let go of people’s perceptions of me. but if you’re directly in my life, i will communicate my gender and pronouns. it’s THEIR perceptions that matter most to me because they affect my daily experiences. and so even though it can uncomfortable, i muster the strength to tell anyone that comes into my circles and environments. there are a lot of non-binary people in the world, cis people will need to learn to adjust eventually. if they’re in your life, they should make an effort to see/treat you the way that you want. your true self. hopefully, you’ll get to the point that you almost always have that sense of comfort that you did with your enby friends. you can tell those people, “i’m not one of the guys or your guy friend”. whatever you’re comfortable with! i just want to encourage you to communicate with the people in your life so you can more comfortably be your authentic self 🌟
I have spent my life with people asking if i am male or female ( i am 45)
Women leaving the restroom to check if they are in the right restroom, kids asking their parents if i am a boy or girl, adults calling me sir or ma’am, it’s exhausting
People just have no clue
> and I'm naturally muscular/broad, so I'm pretty much doomed to be perceived as a man for the rest of my life

have you considered hormones? SERMs specifically
I get this with kids, they don't know if im a boy or a girl...because of my short hair and boy clothes.... I know thats just stereotypes that they put on they think is a boy or a girl but it some what comforts me knowing that got no idea what I am.
Well it is and we are!
I present androgynous & most people I meet cannot tell what gender I am. They still default to she (usually) or he (rarely)--over 90% of the time. Those other moments when someone defaults to they make life feel so much better. I just wish that was the normal thing to do, rather than guess which of their boxes I seem more like in their brains.
At some point, I stop seeing my friends as their physical form- they evolve past it. I don't know how else to describe it.

So, often when trying to describe a friend to someone else, I come up with nothing helpful. And it comes out like ""Uh. He's like shortish, but he like owns it. He kinda walks with a hop and has short hair. He dresses- uh, like regular? Baggy jeans, and a much too large button down and rides the bus.""
I definitely agree. My core group of friends is 4 people including me, with a few others that join us now and again. We consist of 2 enbies, a trans woman and our “token cishet guy” (don’t worry, he’s my fiancé and enjoys that joke). Us enbies definitely have social androgyny at this point.
THIS my friends got that totally on their own, i get clumped up with the guys sometimes and other times with the girls. Example: We were preparing for a vacation trip on foot and everyone was considering 3 guys for carrying the heaviest stuff. Our group was 2 AMAB and 3 AFAB, Guess who the third guy was!
Gender euphoria at it's finest
""The representation of something isn’t the actual. The actual you doesn’t  
 have to present or represent yourself in any specific way.  Even   
struggling with wished appearance vs reality can be affirming - though I  
 understand that it isn’t much of a comfort.  The thing is, you don’t   
have to present physically to be 'seen'""

The classic ""map vs territory"" fallacy! Man this gets into some epistemology and metaphysics of gender if you think about it too hard (a common failing of mine). I really need to read more philosophy of gender and sexuality for better language on the topics
And for people to stop assigning certain attributes or conditions to each binary. Uhggg it’s annoying bc the weak feeble human brain of today wants to categorize things in a simple way, no grey areas just black or white. It’s stifling and difficult to deal with when it’s the vast majority that is this way.
Yes! I like to dress ""feminine"" because I enjoy the colors and textures and flow of female clothes. I dont hate my breasts. I bind sometimes, but overall i think they balance out my body proprtions nicely. I just dont want to be seen as a girl. I am simply,, not a woman,,, and it sucks that i cant be my authentic self and ALSO be treated and seen as i want to be.
Exactly!
>I'd love to say, bring on the day where the classes and customs don't exist for any gender, but they seem to be quite important to cis people and I wouldn't want to deny them their gender expression like mine has been.

Dang, that hit hard. You are very right, as well as for our trans brothers and sisters 🍺
Yeah, I'm growing my hair out right now! I'm really impatient lol. Also, I'm black, so it's going to take extra long for it to get to a satisfactory length for me to define my curls.

I've always just wanted to be able to play with and flick my hair and to have it flow in the wind. I really struggle to understand why people like short hair lol.

I don't think my parents are expecting me to get such long hair, so that'll be a *fun* conversation. Hopefully, they don't make the connection.
I guess it's more just about wanting to be unlabelled *inside* other people's brains, as well as them not wanting to label me either. That would be lovely.

I don't know anything about Pat, but I take it that they actually do identify as a man/woman? I think that people should just accept nonbinary and move on.
>I'm really thinking of getting an androgynous if not outright female fursuit.

... What?
I have, but I don’t think I really want them.
Yeah. I have people I've been friends with since childhood and most days I couldn't tell you their eye color without thinking about it for a second (I don't like making eye contact lol). But I can tell you all about their personality and who they are to me!
I haven’t read anything gender specific.  The quoted bit is probably most influenced by The Society of the Spectacle.  There’s a lot to unpack in it, especially through the lens of social media (or more conventionally advertising and consumerism). 

Do you know of any serious works that explore gender?  I’d be curious to read a synopsis.
sweet :) Theres like an annoying phase that lasted for a while but once you get to a good length for me that was past my shoulders you can do all kinds of things with it and vary it for how you feel and if you ever feel uncomfortable presenting androgynously in a situation like travel or a meeting tying it up is really nice and way less effort then having short hair ever was.
The SNL Pat character, from the early 90's, never self-identified, and that was part of the joke.  The other characters would struggle with what to call Pat and would try to get them to give some definitive clue as to their sex.  I find it offensive today, but I don't remember finding it offensive 30 years ago.  This is a good example:

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xV4kBndQJlE
Fursuit, like a mascot costum but specifically anthropomorphic animal based. Have... have you not heard of furries?
This particular friend I was describing snuck up on me while I was trying to explain to his coworker who he was.

Once his coworker realized he said ""You could have just said 'The black guy'. He's the only one.""

But I guess I don't think that's a distinguishing feature.

He is also the only person to regularly forget that I am a girl (AFAB, identifying as whatever, masc personality) so I feel like it was a satisfying friendship.
Judith Butler is a name I hear a lot for theory of gender, there's also Beauvoir's The Second Sex for a reflection on femininity and gender through the lens of mid-20th-century existentialism. I think Foucault is also quoted in a lot of queer studies, not sure though. I'm sure folks in the queer theory world have better lists!
I'm getting towards the end of that annoying phase right now, and god it's so nice to be able to actually do things with my hair now.
Oh yeah...
I'm in that annoying phase and I just want it to end. I'm *exactly* chin length when I pull a strand from the top of my head forward, but it's really thick and surprisingly curly. There was no sign I had curly hair before I grew it out. I use *two* products daily to try and hold it down without making it crunchy, but it just wants to expand in all directions.

Shoulder-length now please!
Easiest way to be ungendered or the opposite gender afaik.
I'm the same way, with the thick unexpectedly curly hair. Once it gets a bit longer, you should look into getting a straightening brush. Straightening my hair helps it hold way better than any product I've tried.
\[AMAB, they/he\] I'm debating trying to grow my hair out for that exact reason, I end up with a mushroom head of hair and it never seems to want to grow ""down"" haha"	xsqiyn	NonBinary	1116	0.99	2022-10-01 09:01:32

Saaaaaame. The rest of the days are ‘anxious but [something]’
There’s room for everyone!
Yeah it is, I’m still trying to find a good outfit for it  though
i honestly thought you were my Age lol (17)
Oh oof
Thank you!
Sometimes it’s a winning combo of sad but anxious
Can you buy this jacket somewhere?
Edit: just read that its apparently from wish, thanks
I’m considering getting some of the fabric to make some kind of bottom half garment to match it.  I will definitely mostly be rocking it with crop tops for sure though! The shorts really don’t look as great IRL sadly 😔
Oh bless you I am 34!!!
Oof??? It is cool that it’s pan colours though, love my pan pals 😊
Or anxious but sad. That’s the real fun one, lol
I also know you can get it off a store called forever online

Edit - here’s the link 
https://www.storenvy.com/products/16819365-transparent-rainbow-jacket
Wow , i hope i look like you at 34 lol
😊
Solidarity and love to you my sad sibling 💜
I paid £4 + £3 postage for it on wish!
I’m sure you’ll look as awesome as you do now!"	g7i71f	NonBinary	1099	0.99	2020-04-24 22:35:11
Feeling that gender euphoria! (they/them)		"omg the contrast between the pink of your shorts and top with that pop of turquoise in your necklace and nails!!! I LOVE! you look so cute! 💜💫
yooo i love the colors and the general outfit, wearing small clothes underneath a big coat is a LOOK that im here for
Yeeee so cute!
Oh hell yes. That’s a look.
I love the colour choices. Turquoise especially is a personal favourite.
I'm so jelous of how your rocking those shorts with that cute ass belly. I got the pouchy flops lol.
Cuteeee!!
So fabulous! And may I say I see you ROCKING high wasted shorts, if they feel right to you of course <3
Stunning!! Loving the coral top and shorts with that turquoise necklace!
your rocking that outfit , you look amazing.
This outfit knocks. You're super fn hot.
Pink looks great on you!
Maybe try shaving your chest, might help with euphoria like it did for me, but dysphoria and euphoria works differently for everyone
Thanks!!! 🥰🥰🥰

Thanks! ❤️❤️❤️

Thanks!! I will keep my eyes out for the right pair 😁

Nervous about sharing my writing with no gender construct	"So, I’m writing a novel. I hate having to be nervous about sharing it because the world it takes place in has no gender construct. I don’t use he or she at all, I use sei/sem/ser (pronounced like “they” except with a distinction between plural and singular, verbs are singular). I just… couldn’t really write binary gendered characters. My mind doesn’t work that way.

I’ve gotten pushback about this from all sides… the only people who haven’t been rude to me about it are people who only read it because they pitied me about something else…

Anyway, here’s two of the characters. They won’t get that intimate until maybe book 3, if at all, but…"	"Go for it, all genre bending novels were criticised initially before becoming classics, if nothing else the image intrigues me
My partner has just finished writing his book in a fully nongendered. He's gotten a little bit of pushback from someone who doesn't even know any trans people, but... That's not who he wrote the book for. He wrote it for himself, and for me, and to give the nonbinary community something to immerse themselves in, and to show the world it can be done. Fuck the haters, they would find something else to pick on, but write the book the way YOU want to
On that pushback- I’d respond this way. 
“That’s a really weird thing to get hung up on in a fictional work.”

Personally I think the pronoun grammar is a nice touch.
No gender construct is best gender construct.
I'd definitely read it! And a lot of popular novels now a days are using neopronouns, and nobody is pushing back. Books like *The Long Way to a Small Angry Planet* by Becky Chambers, or *Black Sun* by Rebecca Roanhorse. Granted I've never read a book completely in neopronouns... but someone has to push that envelope!
I'd happily read a book like that so long as there was a section laying out stuff like pronouns etc. :)
You're in good company! One of the most popular books by the renowned Ursula K LeGuin, *The Left Hand of Darkness*, is about an ambisexual, genderless society.
I would read the fuck out of this!
It makes sense to be nervous about sharing your art in general so your feelings are totally valid. I don't see why it would be a problem though, it's not like it would be that confusing if at all. At worst you could just put an author's note at the front of the book explaining that your book avoids gender constructs and how your setting differs from the real world.
Based on the picture alone, dear god do I want to read this 😍
I think it sounds like a great book! 

If you're not sure about the reaction you're going to get with talking about it though you could always frame it as a literary experiment. Lots of writers do that sort of thing
im pretty sure The Unraveling by Benjamin Rosenthall? i think is his name also did something like this! gendered pronouns were used but for different types and none of them were traditional binary genders. that book had almost a 5.0 on storygraph!
Hey, I’m writing a far-future SF novel in first person where the narrator’s gender is never indicated in any way. So you’re not alone in writing genderless characters. 

The literary world needs more works featuring nonbinary characters. It’s really sad that the only truly well-known literary work in that regard was published in 1969. (Specifically, Ursula K. LeGuin’s *The Left Hand of Darkness*.)

As for readers being rude about your characters being fundamentally nonbinary, those who would do that are one, poor choices for test readers, and two, probably not your friends. Based on the art, I presume you’re writing either fantasy or science fiction (or some combination of the two), and any reader who actually appreciates those genres shouldn’t be rude to an author for creating a non-gendered world. Not more than fifty years after a novel with that premise won the two most prestigious awards in sf/f literature (again, *The Left Hand of Darkness*, which won both the Hugo and Nebula awards for Best Novel; the Hugo is decided by fans, and the Nebula by fellow writers, so winning both means both camps really liked it).
Thank you for all the kind responses~ I like… never get that many comments on things. Two short stories from two series are [here](https://archiveofourown.org/users/FiammettaRey/works?fandom_id=2692), as is the first bit of the first chapter of the thing I’m working on now… I’m planning to get a first draft done, then edit the first part of it and post as a draft for workshopping, then edit more and start serializing the book in January. *Might* not happen according to plan, but…
I would 100% read that. As u/philnicau said, so many great novels were criticized initially before becoming classics. Don’t let that discourage you!
The point of stary writing is to break the norms. SO TAKE THE WREKING BALL MASTERPIECE YOULL MAKE AND BREAK DOWN THE SOCIAL GENDER WALL!
I am absolutely interested in this. I thought about the idea of a world with no gender constructs but I never wrote about it. You have serious courage and you’re following your heart! Let me know when it’s out so I can read it!! 🥹🥰❤️
Ohhh, omfg I love that art, can I read it?? I love that idea and I've always wondered what it would be like to read a story with no gender 😌

Plus if it gets intimate I'm excited! 😋
I’d love to read it!
Omg this is beautifullllll
There will always be people who have trouble connecting with your art no matter how many things you do to try and make them happy, at the end of the day (imho) art is YOUR expression, and there are tons of people who will connect with it, who will feel things experiencing your art, people who will see your art as genius. 

I’m a musician, not an author, so some of my views on art might not translate super well for you, but the jist of what I’m trying to say is that your target audience is incredibly important when making art, posting here is already a great way to start finding that audience. Your target audience is important not only because they will like your art, but also because they will give you valuable criticisms and help you grow as an artist.

Example of what I mean: when I make a funny song and show it to a serious friend they will want me to make the song more serious in their criticisms, but if I show it to a goofy friend they will help me come up with jokes, recommend sound effects, and overall make me more excited to make something cool rather than feeling bad about not reaching expectations.

Wishing you luck in your endeavours :) I recognize how difficult writing can be, mad respect for already coming so far.
Pretty
i think that this is a great idea, and people really should be worried about things other than whether or not a fantasy novel has gender constructs or not.

(also, the art is amazing!! did you draw this yourself??)
Honestly I love this and I imagine lots of other trans and enby folks will as well
This sounds like an amazing concept and the vibes of that art are fantastic!
this is cool as hell, makes my gendered story world featuring a couple of nonbinary characters seem lame /lh

seriously, this sounds cool as hell! i would totally read a book written like this.
I qould read the fuck out of it. Don't worry about demand, just get the right lgbtq nonbinary marketer
My sibling--do you know just how many awards ancillary justice won? The main character looks at someone in the first chapter and says ""she was a male, I could tell by the beard."" Don't sweat it. Write difficult-to-read, mind-expanding stuff. 💜
I love this idea!! Genderless world sounds like a world I’d want to live in - even if it’s just my imagination while reading a book. Please don’t give up. You have all of us supporting you and wanting to read it!!
There will always be an audience for your writing, no matter what it is.

If it helps, I'm  non-binary writer too. Hope to make it my career. I've added *plenty* of trans and non-binary people to my works about human and non-human beings.

If people can read about aliens that don't even appear human, they can read about a genderless society. 

Your art looks awesome and is giving me gender envy. 

So don't let a few voices drown out the people like me who would absolutely love to read something like this.
Awesome. I have experience in this type of writing but we had not completely managed to kick the binary fully. Part of my frustration was that we were givin the parameter of continuing to use masc pronouns. I think I could pull it off better now than I did at the time. In fact, I'm playing with the idea of revisiting original fiction with atypical gender.
As someone who is somewhat agender (demifeminine), reading something like this would make me feel euphoric I think. Also, it would help me learn how to use neopronouns grammatically, since I’m struggling with how to use them correctly
Oh this sounds interesting, if you ever published it I would try get my hands on it(..and fail, since I'm broke af) Also that art is stunning, I find watercolour hard to use but the effect is certainly unparalleled.
Please give the artist credit
[removed]
That is beautiful
This artwork is beautiful. I’d love to read that!
this sounds so cool!!! omg !! i would love to read it!!!
Oh my goodness, this looks amazing 🤩
they’re hot 🥵. on a more serious note, anyone who’s been rude to u about this is clearly just not part of ur target audience and that’s fine. they are limiting themselves, not vice versa. 

i’m curious if besides the lack of gender norms, are the people in ur novel humans? like do most people still have the typical reproductive parts? or is that something you leave more ambiguous? i just think about why gender norms exist and i think like any other complex topic it’s because of the binaries we create as a result of our perception of reality. most people perceive reality to be that you have a penis or a vagina and one makes u a man and the other makes u a woman. since the human mind understand things better in a binary we latch on to explanations of complex topics that require the least amount of thought. we could ask “what does it mean to be a man or a woman?” (and by extension anything inbetween or outside of those 2 descriptors) as a philosophical question but it’s easier to say man have penis woman have vagina. so what has occurred in this society in order for those same assumptions to not occur? what happened to show these people the merit of the more difficult path?

i don’t necessarily expect answers to these questions they were just some thoughts that popped into my mind that seemed worth mentioning. i’m sure you’ve put lots of thought into this world you’re building, if you want someone to read it who who won’t be rude i gotchu.
Seems like a cool concept!

I'd read it
I love the idea and I’d love to read it one day ❣️❣️
Write the book you want to read.

I guaruntee you won't be alone in your tastes.
Ahh thank you~

Yeah, I’m trying, just… I worry about conversations just going bad with someone when I share it.
Oooh, what Book is it ? It sounds interesting
Agreed
Interesting. Who gave you the parameters? Were you writing for a larger project?
I guess they generally have a subject form, object form, possessive form, and maybe… I’m dumb, I don’t know what to call like… object possessive? I/me/my/mine.

In English. Other languages are all different. Japanese, for example, doesn’t conjugate pronouns at all. Or verbs. (Historically, first person pronouns have been considered gendered, but in my experience, they really aren’t anymore. I’ve known a ton of males who use “watashi”/“atashi” and females who use “boku”/“ore”). French, Spanish, Italian, et. al. use gendered 3rd person pronouns for inanimate objects. Latin also genders inanimate objects, but it does have a “neuter”… really, English as a language is just NB-phonic because “non-gendered = it = non-human”… I really wish more people understood that that is a construct of the English language. 

Anyway, yeah, some people might not specify possessive cases, since the standard format tends to be “subj/obj” (e.g. “she/her” “they/them”). Also, since traditional English m is “he/hi**m**/hi**s**” but f uses “her” for both… but then you get “hers” and “theirs” (“this is **my** book, it’s **mine**”/“this is **his** book, it’s **his**”/“this is **her** book, it’s **hers**”)

Basically, mine are they/them/their/theirs but without the th (which is a rare consonant anyway). They could be pronounced just like that, like say/sem/sair, or more like he/him/her (see/sim/sir). 

I’m… just not into x’s or z’s…

I *might* do a thing where pronouns show other things, like intimacy (like the 2nd person tu vs usted in Spanish, or 1st person stuff in Japanese), but I don’t know yet. 

/long, and tons of people have probably said all of this way better than me. Do people still like that “dog is a gender” video, or is that wrong now?
Ahh I’m going to serialize it on a free site like AO3. Maybe Wattpad too. Not sure yet, but that’s how I’ll do it, at least for a while.
I’m the artist.
I know you meant well with this comment, but calling someone else's pronouns ""nonsensical"" just because they're personally hard for you to parse/aren't widely accepted is antithetical to trans solidarity and quite frankly has no place in this sub or any other. We aren't here to be embraced by the general public -- we're here to be who we are unapologetically. Just a thought.
Maybe try to find non-binary beta readers first?
There will be bad conversations, with everything in life. But that doesnt mean they need to be focused on beyond sifting out some proper criticism from the negativity, and using it to strengthen your talents.

Cause, you can't just go and focus on the bad if theres even just a sliver of good. It's not productive, even if its difficult.

Edit to say this is coming from a personal place, as I've been playing various instruments for about 15y and have had plenty of bad comments, but eventually learned to focus on the people who uplift me about my shy talent
Even if they go bad, it's just new insights into something you could teach them. That's how I think about it, it has to start somewhere that we all build understanding and respect.
Yes. I was cowriting a fan fiction and we used the conventions of the published work. The published auther helped us edit it and publish it as a shared world book -- the first a several.
This is actually quite helpful thank you!
Ah! In that case, I love it!- a fellow non-binary artist
Here's another thought.

You seemed to focus on the first sentence I wrote and ignored the rest. You've got to understand that'd led me to not taking your comment too seriously.

We are talking about a character, in a book. Trans solidarity is not equal to complacency, and I do have a voice, which I will use to express myself.

But yes, do tell me to not express myself. Solidarity. I'm sure you meant no harm. Just. A. Thought.
You cannot honestly sit there and tell me you expect everybody who's trans to do exactly what you want them to, right? Not face any sort of criticism, even if it's healthy?

And you're trying to tell me what I wrote was problematic. 

Lol. Just lol.
I bet there's a sub where enbys hang out
Ahh that’s nice, though~ I wish I could work on a collaborative project lol. Maybe someday…
You’re welcome ^_^;; ehehe I hope it’s not terribly wrong
You're arguing with a brick wall right now. Criticizing neopronouns is not healthy nor is it constructive considering how many trans people use them and incorporate them into the art they create. Trans solidarity is about respecting the members of our community, not calling them nonsensical and thinking that's support on your end. If those were OP's pronouns would you feel better talking down on their usage? Get a grip."	x4drb0	NonBinary	1078	0.99	2022-09-02 22:02:17
What name suits me? Going by Leon rn, but I don't really like it :/... I prefer gender neutral names and maybe something that sounds more, idk... powerful? I use they/them pronouns btw ☺️		"I can’t think of a name, but wanted to tell you that you have such thick and lovely hair!
You look like Sparrow would be your name, hope this helps, friend!
Also, I used to go by Nova for a while and alot of my irl friends have told me that they really like that one. Opinions?
I WANT HAIR LIKE THAT
i've seen Silas here and I'm a big fan!! If you're going for more dramatic flair, Ares, Mars, and Jupiter all are names of Gods and planets (and I've seen on a range of nonbinary people) - Theseus could be a powerful name, but is pretty masc. 

Sol is such a nice name, and if you're genderfluid in your presentation you could use Solomon on masc days and Sol on neutral/fem days!
Coruscant, Cory or Cort for short, and Croissant when baked.
Leander. 😊
Lex.
definitely Alex. i know it’s cliche af but you look like an Alex.
atlas :)
Weylin? I LOVE YOUR JACKET AAHH

Holy shit, you’re super handsome and pretty at the same time
Ares, Nova, Helios, Viscount, Mercy
You can't go wrong with celestial names.
Aries?
[deleted]
Maybe I'm unhelpful but, I look at you and think Jareth from labyrinth. 🤩 
Or Spence...
Zenith?
When looking for names I found “Sterling” very tempting … went with another name for family reasons in the end. I still think it’s great though
i met a Savvy recently said save v...
I feel like Ares would be perfect, but that’s just a theory…
I think Hawk sounds really good for you (:
Finn
The first two that came to mind were Aster and Ghost
[removed]
if there's a reason you don't like nova but you still want a cool space name, you could go with quasar. if not that, you could name yourself like me, and take the name of a mineral, rock, element, gem, etc. and make slight alterations to it (I've found that rocks and stuff are some of the things that people least associate with a masc/fem spectrum) for example my name is ""komatii"" based in the mineral ""komatiite"".
Wren or Ryn, Reid, Kai, Cyrus/Silas, Sybil, Syd.
lex or jasper !
Ray
Unique
Rai
nova or somethibg spacey makes sense in my mind
Why not Lion?
Don't have a name but I like that theorist drip
Jagger, Dawson, Ash, Val, Phoenix, Kadin, Quinn

Victory?
Rox
1. goddamn you look good

2. i’d have to say rowan or robyn
LOVE THE HAIR, LOVE THE JACKET
lime maybe?? also I love the jacket
raven !!!
Raven?
Grouse

My name is feminine and I like it, but when I don’t feel feminine, I use my nickname, which is Mars. It sounds neutral.
Ash
Felix
Alex
Cruz
Rin
Jordan
Sam
Bread
Nat/Nate
Elli
Em
Scoot/scooter
Sky
Ore, Decay, Arc, Level. Love the game theory merch!
Bones or just straight up your zodiac sign
I love your hair! Some names that I feel that ""Theo"" (means God), or ""Havoc"" (means chaos and destruction) suit you the most! Just my opinion! <33
Leo?
Euhm hi! Looking at u makes me so nervous lol ur so fucking beautiful/handsome 😩🥺 i love the name nova ☺️
Oh please Kaz suits you so well
Lazerath
Cole? I know it’s not gender neutral but it is the first name that came to mind
[deleted]
I've never been good at naming, just wanted to say that you're really attractive. Have a good day!
Ziya or Zion, btw you’re really fucking cool :3
Griz
Ashtyn
You look like a Trinity to me. Love the sweater btw!
Lavender....idk  if it's good but it's the first thing that I thought...
Lius
Idk what name suites you but you look sooo coooool
Noel. Yes I just reversed your current name. 😋
I'm so jealous of your hair.
- Aries/Mars
- Quinn
- Ziv
- Xen
- Vesper
- Orion
- Delta


I couldve misinterpreted what you meant by ""powerful"" but these are the names I think would fit you!! Also i really like ur hair :) i hope you have a nice day/night!
Maybe Leo? Is that gender natural? And you also look amazing! I hope you'll find a name that will suit you the best... Have a wonderful day 😄
Josie/Josiah
Apollo? Luna? Hex?
I looked at you and my brain immediately fired off the name Kilian. ^_^
Powerful name?

Rocket
Phoenix
Yo, Neo/Neon?
I’ve been thinking about going by Jona or Jonah, it’s traditionally male but i think it can go either way
Radish like the veggie
Danae
For some reason you look like a Max or a Alex or maybe even Ian?

Although i gotta admit the name ""Nova"" defiantly sounds better than my suggestions...
I know it's not exactly the character's hairstyle, but my first thought was Rogue.
Skylar
I agree with everyone else who’s suggested Raven…
But that’s just a theory, a NAME theory!
Robin.
""Ari"" would suit you. It's a strong name with roots in hebrew.

And can I just say that your hair looks otherworldly fabulous? Because it _does_! Amazing look💖
Ash/Ashley or something like that I don't really have a supportive mom and my dad moved state so...umm yeah I really got nothing sorrys
[removed]
Halo!!
Tron
What do you think of the name Talin?
Azra
Ezra
Altay 
Ilan
I think you look like an Orion tbh. 

PS: Love your hair!
Aeon popped into my head. 8D
Idl why ig the game theory and red hair makes me think of neo idk why
You give me slight Lycan vibes, honestly
I don't really any suggestions but what about Roen? Anyways your hair is so cool ☺️
Finch or Soda maybe Crow?
Not good with names but GAME THEORY HOODIE
What about loki? Its a powerful name god of mischief i think? Regardless of what you choose im sure it will suit you
I immediately got “c” name vibes like Cameron or Cal!
Everest
Try your favourite cartoon characters for inspiration, I almost called myself Finster (I was obsessed with the rugrats as a little kid) or just characters in general.
Kay…. I don’t know why but that was the first name I thought of when I saw you. ❤️❤️
No names... but that hair tho...
Lake I’d say
Idk about a name but I like your drip and hair, fits you really well
If you’re going for a powerful name you can look to rulers and emperors for inspiration. Augustus (August), Julius (Jules), Cleopatra (Cleo). You could also look to deities and sorcerers like Morrigan, Apollo, Loki etc.
Rhea?
Ash, Flame, Ember, Fire, Rain, or Arson
Something like Arson, or you also look like a Max or a Zeph
Helo, Starbuck, Skulls, Racetrack.
Jagrebawöy
Auburb
james
It's alright :) Thank you!!
Ahh love this suggestion! Bird themed names are just 😍😍
And Phoenix comes to mind for something that (I think) fits.

And is also neutral.

Also, I definitely think it falls into the “powerful sounding” category, especially because they friggin are, and technically can never die (as they are reborn from their ashes when they do pass)!
I love Nova! It makes me think of Super Novas and how they're cool. And hey, great to see another enby theorist!
Okay I actually really like that one, your friends like it, you’ve already used it, and SPACE
i think nova is a great name! it suits you v well
🖤🖤🖤
These are all wonderful suggestions!! Thank you! 🖤
Honestly I think OP should change their name to Nova Silas Sparrow.
Oh my 😭
Ooo I've never heard that one! It's nice!
YOO THAT'S MY MIDDLE NAME
Ooo that's a new one! And thank you!! 🖤
And the God that Tuesday is named after
Love both!

Love these!
Truee

Aster is so cool!
Hii! Haha 💚
Love this idea! Thank you!
Ryn was the powerful lead mermaid in the show Siren!

Also a Star Trek character who has an interesting storyline
I LOVE Jasper, but it's my ex's name 😭
I used to go by Nova! Love space themed names!
Cutee 🦁🦁
It's alright! Thanks!!
I don't do anything with it actually, it just air dries like that. 😅 It's pretty layered tho so that helps! Oh and I pin my bangs up while they dry for extra fluffyness there!
Hehe yess! And thank you for your suggestions!
Ahh cool suggestion!!
1. Ugh thank youu 😩 🖤
2. I like Robyn! Thanks for your suggestions!
Thanks!! 🖤
LIME?! That's adorable! Love the suggestion! And thank you!!

Cutee!
You're suggestions are great!
Haha! A theory indeed!
Tysm!! 🖤
Maybe hunter?
Oh, i'm sorry about that! I hope things change for you soon!
Thank you!!
How is it pronounced?
Ooo and thank you!!
I like that one!
Neos cool!
😮 This one's cool!!
I like it! And thank you!!
HAH!
Loki 😍
Finn from Adventure Time for me 🥴
Thanks!
OOO OKAY! THANKS!
I really like Sparrow too. It's unique, gender neutral, and of course, awesome. I think it's pretty powerful too, but maybe thats just because I like sparrows.
Since you like bird themed names might I suggest Crow or Kestrel?
Yess! That's actually how I came up with it! Love the space themed names!
I've got hair like that :D I cut it a month ago and it's the shortest I ever had. I didn't even knew you curls where that strong. Love the hair and I have the same jacket. Game theory fan ;) 
Edit: ok know I'm thinking about posting a picture just to proof those two things. I don't look as cute as you do but It's funny we have those things in common.
Silas is my cousins chosen name! It’s a great one :-)
Lucky you! It’s a great name. 😌
I thought you looked like a Raven before I even read your caption
You’re a new transition goal for me now
Oh my god thank you so much you just made my day
My name is Kai Ryn :)
NOOOOO omg 
steal it /hj
I'm happy you like it!!! n you are very much welcome :D
Thankss! I love ur hair too! We have matching haircolour 🥰
There's also a Seraphim. Apperantly it's a normal name in Greece , it gave me strong nb vibes
It's pronounced like you want. I was thinking Tah-lynn but it could also be pronounced like Talon
ofc ^_^
Ooo!
Thank youu!! 🥺🥺🥰 Yess, I LOVE this jacket!
OMG STOP THAT MEANS SO MUCH! 😢🖤
I love this!!
I thinking about it 🤫
We do! 🥰
Ahh love that one too! 😍
I like Tah-lynn!
Corvid?
I literally can’t, you’re like

Yes. I’m in awe, I can’t get over how handsome that jawline is and so on. I’m genuinely impressed and amazed. Sorry if it’s too much, I literally, I just. Gender envy
Love it!  But I feel like people would make a comparison to Covid.. 😅

reminder that clothing has no gender		"Honestly clothing shouldn’t be gendered. That don’t make much sense. And it would be great for clothing business to have anyone feel fine with buying their stuff.
I want those stockings, and those legs 😂
Oh my God, I love everything about your outfit!!! Is lovely, the skirt, the belt, the top, the stockings, everything! I couldn't wear all of this (I wish i could, but I'm insecure), but damm, it fits perfectly on you!!!
omg where'd you get your necklace???
yeesssss you look so nice!
That's always been my motto, fo sho!
Reminder that this outfit is beautiful
Honestly people shouldn’t be gendered.
bought it from a thrift site (mercari)!! i wish i knew where it came from 😫
Well, fitting into something is very useful for people. We like factoring into a group. That is why subreddits exist and that is why genders exist. Even being agender is factoring into a group, and that group is agender. Even if you try to get rid of it for everyone, it will naturally form back again. We humans like patterns, and humans are just other patterns on a sociatal scale.
But that’s the problem. Subreddits are grouped based on topics, interests, whatever. Gender is grouped based on... What? Self-identity? But that’s obviously circular (if being a “man” just means being “someone who identifies as a man”, then it means “someone who identifies as someone who identifies as a man” and so on into infinity, until it doesn’t mean anything at all). So long as genders exist and are socially significant, there will always be stereotypes and gender roles and so on of some sort. For something that’s nothing more than lines drawn in the sand, it’s inherently limiting and divisive and a lot more trouble than it’s worth.

(Don’t get me started on the cruel irony of treating “agender” like it’s a gender. You have the people who don’t want to be put in a box and put all of them into a box anyways.)
So I’m with you that if we get rid of gender roles and stereotypes, then things would be a lot better. I also think that we should not say stuff like gender shouldn’t exist cuz that hurts those in the LGBT community, and those outside of it, that are quite happy with the gender that they identify as. Even within the nonbinary community there are those that are demigender or a third gender that might not be happy with that idea. Now I honestly don’t know if dysphoria or a want to be a different gender would still exist, but yeah. I can’t speak for others, though. Because I’m also agender, or at least experimenting. You know, trans peeps might be just fine with genders being destroyed. I have no idea.this question should be brought up in r/trans, frankly. If you’re not going to do it, I’ll do it.
Gender is so much more than self identification. The reason we should let people self identify their gender is the same reason we should let people self identify their sexuality. If someone says they are gay, they are almost certainly gay. We don't know what a person's internal experience eis like without them telling us and gender is dependent on that internal experience.

You asked ""What is gender?"". And that's a bit like asking ""what is an American?"". On one hand you could formally define it as someone with American citizenship. But what about a child that immigrate illegally but has spent their entire life in the U.S.? Are they not American?

Identities are built upon shared experiences, preferences, tendencies, and a sense of ""sameness"" usually based on those experiences. Some of those things for Americans would be: supporting democracy, celebrating the 4th of july, living in America.

There is no one trait that defines what it means to be an American. Some American's don't support democracy. Some have never lived here (maybe grew up on a military base), some don't celebrate holidays.

Gender is the same way and definitely a group with more variance than something like nationality. People bond with people of their gender for many reasons, but no reason is better than another. Someone may feel connected to women as a group because they feel that many women have the kinds of emotional responses they do where as most men don't (for example high levels of empathy). And people perceive gender differently. Like while I may think that women are typically more empathetic, you may vehemently disagree with that.

But even though people tend to disagree on what the exact traits the define a gender are, people tend to agree that there definitely are gendered traits.
Like, one problem with just dismantling gender as-is is that people might fall back to just using biological sex to group people instead, and obviously that’s not too great. (TERFs advocate for something similar.) How do you avoid that? Honestly I’m not too sure.

It’s not an unsolvable problem though. The point is that at some point in the future we *should* stop using gender, because fundamentally it doesn’t make sense. People try so hard to be accepting of every gender expression, but it just doesn’t work that way. If you can be anything as any gender, what’s the point of having gender anyways? How would you even choose one, if not relying on stereotypes and gender roles to form an idea of what each gender is “like”?
>We don't know what a person's internal experience eis like without them telling us and gender is dependent on that internal experience.

Defining a concept based on unverifiable internal experience is going to bring serious problems. Some even argue that the concept is incoherent: see Wittgenstein's argument against private language. Beetles in a box, etc. In short: if we all have a ""beetle"" in a box that no one else is ever allowed to see - in this case our internal unobservable ""gender-experience"" - how are we even going to know we're talking about the same thing when we say ""beetle""? How are we going to categorize our own ""beetle"" when we cannot see what anyone else's looks like? Wittgenstein argues that the word ""beetle"" is not even a meaningful word in this context, which I tend to agree with. If ""gender"" is defined purely in relation to internal experiences, first we are going to struggle with how we can even meaningfully refer to it.

>There is no one trait that defines what it means to be an American. Some American's don't support democracy. Some have never lived here (maybe grew up on a military base), some don't celebrate holidays.

You're describing a cluster theory, which again, does not work very well in relation to gender (or whether or not someone is an American, for that matter). There's no reason why someone who hates democracy, who hates Thanksgiving and Christmas and the 4th of July, who never lived in America - who is the antithesis of ""American-ness"" in every respect - can't still be an American, as long as they hold an American passport. 

Similarly, unless you want to deny the gender identity of closeted trans people and crossdressers, you'd have to admit that someone can be as feminine as they want, or even pass entirely as female, and still be a man, and vice versa. (And really, do you really want a theory of gender that states that men have to be at least somewhat masculine and women have to be at least somewhat feminine, otherwise they're not really men/women?) And there, the cluster theory goes out the window.

The bottom line is, people usually want two things for their theory of gender: 1) that it doesn't deny people of their preferred gender identity and isn't restricting, and 2) that it isn't completely meaningless. 

Unfortunately, as I'm trying to show, these two criteria are mutually exclusive. Gender defined solely on the basis of self identity is vacuous and meaningless. But any more substantial gender system that adds in additional criteria above and beyond self-identity will inevitably deny *some* people their preferred identity, depending on your specific criteria used.

(And of course saying ""everyone is free to define gender as they wish"" doesn't solve things at all, since if everyone uses a word differently, that word once again becomes completely meaningless.)
It’s better to have people having any gender they want and expressing it however they want than to have no gender and have it fall back on sex.
I like you haha there's a bunch I want to address here, but I think I should read Wittgenstein on this first before I continue to make sure he didn't already address these things. But I think I see some problems with his criticisms of private language. Thanks for the reading material though!

Also, where can I read about cluster theory?
I agree. The point is that having no gender doesn’t mean it *has* to fall back on sex. We don’t treat people with different eye colors and hair colors as different social categories after all.
Ye. Now that I think about it, applying Wittgenstein’s argument isn’t as straightforward as I made it to be. It seems that we *do* manage to talk about certain internal experiences, such as *pain* or *color*: however, there is of course no way to know that someone else’s “pain” is the same or even a similar kind of subjective experience to your “pain”, and of course we can’t tell whether or not others perceive color in the same way.

But Wittgenstein perhaps wouldn’t say that the words “pain” or “blue” are incoherent concepts per se, only that the internal experience that they purportedly refer to cannot truly be what they mean.

As for cluster theory, look up “cluster concept”; one introduction is in Kripke’s *Naming and Necessity* (see pp. 30-32, 64-66), which is a fascinating (if long) read. Note that Kripke’s talking about proper names (like *Martha*, *Taylor* and such), but his definition of cluster theories can be easily expanded, and I would argue that *gender* at least in the orthodox definition behaves very much like names (or even that they really just are a third name).
True, but sex is a tad more important than eye color. It holds the capability of life and is therefore very significant without a doubt. There are also a host of different things it does to a body. The two (not counting intersex) genders determine hormone percentages naturally, which causes a host of physical and psychological changes in a person. So it is much larger scale than eye color. Those things are things that people might have trouble with and confide in others for. That is what makes it a social class of a sort.
Biological sex *does* have certain influences on the body, but I still don't think that's a good argument for it being an innate social class. We don't really have different social categories based on height (the most visible trait), intelligence (arguably the most important trait in modern society), or heart disease susceptibility, or any number of significant genetic binaries. Now obviously these things do affect people's experiences, but they don't form social categories in the same way gender does.

At any rate, with the advancement of technology, it may be that we will be able to modify our bodies to be less constrained by the binary of biological sex in the near future. Sex would be even less relevant then.
You have good points. I think once tech advances and gender norms collapse, gender is going to matter so much less. That way, gender is basically eradicated.
I hope so too. It’s going to take a while for it to happen naturally, but hopefully we can see it happening."	j6s9cs	NonBinary	1078	1.0	2020-10-07 14:52:25

how annoying are those facial hair pieces to wear? do they stay pretty well?
Oof, you look fantastic presenting masc.
You look incredible!! I can feel the gender euphoria from here lol, I think I might want to try faux facial hair 😍
Oh damn
Nice job, you look handsome as heck!!
you are simultaneously *fantastically* dressed and in perfect disguise - 10/10 would yarhar again
You look great!!
Add a thin black painted moustache and you'd be giving off massive Dorian Electra vibes
I’d give you my face follicles if I could homie!!

I start laser this Tuesday to be rid of my 5 o’clock shadow, weird how the grass is greener for so many of us when it comes to gender markers we were/weren’t assigned at birth.

Just your local enby feeling pretty good at a gender/body inclusive pole class😛		"Okay with that username and the video, I am 100% certain you are the teeny angelic/demonic creature whispering in my ear! So good to see you outside of your work hours doing something you love, awesome!
Dayum! It takes a lot of strength to hang on to those things, kudos to you and your mighty muscles
Fellow poler here! Nice spin!
Spiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiinnnn
Hell yes!!!! I wanna go
Wowza! Holy arm and leg strength! 

I’m always blown away by pole dancers. I’d love to learn it if I had any upper body strength at all (I don’t)!
Pole class is amazing! You use muscles you never knew you had...haha. It is a great workout. Have fun.
I'm glad this is making you happy. I'm sure that's extremely hard to do.
You are awesome!!
I don't know much about pole dancing but spinning like that looks so fun!
Omg you’re doing an incredible job 😍🖤✨👏👏👏 I am both jealous of you and very happy for you!!
I've always wanted to learn how to pole dance but sadly there aren't any classes available since I live in a small town. Can't wait to move and look into it. Especially if gender inclusive classes are a thing now.
You better twirlllll 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Wow ! It’s soooo cool ! Knowing that there are some inclusive classes out there reignites my desire to try it. Thank you for sharing your beautiful video ✨
Awn, makes me miss pole class, I haven't been able to go to the studio since covid but I used to love it sooo much. Lucky you that you get to! Spin on!
Awesome skill.
Your thighs look so strong!!! Also, I’m impressed by your strength in general book pole dance requires strength.
How does one find such a class?🥺
that’s talent right there!
Spins for the wins! 🙌
Impressive! I got dizzy by just looking, so kudos to to you for your performance and stable inner ear.❤
Mark NSFW
This is SO IMPRESSIVE I could literally NEVER!!
Thanks friend! Definitely helps me appreciate what my body can do vs how it looks lol
Thank you😊
Training can build your strenght up! Don't give up if you really want to try!
Now in days there are tons of online classes! But you would need to get a pole which can be annoying, especially if you don't know if you even like it yet... but may be something to check out!
Yeah, our studio only has 6 people max including the instructor because of covid but normally 3. I did online classes a bit during the hard-core lockdown. I hope you're able to get back to it soon!
So I checked out all the studios near me and carefully read their reviews and ethos and whatnot. The one I go to has a policy of and focus on inclusion. They believe pole is for everyone and have lgbt+ instructors as well as a variety of students, body sizes, genders, poc, etc. I really love the community. 0 body shaming. I'd start by looking at the websites and reviews of studios around you or messaging them asking!
Not sure this is NSFW... I'm fully clothed (the pants are pole shorts) and doing a pole fitness class, not anything remotely suggestive
Theres nothing NSFW happening here hun, its not OP's responsibility to cater to your personal hangups
You definitely could! It's just practice. I've only been doing it on and off for 6 months
Honestly it looks great too
I’ve been doing a lot of strength training recently but not at that level yet! Working on it though!
that's, actually a really comprehension and thoughtful reply, thank you so much!
Even the YouTuber Markiplier has video where he tries out pole dancing with his friends. That was an experience to watch, I found it funny since they had no clue how fit someone has to be to do cool tricks. XD
Pole helps you get strong! You definitely don't need to be to start!

I just saw a tiktok with someone else who got this edition of dune, and if you fan the pages a bit you’ll see a really cool illustration on the page edges!
Thanks! I'll be glad to discuss anything with another Dune/Tool fan! ;) Merry Christmas
Right!? I wanna be friends haha They seem like my kinda people lol
What can I say ? XD 🇫🇷
Thanks!
I'm old enough to get to ask what I want to be given ;) but I very specifically wanted that special re edition, and these two albums!
Most of feminine perfume are very floral like, most masculine are heavy on the musc
It's nice to find something in between, plus I tend to wear masculine perfume but my family buys me often more feminine products
🤘🤘🤘🤘🤘
Keep going 👁️
Tool albums are good
You lucky hellspawn X) I wanted to see them in Paris for the upcoming tour, but I don't think that's happening. I wish you a great time there ;)
I'm afraid I don't have this specific edition, I can't see anything there
Always loved that physical album. I miss thumbing through album booklets, but I love the convenience of streaming.
Hello fellow french non binary, I wish you un joyeux noël :P
Oh man, I’m in my mid twenties and nobody in our whole extended family gets to request gifts!
Oh, I went back and checked and realized that she painted it herself! Here’s the tiktok in case anyone is interested :) https://vm.tiktok.com/TTPd6BwdLy/
Love the convenience of streaming too, but it will never match the audio quality! 
I chose a van with a good audio system and a cd-reader, and I travel a lot so I don't always have a good connection. Now I can bring Tool with me everywhere ;)
And these are literally objects of art, with the booklets and sleeves
Joyeux Noël à toi aussi, Agrougrou
I'm 24, I shop gifts online on my parent's and grandparent's behalf so I know exactly what everyone gets xD plus we get asked every year if there's something we'd like to get for Christmas, if something broke in our house, our cars, if we need a change of tire etc... Everything really dear to us we get to mention at least once and get gifted at Christmas
Thank you!
[Edit] Not sure if they painted it themselves, but that's definitely not the same cover as mine, so this is a different rendition of the book ;)
Very nice ^_^ I also miss actually having a CD player in my car...
Alex grey is the artist for both of those albums. Your welcome lol. I remember buying both of those the day they came out. I haven't bought a CD in MANY years but I bought fear inoculum the day it came out lol

What gender do you identify with?		"Strongly disagree,no to all gender norms

Strongly disagree. 🖤💚🤍💚🖤
‘Neither agree nor disagree’ … I’ve never felt so seen by a gender question in a questionnaire before. This should always be an option 😂🙌🏻
Somewhat disagree. I don't identify as my AGAB, but I do want to be a mix of masc, femme, and androg. So I guess my biology helps with *one* of those...
Nither agree nor disagree, just fits,

all the genders motherfucker. they're mine now

I think I'm somewhat agree, cuz if someone forced me to choose I guess I wouldn't mind ""being a man"", but I don't identify with that. But like also if I'm wearing stuff that matches my gender identity and everyone thinks I'm just a boy in a dress, than that's too bad, but it's only minor. I also really want to be able to pull off androg

Interesting marginally-related tidbit: a couple of NBi people I know use the pronoun “thon,” a contraction of “this/that one” which when thought about always feels awkward but they all seem to be ready to die for it. (Also it has strong Khajiit vibes, which maybe has something to do with it 😂) 

“Birthday One” feels like the festive extension of thon.

I'm amazed your dad didn't just say ""birthday kid""
Well, I think I would be a bit odd if they were an adult
I’m 26 and my dad still calls me kid

Rad AF
That haircut looks so nice on you 💖
You look great in both photos, but bonus to the one that makes you feel like you.
I was gonna say with that first haircut... and then saw the second pic, lol. I think you look about 23 in the second pic, maybe 26 in the first? If you're older than that you look rather young. I still get mistaken for being in my 20's sometimes though I'm 36. 😅
Beautiful 😍
Damn.... You look hot!
Love it and the shirt!! Tomie the shit!

Achievement unlocked: Gender Euphoria. Wore a skirt to work, got cold, and literally looked/felt like a gamer goth alt-person and I was so happy.		"That outfit is great on you!!
YAS FELLOW BARISTA BABE ILYSM U LOOK GREAT !!!
This is adorable!!
You look lovely!
ayyyyy i’d know that BOH anywhere!!!! you look great, that skirt seems super comfy!!!
Batwing hem! Too cool!
If you wear some leggings underneath it it won't be so cold and you can still wear the skirt.
I’m not one for skirts but that one goes so good with that jacket and those shoes!!!! Vibes and goals honestly
You look awesome!
such a cool skirt! Love the vibe :)
You look great!!!! :)
Ya look like a star ✨✨love it
You're lovely!
Omg you're so cute
Isn’t gender europhoria the best feeling ever!! I didn’t realise it existed until I started wearing skirts 🥰🥰
i gotta know where you got that skirt! it’s so cute!
Nice! So happy for you!!! <3
YOU LOOK SOO GOOD AND HAPPY THANKS FOR DOING THIS :))
It DO go spinny\~! =D  
<3
Damn cute omg! ❤️❤️❤️
OMG YOU LOOK SO GOOD!!! to not get cold i’d recommending getting some tights and maybe some leg warmers too!! <3
Gamer goth human beans unite!! Honestly though you look great! When I shaved most of my hair and started dressing masculine on some days I felt a lot more freedom than I'd ever felt, like ""I can be femme one day and masc the next? Why did Jo one tell me this..""
Just wish I had friends this end of the country who were also like me. 

Also bonus points for the very adorable pose and peace sign at the end!
You look great!!

If you get cold easy, get some fleece lined tights in a shade that's close to your skintone, or color coordinate. And if you'll be moving a lot, wear some shorts to prevent any skin irritation!"	vhhvtc	NonBinary	1053	1.0	2022-06-21 16:55:23
Against Gender Reveal Parties by me...		"*genital reveal parties
When I was a fetus, my mom had an amniocentesis to check for some possible health issues (it was a pretty high risk pregnancy for her). The amnio said I was a boy. Or the nurse read it wrong. Or the papers got switched with someone else's. Or something. I came out in full possession of a vagina. I am, in fact, non-binary. 

Gender reveal parties are BS.
How about a baby reveal? Is it a human or a

swarm of bees
Apparently, they cause hell fires on earth. 🤷🏿‍♀️
Gender reveals shouldn’t exist. Why make such a big deal over gender, it doesn’t matter!
Why are the straights so obsessed with a concept they are too stupid, lazy, or bigoted to understand?
My brother and his gf had the one for their demon spawn yesterday.

I now know their unborn is in possesion of a vagina.
Me 2
Agreed. A baby is a baby, and no matter what the gender is, it shouldn't matter. All that matters is that the baby comes out healthy in an atmosphere full of love. 😊
Thank you for this glorious gift kind stranger
some fucktards started a huge fire in california with one of these dumb parties. as evidenced by the dozens of currently raging fires, including the one threatening to force my evacuating my home, the state is perfectly capable of lighting itself on fire. we don't need help from mommy and daddy. thank you.

the worst part is knowing that these idiots already bred...
hey op can i use this as my background on my phone? 👉👈
gender is a social construct not an observable biological feature.

however, if we called them sex reveal parties it might lead to some awkward guest interactions...
Always bees
which would you rather fight: a swarm of bee-sized humans or a human-sized bee?
For my mother it was a bucket of haunted bog water. 

Our house has since cultivated a healthy frog population, but alas, the floorboards are starting to warp
to be fair, california does a fine job of lighting itself on fire without the help of idiot parents or pg&e.
It's just another excuse for a party and to get together why sharing information about your soon to come child. With the norm being cisgender people being born and procreating, to produce further cisgender people, it only makes sense people want to celebrate what they think they are getting and what ""typical"" experiences they are likely to have, and likely hope for their child to have. 

While there is absolutely nothing wrong with being any type of gender or anything, I think most rational people would agree that to be born anything other than cisgender is likely to be a bumpy road, no matter how many loving or supportive people there are. I can't imagine how it must be to be transgender, or anything out of the norm and the challenges they can face. So idk, I think some people do it with best intentions, however if you do do it, you need to know and realize just because someone is born with a set of whatever, doesn't mean they are going to turn out they way you think and begin raising them. Be ready, and happy for whatever may come.
why are you assuming they are straight? they might just be stupid.
Hey, now, you might just learn to like your nibling.
you just made me realize that vaginas come out of vaginas all the time and technically it was put in there by a dick...
Yes! There is my 'signature' in the drawing so it's fine...!!
""Is it a penis or a vagina? Let's find out!!""

Yeah, creepy.
Bee-sized humans. Just cough on 'em
Just listened to a podcast today about a serial arsonist named John Orr (who also happened to be the head of an arson task force!!!!) who was single handedly responsible for 90% of California’s bush fires back in the day. IIRC northern Cali went from 67 bushfires a year to THREE after he was arrested. He was active for more than a decade!! 

You’re totally not wrong tho, but it’s whack to think about just how much damage literally one (1) person can do.
You got me there coffeetablesex!
Who says demon spawn is unlikeable?
Hi! Can I use it as a profile pic on discord?
>""Orr, as an arson investigator, insisted that the cause was arson.""

>""...arson investigators from around southern California converged on the destroyed store, and declared the cause to be an electrical fire.[5] However, Orr, as an arson investigator, insisted that the cause was arson.""

Now just wait until you discover dresses...
[deleted]
A friend in work got it right for me a couple of days ago and I mearly cried. <3
just keep being you then :)
seconding this
that is the next hurdle to climb, but i want to very badly
im in canada, and no I got it at a thrift shop here so no idea where its actually from originally
i will thank you for the confidence, have so many new looks I want to try and show off
In my experience, it felt like summiting K2 until I found a dress that fit me right. I was all like ""IDK, maybe dresses are too femme for me."" Turns out that I was looking at the wrong ones.

Once you try the right one on, it just feels fantastic and natural.
<3
i know it will feel right, just daunting that I definitely need to try it on before i buy it since it would have to fit everywhere and not just in my hips and waist. but i will get there and want to badly. i really just want to test my gender and wish i had a safe space to do so, but with all the lovely people here i might just post more pics
How tall are you? I'm 6'-0.5"" (184cm), and I'm thinning out my closet. I'd be happy to send you a few things, if my stuff would fit.
that is so generous of you! im 178cm
Fantastic! I'll DM you when I get home, and we can figure out the deets

Ah Yes, the Three Genders: Rather... non-binary.		"Male and female except you don't reaaally wanna commit to the hobby
this is like the reverse of people saying ""Men, Women, and people who identify as Non-Binary"". the person making this just unintentionally validated enbies
Only demigenders and other non binaries allowed... People fully committed with their binary gender, please fill your gender in other forms
N/A speaks to my soul.
""Rather male"" or maybe even ""male-ish"" sounds about right 👍
British genders
Tbh not an uninclusive way of looking at it
I vibe with rather male I think
ah yes not i’de prefer not to say no, gender is Not available
My polygender non-binary transfem ass. 

I still don't know which one to pick 😭😭😭😭
My pronouns are now N/A apparently
Surveys. They be wilding out there.
what a lovely image.
Needs to be checkboxes instead of radio button. 😅
Gender non-applicable
I love it
Honestly, windmill slam N/A and be done with it.
I like pronouncing the first one as “Naw.”
Gender?
Nawww
you forget the forth one there N/A
What does N/A mean if not non-binary?
I’m here looking at N/A, that’s the true answer
“i’m a woman but i just can’t commit to the bit”
We only validate enbies here. Down with the binary! Down with gender!

(Not actually tho.)
unintentionaly?

I dunno, feels kind of intentional to me. Could be wrong, though.
To register as fully male or female, provide a psychological evaluation
I want to be part of that system
same.. ""gender? not applicable.""
I wish was a gender/sex marker on official documents instead of M, F, or X. No? Nonbinary? Not applicable? Neutral? So many options

EDIT: N I meant N how did that disappear
exactly. i wish i could get that on my drivers license.
That’s literally me.
 I thought it meant not applicable?
lmao... relatable.
OMG, I don't think I've ever felt so *seen*. 

(agender woman)
As someone who leans almost exclusively masc, but still identifies as non-binary, this made me reactively mad for half a second and then made me think about stuff. So that's fun.
[redacted]
may i ask how you came to identify with both agender as well as a gender, especially a binary one? i don’t want to invalidate you, i just am also agender and i’d like to hear your perspective about how it can mix

(you’re allowed to say no, that you’re not comfortable explaining btw! i’m just curious)
Bruh lol I was talking about N
Not a problem at all! As I was researching and coming to terms with my gender (or lack thereof aka ""meh"" attitude towards gender and ""pass"" attitude towards most things femme and all things masc), I ran into the term ""demigirl"". I'm not a personal fan of using the term girl for adults, so I kept researching. When I ran into [this page](https://www.lgbtqia.wiki/wiki/Agender_Woman), I said, ""Yes!!! That's me!!!"" :) 

In particular, it's these definitions that resonated with me: ""One is agender but prefers or is comfortable being perceived as female (agirl)"" and ""One is agender, but is connected to womanhood in some way.""

Another way to put it, for me, is: I'm attracted to only straight(ish) men, and I like having long hair and putting it up, and on occasion I wear a dress but I sorta hate it, and never felt motherly except when I was pregnant and hormones didn't give me a choice haha, so I feel only slightly woman-aligned, and I really dgaf if people call me a woman (just don't call me a man). I'm just not *feminine* and don't really find a connection with many things women generally do together (like shopping, kaffeklatches, dancing) and *do* find a connection with many things men generally do together. 

If I had listened to 6th grade me, back when I was only hanging around boys because those were ""my people"", I may have.... Well, I have no idea, but here I am now. ;)
I know an agender woman who experiences themself as agender but is a person perceived by others as a woman, with everything that implies in society, and wants their gender label to reflect both aspects of their experience.

Thanks I guess haha
Thanks :)
Thanks! Maybe vests/jackets and a cap could help? I'm sure you'll figure it out someday XD. Until then, don't lose hope!
Thanks for the support! Maybe they will, they're open minded. But they also say a lot of comments about me or other adrogynous friends that they do not look like their assigned gender. And I don't know if it's just an innocent comment or something else. So I'll think I'll stay closeted for now.
Thanks fellow army :)
Yes it is really magnificent. It feels so freeing. I always thought that I was something else than a woman but I don't feel trans. To finally find a perfect label is awesome!
Thanks!
Thanks Kylar!
I see you're a person of culture as well XD. Love your username!

everything is a jojo référence if you try hard enough :)
Thanks, I knew my brother had a good taste in clothes XD.  How is your enby adventure going? I hope you can also find outfits that make you feel happy <3
My bad, I was assuming your assigned birth and I shouldn't have done that. I am sorry! I found some sites that could maybe help in your quest to find your perfect look:

I hope I didn't insult you in any way or made you feel uncomfortable! I rlly hope you find your look and if you want help from a fellow enby, you can always message me.
He sure does! And I’m actually closeted right now, but I’m trying to work on a new name and seeing what hair styles I like and the clothes I like. I hope I can find a few outfits that make me feel like me, but thank you for the well wishes <3 and you’re more than welcome to add me on here and message me whenever!
Don't worry at all! No offense was even considered. I do realise that my original comment slightly makes it sound like I was AFAB anyway! Thanks for the links, I'll take a look!"	g1rc1a	NonBinary	1043	1.0	2020-04-15 12:53:01
I dislike the increase of the phrases AMAB and AFAB within the community	I understand that saying what you were assigned can be important in like medical circumstances, but I wish it wasn't used literally all the time in regards to nonbinary folks. I'm nonbinary cause I don't like being forced into gender boxes, and with this language we're literally just creating new boxes. I also feel it also reinforces the idea that nonbinary people are just man or woman lite™︎. I'd be interested to hear other's opinions on this.	"I don't personally mind agab terms when other people use them when talking about themselves. I don't really like to advertise mine. But I think that for some people it's important to them and their experience. While it's not usually necessary, it might help some people especially if they are just coming to terms with their identity.

That being said. No one should ever ask anyone to reveal their agab when it's not necessary (so basically anytime online). There should be no shaming anyone in any direction for the words they choose to use or not use.

I tend to agree that bringing up someone's agab can make it feel like you're putting people in boxes.

I think this conversation is much more nuanced than just good or bad. So, I don't really know where I'm going with this anymore. I hope it made some sort of sense.
I don't think they're bad inherently and they do have their uses in some contexts, but a lot of people have turned it into a new way to say ""ok but what's your REAL gender?""

There's a weird subset of people on Twitter who believe that a nonbinary person should always be obligated to disclose their AGAB before they join certain spaces or conversations. Usually for the sake of ousting transfem nonbinary people, but I have seen it otherwise too.

It's none of yr business.
For me, I often have to use amab to describe myself because I'm still largely perceived as male by society, so it describes a lot about my experiences and situation. It also says a lot about my history and upbringing and some of the types of transphobia I've experienced. I'm also older than many other enbies, so it's not really as easy for me to pull off the androgynous look. As much as I wish I could, it's just a reality that without major investments, it will be really difficult for me.

What I REALLY don't like though is when people just completely invalidate my actual gender and instead go by my agab, that's not cool and I think it's pretty transphobic honestly.
agab: all genders are bastards
I don't mind and usually do find it relevant when discussing experiences i.e. growing up or with dating. My AGAB is not relevant to my perception of my gender, but how society at large sees me does matter in my day-to-day life.
I don't like how it's so generalized. People say things about how they were AFAB/AMAB so they were raised a certain way (which is ok). What's not ok is when people assume that just because people were AFAB/AMAB that they all share the same experiences, that they were all treated the same by society. It isn't even an accurate assumption if you refer to only cis people.

The other side is it's unnecessary use for physical terms. It's not AMAB puberty it's testosterone based puberty. It's not AFAB genitals it's vagina and vulva (bottom surgery exists stop acting like it doesn't). It's not an AMAB chest it's just a potentially masculinized flat chest.

With so many ways to transition and people being able to transition younger you cant just use a general term like AMAB/AFAB to describe a very particular experience because you will end up excluding trans people.
I find them useful in describing my own experiences. Not just in a medical sense but because yeah, I get read as my ASAB all the time and having a word to refer to that, that isn't gendered or invalidating, is helpful. I wouldn't insist on knowing anyone else's or whatever though.
Totally agree with you. I absolutely hate the “what sex do I look like I was born?” type posts, too. They’re so awful, and perpetuate more transphobia/enbyphobia.
I never see how AGAB is relevant unless speaking about one’s personal physical and sexual health, you know? When people ask if they look like their AGAB I don’t even know what to say because I don’t think of other people (especially young people) as AGAB anymore.
I have a male body.  I don't wish to change it.  It comes up surprisingly often.  Personally, although it isn't any of my business and I wouldn't ask, I always do enjoy hearing what someone's gender used to be.  It feels... like they trust me not to misgender them?  If that makes sense?  I love the feeling.
[deleted]
I think context is what's important. When talking about growing up and how one was socialized, or other certain instances it makes me feel better to put the blame of being assigned my gender on a third party. Like I was afab so I was socialized in a very different way than someone who was amab, but maybe there are better ways to phrase it. I think it defeats the point of being nonbinary when people use it to talk about bodies or masc/femme presenting people since that doesn't have much relevance. Happy to see this being discussed :)
The vast majority of the time I see people refer to their AGAB it's because they feel it's relevant in some way. Maybe they're talking about their anatomy, the way they were raised, or how others treat them. All of those are situations where AGAB could provide important context. If people are asking you your AGAB unprompted, then yeah, that's not great, but I think that's a problem with the people who are asking, not with the terms themselves.
People tend to get hung up on their AGAB and look for other people with the same AGAB when they're in the earlier stages of their nonbinary journey. It's hard to escape the binary, and it's easy to relate to people inside the binary because we were all raised in a society with a very strong gender binary.

Getting away from AGAB is great though. 

For anyone who needs to hear it: You are not your AGAB, you were *assigned* that gender against your will. It is not your gender if you are nonbinary. You and other nonbinary people with the same or different biology share the same or have a similar gender.
It's so overused it's defeating the purpose of being nonbinary (when used on others, im ok with people using it on themselves when describing their experience or transition).

I saw someone say ""I wish I were AMAB nonbinary instead of AFAB nonbinary, is this offensive"" and just wow, that's kind of a staple of most trans people's experience is wanting to be born the opposite sex. Nonbinary people are getting dysphoric over people continuously calling them by their sex and it's so normalized they are wondering if they are being offensive for not liking that. 

Unfortunately there's even small subsections of trans people who like to shit on AFAB nonbinary people (""theyfab"" memes and shit)...and dont see the inherent transphobia in trying to break genders apart by AGAB.
It depends: if it makes sense within the dialog by adding context and/or details to the dialog, it is helpful to use one’s own AGAB.apart from that it is, of course, nobody’s business and should not be used.
I think its very complicated. There are many instances and discussions where distinguishing amab and afab enby people is necessary. And plenty are fine with using the term for themselves, i dont see an issue with that. I do understand not wanting to be associated with the binary genders all the time though. I definitely get a pang of discomfort when referring to myself as AFAB, especially because the contexts i mostly do so in are when I'm justifying my existence/opinions in female spaces. As if i have to tear down my identity in order to speak on experiences that i deal with and have always dealt with. I dont quite know how this could be fixed. Doing away with usage of the terms wouldn't help, as i think they would inevitably be replaced with something similar. Maybe just use the terms when absolutely necessary or for yourself.
I agree, I try to avoid using them when I can. I'd rather say ""I have boobs/I have more estrogen/..."" when it's relevant to the conversation. Every people describe themselves using those terms I cringe a little, tho of course I don't want to control what terms people use for themselves. But it just feels wrong for me.
I can understand this. But our life experiences are different, especially based on our assigned gender and the rolls we may have been forced to play in the family home and later within society. 

I was in h.s. in the late 80s early 90's. The lines weren't as blurry as now. Especially when it came to expression of oneself. 

It was far more acceptable for 'girls' then it was 'boys'. With the slight exception to being gay. 

While I am non-binary, I also consider myself trans and I would feel far more comfortable expressing myself if I had a woman's body, but a more neutral gender. 

So when I speak to others, I think it can be important for them to know my life experiences, as this may help them better understand where I am coming from in life.
Honestly, I'm not bothered by it because I only ever hear people mention agab when it's relevant to understand the converstaion. We're all talking more about our experiences and sometimes agab is important when discussing transitioning socially or physically, but it's also important context when discussing how people misgender us and assume our gender, or react to the way we push against the stereotypes of our agab which is something we've all probably talked about. I get we all want to remove boxes, but society is forcing us into them and having conversations that involve the box we were put into isn't the same as sorting ourselves. I want every nonbinary person to feel safe talking about experiences specific to their agab without worrying about perpetuating binary gendering.
I tend to specify my agab mostly when talking about how i grew up or how I'm seen irl (since i haven't had enough money to socially transition like i want to yet, let alone surgery) and tbh i don't really specify it when talking about physical things bc it can be implied and idc to spell it out. I just also have the adhd infodumping tendencies and will bring it up so I'm not misconstrued in spaces i don't spend a lot of time in where it could be relevant. Also I used to be mistaken for a guy constantly online both bc of the spaces I'd be in and bc even tho I'm afab i was never fem, and sometimes it led to bad assumptions, so i got into the habit of saying (what i thought was) my gender right out the gate and it's a bit of a hard habit to break lol
I’m gen X and what I find so interesting is how my generation was so big on having “no labels” at all. No one wanted to be “labeled” anything. Todays generation has gone the exact opposite way and everything/everyone has a label, so many people don’t know what’s what half the time. Imo I could care less. If you want to label yourself or don’t want any label at all it’s fine by me. Just interesting to see how things change overtime.
The only time I really use agab labels is when it’s relevant and I usually include cis and trans people in the label too.
All the fucking ""Guess my agab?"" posts are pissing me off
To be fair you are 1000% entitled to never mention your AGAB. I wouldn't, and I don't care if people want me to, I still won't. 

Although I agree putting Enbies into AMAB and AFAB boxes is the wrong direction (especially considering AFAB enbies seem more accepted), If people want to say, they're more than entitled to, especially if it's relevant information to what they're saying
I understand that once a person is settled in, this could be annoying. I am new to this and have been following the examples I have seen so am also guilty of following along. I do appreciate knowing someone's efforts to align presentation and identity regardless of their assigned gender. I have seen it as helpfully informative to understanding the many ways of being.
I absolutely agree. Plus the AGAB labels were created for intersex folks, as those who aren't don't have someone pick a sex to write on their birth certificate because nobody can tall.
I only reference AGAB when I'm talking about HRT or surgery where it's relevant. Using it to categorize enbies just for the sake of it is wack
I agree, I try to avoid using them when I can
We should use AGAB for assigned gay at birth, they take you out towel you off, take a quick look and say “god damn it’s another queer”
I fully agree. My AGAB is no one’s business. I hate that the nonbinary community obsesses over AGAB
I largely agree that using AGAB monikers isn't the best, especially as a way to introduce yourself.  It is also a bit rude to ask someone that if you have no reason to know.  If you are pre or non-op (like me), your AGAB can matter in medical circumstances, and for potential partners, but those are fairly rare circumstances compared to the day-to-day realities of people.  It also feels like a question similar to ""what do you do for a living?"".  It's a way for someone to ask a seemingly innocuous question, but use that information to judge you or perceive you in a certain way.
Some people prefer to transcend their roots. I could go either way. On one hand assigned gender colors a person’s life experience from birth, internally and externally. On the other hand it can lead to prejudices from others that could be patently false, like poorly researched assumptions about trans women and periods.
I wouldn’t mind it except that I’ve seen an increase of people using it online to discuss perceived stereotypes in the non binary community
I see where you're coming from with this. I like to say AGAB to remove a little bit of that, because it feels like it distances myself from the previous label, but the connotation is definitely still there. Thanks for drawing this to my attention.
I so rarely see a need to use it outside of purely medical issues.  The only time it comes up by necessity in our house is when my oldest child has friends over for sleep overs. At the age of 14 and no birth control use yet (offered, just not using yet),  I want to make sure there are no ""part a fitting into slot b"" scenarios that could lead to a baby.  That's just a while lot more than I want to deal with right now so I do ask for agab info before saying yes to an overnight. Daytime hang outs are fine,  but I supervise much more cautiously.  For context I'm NB, my oldest is trans but not on hormones yet,  and the whole friend group runs the spectrum of representation 😄.
Right. It's very cis-normative.
Hugely agree. 

I hate it so much. Like for sure when sharing tips it can sometimes be relevant whether a person is transmasc or transfemme. Amd medical stuff *of course* is important to know at times... But 90% of the time when i see those used it is in no way important context.

Its just ""amab or afab"" becoming a replacement for ""m or f"".
I don't know, this could be an unhealthy thought process, but I personally kinda find it important when I'm trying to find ways to feel more agender ig. Like a bit ago, I made a post asking about clothing recommendations and specified that I was AMAB because I thought it would help when I explained that most traditionally masculine clothing makes me just feel like a man and I hate it haha. 

I definitely agree that it generally doesn't matter and definitely should never be something that you ask someone to reveal. I do think it can be an important term to explain a person's individual dysphoria though. Just don't use it to try and divide nonbinary people or anything like that and I feel like it can be useful in specific circumstances.
Excessive agab usage is just the woke way to say biological (fe)male even if the people using it don't realize that's what they're using it as. It has some uses but it is not a substitute for more specific terms. Say ""people with uteruses"" not ""AFABs."" Say ""people w/ testosterone puberty"" not ""AMABs"". If you're talking about yourself it's one thing but even so your language choice doesn't exist in a vacuum so if you say AMAB to mean someone with a flat chest, penis, and testosterone, that's inaccurate and transphobic even if you're trans yourself. 

Also acting like socialization is some immutable thing that's the same for everyone and using it as a generalized expression. It's not AFAB autism, it's high masking autism. By all means someone can talk about how their socialization effects them and how their agab influenced their socialization but look at this example:

 An upper class, white, able-bodied neurotypical nonbinary lesbian AFAB w/ an abusive family has an entirely different socialization than a Black, working class, neurodivergent, disabled, aroace  cis woman with a supportive family as a result of **all of those traits that intersect where a single one can't be isolated**. Despite how both were AFAB, socialization related to agab is vastly vastly different 

There's AFAB people who never went through estrogen puberty and AMAB people who were socialized as girls since early childhood. It just doesn't make any sense to state that something is a specific shared experience exclusive to everyone the doctor diagnosed with the same sex

In conclusion, everything need nuance.

I do not have the spoons to argue or debate if someone has a problem with what I've said. I likely won't even have the mental energy to reflect on any more constructive replies unfortunately. Being transphobic doesn't make someone automatically bad, everyone absorbs some transphobic biases living in this world and it's only a problem if we're being overtly transphobic, defensive, or refuse to unlearn them
100% with you on this.
I specify agab when it’s relevant. Which it often is (for me, I don’t do this to others) because I’m typically in nb spaces to talk about my transition or my experiences having been raised as my agab. When it’s not relevant, I don’t bring it up. But I’m not upset by it in general. It’s just another way for people to describe their experiences.

I think it’s also important to recognize that nonbinary is not a third gender. And it does not describe androgyny or lack of gender. So for some people, their agab will ALWAYS be relevant to their experience under the NB umbrella. And we should allow them to express that.
I agree. Is it actually relevant to what's being talked about? Cool, carry on. But if not, why is it being used? Also, is it actually what you mean, or would ""socialized female"" , ""has testicles"", etc, be more accurate?

Lately, I've been seeing (in general, not in this sub) amab and afab used to replace man and woman in an effort to \*seem\* woke while actually being totally transphobic; it's driving me up a wall.
you can use whatever words you want but you don't get to tell other people what words they can or can't use.
I find the term useful at times but like all other labels I only use them when necessary and don’t feel very attached to them. I don’t like the term nonbinary that much either but unfortunately the current language and understanding of gender is limited
I feel like it’s nessisary when talking about some aspects of the Enby experience, an Arab person would not have bottom disproof from euphoria >!boners!< And might instead get it from periods.
All genders are bastards
I will only talk about my assigned gender when talking about issues that affect me as someone that the society perceives as a certain gender. It would be great if I could pass as androgynous, but that's not the world we live in. Society raised me as a female and that is a great source of dysphoria for me.

Being told to act or look more feminine, for example, is something AFAB have to put up with that causes dysphoria. How do we discuss that if I don't reveal my assigned gender?
I personally believe it’s an individual decision. if you aren’t comfortable with it, then don’t use it. I am non binary and I find it very comforting because it states I was told I was female at birth but I don’t identify with that. I just think we need to think in things more in terms of “I don’t think this is a valid part of my identity, but if other people enjoy it, that’s fine.” (unless it harms other people like homophobia and transphobia) but if it’s how you like to identify with I don’t see why someone can’t use it.
I VERY MUCH AGREE
If someone is doing it to refer to themself, it’s unfair to be annoyed or frustrated. Sometimes it’s used to highlight personal experiences that might be different between amab or afab people or sometimes people feel it’s a part of their identity (something similar to saying transfemme or transmasc)
They might not be a woman, but they’re afab nonbinary and they’re comfy with that. It’s not always just to differentiate or fit a box, it’s specifically a part of them and how they’re happy identifying.

I agree it should NEVER be expected from others except in a medical or health sense though, no one should feel pressured into providing that if they don’t want to
Honestly I don’t mind it and think they have a place in discussion when talking about certain topics. But also non binary is such a broad term. It’s not always neither man nor woman. I’m a transmasc but not a trans man. I will still fall under the non binary term. I use the AGAB terms when talking about my identity and explaining it, it helps.
It’s repackaged bioessentialism
I personally think it should only be said if the topic is relevant to their AGAB, such as someone who is AFAB talking about their period
I definitely agree. I also don’t like the rise of using TMA/TME as blanket terms to refer to people. People use them the same as AMAB/AFAB, which is really oversimplified.
*standing ovation*
I use it some because of living in the disability community maybe more than the NB community. AKA autism presents differently in AMAB and AFAB. I do understand this is masked vs unmasked but even most AMAB people mask differently than AFAB people do. I also have physical disabilities that are either solely exist among people with uteruses (endometriosis, adenomyosis) or very predominantly existing among people with uteruses (intercistial cystitis, fibromyalgia). I guess AFAB allows me to identify with my disabilities some so there is some comfort in that. 

I also don’t mind it as much personally. Absolutely not saying that it shouldn’t bother others and will try not to use it as much as I see it can be painful for others. I struggled with whether to come out at all as NB because I didn’t really not identify as a woman but more so identify as non-binary.
I personally use the terms male and female when talking about sex, exclusively. Chromosomes, morphology of genitalia, hormones, secondary sex characteristics, all very biological stuff.

I use man, woman, trans-, non-binary, and everything else for gender. How a person feels inside.

And sexuality is it's own, third, separate thing.

So I would be male, non-binary/genderfluid, pansexual.

This is just my understanding of it. Not everyone has the same understanding. Some people use the word male as their gender. Whatever the words mean to the person, then that's what they mean.

Also, considering sex, if a transgender man is now taking testosterone and had gender reaffirming surgery, then you'd be pretty damn hard pressed to say they are a female.

So, I like AMAB and AFAB when it's referring to someone's sex assigned at birth. Not their gender. You could say a ""testosterone-based body"" and an ""estrogen-based body"".

All of these ""gender reveal parties"" are actually ""sex reveal parties"". You've got no damn idea what their gender is/will be.

And I didn't even touch on intersex people.

As a fellow non-binary person, yes fuck the binary. People are complicated. There's no one universal experience for men and there's no one universal experience for women. Fuck these two little boxes. We're all quite diverse.
Very Understandable Opinion.

I'll Personally Use It When Describing My Own Personal Experiences, Especially In The Past, As I Feel Like It's Useful Context For That, But Yeah I Feel Like It Shouldn't Be Relevant For Describing How/Who You Are Now. I Suppose Some People May Feel Differently, But That's Just How I Feel.
I feel like there are contexts where AGAB is relevant and important, but people definitely bring them up often in contexts where they really aren’t important. No one should be asking about someone’s AGAB unless it’s their doctor and it is medically necessary for that doctor to know. In all other cases, it should be people’s choice if they personally want to share that information or not.
Personally I explain I'm AFAB specifically because being raised and socialized as biologically female gives a lot of context behind my thought processes and what kind of societal pressure was put on me to perform a certain way. I think it is relevant when talking of personal experience, but only when the person talking wants to add that kind of context. I would never pry about it tho-- its up to the individual to decide if that information is relevant to the conversation at hand, yanno?
Eh. I am non-binary. I’m not a man or a woman. But it is also an intrinsic fact that I am female, and my whole life has been shaped by that. Society views me as female & woman. I was raised female. I present feminine because I think it’s cute and comfy. Female defines my life, due to societal influences and the fact that my body has a vagina and all the associated organs, inside and out. 

It doesn’t mean I’m put in a box. I’m still non-binary. The fact I’m female doesn’t change that. It just shapes it.

My experience as a non-binary female is inherently different to that of a non-binary male. Because that’s just how life and society is. We are both non-binary, but we experience it differently, physically and socially. (Obviously there are nuances to this but this is in general)
I’m old guard (Xennial), grew up in the Gay community (watched with pride the evolution to 2SLGBTQIA+).

Though hopefully as kids are allowed to discover themselves, it will be less of an issue with time, there is still some truth to the “shared/lived experiences” aspect of communication.

If someone experienced early socialization AFAB, it has implications for the social conditioning inflicted upon them by the culture they were raised in/attended school in.

This affects things like difficulties obtaining autism or ADHD diagnosis / accommodations for someone AFAB.

Or being conditioned to apologize overmuch (if AFAB), or internalize different emotions (broadly, male to repress empathy, female to repress anger, as just two examples).

It’s not great that societies are like this, but there is additional presumptive useful data beyond “what hardware your clay originated with” in the AFAB/AMAB datapoints.

I’m not sure if I’m explaining this clearly, and none should press someone for their AGAB if they don’t want to disclose such.

But it can have value beyond a medical setting, when the desire is full communication and understanding.
AGAB is currently incredibly important with the rollback of reproductive rights.  I have zero interest in hearing opinions about my uterus from AMAB people, regardless of their current gender identity.
The only good case for them is for medical care, otherwise it just calls back to something that's not at all me or related to me at all at this point.
I don't mind because I consider Male and Female to refer to sex not gender and the term is referring to the sex assigned at birth for context. Its not trying to put someone into a gender box your gender can be Nonbinary while your sex or assigned sex at birth refers to your sex. They aren't the same thing.
Thank you! What drives me crazy the most is the ever present post of people asking others to gender them. Like wtf do you want us to say? You have features that would make me clock you as ___? At that point why not just transition to that gender if those are the results you are seeking?

What I thought was the whole point and appeal of non-binary was that you basically got to reinvent yourself into something that didn't fit into strict boxes. But the way I see it talked about here, it feels like all I'm doing is replacing one binary with another. That at the end of the day my features will still box me into a category I have no control over.
In my work I use agab language exclusively when discussing biases that an individual was conditioned under, and where it serve importance in defining (actual medically relevant conversations) and I do so to ensure no person has the excuse of saying “since they ARE a girl”, because despite being in education some people are literal idiots
It's okay you don't like using those phrases for yourself, but don't whine about other people using those phrases.
I may be repeating a point already mentioned, if so I apologize, but:

I tend to use my AGAB as a way of finding other enbies that I can better relate to, but not to treat them any differently.  For example, I'm not sure an AFAB would care to hear me talk about microdosing E and breast development.
Your wrong. I’ll get chased out of non cis spaces cause I got a penis and muscles so it’s pretty important
I’ve only ever used it as code for my “sex” (so basically have never had a real convo where the other person was understanding my female sex is a different topic from my NB gender)— I find AFAB to have its use there, but it’s a utilitarian choice honestly because I don’t have the time or desire to be an educator every day. Maybe I’m being to lazy about it. But I also have never found them offensive, personally. People can use whatever terms they want, it’s not our place to police people.
I’ve seen this topic comes by every single day and by now I’m just starting to hate people who complain about it. I get it, it’s frustrating, but I’m done cases it’s important. If I’m gonna ask about to surgery it’s important that the right people respond. Knowing how boob implants are doomed gives me no knowledge on yeeting the teets and does me no good, so by saying afab to surgery it makes it clear till the amab people I’m not requiring their knowledge on this topic. 

But yeah where it’s not relevant I wish people would stop saying it too, but then again, I’d also wish people wouldn’t bring up the same subject daily so there’s that
I'm AFAB, and I think it can be useful in circumstances where I want to communicate that I am stereotyped and face sexism because of my birth gender/the gender I ""appear"" to be to others. I think AMAB do not and can not relate to my specific experience, and that is absolutely ok. It's important to acknowledge that sexism towards AFAB people is more prominent / pernicious than any inequalities or judgments faced by AMAB people.
honestly same a lot of the time. i only ever use those terms when discussing medical topics or sometimes when debating with transphobes online if the distinction needs to be clear
I'll take 'man lite' if no one else wants it
Yeah. I will gladly discuss my experienced growing up as my AGAB when it comes up or with friends, but nobody outside of my doctors and my partner(s) have any reason to know my AGAB. It is just not important or relevant for the vast majority of situations and people. Its the sort of thing I am fine with bringing up myself or using to describe myself, but I don't want other people to talk about me that way, and I try to avoid talking about others that way.
I normally reference my AGAB because I know that with my AGAB comes certain privileges and situations that someone who isn't my AGAB has. I'm AMAB so I abvoousky have way more privilege and people normally view my opinion as greater because I'm often publicly masc presenting. It's important to make that distinction because my experience will be Hella different than that of someone who was AFAB
i think its ok here because it gives an idea of where the person's views may come from, but it becomes a problem when non binary is being attached 100% of the time to an assigned gender (like, always saying ""amab nonbinary"" for one such person, instead of moving onto just saying nonbinary after they specify for a personal reason, like discussing their family or smth that knowing agab might put things into perspective). plus we can have personal flairs here that indicate this, but i assume you mean in conversations and especially when it isn't necessary to specify, though most discussions here will be nonbinary and/or trans central and specifying just gives a nice view of what's going on
I usually see people using them to give context when, for example, pondering their gender presentation. I don't remember anyone mentioning their AGAB for absolutely no reason.
i’ll use it occasionally for context, specifically if i’m talking about hrt but generally yeah it feels super binary
I mostly use A’G’AB when I have to defend my trans-ness. There is a lot of “you’re not trans if you don’t want hormones/surgery.” rhetoric.

I also use it when I’m explaining my non-binary identity and how I experience gender in society.
I’m nonbinary because I want to directly object to gender roles, and I don’t feel I fit or should be bound by them.
I often tell people that my preference would be for society to reject and unlearn gender expectations, so that I wouldn’t feel outside of the “typical genders”.

However, I’m a realist-society, sex & gender won’t be free of those expectations in my life time, so I’m nonbinary to be free of that as an individual.
I think I appreciate the terms AFAB and AMAB. I once used the term “licensed vagina holder”. Now whilst my partner found it funny, my sibling did not and I understand why. As a parent with children AFAB helps me discuss certain things that my body does (for instance trying for babies). It definitely helps with discussions
For personal reasons I am only sleeping with/dating people who were AFAB, that's rly the only time I care. Otherwise idc what u got down there it's irrelevant to ur gender, gender expression , and hormones anyway. 

I also wanna say it's not so much putting you in a box, but if you were to think about how somebody Spanish might speak to somebody Portuguese... Some of their words might be the same, but there's gonna be a gap to bridge. So they may use other words to explain it better. It sounds a little disjointed, but it does the trick of communication. That's kind of how I think of AFAB / AMAB / AIAB. 

It's a bit of a bridge, for people who may lack the expanded mindset to no longer be categorizing gender with sex. If they are stuck in that mindset, these labels may actually help them understand better, whilst remaining inclusive in language to us. Also, many people within the community are comfortable with it, including myself! I was AFAB, I still carry that with me every single day, it's a social construct based on the body I was given, nothing more! We were assigned it, acknowledging that is something you're allowed to choose for yourself, you don't have to. Assigned trans at birth!
Being gender fluid, my perspective is starting to be more of I know what I feel at a given moment but other people can’t see or feel that. So I’m beginning not to care about boxes or labels. I don’t fit in a box on a 2 dimensional paper; none of us do in reality. So what ever I was assigned to at birth doesn’t always fit. Sometimes I use it to describe a situation so context is important. But I am so much more than any label that anyone assumes upon me; so are you! I live in a beautiful spectrum; we all do, but everyone can feel that.
Wait, why did I think AMAB and AFAB were assigned sex (not gender) at birth? I could have sworn it was to designate binary sex organs, rather than designating binary expected genders.
My kiddos are 13 and almost 16 both AMAB, non binary/agender. But both will answer to he/him or they/them. This is mostly because while they both dress very androgynous they are both massive human beings. 5'10 and 6'3, broad shoulders. When we use it while describing them it will only be when their physical appearance is relevant to the topic. Otherwise, if it doesn't apply it isn't mentioned.
AFAB and AMAB aren't gender indicators. They're the sex assigned at birth
it definitely really confused me when i first started hearing trans ppl use it cuz i was under the impression they were terms only for intersex ppl
I think “afab/amab” are very helpful in spaces like this one here because non-binary folk will have different experiences and relationships with their gender identity due to their agab. Society unfortunately treats enbies that appear amab differently than enbies that appear to be afab. So naturally their experiences with how they realize their identity, their experiences with dysphoria, how they feel about it, how they come out and present themselves, and how they are accepted,  are all things that can change a lot based on someones agab. Because of that, i think its often very relevant to include ones own agab when discussing their experiences, and its not bad or takes away from the non-binary identity to do so. I’d argue that it adds to it, actually, because it often bothers me how much these experiences of being non-binary for afab and amab people are often treated as the same when they arent. I think its important for this community to be able to understand itself, bc otherwise people get the idea that everyones experiences only differ on an individual basis and thats just not true. (ie: gender neutral dude discourse where afab people tend to feel validated at being called dude while amab people tend to feel the opposite)
Its when its people (usually outside the community) who will use it for no reason other than to describe what “type” of non-binary person they’re talking about that its a no good issue. No different than “non-binary woman/man”. Thats def gross. And tbh, i totally get being sensitive to that kind of thing bc i get that way a lot too. On the other hand though, if someone is using “afab” and “amab” terminology, then they’re likely already on a learning journey and can be easily guided on the right path by a reminder not to identify people by their agab unless its relevant to do so and also the person in question is okay with it.
No offense to OP for sharing concerns as I love this sub for being a pretty safe place for all kinds of discussions. My fear is that deciding how others refer to themselves can easily become gatekeeping. I first heard AFAB used by drag queens who were biologically female and fighting the prejudice that was rife in the community. Trans women were finally being embraced and AFAB women wanted the validation that was being denied.
The fact that this has nothing to do with enby folks is something I just noticed.
I like the phrase because as an AMAB Enby, there’s a different kind of baggage grappling with your own view and society’s view of masculinity, and that’s an important part
agab assigned gay at birth
Yep, nonbinary is an **umbrella term** and not everyone is averse to referencing their AGAB.

I'm bigender/genderfluid, and partially identify with my AGAB. Masculinity, femininity and agender can all describe my experience at any given point. 

I don't think it's fair to police how people reference *themselves.* Asking for AGAB is where I would draw the line, that's just rude and unnecessary.

The only thing you can say about enben is that we're not a uniform monolith, really.
>I think this conversation is much more nuanced than just good or bad. So, I don't really know where I'm going with this anymore. I hope it made some sort of sense.

Honestly, that is so mood. I'm going to end all of my college essays like that.
generally revealing your AGAB irl isn't necessary either. There's no time you HAVE to tell someone unless you plan to have intercourse, or your doctor needs to know (assuming it isn't already documented).

But of course, I agree you never need to online anyway.
Lol, yes think my name kinda hints well who I am
If I need to put it out there I usually just say ftm or transmasc. I've been using transmasc a lot more lately since I'm exploring the gender spectrum. Ppl know what I mean.
>But I think that for some people it's important to them and their experience.

This isn't necessarily a good thing. There are plenty of afab non binary people who specifically identify as such in an attempt to maintain the ""innocence"" of feminity and in doing so deny it from transfems
I similarly refuse to acknowledge my assigned gender and its worked just fine for years. Occasionally I'll use other terms I'm more comfy with to describe my relationship with gender, hormones, gender expression, or other things like that.
That reminds me of how someone got into it with me one time by saying ""your AGAB matters when using trans terms because if you haven't transitioned from one gender to another then you can't experience trans mysogeny"" or some damn nonsense. As if some reactionary church is going to ask you if you're not trans and just nonbinary to decide whether or not they want to harass you.
>I think context is what's important. When talking about growing up and how one was socialized, or other certain instances it makes me feel better to put the blame of being assigned my gender on a third party. Like I was afab so I was socialized in a very different way than someone who was amab, but maybe there are better ways to phrase it. I think it defeats the point of being nonbinary when people use it to talk about bodies or masc/femme presenting people since that doesn't have much relevance. Happy to see this being discussed :)

It's definitely super annoying when people overemphasize it as if it defines your personality more than your actual gender. I feel like gender is what people should use to try and understand who someone is and if they're trying to figure that out using agab they're not going to get an accurate representation of nonbinary people. With that said, amongst people that actually acknowledge and recognize me as my gender, I don't mind sharing my agab and what it was like to be raised, etc.
I prefer “assumed to be X often/by society” than to reveal genitalia (this screen name aside, since I use it specifically to discuss genitalia related issues). When trans people are very “passing”, they also are assumed X and thus experience a very specific way of society treating them. 

It’s that assumption that’s the most transphobic thing. That how one appears = their sex (which, estimated 2% don’t even fit into due to internal genitalia differences!!! that they may or may not even know about!) = their gender identity and experiences. 

E.g. “I’m assumed female by society” versus “I’m AFAB” (which reveals my external genitalia at birth status).
Yeeee
fr
Preach. That's my experience. Sharing my AGAB will not give anyone a good idea what I grew up with. Physical development varies so if you're an outlier on the spectrum of your AGAB (woo hoo puberty you loon) my life is filled people trying to put me down and make fun of me because I literally could never fit into the image of that even if I wanted too. I don't and being enby is probably a blessing because I like that I'm not stereotyped into one thing even at a glance by others. Sucked hard as a kid but it got better with age
Well said. This reflects some of my issues with it
This!!! Even if people saying it don't personally mind people guessing, it's so transphobic. It reinforces the idea that what you were assigned at birth  matters more than your gender for how you look and are  perceived which is obviously not cool
I disagree with this post and still think those types of posts are annoying and I hate them lol guessing feels so reductive and just purposefully causes dysphoria
Same! I feel so weird when people ask that question.
You don't see how someone discussing how they were raised as a particular gender is relevant? Really?
Yeah for sure. I'm in no way policing what people should or shouldn't say.
Our own language is being used against us to enforce boxes we don’t belong in. I’m not man lite. I’m transfem, but I don’t fit under the label “woman”. I get pissed when people try to assign masculinity to me I don’t feel.
>I saw someone say ""I wish I were AMAB nonbinary instead of AFAB nonbinary, is this offensive"" and just wow, that's kind of a staple of most trans people's experience is wanting to be born the opposite sex. Nonbinary people are getting dysphoric over people continuously calling them by their sex and it's so normalized they are wondering if they are being offensive for not liking that. 


Gonna just prove your point rq by thanking you for this entire paragraph. I've been giving myself grief for this for months, maybe years, because I didn't realise it was a normal part of the enby experience. Now I've read it, things make so much more sense.
This is actually how I kinda feel now. I’ve been living as an out enby for a few years now. But with how people are with labels, I feel just as boxed with the term Nonbinary then I did with the term “woman” and it makes me want to throw up
Oohhh I hate those

hi! not trying to tell you that anything you posted asking for clothe recs was wrong, just curious if it would’ve been as helpful/gotten your point across to say “society assumes/sees me as male?” i’ve been looking for clothing recs for a similar reason as you, and society assumes im male because of HRT/surgery, but im AFAB. and traditionally masc clothing can make me feel more like a man and less like me sometimes. so i don’t know how relevant our AGAB is for either of us in this specific situation you mentioned. just curious about continuing the convo, not at all saying you should change what you said :)
hi! i’m a bit confused. many trans people alter our genitalia, hormones, etc. so i’m not sure what the male and female you’re referring to is? you also mentioned “testosterone based body” and “estrogen based body”. i was assigned female at birth and now have a testosterone based body, how does that fit in with what you’re saying?
This 100%
hi! it still seems like what you’re saying is “i’m non-binary and society assumes or sees me as female”. that’s not the same thing as “i’m non-binary and afab”. i myself am non-binary and afab, and society assumes i am male. i probably experience my non-binary identity much more similarly to a non-binary amab person who presents masculinely. i think a lot of comments here are showing that what’s important/salient is 1) how we were perceived and raised growing up and 2) how we are perceived now. neither of those can be summed up or conveyed through agab alone.
it’s disappointing to see you being downvoted for giving a nuanced, mindful, and well-reasoned explanation. it speaks to the intolerance and resistance of those who see something they even mildly disagree with…and their first thought is not to be open to other (not harmful) perspectives, but to try to instead stomp it out of existence
this! at times it is very relevant to the topic
i think you actually proved OPs point? the details you gave don’t actually mention or reveal your agab. i’m afab and have both things you mentioned.
I'm pretty sure using those phrases aren't necessary in any of the scenarios you mentioned. If i wanted knowledge on getting breast implants, that's not specific to any sex. Nor are breast reductions or removal. And if you're talking about hormones or something, i really doubt someone without experience would interject. Also i don't see people complaining about this often at all
I feel like assertion that folks of different sexes can't have similar experiences only further excludes people, and would put down people who have had those experiences.
sexism toward trans fems is….huge. saying sexism toward afab people is more prominent than toward amab trans folks is…not it
many of us who were afab medically transition and are perceived as men. i was afab and i also have privilege, people view my opinion as greater, etc. your post has kind of erased the experiences of many many trans people, and implied that non-binary people are always seen as their agab.
I never claimed they were.
I'm confused as to how that scenario is relevant. Also I never advocated for making people change their language. I'm only saying I dislike how people are using the terms amab and afab to describe nonbinary people. People are allowed to do whatever they please
Agender folx when assigned gender at birth 😭
100% agree. ""What's your AGAB?"" Is akin to asking ""what in pants?"". Someone mentioning THEIR AGAB and someone saying it's wrong is just another  form of gatekeepers. Just my 2 cents
Oh for sure, I agree 100%. I was mostly just specifying online, because that's where this conversation is happening.
It really isn't necessary for either of those. I don't have the genitals associated with my AGAB. Disclosing my AGAB doesn't tell anybody anything useful. Even my doctor doesn't have my AGAB written down because my hormonal profile is more useful and affects my healthcare more than knowing what I had in my pants half a decade ago.
Even for intercourse it’s more about what you have at the moment rather than what you were born with.
i think agab is slowly going from meaning ""assigned gender at birth"" to ""assumed gender at birth"" and i for one cannot wait for the switch to properly be made. it's just one word but to me and many of my trans friends it makes a big difference
Oh wow. Yeah that’s another good way of selectively sharing information.
Yeah. And I’m someone who is assumed to be very female, and don’t *want* to change or look “exactly” androgynous. These people also perpetuate that non-binary folks MUST be, and owe androgyny. Fuck that noise.
I only tend to use it when describing a situation where I was misgendered or mistreated as clarification.  You only need to know my bio sex for relevant medical issues
Depends on what we’re talking about. It doesn’t matter to me what someone’s AGAB is on an interpersonal level. One’s life experiences do matter, but it’s so varied. How someone is raised because of their AGAB is different depending on when and where they grew up, so it doesn’t mean anything to me unless someone tells me what it means to them.

Yeah.  The emotions and impulsivity run high in these years.  Once he's on birth control and older things will settle out. For now I am respectful of pronouns, and file away new chosen names as they come up (the harder part is remembering which kids are out to their parents and if their parents know pronouns), along with who could be a pregnancy risk if unsupervised.
Hello! After thinking on it a bit, you're definitely right about this! Using ""society sees me as male"" definitely makes me feel less shitty than the phrase ""AMAB"" does. I think it's one of those situations where I just never had the words to describe that concept correctly and defaulted to something close enough, but not ideal. I super appreciate this comment, and ima start using this instead whenever possible :)

If you're still looking for some recommendations, I'd love to swap ideas when you got the time!! Also I love your username, very fun haha
The male and female I'm referring to are the biological DNA XX and XY chromosomes that develop into genitalia, secondary sex characteristics, and hormones that people are born with and would develop on their own if left alone. However, biology is not cut and dry, nor black and white, and I am not well-versed enough in other related topics such as intersex people.

So that's why I said my buddy, who is a trans-man, was assigned female at birth, but you would be hard pressed to say he is female today. He takes testosterone and has had top surgery, so based upon my biological definition of male and female, you would be pretty hard pressed to call him a female. Not even taking into consideration how incredibly rude and demeaning it would be to do that.

With regards to the testosterone/estrogen-based body: I was trying to say that another understanding of the biological definitions, that is more inclusive, would be to say testosterone or estrogen-based body rather than using the terms male and female.

So if I we were to label you (which I don't want to do), you could say that you were assigned female at birth and now have a testosterone-based body. You are a trans-man (or whichever words feels good to you), or just a man. I do wonder when we'll get to the point where we no longer say trans-man and trans-woman and just say man and woman.

Ultimately, whatever language the person chooses to use, that's what I would listen to and use as well. It is all so personal and there are no hard and fast rules.

For me, I am a male (my sex), I am non-binary/genderfluid (my gender), and am pansexual (my sexuality). I personally just don't like to conflate sex and gender as two interchangeable things. I believe that they are two separate things.

Sorry for the confusion, thank you for the questions. Does what I said make more sense now? Please ask more questions if you have them.
No, I didn’t say that. I said exactly what I said. I am female. I am also non-binary. Female is my physical sex. My gender identity is non-binary. Sex and gender are two different things.
Actually your right
Hmmm maybe it’s just me. 

But I mean it’s still relevant, but I see your mind is set. That’s fine. But you asked my opinion and I gave it to you. AGAB is still relevant when we’re talking about medical shit🤷
So male-presenting peiple experience female sexism now? male-presenting people are not hired for tech jobs? what You are saying invalidates the sexism that AFAB people have had to deal with for centuries
I apologize. Your post made me think of gatekeeping but I did not mean to imply you were gatekeeping. I made an attempt to separate the two but failed miserably.
yeah that makes sense
It is if you have certain conditions. It’s not just my hormonal balance that matters. I constantly hurt because of endometriosis and that does not exist in AMAB people. Without that information a doctor cannot treat me. I love the idea that it doesn’t matter but there are internal organs that even a medical transition don’t often change and those can have issues.
that definitely depends. As an Agender person who doesnt intend to transition, my AGAB is definitely important if they can't tell based on visual assumptions.
That really only applies once you’ve reached a certain stage of transition—and many enbys will never transition. So, yes, your AGAB really does matter to your doctor in most cases.
well true in the case of transitioning, which I admit I didn't think of. Im Agender and don't wish to transition so I was looking at it from that perspective.
Ohhh I like that, ASSUMED gender at birth. Thank you.
Right? I learned this from a very good friend who’s a trans educator/activist who is very cis assumed. The word “assumed” has helped to also locate that it is on the recipient’s assumption/expectations/biases and not our mere existence’s expected flaws. It feels more empowering to me, as well as provides less specific private information.
I fear the day we have NB Truscum harassing people for not meeting some arbitrary 50/50 standard.

edit: my phone refuses to acknowledge the existence of truscum. How I wish it was right.
You see that you're doing that same thing though, right? You're trying to tell someone the ""correct"" way to be non-binary. Many people, myself included, would like to appear more androgynous, it's not ""perpetuating a stereotype"" or whatever to want to be yourself. I probably wouldn't make a post like that, but if I did, it's because I'm curious to know if I've managed to present myself in a way that makes my AGAB less obvious, because that would make me happy. 

It's the same as gay men who reject ""flamboyant"" gay guys as being a negative stereotype. Maybe it doesn't fit your experience, but it doesn't mean you can dismiss those who do fit within those expectations. People are different and want different things. If you have a problem with expectations being pushed on you, your issue is with the people doing so, not people who present as androgynous.
Uh... I haven't argued with anyone here. All I've done is give my opinion on the topic. In none of my responses have i said people aren't allowed to say this. Discussions aren't one sided mate. And I especially haven't said how people describe themselves is wrong either. You're quite literally making up stuff.
No one can make me do anything I don’t want to do. My biggest problem is people misusing our lexicon against us.
Oh, how repulsive! So limp and boneless, like a centrist, you are! Grow a spine. Make a stand about language. Defend how and why you speak the way you do; expect others to do the same. Language is how we think. 

If you only think of other people in terms of AFAB and AMAB, the OP was absolutely right; you NEED to be called the fuck out! So was the person you're replying to -- it's messed up for other people to push us into boxes like man-lite and woman-lite, based on whether our genitals are innies or outies. Fuck that!

Enough of this 1980s-ass political correctness -- respecting other people's beliefs NO MATTER WHAT. Time Cube lookin ass... like, why would we sit still and smile just because ""No one's making us use that language."" They're using it for us! That's why we're pissed!
[deleted]
yeah i think there’s a lot of discourse around “afab and amab non-binary people just have different experiences” to the point people forget many of our experiences overlap regardless of agab…. 

and thank you! i go back and forth with whether i still like my username haha
yes, i’m not saying what you said is incorrect. just that sex can change and is an elusive concept- so our assigned sex at birth (the topic of the original post) is not necessarily our current sex. i think it’s completely valid to name one’s assigned sex and current sex (or how they’re currently perceived or however they want to put it), but none of this can be summed up in JUST sex at birth (which was my point).
You're quite literally using TERF arguments. And no one mentioned ""male presenting"" people...
amab doesn’t mean male presenting. you are making a lot of assumptions about what trans and non-binary people experience and how we present ourselves, and you seem to have a deep misunderstanding of the oppression and violence against trans people, especially against trans fems. i really suggest doing some more research and learning from the trans and non-binary people who post in this sub.
Ah no problem then. I can definitely see why people would cautious about this opinion.
my agab is known because I haven't had/ do not plan to have hormones or surgery. i'm listed as trans. but of course if it wasn't listed with my agab then me going to get birth control would confuse the doctors to no end, if they'd even give me an appointment lol (like ""but you don't ...have...what is going on"")

not everyone has surgery lol
i get really sad that transition is always synonymous with surgery and hormones. this IS my transition, my transition is done when i say it's done, and just bc i never had or dont want the medical parts, doesn't mean i didn't transition or that i'm not still transitioning
Maternal mortality rates are higher for Black cis women who go to white doctors. Black cis women have the same AGAB as white cis women, but they have different health needs. 

At best AGAB can tell you what genitals a person might have and what their hormonal profile might be. This information is at the cost of people dying because they aren't receiving adequate healthcare. We need better language to talk about hormonal profiles and such, and focusing on this bioessentialist nonsense regarding AGAB is just an impediment.
Lol sometimes it feels like it’s already here… the cis/hets struggle to conceptualize what even is outside of the binary, whereas our own community seems to also not get it either and still want to box gender into clean cut little boxes with (arbitrary af) rules.

One of the very loudly proud, visibly queer, non-binary students at my school (not my student) went on a gatekeeping rampage of who is allowed to use what pronouns, and what someone who uses these pronouns are supposed to be like, blah blah blah, in an effort to gatekeep another person who is cis-assumed (and from a racial group that would NOT be easily available to experiment) from using they/them pronouns. 

Like. This is the trend I’m seeing a lot. It’s US, in our own community that often times makes it so much more complex and complicated versus just completely confused and ignorant cis/hets who Want To Do Good (TM) but Still Mess Up.
I’m not being prescriptive AT ALL. Where did I say you can’t be androgynous looking? Or are you just projecting? 

Non-binary people can exist however the fuck we want, can express however the fuck we want. Perpetuating that we *must* look one way or another because it’s the “right” way to be non-binary is transphobic. Making posts asking people to assume what genitalia one has is transphobic. The whole system of assuming gender identity based on appearances is transphobic.
[deleted]
Yeah I can only imagine how hard it gets as a teacher!!
Super true. No need to arbitrarily divide us for no reason. Definitely good to avoid terminology that does that whenever you can
Ok but notice I’m talking about ME.
You're right tbh, I should've specified medically. I never really see me transitioning in the sense that I haven't really changed anything about myself, just discovered why I am how I am. If you were to get bottom surgery those genitals are all they need to know about anyway. My perspective was sorta biased towards my own experience and I forgot to specify.
Not to argue with you but is it possible that, instead of biological differences between races, white medical staff are more likely to dismiss symptoms/neglect care of poc mothers?
Bringing race into it is tangential. The role of race in healthcare bias is a huge topic all of its own, and really not relevant to this discussion. 

I know this is not an “approved” viewpoint, but it is scientific reality that the various biological markers for sex are frequently important in healthcare. And one’s AGAB is, in most cases, the most readily available indicator of what those biomarkers are. 

It’s not perfect. It’s not always accurate. Sex is more complicated than AGAB can convey, and gender is even more complicated than that. It doesn’t change the fact that for most of us, letting one’s doctor know what their AGAB is is an important part of one’s medical history, and refusing to disclose it to one’s primary care physician can and has been known to reduce the quality of care provided simply because there are things about your biology that the doctor could know but doesn’t. 

For you personally, it may be irrelevant. It is bad advice for enbys in general to say that it’s always or usually irrelevant. Maybe someday we’ll be able to cast off AGAB entirely and just refer to raw biomarkers. That day is not today. 

Y’all can downvote me all you want, but refusing to accept that biological sex markers are relevant to healthcare will not benefit you in any way.
[removed]
idk why you are being so downvoted, because you are correct and the person you are responding to is super rude and unhinged.
I more meant that in general I wish people wouldn’t assume as such, I’m pretty much the same and I feel like we often get seen as someone who doesn’t transition at all, which is untrue a lot of times

You’ve got a point
Thanks so much to everyone who commented 😭 I always comb this sub for haircut ideas and fashion looks, so if someone can get either from this post, I’ll feel like I’ve paid back my dues!
Yep, I used 'goth dressing' as an excuse to wear a dress and makeup for almost 15 years.
Definitely
I identify as pastel goth. ✌🏻🤷🏼‍♀️
Eh, call me old and grumpy but I really don't like blurring the lines between gender identity/expression and fashion choices. Gender is a sociopsychological consequence of sexual dimorphism, therefore there cannot be a goth gender, since being goth doesn't relate to anything sex-dymorphism-related. I know it was meant to be the joke, but it kinda irks me how much sometimes this sub is about selfies and fashion, and not gender. Perhaps because I hate fashion with passion, I really don't like how the world is appearance-focused and I still consider myself enby; or maybe perhaps I feel it brings down something as complex as gender identity to your wardrobe choices and I feel that fabric is fabric and shouldn't be gendered at all in the first place.
I've found I can't pull off the whole goth thing (not for lack of trying), so my go-to when I feel like doing more than the standard issue one-size-too-big gray hoodie is to go all riot grrl with a beard.
It makes sense. Nail polish, make-up, corsets, combat boots, battlejackets, jewellery: goths and metalheads blur gender lines right?
Aren’t we all? 🖤

(edgy + enby = edgeby?)
That sounds fun. Might have to try it when I'm feeling particularly brave.
I was a suburban teenager in the 90s, and for a couple years I was the one person in my grade who played bass so I was in a lot of bands for like a month at a time, so what I was conditioned to consider to be the ideal expression of feminine beauty by my formative years is sloppy prom queen makeup, something sparkly in the hair, an ironically cute t-shirt (which is great because like 3/4ths of my shirts unironically have kittens on them), a pair of Dickies and a pair of brightly colored Chucks or Vans.  


It's great since I'm 6'2"" with a 32"" inseam, making my body shape closer to that of a gorilla than to a human being (with the body hair to match) and even though I'd love to own a dress or two, I don't want to own them enough that I would have to put up with all the frustration of finding one off the rack that actually fits my proportions, the expense of having one custom made, or the effort of making one myself.
It might not look like it in this pic, but I struggle with body/facial hair and body image, too. I hope sometime you’re able to get that dress - though I don’t blame you for being reluctant. Either way... goth is what allows me to feel like I’m really fucking w gender, so I hope you’re able to find that same feeling whether through goth fashion or not. 🖤"	fe5238	NonBinary	1025	1.0	2020-03-06 00:28:25

I think the fact that you feel beautiful and you love yourself for who you are is far more important than whatever people will you want you to be. 

Idk why I'm in this mood lol, seriously though you look super pretty :D

Very much questioning my gender rn. Not sure if im NB or just a very masc woman, but the gender euphoria I feel when I look masc is unreal		"I don't think I can help much with the gender questioning part, it's a really personal thing imo and I don't feel qualified to comment on your gender in any way.

I do however feel qualified to tell you that you look amazing, especially in that white shirt :)
As someone who was questioning for a while until very recently, here are a few things that helped me.

1. There's no such thing as being non-binary ""enough."" You can identify as a woman and non-binary if that makes sense to you.

2. If you want to be non-binary, you can. It's that simple.

3. The first time I thought about identifying as non-binary, I felt a wave of euphoria that I didn't know I had in me. If you say to yourself, ""I'm non-binary,"" how do you feel? 

4. I've seen this statement online a lot: People who aren't non-binary don't think about whether they're non-binary or not. 

I hope this is helpful! Regardless, you've got great style.
Your euphoria is spreading! Damn fine
A handsome look regardless! That style really compliments you. Regarding gender though, there is no real ‘wrong’ way to identify. Use the terms that make you feel the best about yourself and if those terms change, there’s nothing wrong with that
Either way you pull masc off so well! You look very handsome!
I dunno what your gender is either, but whatever it is, I'm fersher attracted to it lol
You look so good that you've given me a bit of a gender awakening. Or at least a gender presentation awakening.
I dont have much advice in the vein of gender questioning, but I would like to say that the masc look does suit you, and you look confident!
Nice! Questioning is apart of the journey and for some, it’s the destination. Just keep doing what feels good!
If you’re confused, try searching online the gender identities. It sorta helped me. I think I’m a bit confused still, but I know I’m definitely non-binary. Just not sure if I identify with anything else
In the same boat as you rn
Masculine women are a thing! Looking awesome!
Whatever it is you are expressing, it works, and you look gorgeous.
YOU LOOK SO GOOD! i definitely understand how you are feeling.
I don’t know what your gender is, but you’re *stunning* and you have excellent fashion sense. The bi panic would be intense if I saw you on the street.
Your gender is hot
my fav photos are 3 and 4 💕 i hope you get to figure out who you want to be
I can tell, whatever way you feel, you'll be great at it.
You look wonderful! Masc suites you.
Picture #3 is a whole *look*. Whew. So handsome.
Too smart in black
Really digging the first one! 👍
No need to be in a rush, self discovery takes time. Do what/wear makes u feel comfortable, and that's what'll make u feel great! < 3
I'm not really into suits, but you wearing a suit looks so damn handsome and hot 👀
First off, you look AMAZING! 😍🥰

Secondly, I could have written your post. I’ve been dressing masc for a year now, as well as affirming myself with my hair and all that. The gender expression to gender identity pipeline is a sloppy slope for me & I’ve been struggling, too. I don’t feel at home identifying with traditional femininity, but I sure as hell feel like I’d throw myself into the closet a few more steps if I grouped myself with cis men. It’s so tricky. 😅

My TikTok algorithm thinks that I’m either an AMAZING trans ally orrr the closet is (cracked) glass and I’m most like enby. 😂😅

Holy shit, I literally have this conversation with myself at least monthly. I’d address this more deeply in therapy, but my therapist is out on maternity leave. 🤣😭
Just to say, whatever you decide you are, you are stunning. And whatever label you put on yourself won't take away from that. Dress and represent however makes you feel most euphoric. But DAMN, you fine.
You don't ever have to figure out your gender, it's a spectrum, you're on that spectrum somewhere and that's all you need to know 😊 
If you really do want to figure it out though, I hope the journey is a smooth one for you 🙂
Masc presenting demi-woman here who deeply struggled with gender for a solid 5 years since my early teens, you do you and it may take years to find yourself but you'll know when you do❤️

On another note, love the black shirt and pants look in the 1st Pic, it's the same kind of look I go for most days and it slays!
HELLO!!!!! THANK YOU!! 😭🤲🤲🤲🤲
When I first started questioning my gender I really thought about pronouns, which I know don't equate to gender. But I knew he/him was wrong. That didn't feel good for me at all. And I accepted she/her. Still do with strangers and older folks in my family, but that also doesn't feel right. I felt like I performed girl and femininity and I was also really bad at it. I prefer to look masc, but I didn't fully want to be male I felt very in the middle. Getting dysphoria from both was a weird place to be. I actually had my moment in a goodwill when I found a skirt that was perfectly my size and aesthetic and I cried for a few hours and had a gender crisis cause wearing it made me feel awful. I don't know if any of that is helpful, but it's a journey and you'll figure it out eventually. My wife and I just started using different pronouns until it felt right.
🔥🔥🔥
Very stylish in both masculine and feminine qualities!
You look awesome! 😎
I feel the same pretty much!
You lowkey remind me of Stromae. [A French/Belgian musician](https://youtu.be/CAMWdvo71ls)

YOUR LOOK SO AMAZING OQWida goewltiYU
Thank you so much !! Haha hey at this point I’m not feeling too qualified to give MYSELF advice on my gender lol
When I say to myself “I’m non binary” I feel like a faker but I also feel nice. I definitely agree with 4 though. I’ve been struggling with my gender since I was 15. I’m 23 now and still questioning. When I was 15 I thought I was FTM but now I feel like a woman but not. And most days I feel like I’m not. But I am. Like I’m ok with my body. But I wouldn’t mind my voice being deeper. And sometimes I want to be on T and I wish I was more muscular and built more masculine. So idk idk. Lol but thank you that does help. And thank you !!! I don’t often get compliments on my style :D
Lmfaooo, sameeee 😏😍
Hey can I PM you ?
I get misgendered in public all the time, people often call me sir and I get kinda happy about that. And when my girlfriend calls me handsome I definitely get pretty giddy about it lol. But also he/him doesn’t feel right totally. But neither does she/her. Or particularly they/them cause I’m only one person. I do really feel right in the middle and I kind of do feel like I get dysphoria a little from both sides. I don’t feel like I fit into either, I feel like I’m just me, but I also don’t feel like I fit into neither. Omg this is so confusing but I feel like I’m talking to the people who understand this best.
Stromae is one of my favorite artists omg thank you sm 🥰
Neither are we, bad we agree, bad ass gender bend 🙃🦄👊
If the way you feel about yourself changes, maybe consider the term genderfluid. Non-binary"" is a very large umbrella term that means a lot of different things to a lot of people. The more I learn about specific ways people identify, the more I'm able to feel what fits right for me. Good luck on your search, and remember that however you feel is valid!
That’s basically how I felt too. I thought I was trans and questioned my gender ALOT throughout middle/highschool but afterwards I kinda just accepted like transitioning seems really difficult so I’ll just stay a woman. And then something happened in my personal life that made me REALLY question my gender and brought back basically all the feelings teenage me felt and then I cut my hair off and that was it lol I made a doctors appointment to get on T. I tried the label gender fluid and that didn’t really feel right and for now I identify as transmasc non binary but who knows that could change too. I think I’ll eventually go by he/him pronouns and my kid will call me dad etc but that doesn’t make me any less non binary so you can still go by she/her and like your feminine body and be non binary (: there are no rules. Do what makes you happy and feel the most comfortable. You are not a faker I promise
I agree with the other comments here; if non-binary feels nice but not quite right then you may identify more with a different label. Demigirl, neutrois, , transmasc, genderfluid, bigender, etc. A lot of these do fall under the non-binary umbrella, but reading the more specific labels might help you narrow down how you feel.
You can build muscle as a female without taking steroids (T is a steroid). Many people will never fully feel like sex stereotypes fit them, that's normal.
This definitely sounds like NB :)
Similar to my experience x
Sure thing
They're so good I don't even need to know French to enjoy their music. I'll just be jamming with subtitles on 🤣💛
Basically yes! I recently was able to admit to myself that i was bisexual and I thought a lot of the gender issues I was having came from that cause of my internalized homophobia, I was the biggest ally but for me it couldn’t be right, and I thought the only way it was acceptable for ME to date women was I had to be a man. I started dating my gf and had a brief period where I was ok with my gender but now I’m back to not feeling right. And I’m sitting here feeling like I’m 15 again because again so many things are like affirming. Like all these comments calling me handsome: gender euphoria. The few saying that they weren’t sure which gender I am: euphoria.
Oh absolutely ! I was a D1 athlete in college so I’m very muscular already and have a good relationship with the gym. It’s just more so I wish I had the musculature of a man and that I could build muscle as quickly and that I carried muscles like a man. Like I said I’m very muscular already but I’m also kinda lean so I carry my muscles more feminine and when I see body building women who look conventionally masculine with the amount of muscles they have I get insanely jealous. Lol I am working on bulking up. I’m trying to target muscles that will make my body look more androgynous.
Have you listened to their new album yet ?! Ivaincu and la solassitude are 10/10 if you haven’t !! Moules frites and dodo used to be my favorites but la solassitude totally tops them !!!
You can do everything slowly too you don’t have to make any decisions and find yourself/label immediately. Maybe now you feel more comfortable presenting as a butch lesbian. Maybe have loved ones close to you (friends/gf) use they/them pronouns and see how that feels and if you like it maybe non binary is right for you ! (Not that they them pronouns decide whether or not you’re nb) and maybe from there it would be easier for you to start t/present masculine if u tried it out in steps and didn’t have to commit to a label right at this second. The fact that you’ve been questioning it so long I mean hey why not try it out and see if you like it. You do as much or as little hormones/surgery/changes as you want and it doesn’t make you any less or any more nb/trans. Hope you have fun on this journey !! Don’t let it stress you out to much. Just enjoy figuring out who you were meant to be (:
I have not but I'll give it a try for sure 💛
While I agree with this I think for me personally I need to label myself before I do anything permanent. On the days that I want to be on T always in the back of my mind is the fear that what if im wrong about not feeling all the way like a woman and I realize too late when I’ve already made irreparable changes. But then there’s the other hand when In a week 4/7 days I’m dreaming of starting T which leads me to believe that I wouldn’t be wrong. Most of my issue comes from not trusting myself really I think. Im going to try different things though to see where I feel comfortable. I had the conversation with my girlfriend last night about how I’ve been really questioning things again and she was so supportive so I definitely look forward to discovering myself with her support along with my families :D very thankful to have a supportive circle who won’t see me as any different than they do now and will be with me all the steps of the way and will be willing to change with me (:
Yes do what’s right for you !! Happy for you homie (:"	ujtqo5	NonBinary	1019	1.0	2022-05-06 18:19:36

My gender is fluid but not like how people typically describes it. Basically I'm a cauldron of many different liquids. The liquids are my genders and whatever gender I am is what liquid is floating on the surface. So when I am one gender I am still every single other gender just that one is just on the surface. Also their are infinite types of liquids in the cauldron.  Also when I am depress or having a mental breakdown someone dumps the cauldron out giving me no gender. My guess is my brain trying to help relieve my gender dysphoria so I'm not too depress during these episodes. After the episode done the cauldron is then refilled.

Honestly how I think about it is that, it's like - imagine aliens. Maybe they have gender, maybe they don't, but it wouldn't be this [constraining, to put it lightly] man/woman concept. It would not be a human construct at all. Maybe the aliens would have beings that would remind us of men/women/(humans in general), but they wouldn't be actual men/women/humans.

E.g. (I would have to find the original Twitter user who said this, but these are not my words) he/him as in seeing a dog/another animal and saying ""aw he's a good boy!"", not he/him as in a man. The original tweet is worded way better 😅

E.g. sometimes I think im a demigirl, but I don't use the definition where it means ""part"" girl/woman (and I don't assume anyone else who uses the term uses that definition either, necessarily). It's like the above - it's more like, if we met an alien species and some of the beings reminded us of who we think of when we think of women. But those aliens aren't women because they're a different species/life form, not humans. But it is a la ""woman.""

This is how I think about myself (along with other ways) when I say I'm a ""demigirl/boy"" or anything else. I don't really understand myself and am often confused. The terms agender and genderfluid feel very similar to me. If I want to be a ""woman"" one day and a bog monster the next, I can. 

This is how I would confuse the fuck out of a cis person, even though I feel like it should be understandable/relatable. Sigh, oh well. Y'all will get me.
I like my boobs. I don't like my boobs.
I'm hard femme, the hand with painted nails slipping into a velvet lined leather glove kind of femme. The kind who dips into soft butch expression with suspenders and flannel but loves to always have lipstick on hand.  The kind who sometimes oscillates into gender alignment: chaotic. 

Cis people: So you're a woman?

Me: I am the fire in the dark, the black heat between stars, all shall love me and despa- wait really that's what you got from that. I can't even, goodbye.

(I love the memes where nb folx take transphobic helicopter then run with the gender metaphors to 11. It's ours now lol)
This is why I love xenogender labels. Why write a whole paragraph describing what your gender feels to you when you could just write down what can function as basically a gender TL;DR?
it's like if dialup modem noises were a person
I can’t find my gender☹️☹️

Even I don’t know how to describe my gender other than just phoebian-femme.

I think of gender as icky stuff that I dont want on me, attached to me. That's another way of saying I dont want gendered terms to define me. I'm agender.
I'm a wolf made of arcade carpet
An actual conversation I had yesterday that makes me think I'm not just questioning:
Me: ""Wow, I have gender envy for that person""
Other: ""but...you both are girls""
Me: ""I'm jealous at how well she can pass as either gender""

Btw said person is someone famous that I forgot, we looked her up and she uses she/her pronouns
Something somewhere in the vicinity of female, but I have no idea where unless I check.
You have just described my feels exactly !!!

I am just literally vibin, let’s not make a big deal of things.
my gender is gay
I'm a dude's dude but not a dude
I want to be feminine, but also masculine, but still feminine. But also masculine in a feminine way.
If the winx club was made of cross dressers, but also church cryptid mother figure, cherry Pepsi and high functioning alcoholic that gives sexy homeless vibes. Or like mugshot model dude but make him a magical girl. If I was both the monster and the monster fucker.
I wanna be a boy while also sort of being a girl while also being enby

I’m genderfluid but instead of my gender switching between girl or boy it’s more like switching between a character played by Robert Sean Leonard, a punk older brother, a ambiguously queer history major, the colours gold black and purple, the taste of grape soda (purple), crow, a goth dad, an Emily Dickinson or Edgar Allan Poe poem, a chaos god that’s half asleep, a matchstick, a cool fall breeze or a tornado like at any given moment one or more of these is how lm feeling gender wise

My gender is only associated with very specific vibes I’m feeling at any moment that in my mind are slightly fem or masc
like it a man and a woman had a baby
I’m three moths in a trench coat 🧥
I want to in the same place but from a different direction. Except when I want to be in a different place from the same direction. It’s all a troubling mess.
My gender?

I dunno. Honestly whatever you want it to be.
Everything and Nothing with mental physical and emotional health issues and gremlin rage
I’m mostly just clothes.
I want to be feminine in a ""transgender prehuman primate mystic"" sort of way.  
But sometimes in a distinctly eldritch mother goddess sort of way.  
Sometimes both!

I sometimes am a gal, sometimes I’m like a Guy but still a gal, other times I’m a blur of two or more where I can’t tell. Sometimes I’m straight up M or F no in between. Then there’s the ball of random anatomy from 500 species with a giant eyeball, no mouth, and likes pouring tea over where it’s mouth should be maybe?? With a tentacle. Definitely feel alien/elvish from this whole human thing..

At times I’m male but most of the time I feel more female and have more feminine mannerisms. I also have a penis and want breasts.
I feel wrong no matter how I make myself look!
I’m a guy, who can’t tell if the feminine feelings inside of him are a part of his gender, or his gender expression, and so either are fine.
Ok so imagine you wake up before dawn in a forest, cook yourself a nice breakfast, dance in the rain, write or sew or craft something, gather the food from your permaculture garden to make tonight's dinner, go on a walk, apint some mushrooms, bathe in a nearby river and get ready to take the train out to the village nearby where you work, watching the transition from late sunrise to golden hour as you embroider stars, trees and flowers on your uniform for your second job (you work short hours of each and no capitalism this is volunteer work ig) you get there, grab a pastry from the bakery and go to help your friend sell clothes and cause chaos (kind chaos) and its probably like all medieval steampunk fantasy kind of thing, when youre done working you go to the beach draw in the sand at while you wait for a boat to pick you up ig ur also a pirate you go with ur pirate friends off into the sea and go fight a government official then they drop you off at your next job, its still early so you enjoy some leisure time watching a video essay about someone talking about how inside is actually about transhumanism and why they think so that sounds like an interesting perspective so why not and talk with cool ppl I'm the shops here this one is a bigger village now you go to preform at a circus and it has the cool old circus aesthetic you know and you preform an act using both trapeze and silks and you look cool and fly then you go to like a philosophy and ethics/debate meetup thing not the boring kind though the kind where ur like theres no answer so lets explore the complexities of this terrifying yet beautiful grey area and then you take a train to the city city but its like a futuristic city not the ugly kind of futuristic like cyberpunk but not dystopian solarpunk and cyberpunk combined ig even though thats very contradictory and you go first to ig ur also in college but again no capitalism dont forget that part utopian world with a culture of communication empathy self expression and boundary setting ok so ur in college ig but like its more fun or something and this one is all futuristic and its a class ab the intersection between gender, feminism, sex and sociology and ofc you talk about all the intersections possible but thats the main focus and then u go to a queer strip club thing ig? And thats ur last job ur a sexy futuristic drag queen alien and u have the holographic and translucent clothing and everything and u flirt with everyone at the front (consensually u announced at the beginning to not be in the very front if u dont wanna be flirted with) and then u go hang out with friends ig u just go smoke weed and talk about everything in the rain in a small lavender field before taking the train home u get home by 1am watch some stuff and sleep but dont worry all that isnt exhausting and u only need 3 hours of sleep somehow ok that made no sense you can probably smell the adhd in this comment ok sorry bye

It's simple, I'm not a boy! 

... No it doesn't mean I'm automatically a girl, though sometimes I am
My most consistent gender is lying down long enough and letting the moss and forest reclaim me, but with a twist toward whatever vibe I'm into at the point in time (Like Gothic western, Intimidating business person, classy hooker, music festival patron, etc) Cis people simply describe me as ""eccentric"" and/or ""eclectic""
Like if you ordered a plain white rug on Wish but somehow got sent a fridge with that arcade carpet pattern on it that didn’t work properly
I present masculine and use he/him pronouns but don't identify as a man.

Not outwardly feminine but subtle in hints of femininity mixed with masculine undertones. Soft fabrics, bright colors, and lingerie to warm my feminine soul. It is not easy having mixed thoughts and feelings with my weak gender identities. I present myself as a warm blend of genders that I feel comfortable looking and feeling like. 

No intentions to confuse people, it is just the way that I am.

I definitely have gender, but it's like, maybe a handful or so? Like when you go into a gas station in the evening and you're really tired so you're not paying attention to the only other customer there but you notice their shoes and you're like ""huh. Those are kind of nice."" And then you get your chips and you leave but on the way home you're like ""Oh wait was the person with the shoes a guy or girl?"" and you're fairly certain they weren't very outwardly queer, or you would've noticed. But when you think about it you could just as easily remember that person being a girl or a guy, so you just blame it on your bad memory and then you drop the subject.

My gender is the void, but specifically the absence that exists in between two objects, two worlds— no matter how close they are, they will never, ever truly touch. My gender is the space defined by everything else that is, but could never be, and so I lay there, only able to see the barest glimmer of light of stars that I can never reach.

Its always switching between different ones. What exactly those are, i have no clue. None of them are binary.

A femboy but not really? Sort of a boy, who kinda looks kinda like a girl. 

And everyone who likes me is gay even if they aren’t.
I'm bi, not pan. Queer, not butch dyke.
I present masc, but act feminine.
I'm AFAB, but never felt like just a female. 
I can have gay sex with a man just as equally as I can make love to a woman.
Like a girl trying to look like a boy trying to look like a girl, but specifically in a tank-top and black baggy cargo pant's 'yknow?

But also when I go to school I'm a ""girl"" but that just makes me feel like a cardboard cutout so I prefer nonbinary a LOT more :)

I'm a facade, like in old movies. A facade that looks like a guy, but behind it is just nothing, a shining void.
my gender is just nothingness. i'm not male, female, non binary or anything else, i'm just me. and it's not like i don't have a gender; my gender *is* nothing.

The feeling you get when you walk into a room and forget why you did
when i'm a woman it's in the ""slasher killers first victim that doesn't actually get found until halfway through the movie so she's really rotten and gross"" way and when i'm a man it's in the ""pathetic wet napkin of a human being but still a whore"" way. and when i'm neither i'm just a little cat laying in a patch of sunlight
My gender is only to produce chaos and confusion to rude people like a shitty little court jester that no one can kill cause I'm the kings favorite. I can be either girl or boy depending on what will shock the courts most.  But in reality when I get back to my private chambers, I'm a silly secret third thing (no gender at all) because Ive fooled them all while I made off with their riches and jewelry. The king is aware and finds it hilarious

I am the water rolling down the back of a tall man with long dark hair as he lets the shower wash away his weariness, and I am the golden sunlight shining through the trees in the forest

I am the autumn afternoon and the early summer morning

I am the laughing wind and pounding rain when the water returns to sun parched soil, and I am the gentle warmth of winter sunlight on overnight frost

And I am teeth snapping and wolves howling and the great, guttural growling of a beast in the shadows that circles its nest and stares with bright eyes out into the forest

I am broad shoulders and a barrel chest

I am delicate features and a timid glance

I am the brilliance of the moonlight on my skin when nights are clear or clouds are thin, and I am the scarlet peach and gold of sunlight gently piercing through the clouds

I am hands and arms so often bloodied that they have become forever stained a scarlet hue

I am the calm when others panic and my own anxiety does not betray me

I am the eagerness to throw myself into a fight because I know I may be injured

I am the swell of flight and the great gasp of falling long, and I am fire clothed in flesh

In Ohio, if you serve alcohol, you must have a designated women's and men's room labeled.  This one restaurant opened with genderless bathrooms and the health inspector was like, that's not to code.  Then they got in one changing table and put it in the women's room.   uhhhh thanks?

Why don't the cancel culture masses get that state ordinance overturned? 🙏

I've seen ppl use the term ""strayt"" when it's the vibe of a straight relationship bc one or both ppl are enby and their genders are pretty different
When it’s not confusing at all, just work! (It is work, before people yell, it’s just work worth doing. I’m nb and I have to work at it  Brains like patterns and gendered language is a pretty strongly entrenched pattern that takes conscious effort and practice to change. Which, again, people should do!)
There are quotes around this- did you take it from somewhere?

Thank you!
You're very right, I'll be sure to keep my mouth shut around the cishets
Nah, it's an adaptation of Castlevania! Same name, different guy.
I was referring to actual chocolate ester bunnies by Lindt and they make pink ones, blue ones and green ones and  I love how you've actually given me a nice extra point here. Yes between pink and blue is purple, but I am not between, I am the crunchy easter bunny outside the in between. 

Also I did waay too much research into Lindt easter bunnies. A few gender options I found: hyper pink marketing with a white chocolate/strawberry bunny inside. Milk chocolate with tiger stripes. Milk chocolate with cougar dots (we all know who this is). Dark chocolate and milk chocolate with dark brown bell or fancy fairy white bell (which could be adapted for kinky/vanilla) 

Did I just cobble together the hanky-code of chocolate bunnies?

I love when people get excited about stuff so I shall name you caps-tain of this wild ride.
My roommate uses null pronouns for me because they/them confuse him, I don't mind at all because while I say my pronouns are they/them I have a lot of pronouns that work for me I just don't list them out of simplicity for everyone involved. But its funny.

I think of it as like the commodified version of ""Paris is Burning."" My friend and I will just say ""Inherent Vice"" to reference the Pynchon novel whenever we see capitalism commodifying sub and counter cultures before spitting back out a buyable facsimile. Ru Paul's drag race is that facsimile to me....
Ru Paul is pretty transphobic so there's that 😬
I don't care if people mess up (which not doing is the hard part) I just care that they are willing to be corrected without making a big deal out of it (which is way less hard)

Porrrfect, off we go, steal the moon to surprise momma with a gift.
Gru is honestly a great character. How did he just suddenly manage to pop up in a silly kid's movie one day and be such a good character?
Do you. I just don't think Velma is an unappealing Scooby (or character in general).
I just use non-binary or gender queer.  Demigirl probably fits, but it’s not a term I love.  I’m more neutral than anything else, but just a little bit girl of center lol
Whoaaaaaaaaaaaa

Admittedly, v v high right now, but that’s making some synapses fire like strobe lights
Wasn't RuPaul actually IN Paris Is Burning, though?
he fracks as well
How in the everloving fuck does one
All I'm finding is something from 2018 that he apologized for. Is there more than that?
RuPaul said in an interview many years ago, which she has since apologized for, that she wouldn't want a post-transition trans woman competing on Drag Race. This makes a lot of sense, because cis women can't compete on Drag Race either.

Somehow people have twisted ""trans women are women"" into ""transphobia"", because they desperately need someone to be mad at.
I love it
ikr 😩⁉️
For me, void is a feeling, like I'm void of having a gender (but I'm Agender so not all enby people feel this way)
Also this

Hellsing Alucard is just... goals, in so many ways
🤣🤣🤣☠☠☠ 
This is perfection!

Cool, thanks for sharing. Nice to hear I’m not the only one that uses nonbinary but just a little bit of boy or girl, tho for me is boy.
RuPaul wasn’t in Paris is burning, but the show makes tons of references to it.
(TW for mentions of derogatory trans terms)




I guess, but I thought there was a section on the show called ""he male or she-male"", which is a derogatory term used for trans people
And also thought it was fine to use the T-slur to refer to herself because people used to think she was trans and called her that.
I'm glad she apologized for the stuff she's done at least
Damn, ok, that actually makes sense and I ain’t even a little mad about it
[I don think they really care for RuPaul's show](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRFsnmWgMDc)
It's all good. I'm agender too (&pan). I just want to come off as sort of very queer and wearing all black. But not really goth/punk.
I know right 😊 and also vampire Dady 😅💁🏼‍♂️🤭.
Ayye agender gang!! But yeah I get that, I love wearing all black, but without the goth/punk aspect of it. For me, it's all about black skinny jeans, with a tucked in black t-shirt, and a black cardigan or jacket; I just try to keep it simple
It could just be me having issues. Cause I'm waiting to yeet my teats. They're so large they give away my gender. Maybe once they're gone, it'll be a bit better.... who knows.    

In good news I'm moving back to my home state which will allow me to put an X on my driver's license.
That's exciting!! I wish you the best of luck with the yeeting of your teets. And I didn't know you could put an X on your driver's license tbh, I have yet to get my license (I'm 17 so I'm just gonna wait till I'm 18 so I don't have to pay for driving school) so when that time comes I'm gonna see if that possible, idk tho, my state isn't super progressive
Thank you!    

I'm quite a bit older (35). But I'm still figuring it all out. I just came out in June/Pride month. Only on Facebook because I am still in the South. I'll be moving back to the North soon.      

You'll have to do some research about the X. It varies from State to State. I know the State I'm moving to DGAF and let's you just swap it when you apply for/renew your license. Some don't do it and some need you to have your birth certificate switched ($$$- & sometimes they can waive that fee).
Yeah I need to research for sure, I can't do much now since I'm not an adult yet and we don't have much money. I know eventually I'll get everything changed and that will be a monumental event so that's something to look forward to."	pvbpjj	NonBinary	1023	0.99	2021-09-25 17:40:42
Why do doctor's offices never have proper gender options on paperwork?		"I got non-binary as an official gender option in my healthapp a few months ago :) i live in Denmark.
Sometimes I draw my own checkbox and add my option beside it.

Once it led to a form change for a company to include non-binary / other as a choice!!
""female to male"" so, um, male.
Honestly anytime anything like this comes up it has little medical relevance because I could be on hormones if I'm not trans, and I could be on hormones if I am. They need to know my medication not my gender. 

The answer to any official document asking you gender is ""What are you a cop"" followed by what is legally documented so you are protected legally from discriminatory BS by paperwork alone. Especially if you are androgynous. Being full social transition between genders or to another gender makes it a LOT harder, but is still honestly best practice. 

Personally I just don't check them at all. They have my sex and unless it's relevant (i.e. in the case of a therapist or transition paperwork doctor for something like a license) they can't MAKE you sign your gender for records. If you refuse to do it they'll usually just add a ""declines to say"" if it isn't on there already. I never check it though. If they want it so bad they can do it 

I'm a very pessimistic individual lmao
They also don't have proper sex answer (I mean intersex, hypogonadotropic hypogonadism etc.)
It’s gonna take forever for the massive inefficient bureaucracy that is the US  government to start getting their shit together about us.
My doctor has gender identity and sex as two different categories!
I checked non binary and they put male on my records UwU
I literally write in my own box and check it, ✅ **Nonbinary**, in these situations... I know it winds up getting sorted as no answer or just as my AGAB that way 🙄, but lord, someone needs to point out the absence of proper options.
I always sign as male on any official documents because fuck the state lol
If i have to do one of these, if i was a binary trans woman, sex male, gender female. Im not using the mtf box because that feels kinda exclusionary.
LMFAO this reminds me of my first hormone doc. my favorite is mtf and ftm as gender identity options, it's so bad it's funny
They are thinking very hard it is hard for them
I would had wrote down by sex: No thanks, just that they know.
At my doc's office i wrote an extra line and but down my gender, they where confused and asked me personaly why and so. They were very acceptable with it :3
UK here, just registered for a new doctors yesterday. The only options they had were male or female. Even if there were other options I'd probably pick female since I'm not even out to my family yet, never mind being open about that with official people. If I have to use my deadname for something I'll say female.
I don't know about doctors, but we had an option on a school literacy test. A freaking reading test! So why can't doctors offer that?
I marked non-binary on the paper form but apparently the system doesn’t have the option so they put me as male (I’m AFAB). I honestly don’t care but laughed when someone from insurance randomly called me to inform me they had me as “male” and how to change it.
I was looking at applying to another job last week. Their diversity questionnaire asked ""which gender do you identify as?"" as well as legal sex. Which isn't bad as such, but it was ""male or female"" which a) aren't genders, they're sexes, and b) didn't have non-binary or other option.

Which, fine, lots of places have yet to update their questionnaires. But then they asked for absence dates and *the reason for the absences* which I have no legal obligation to provide. So I didn't apply.
A lot of it is government bs. I've been working with my coworkers on our electronic management system (I work in mental health) because the gender and sexuality options are garbage, and they are all saying it's government regulated which is bullshit.
When I filled in paper work for the dentist, I made my own box saying non binary when asked about my gender. 

What sucked is that I called beforehand asking if they could call me by my preferred pronouns and name, they said yes, but when I went to the dentist they called me by my dead name. Like, don't get my hopes up.
My doc has all the options! Big medical network in Austin. I think it’s just case by case these days.
Also not proper sex identification either here. There’s no intersex option despite it being much more common than is generally discussed. Also also how are “male” and “female” gender identification options, they are sex identification options.
I got a tattoo the other day and the options on the paperwork were male female or private
why do they bother including ftm or mtf anyways? like if you're say, ftm, then you would probably just check female for sex and male for gender identification.
Because those things were made up in about 1987 and they haven't ever bothered to update them. The other question is Why the fuck are they still using paper and pen forms in 2022???
On my paperwork they had a line for filling in gender, so I like put a bunch of smiley and frowny faces??
I think mine might have had an ""other"" and a line to write your answer, amongst those options as well.
Mine has the correct options but made me super uncomfortable when using my pronouns because everyone made a point of going “oh and I see you prefer they/ them pronouns” which might not sound bad but when everyone including all the receptionists and the multiple doctors in different departments do it with a tone like they want a gold star for acknowledging that they gendered you correctly it gets old super fast. I had my least annoying doctor change them to she so I didn’t have to deal with it anymore. 🫥
I have Kaiser (US obviously) and it’s in my chart that in Non-Binary
One of my doctors had the options “male,” “female,” and “trans” to choose from 😂😂

I chose trans and then later on I saw that my folder had my gender listed as “other,” which I was personally happy with, but come on people
i think that gender indentification and sex being separate and also having both present at the same time, because it doesn't exclude medically relevant information without also erasing the actual identity of the patient.

the thought is there, and it's 100% the right direction, the execution itself just needs some work. in my opinion, i would move the MtF and FtM options into the ""sex"" category, assuming that it exclusively refers to people that are medically transitioning (medically relevant reasons, not terfy reasons) in order to add more clarity. if you're MtF/FtM but not yet transitioning in any way, you can still tick male/female/etc. in the gender identification category. speaking of which, that category should also include ""non-binary"" for the sake of inclusion.
I'm just thinking because it's still something very new with being more open about. Perhaps some feedback would help be more inclusive?
In fairness, that is more options than my doctor's office gives. They exclude trans options :/
Not only that but FtM and MtF aren't technically identities, they're transition abbreviations. If a person identifies as a man, but was born female he'd be a trans man and vice versa. It's not necessary to put the female to male or male to female options because if someone checks the ""male"" box in sex and then puts female as identification you'd be able to put 2 and 2 together and know they're a trans woman. The options should be male, female, non-binary, and if they really wanna be inclusive put in agender and/or genderqueer too.
I am afraid in Poland it would be just male or female or rather there would be no gender identification section at all, correct me if I'm wrong
Try to go to a LGBTQIA+ Friendly doctor. I live in Central Florida and have found a good general medicine office. Anyone local DM me I will glad you give you their info. (: it has been really affirming to find a doctor who has been awesome in not using my dead name (staff took a minute but adjusted also) and respecting my pronouns. Finding a decent Dr in the US is always a task.
I would also argue there are not enough sex options.
And the drs offices that do have it correct are clinics that specialise in trans-related hormone care. Even then, it can be exclusionary to those that don't fall within the categories of 'ftm' and 'mtf'.

In an ideal world (because knowing these things are imperitive to your physical care needs along with own comfort) I'd love to see

Assigned sex:
□ Male □ Female □ Intersex

Gender identity:
□ Male □ Female □ Intersex □ Please specify ___

Pronouns
□ He/him □ She/her □ they/them □ Please specify ____


Some suggested things here for sex were □ XX □XY
Nobody truly knows there chromosomes unless they have them tested. The limited options also don't account for intersex variations.

I feel like the main options for gender identity should also mirror those of the sex category, because there are those who are determined intersex at birth, that identify as intersex from a gender perspective also. I think 'please specify' is more appropriate than 'nonbinary' bc of the range of identities in and outside of the nonbinary umbrella. Same for the pronoun section, as other pronouns do exist, and it gives the option to state things like 'any', or to add additional pronouns if you have selected other boxes but also use other pronouns.
I feel like this just needs to be one of those things that they let you fill in.

We were on the verge of greatness, we were 🤏 this close
Let me run this by folks:

The reason why doctors ask for this information is because different chromosomes bring different types of bodily needs. It’s an outdated form, but the data does help save countless lives in the long run. 

With this in mind, I think these forms should be updated to something like:

Preferred Pronouns (optional):____

Gene Type (circle one):  XX   XY

I feel like this kinda solves the problem, no?
If we start stop with the Male/Female, AMAB/AFAB labels, and instead approach those chromosomes more like a blood type?

I feel like it would be a sound solution for avoiding the whole gender/sex thing all together,  and would still give doctors the data they need to treat their patients properly. Hell, in the long run, it may even help doctors save trans / non-binary lives.
Medical staff do really need to know your birth sex, I wish you could just check a box for XX or XY and leave it there.  Needing to know your gender identity is irrelevant to them and I’m always surprised to see that on the paperwork
[removed]
In California personally, and all of my doctors recently (last two years at least) have had nonbinary as an option on paperwork!
Who tf identifies as femape to male or the other way around?! Mtf/ftm trans people's gender is simply what they feel
I’d like to buy a vowel
[deleted]
I have non-binary as an option in my MyChart health app (I'm in WA state, in the US), but it's never an option on any paper forms. Just write it in.
I had a post-top surgery appointment a few days ago and they list me as FTM in their records 🙄
The addition of ftm and mtf is redundant. If the Sex and gender are marked differently than that person is trans. Sex should prolly be changed to sex born as or something like that and include intersex. Change gender to masculine, feminine, GNC, or (Man, boy), (Women, girl), (NB, GNC).
i’m a little lost on why they have ftm and mtf as “gender” options. i mean, they already have a box to check off sex, so if you check female for sex and male for gender, isn’t it just assumed that you are ftm? idk, i’m not a trans person but if i was, i would not identify my gender as “trans”. i would identify it as the gender that i know i am inside (like woman, man, neither, both). also the words “female” and “male” only refer to sex, they aren’t the words used for gender. words for gender include boy, girl, man, and woman. thanks for reading my rant lol
Would love to see someone check male sex and female gender but not male-to-female just to see what they do with that.
it also makes no sense that under gender there's both ""male"" and ""female to male"" and ""female"" and ""male to female"" ... it's the same thing 🤨 and there's a separate box for sex so it's not like it's so they know your agab 

they're basically saying ""man"" or ""transman"" ""women"" or ""transwomen"" as if they're separate, it's like they're asking if you're a real man/women or a ""wannabe""

it's ridiculous.
I think there should be separate fields for sex assigned at birth and gender. 

Sex with options male, female, ""intersex (please specify)"".

Gender with options male, female, other (with an option to specify) and prefer not to say.

This is specifically for medical paperwork, most of others should not care about sex at birth and just ask gender with four options above.

On the practical side of the question, I was changing my GP surgery (NHS England) a few weeks ago. Guess what — they have two options.
that’s the most out of touch gender identification question i think i’ve ever seen
at the doctor's last week, the form had

Preferred Pronoun:  🔲He    🔲She
Since you already know their sex wouldn’t it just be: women, man, Non-Binary, Other. It seems repetitive.
In my area, there’s the options of:

Sex: []Male []Female []Intersex

Preferred Pronouns: [] She/Her [] He/Him []They/Them [] Other: ___ 

But that’s only at the more liberal locations.
Okay so maybe a binary trans person would be better to ask, but wouldn’t gender id just be female or male regardless of being trans? Is the distinction important for some trans folks or is this just a poor attempt at inclusivity?
I just found out in my state you can get an X marker. Progress may be slow but it's progress.
Fair but no answer would be pretty iconic in conversation
Reminds me of my college application. Its always so confusing.
Honestly, I'm extremely surprised to see different boxes for sex and gender

That's pretty uncommon in the medical world, it at least shows that they have *some* sensitivity to differences in ways of treating people based on gender

In the mental health world, that can actually be really important. According to my therapist, disorders like autism spectrum disorder that tend to have different presentations for men and women will actually follow social gender rather than biological sex

So if you're MTF transgender and you have ASD, you'll actually present symptoms of the disorder as a woman would, rather than as a man would (understandable, since you *are* a woman)

Not only does this definitively prove that biological sex and social gender *are* different systems, but it also suggests that the presentation of mental disorders like ASD is heavily affected by social factors, and that treatment programs for them need to be cognizant of the fact that a person's identity plays a major role in their mental health

As a last word, I actually think it's fascinating that disorders like ASD work this way, I would never have guessed in a million years that someone with a mental health condition (many of which are thought to be at least partly genetic, and ASD especially) would present that disorder according to their gender, rather than their genes
they didn't need to add ftm and mtf no trans person is gonna put that but if I had to chose I would put multiple checks (I'm genderfluid)
in germany we only have male and female. not even male to female or female to male
It sucks sometimes, but I always add my own box and option for Non Binary. Then I request and go through all my paperwork and doctor notes and have them change anything that isn’t correct. Short term, it can drive them nuts. Long term, I have had a few doctors who added extra boxes and options for others when I mentioned WPATH, as well. Those are the ones I know actually looked into it and cared.

I’ve had several, non gender affirming surgeries, and there have been a few nurses and admin who refuse to put my preferred name on my wrist band or paperwork. They say it will confuse them. 

I mention it’s more than confusing to be woken up or put under for surgery when someone has ignored information that’s important enough to be in my chart, and that negativity doesn’t belong in bedside manner. Also, many other doctors have done this simple request for me, and I know they can see it on the charts. 

It’s one thing if I just started using my chosen name, but I literally live, work and socialize with it. The government even knows I use a different name, because I mention it on my taxes and other places that ask. 

If someone tried to wake me up after surgery using my deadname, I would probably think I was dead and start to panic. In a doctors office it just sucks. And why some still call out first names is beyond me. My deadname is STILL one of the most common feminine names, but it was in the top 3 in the USA for the year I was born. Ugh…
The US now has an “X” option for gender in passports.
That's awesome :) the US has a ways to go unfortunately
Wait Fr? I haven't seen that here
Wait seriously? I have to look at my health apps then XD
This is why the ace community thinks taking over denmark will spark ace world domination
Omg me too! Hi fellow non-binary dane :D
I did this at my kid's school for them. The computer system doesn’t have it as an option so on all of the official paperwork the gender is blank.
That's really really cool
I had a similar event but advocating ADHD inclusion under conditions in health paperwork as it listed sleep disorder but that's often coupled with ADHD.

 I also commented on the facilities sensory accommodating environment although likely unintentional. It stands out from other similar facilities that had less walls, brighter lights, and lots of little noises that add up to interfere with communication and treatment quality. I thought it was worth voicing their ability to accommodate for needing that service with sensory sensitivities providing optimal care.(I also plan to inform my Dr in hopes they may note it down as a first recommendation to patients with similar needs.)

 Sometimes it only takes one voice and good people to affect inclusion and representation where it's important, and if more is needed to gain the appropriate attention - it only helps to advocate such and add to the voices saying this matters.
technically yes but since trans people can transition and can take meds for it, it makes it easier to differentiate and to keep in mind they might have different side effects.

Exactly
Lmao I thought the same thing when Disney+ just forced me to select a gender option before accessing my account. Like why do want to know?
[deleted]
It's still useful because it then let's them know to ask further questions if it's relevent without asking you to recite your entire transition status down to the minutia every time
I assume if they're asking about gender in addition to sex it's because they need to know how to call me. But then they should just be asking for pronouns, not a hamfisted selection of gender identities.

Marital status is another one that annoys me on doctor intake forms. I had to fill that one out recently for my six year old at an urgent care and it was a required field on a digital form so I couldn't even skip it and I'm just like why.
I would have to disagree with not needing to know your biological sex. The only times I agree with is in the Doctor's office for medical reasons if they need to help you with like medication or whatever.
I know this is reductive but I wonder what they'd do if someone checked both options for sex.
So does this form. I mean it's a decent first step, but the options listed here are bonkers missing the point.
they prolly only have two options in the actual software and half ass the forms to look like they're cool with it but can't be bothered to update their ancient programs
Ah found my person, if they tell me it's not an answer I want a new doctor.
I have been to a couple doctors that have had good forms. When I said never it was hyperbole, just meant I rarely see good inclusive options.
How does that help?
As another stated its at least better to be able to write it down instead
Honestly would be better to write it instead
Yes of course, you're not wrong that physical sex is very important for doctors to know. The thing is though, the form already asks for my sex. If what I select for gender differs from my sex, it's a pretty easy assumption that I'm trans, so it's not really necessary to also put FTM and MTF as gender options. They could easy still ask for assigned sex then put gender options ""male, female, nonbinary, other"" and save room on the paper while still being inclusive.

Edit: Not to mention that they don't even have a nonbinary option, only ""no answer"", so there wasn't really anything accurate I could pick that would give the doctor some idea of what my gender is. It's important that they know my sex but it's also important to me that they respect me as my gender, and if I can't put it on the paperwork then I need to explain it every time or deal with being misgendered. It's exhausting.
Your example of a trans woman isn't gender based — it's medication based and past-durgery based. You can't get the info you need by asking gender. You get it in the medical history and it's dangerous to assume you get the answer by gender. 

Same with binding — gender and sex answers tell you nothing. Not all nonbinary people bind; some don't even have the parts to bind. A full medical history gives you that answer, not gender. 

Furthermore if a doctor actually *NEEDED* to know biological sex, they'd have a lot more than two options. If they leave out all the intersex options, and just use male/female, they clearly don't need to know real sex of patients.
Your own delusions you mean? Because if you open any modern medical resource about sex and gender you will quickly find that the queers are the ones with facts backing them up
Real talk, I would advise against it. It's important for your doctor to know your assigned sex to get the best idea of how to treat you. Obviously you would need to tell them any medical history like hormones, surgeries, etc anyway, but physical sex is something that's important to be in your chart. This isn't to say they shouldn't respect your gender identity, of course.
Thats what i would do except switched lol
Its what i would do unless if i was feeling meh and just put female female and make them figure it out
BUT when I went to the dentist a few months ago they actually had more gender options, they still separated man/woman and trans man/trans woman 😒 but they had options for non-binary, genderqueer, agender, bigender and genderfluid
Poor attempt at inclusivity. Like, they tried, but not quite there. And the lack of nonbinary option is annoying too. I'm sure there are some binary trans people who would prefer to put FTM/MTF, but the majority of trans people afaik just want to be seen as a man or a woman, so the trans modifier isn't really necessary and just separates them from cis people.

(Edit: How did it take reddit 4 days to notify me of your comment, I didnt realize until after I replied lol)
Actually at my hospital it has nonbinary and other and in your my chart you can put in your preferred name and pronouns
Its still a new concepts here as well - but it is getter better.
Yeaaah, we’ve chalked up gender and sexuality as a political topic which just shouldn’t be political in the slightest??
My goodness do we. I just had a tharipist not that long ago try to talk me out of top surgery 🙃.  ""You don't actually want this your just confused, how about breast reduction instead"" 

How about no even if there smaller there not supposed to be there.
I think we can get it on our passports and a few states now!
you could try complaining about it anonymously to the staff over the phone later? maybe they are just ignorant and a complaint will inform them of their oversight
I cant remember if it was Min Sundhed or MinSP.
But it was a few months ago it became an option.
Hi there :)
Yeah but there's already a clarification for AGAB next to it, so I don't really see why you would need it in this instance.
Mmm... The only valid response
Who
Which is exactly why it says ""sex"" just to the left. Putting MtF and FtM there makes no sense.
Back in highschool we had to fill out our gender on the identification part of provincial exams. I always joked about them marking the test differently based on gender. None of my cis friends ever got the joke and they always just responded by saying it was to make sure they got the right person. As if my full legal name, date of birth and provincial student ID number wasn’t enough
To cater to you based on gender norms of the time for your age. 

Also because they sell and keep the information for targeted advertising
Gonna commit insurance fraud by singing all of my gender forms different than I did when I got insurance
Biological sex. Gender is not biological it is identity
We did this in Ireland for the census. Non-binary people checked male and female so your gender was recorded as ""error"". More of a protest than anything but still relevant.
Maybe let your doc know how the paper can be fixed???
Which is super ☺️
What do you mean? If they're gonna give me an open response for gender, I'm not quite sure how else to describe my gender, like, a mess, ig, potentially nonexistent? idk how I'm supposed to answer what my gender is.... like,, ...
I mean, yeah. I didn't say it wasn't 😚
Also sex has just two categories, which is just plain wrong and if it were actually about your-doctor-needs-to-know-what-kind-of-body/chemistry-you-have this wouldn’t really help anyway. This also doesn’t say anything about wether you’re on hrt (which changes hormones a lot obviously) or whether you had surgeries or anything that matters for a doctor really
Yeah, that’s kinda what I figured. I wasn’t sure if maybe the nb category was cut off. Almost seems similar to the male-nonbinary/female/nonbinary options that also completely miss the point.
NY allows X to be used on driver's license as the gender. You don't even have to wait for renewal, you can update it online and they'll send you a new license with X as the gender!
Thank you
identifying as male (when ur afab) and actually transitioning are 2 different things, it's just safer to add the option.
I would put my sex as female not male then for gender id put male to female cuz im legally female im not putting male 🤷‍♀️
It does though. Someone born female who’s transitioning/has transitioned still has traits of female anatomy and vice versa. However, they also have traits of male anatomy, like higher testosterone than a female or gender reassignment surgeries. It’s important for doctors to know how your sex has been impacted by your gender, not just what you were born with.
Probably. Though they did have a NB option, which I was a little surprised by
Beautiful, bravo
I was filling out paperwork in advance for an appointment next week so I'll mention it when I go in for my appointment. Not sure it'll do any good but it's worth bringing up at least.
Not OP here, just a passerby
A non-queer but otherwise not shitty person faced with an answer like that would almost certainly assume you're a right winger getting triggered by being asked their gender though
I know I was agreeing
Oh that’s cool! Do you have to pay for the new one?
Yeah I mean that's true, but they're specifically asking  how you identify, which you just said is different from whether or not you have undergone any form of medical transition.
But isn’t it still redundant if you have both gender and sex already there. 

If I put my Sex down as F and then my gender down as M, that already implies that because those two are different, I’m transitioning. Saying Female-to-male under gender is still redundant because the ‘Female to-‘ party is already implied by the box next to it that says ‘Sex: female’

If someone is cis they can just put ‘Sex: M/Gender:M’ and if someone is trans they can put ‘Sex:M/Gender:F’. 

There’s no need to have the Female-to or Male-to.
Okay good point actually I didn't think of that. Still doesn't really make sense why that's under ""Gender"" instead of ""Sex"" tho since one is your biological traits and the other is simply what you identify as. But yeah what you said makes sense actually.
Often times it's just a mix of media from the age period for max nostalgia
Oopsie
💀💀 i did not consider that possibility rip
To get an updated license yes, it's I think around $13 as they send you a brand new license after they update your gender in their systems
true, but you'd be surprised how many things people forget to mention at the doctor's, they're just trying to be inclusive and safe.
There lies a discrepancy: not all trans people transition, and they do it on different levels.

Just because I mark that my sex is female, yet I identify as a male doesn’t really tell the office anything except that I prefer to be referenced as a man. It doesn’t give any insight as to what my biology looks like, my hormone levels, my top/bottom, etc.

They really should just ask for your sex, how you want to be identified, and what procedures or hormones you’ve done to change yourself biologically. All of this information should be available in your medical files: what sex you were born as, what procedures you’ve had done, and what you prefer in name and pronouns.
It's very funny how both lefties and rightoids will yell ""down with gender"" for completely opposite reasons
That’s not bad at all!
I mean you'd think that if it's relevant  the doctor would ask follow up questions if you tid female for sex and male/man for gender identity. I also think a lot of Trans people who haven't medically transitioned would chose that option because they feel like that what they're supposed to tick, which puts you in the same position regardless.
Yeah it's even cheaper for a photo ID only like $8. I was kinda surprised considering the license renewal is $80.50 ($110.50 for Enchanted which is what I have)
you're forgetting that not many doctors actually have experience in the transgender field. it's safer to just put the option there than to expect everyone to immediately know all the things surrounding a transition. it's not perfect but better safe than sorry. either way it's a preference option and you can just tick the male option if you'd like."	zhc73n	NonBinary	1015	0.99	2022-12-09 23:23:02

I'm proud of myself! A man at my job asked me invasive questions about my gender and asked me if I have a penis. I told him that it's inappropriate to ask questions about people's bodies, let alone their genitals. Guy tried to get me to keep quiet about it. I reported him to HR. 😈		"HR has been super supportive. Surprised since I'm in the South.
That is textbook sexual harassment.  Your employer *should* be concerned and stomping your sex pest problem out because it can get very expensive for them otherwise.
Love to hear it! I hope he feels bad
HELL YESH A WIN
Good for you.
YAAASSS love to hear you stood your ground for yourself! An excellent skill to have✨
Hell yes!
We are proud of you too it’s great to stand up for yourself and hopefully him or the people around him will learn that it is an inappropriate question to ask
If it's about a piercing or tattoo then it's ok to ask about the body. But i will never understand how people feel comfortable to ask random people about their genitals/breast. I hate those people

Edit: the piercing and tattoo question implies if you know the person, i wouldn't run up to a stranger and ask him about his tattoos.
Well done 💞💕
So proud of you friend! This is really tough to do.  I’m really glad HR has been supportive!

*and* you’re in the south! Me too lmao. I can certainly appreciate this win for you. I be frightened af that they’ll say I’m blowing it out of proportion (especially because I’m a person of color). Hats off to you friend, congratulations!!
Is this a rule I missed? I don't feel terribly comfortable asking anyone questions or commenting on permanent/ semi-permanent things until I know them better. I would hope peoples tattoos and piercings are something they like about themselves, but it gets a little exhausting getting comments on my more visible ones all the time, especially when they are made in environments I know are not overtly tattoo friendly (work and school etc). I'll live with it bc I made choices, but it informs my habits with others. Commenting positively on effort (nice hair style, cool clothing etc) seems lovely tho.
I feel like even asking about tattoos and piercings is invasive, especially in the case of tattoos. Aside from it being annoying as fuck to have random strangers come up and ask “Wat dat mean??” Some people’s tattoos are very personal and come with stories and don’t want to disclose that to everyone. And it’s so difficult not to offend someone asking about them because they can’t comprehend that it’s a personal thing.
I think it's a lack of education and fucked up societal norms.
100%. I have a paper trail and I have multiple people as witnesses. I'm going to be extra careful.
My last job responded strongly to the metoo movement, to the point where you were written up if you commented on anyone's appearance. I told a woman I thought her hairstyle looked cool, then I had to talk to hr. It was a bit ridiculous.
That's pretty basic and bare minimum common sense/courtesy/manners, don't you think?
Oh no! That really is an extreme response ...unless maybe it was a black person's hair and you're white, which I know is a faux pax for reasons of exotifying other folks?  I guess the safest thing is to not comment on anything, but that does make me sad to lose all the positivity we can exchange through random compliments. I'm a little torn on that and generally settle with compliment effort, but nothing permanent with the exception of the the above (and I guess anything else that might seem othering?). I'm sorry you got hassle for just being nice. :(
Yes, but as a person that used to be a teacher, I've learned that courtesy and manners need to be taught. At least some of them.
