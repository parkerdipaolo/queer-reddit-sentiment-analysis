My aunt was misgendering me a fair bit so my mum got me a t shirt		"janet, the unintentional trans/nonbinary icon

&#x200B;

we stan

&#x200B;

also i love this shirt and i need it
Im AMAB and often get he himed but still want that shirt :)
Holy shirt!
your mom got you this?? omg how does it feel to live my dream......
The t shirt is from my redbubble store [BreakTheBinary](https://www.redbubble.com/i/t-shirt/Not-A-Girl-by-BreakTheBinary/91886646.BTWM1)
Janet is an icon
ugh this is one of my favourite things, they're one of my favourite nonbinary characters
Haha. Funny. I wish my mom was able to support me, but she’s transphobic, so I’m forced to be in the closet if I don’t want my life to go underground, cuz my life is already down the hill😔
W mom
[deleted]
I need to get me one of these!
Amazing
My ex had just come out when we started dating, and we had a whole thing about Janet and my ex being “not a girl.” I hope your aunt gets it right.
Love it!
your mom dropped this : 👑💜
I am so happy this exists. I want to buy two so I can give one to this new wonderful human I recently connected with who is also non-binary.
I love your mom
That's so dope, I need this, love the good place
Love it !
YEEEEEEEEEEREEERRREEEEEEEE! I love Janet! 🥹😭
10/10 tee
Wait I love it I want this 😂
Not a girl, not a robot, is a total hottie.

Probably my favorite character.
Wow it’s nice😂
Damn that's awesome
I TOO WANT A NONBINARY JANET T-SHIRT
Omg this is EVERYTHING.  I forking love Janet.
Omg I love this so much
Thats a noice 👕
I just wanna say whomever created this shirt is a genius. 

And props to your mom, that seems like the best approach to the situation.


Hope your aunt figures it out an does better.
Holy mother-forking shirtballs!
omg i LOVE this
coolest mom ever
Loooove
Love it lol <33
Ohhhhhh! I get it! Love it!
Who's that character?
I need a shirt like that ngl
W your mum :)
That is awesome!
I'm watching the series like right now 😂

Still, Janet best character 👌
May I ask where those jeans are from? This whole outfit is amazing
Omg I love this
Absolutely buying this shirt for myself lol
I love this so much
I just binged this entire show for the first time and finished it last night, it so good!
Omg I love this ❤️❤️❤️
this made my day
bless your mom, remember to be thankful for her...I wish I had a mom like that! love the shirt btw!
i wish my mom was like that :pensive: instead she calls me a she instead of a they
your mum makes me happy 😊
Wow need
Your mom is amazing 🏆
😍
So your a Lama ? 🤔
W mum
The link is in a separate comment :)
I love this so much. The shirt and the rep Janet gives our queer community <3

&#x200B;

I mean one could say the whole point of The Good Place was that restricting ourselves to the binary can have disastrous consequences that can only be saved by Kristen Bell pretending to like clowns.
I feel like it was intentional. Was it absolutely not? I always got that sense when they corrected people.
We too two tutu
[removed]
Hell yeah! I’ve seen shirts that say “not a guy” / “not a boy” but in different styles bc “not a girl” is what Janet says in the good place specifically
Same
What the fork is going on?
…
It feels great tbh. When I first came out I posted here about how she said I was a girl and she didn’t understand. People told me it would get better and she would come around with time. They were right. It’s been about a year and a half now since I came out.
So you made the shirt or your mom did? I'm just confused lol
this does not compute
Yeah this has me confused as well
No, she genuinely bought this shirt from my own store on redbubble as a surprise to support both me and my store. But I thought I should be open that it’s my own store in the comment.
[removed]
You can get them from the link in my other comment :)
I love my mum too lol
I love the good place too! I put the link to the shirt in another comment if you’re interested ❤️
I will tell her you said that :)
Thanks !
Janet from the good place
I got them second hand through depop - I just looked up “mom jeans”
ye i saw and i fell down a rabbit hole of queer stuff on there FKFKFK
yeah i think the writers were cool enough for it to be intentional. its only really unintentional if the director is a dick or the show is blatantly queerphobic
[removed]
yeah, loved the series, thats kind of another reason I want it, not quite for misgendering, but a) love of the show b) still helps get the message across of me being NB even though Im a bit more NB masc.
Why can't I say fork?
To the bad place with you!
thank you for this. really needed to hear it as i go thru similar things. ♥️
It always gets better if we give it time
I designed the shirt which my mum then bought from my redbubble store to give to me as a surprise - I design lgbt themed merch.
I explained it in the comment above! I know it looks weird but I thought I should be open about the fact that my mum got it for me from my own store instead of pretending it was someone else’s store
Totally get it, my bad mate

Oh I didn’t realise you were a fan of the show! That’s great :) it’s such a good series. I have the link to shirt in another comment if you’re interested ♥️
Ooooh that makes sense!
nah, I was making a joke - your store is ""Break the Binary""
so obviously, this does not compute
That’s ok! Don’t worry about it ♥️

'i may look soft bur i still got the muacle to screw yo ass up'
I aspire to be like you someday
I'll just be the party pooper. Let's be clear that accidental misgendering is not justification to be an asshole or threaten people.
I know this is gonna get lost but that's a really cute dress! Also, is that a stella artois box I spy? Only beer that I drank religiously when I was a drinker. So crisp and clean.
hi please step on me also what are your pronouns
This is the fucking way, lets go themperor.  We got work to do, we gotta look divine and we gotta beat the transphobes and terfs faces in until its fucking paste.    


We aren't asking anymore
You look amazing!! I love the dress so much! Snishdidjdj keep being awesome. :)
Oh yeah? You wanna misgender me too and we can go at it? Or we can skip the misgendering all together and just throw down for the fun of it....
Love that dress! Looks great on you too!

You are so cute!
Oh umm uh sorry I'll get it right next time

Thanks 🥰, I was kinda in a hurry when I took the picture but I feel like I would have probably look even better if my shoes was tied.
'I may look soft but the screwbar will be harder than you think'
Thanks😊
Thanks for the legal disclaimer 😉 but no it's really not an excuse for any toxic behavior
Thanks! And yeah you spot it right it's a stella artois box hahah they're good but not too expensive!
I don't really have a preference for pronouns just go with what make you the more comfortable!
It's the beginning of a revolution!
Thanks ☺ i'll try, i'll try
We could probably just go for the fun and forget about the misgendering😉
Thanks 😊
😎
Thanks ☺
Thank you so much☺
Thanks! 😊
How do you snack common sense into people? Which snacks do you use, cause I got some snack packs that I think might do the trick. They're chocolate fudge flavored.
Oh! I love you too 😊
you've gotta have mobility to stomp on facists
thirding this! must have for when I feel like dressing up

Yep lol.
Would you want to kill someone with cuddle? Because that doesn't sound so bad, I'd volunteer.
Oh are you kidding?! You absolutely blew me out of the water with this one! Ya look fuckin' fantastic! 😍💙 That dress was made for you! 🔥
Thank you so much!
Oh shit did it come off as that? I'm trying to say you're hot and I'm thirsty.
Maybe not everything everything, but at least everything I can see.
Why certainly, and be careful now in the future dearie  as it's hard to dismantle gender norms if you're tripping over your own shoelaces😊
The outfit is amazing, shoes tied or not! I just have some grand-beingly tendencies, lol.
lmao yes
This sounds like a hella solid plan. Cash me ouside, hottie.
YES! validation on the internet! fucking hell yeah

Looks good!
It's christmas, it's my give for you ;)

Merry christmas !!
Its gorgeous, as someone who never bought a dress before, but paranoid about knowing what size would fit, any tips?
It's probably one of the best way to go😏
Thanks, it warm me to have such kind word from someone georgeous like you. It make me blush😊🥰
Oh ok I might have read it wrong too sorry, I found it was kinda aggressive tbh, but thanks for the compliment!
hahaha, i'm not sure if i'm intricate or i'm freaking out 😂
I'll probably be genderise as a failure then😅
It's my first and only dress so I don't have a lot of tip, but i'd say when you look at the chart size, the bust size is probably the more important one to check if you want to fit well. And go for someting more casual and not to fancy, they'll be probably more comfortable for a first dress 😊
As someone who does buy a decent number of dresses, the shoulders and chest/bust are the most important to get right as long as the resulting waist isn’t too small to fit. Shoulders and chest being too small or too big has the largest impact on the dress not hanging well, a skirt can fall high or low, fit wide or narrow and just be a different but ok fit than the model shows, without being awkward.
Oh hush you 🥰 You absolutely deserve all of the compliments, for real. You look amazing 😄
Lol I'll edit it and add some emojis :P
I guess I didn't know how to respond and now I feel embarrassed because this is getting out of hand.
Certainly not! We shall just acquire some velcro instead😂
Shoulders are such a big thing in dresses. I 100% recommend starting with tank top style dresses like this because for some reason they refuse to acknowledge large shouldered people wear dresses. 
Layering is trendy RN (i think, I'm so old) grab some sleeveless dresses and put them over a nice turtle neck or just long sleeve. 
-source:AFAB with giant shoulders
Thanks 😊
Hahaha, and sorry for the mod who's propably gonna look at it since I report it, since I tough it was just someone being toxic😅
hahah sorry to make you feel that way, I was just kinda trying to understand the referance 😅
Shoulders and dresses are SO HARD.

I like floaty or warm shawls/wraps as well for the solution to “my dress is more open than I want it to be.”

Source: tiny shoulder person
Yeah, I wasn't making a reference, just trying to say that you look stunning, but in a different way because I always say it and it kinda felt less genuine if I said it the same every time.
Maybe it's just me who look too hard into it, Thanks for you compliment tho 🥰"	kk5i3x	NonBinary	3344	0.99	2020-12-25 20:32:16

You know in anime when the main character dies and wakes up in another world and immediately goes on an adventure? Yeah. This.
I WISH I HAD AN AWARD FOR YOU OMFG

Is there a word for frightened, yet also attracted? Scare-roused maybe?
Is anyone else seeing this thinking about the ""you've been weighed, you've been measured and you've been found wanting"" moment from A Knight's Tale?
As the living personification of violence, I approve.

someone made this meme about me unironically lol. I think the original poster tried to misgender me but since I'm any/all they ended up not misgendering me in the end!		"best part is that this meme was posted to many different meme subreddits today I'd say 80% of the comments throughout all the subreddits have been positive! I was expecting a lot more negativity, I did see a ""nonbinaries aren't a real thing"" comment tho
Was the point of making the meme to show how much hotter guys are now?
lmaoooo i saw this on r/memes and my comment was ‘damn the guy on the right looks hot af ngl’
tfw you try to be edgy but abolish gender by accident. Oopsie daisey!
Gotta love it when they try to be cruel but are so ignorant that they fail. You always look amazing and it’s funny that they picked you for this since you always look flawless. Like, they could have picked a non-binary individual that clearly doesn’t have their shit together like me and it would have been far more effective.
Both slides are fine! Let men be however they want, these weirdo conservatives can't handle the idea that some men want to be feminine, and it's not like the vast majority of men aren't still traditionally masculine. They're whining about a problem that doesn't even exist.
Two misgenders make a correct gender
That moment a meme that tried to be mean makes everyone accidentally gay.
Plot twist: the second pic is actually how the guy in the first pic dressed up in the privacy of his home.
Alcoholic, repressed, and riddled with heart disease, yessir, men were MEN back then!
The funniest thing is that the person on the left could be all kinds of things that conservatives don't like. We assume that is a man, but that's an assumption. Likewise, that person could be queer, non-binary, etc. Also, you look great, as usual!
I'm glad I'm in the present!!
wow today I learned queer people didn't exist in the 1940s 🙄
So 'men back then' where soldiers who put up a brave front, as their duty commanded.

And ""'men' today' are civillians who happilly mind their own buisness.

After the battle, let's celebrate the victory, js.
i prefer the men of today thank you very much
OP, You're HOT AF !!!!!
To be honest, I'd rather date the one on the right, they're just being themselves and not listening to what society says you have to do.
Just saw this in r/arethestraightsok
Dude I could look like both of these minutes apart people act like they’re mutual exclusive
The person on the right is my kinda guy!
i just commented on the r/arethecisok post talking abt how i love ur posts here lol
they can't handle the power of thigh highs.
Just jealous cuz you’re hot
You know you've made it in life when right-wingers look at you and go ""you don't want to be like this person""

Jokes aside you look absolutely stunning <3
You unintentionally trolled them nice 👍
I like how they put ""men"" in quotation marks, implying you're not really a man. Which is technically true.
Gotta love how the guy who probably beat the shit out of his wife and worked 16 hours a day at the factory is an aspirstion for these people.
I only see improvements
Lol I almost wish someone would post this on r/gatekeepingyuri
My man on the left has the worst fitting trousers of all time, hot stuff on the right is much better 😅

Edit :Accidental first non-anon comment on here oooooop
I saw this on r/rolereversal! There were sadly some transphobes/trolls but most of the comments were positive! :)
Actual gender goals.
i think the real question is what repressed situation do they have going on, lol. gotta be *looking* to find cuties in tights tbh 😂

no way they found that just casually scrolling, so they probably frequent the very subs they mock too
the meme doesn't even make sense since both images are attractive looking
The sad thing is just how much our society hates women. The fact that the ultimate insult towards a man is comparing him to a woman is telling.

Why shouldn't a man want to be feminine? What is so horrible about women that to be compared to them is the ultimate act of humiliation?

That's what bothers me so much about terfs, they claim to be feminists but they believe to their core that females are inferior.
Insert the ""Both? Both. Both is good"" meme here 👌
Pretty
Stay awesome, friend
They really think they are out here saying something. 

Like..  ok? Both of these are good.
That moment when they use a damn good photo to try and bring you down but youre really empowered from it! You killin it baddie 😊💖
Idk both are still pretty cute
Oh so that's you! I remember seeing this meme earlier today lol
You're both pretty attractive, frankly.
when will an attempt at a transphobic meme go viral and show everyone how hot i am. damn (you look fantastic)
I just want both can't they understand?
Couldn't be happier to be living in the present tbh
I prefer men today
I don't know about you but I do BOTH of these styles.
Wtf is your workout u/jazzzberrry damn
That’s a great pic of you though like…damn lol
Okay seriously wtf is your workout routine
Really wish I had the confidence and figure to dress like the right image
And both are hot AF. I'm not seeing the problem they're trying to make.
You’re just an enby icon and we’re all jealous. I know I am at least
Heh. They *hate* it when they can't understand their boner. Makes me smile.
As if there weren’t also non-binary people then and men in suits today lol
I feel like ppl who go by any/all pronouns are extra intimidating to transphobes cuz its like ""go ahead, TRY to misgender me. i DARE you.""
i can guaramtee you that the creator of that ""meme"" copies his day-to-day-look from the underside of a deep-fat-fryer and would not get even remotely close to either side of the meme XD
Men got hot!
Both are cute
So 'men back then' where soldiers who put up a brave front, as their duty commanded.

And ""'men' today' are civillians who happilly mind their own buisness.

After the battle, let's celebrate the victory, js.
I really want to have that outfit! The one on the right of course
Nice abs
you_tried.jpg
GUYS HEAR ME OUT WHAT IF THEYRE DATING!!
So glad that time has passed then!
Lmao, they look stupid anyway because you look cute as hell!
ur hot
does that mean I can share this meme with friends for fun?
I love this so much!!
Both are pretty hot xD
more into the one on the right <3
Men or not, you look absolutely amazing!
Lots of people now know how hot you are. It's also free advertising lol
YOU LOOK SO PRETTY THOUGH
We've sure come a long way
Honestly JazzzyB you're full-stop goals.

Knowing you've caught the attention of the patriarchy? Level fuckin'~~-em~~ up.

Keep it rad m8
Idk why but youre like elite enby to me. Maybe its just the gender expression envy comin out or how absolutely fantastic you look or both idk but uh yeah keep doing what youre doing friend. You looks great on you.
There were trans people in those days too 💀
Talk about an upgrade.
10/10 would date/bang/woo/spoil
Damn ""men"" today are pretty, we are so lucky to be alive at this time
My masc genderfluid ass be like
I’ll take today.
Upgrades people, upgrades!
You got ""the Rachel""
I'm sorry to say that I have seen this meme floating around before, but my thought was always that the person on the right looks amazing and like they have way more fun ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯
y’all both look slamming
You're much hotter than the before picture if we're all being honest here
Ur hawt
Men back then- would beat their wife for looking at them.

People now-
Looking At This, So Glad I Live In The Present, Even If It Comes At The Unfortunate Cost Of Hats Being Out Of Fashion.
This folks, is called progress
I'm pansexual. I'll take em' either way lol they both fine...
I think I saw your pic in a video as well
Damn men got hot! Literally biggest glow up
Both very hot. I like being bi
You are goals for all genders! I'm glad this has made your day and there's more positivity than negativity!
wait… this was supposed to be negative? You look way cooler than some boring cary grant wannabe!
THOSE LEGS JESUS
must've been rather strange to just see yourself while just scrolling reddit
Seems like a great time to be alive if you ask me
Damn.... what's up with ""men"" today.... much improved. Must be something in the water.
Exactly we are all 😈😈😈
Omfg you look soooo fucking good I want your outfit ASAP
I hope to look like you one day ❤️ you're so pretty 😍
I wish I looked half as good as the second pic
I mean i dont really see why discrimination like this exists.... Clearly you're not hurting anyone by being yourself... So whats it to anyone else?
Yeah I don’t get why they picked a hot person for this lmao
[removed]
I don't understand why people have an issue with this ones cute the other is snazzy both are good.
Still prefer cute tho 💗
Op you’re absolutely stunning, i hope you have a great day.
Improvement imo
I saw this on r/memes and i just said ""oh wow""
You’re looking so much better though. Can’t trust anyone that’s always wearing a suit
Both are good for me
Your fit is fire!! Looking good!
On the left we have someone who may mistreat his wife. On the right we have someone who could *be* your wife. I’d call that an upgrade.
OMG I downloaded this yesterday, sent it to a friend and said ""men are hot now wtf""
Hey, I see you all the time and get filled with all sorts of jelly. But above all, do you have any advice for someone that wants hair as gorgeous as yours but is currently stuck with a very gross ""man"" cut slowly growing? your hair gives me everything I want.
I am glad I was born in this era >\_>
Let just appreciate for a second how good that looks on you
The second one is way hotter. But that’s a nice suit in the first one.
I wish there were more Men like you in this world!
r/AccidentalAlly
i just randomly found this on my home page. r/terriblefacebookmemes thinks this is an upgrade (because it is)
lol what I find hilarious is that meme makers like this are spending tons of time in niche trans subreddits.

Like what are you doing, get over your internalized bullshit, stop making memes and buy that skirt you always wanted and you be the real you
This is the third time it’s showed up on my feed! You look great, btw.
To most ppl this is simply a femboy meme which would have nothing to do with nonbinary people
Also, this completely ignores all the magnificent men who were probably crossdressing and looking fabulous behind doors. 

These people just hate having to question their sexualities all over again.
right?!?!?!
link please?
hahahaha
it's funny how the person tried to be hurtful but ended up making my entire day! everyone has been so kind today it's been rly amazing
plus the fun double standard when an AFAB dresses masc and its just fine.  just leave people alone to be happy already
>They're whining about a problem that doesn't even exist. 

Oxford should update the OED with this definition of conservatism.
If this can happen then we can also try to do other stuff with gender-related topics. Imagine calculating the root of binary gender in front of a group of confused bigots. Glorious.
Or wished he could, but was too afraid and ashamed to. Then he died of a broken heart from being unable to love himself.
Back when men were men and boys were boys, and boys died doing what they loved, mining coal and factory working
Honestly yeah and tbh why the fuck not both? If anyone wants to dress like the left, go for it, looks sick. Anyone wants to dress like the right, fucking go for it. It's 2022 and we can dress however the fuck we feel like and that's even cooler.

Dress the left MWF and right T Th, and stun your office every day of the week
Same. This is a big upgrade

Omg same
do you have a link?
Someone already did!
I want both outfits lol

wow the comments there are surprisingly good!!

To be fair, our memes are absolute fire. They're doing the equivalent of studying an Olympic athlete's form.

I friggin' love this. I like thinking about all the dudes back then who were like ""Hey y'all, we should dress up like a bunch of dames, 'cause wouldn't that be so funny!?"" while inside they were like ""OMG, OMG, I'm actually going to get to dress up in public! Yes!""

Just make sure you get some baby oil or their removal solvent to avoid harming your skin during removal!!
these are always such good and validating compliments Tysm 💛
My gender evny AND my pansexuality... Can't handle anything of that xD (in a possitive way)

PRACTICE PRACTICE PRACTICE 

It took me fucking years to learn how to properly draw to suit my face god but in the meantime 
I use a good thin angled brush (Anastasia #13??? But any thin angled brush will do) get some REALLY pigmented shadow in whatever color suits best, get some pigment on the tip of ur brush and draw a baseline of ur eyebrow to ur eyebrow bone or whatever, TRY TO GET IT AS STRAAAAIGHT N CLEAN AS U CAN so u don’t have to make up little mistakes later, after going so go ahead and draw ur top line connecting the two so u have a lil eyebrow outline, make sure u don’t draw it TOO inward cuz then it’s hard to get a natural looking gradient and it can look too long this way. Once u have ur little outline go ahead and start filling in ur brow with pigment from the outside in, you wanna make the tail the most pigmented obvi and be careful to lightly shade it up to the front. You can stop there and use ur angled brush with some soap and water to fix up imperfections if u need. If you want em to REALLY pop like I do here (only works if you have some sort of liner/pomade in ur desired color so more bright poppy brows unfortunately u have to use shadow only but I’m sure u could whip up some sort of base by mixing ur shadow into a light liquid whatever) but take ur liner and basically draw over the tail of ur brow and fill it in up to like 3/4 of ur brow and then go over the meeting point of the shadow and brow with more pigment and blend it in so it looks clean

There u have it!! Very very quick rushed brow tutorial lol
I’m gonna shit my pants u guys are TOO FUCKING SWEET
Thank u 💛💛💛💛💛💛💛💛
just wait until u see me in my hatsune miku clout 👀 

(Thank uuuu 😭💛💛💛💛)
our wedding has to be on miku day no exceptions
oh I know lol I’m transmasc (practically ftm I just still don’t consider myself to be on the binary) using the men’s room at work when everyone was used to they/she is 😳
Ahhh I hope you enjoy it! 💛
Thank u u too 💛💛💛
Tysm!!!! It’s normally a bright ass yellow but my hairstylist be MIA rn ;-;
Thanks so much! 💛
just spend all ur money on tattoos and obsess over hatsune miku and u will GET THERE 😤
honestly the shape of my brow and my attitude makes a big fuckin difference I’m tryna hit that hella masc bold brow shape erryday but it’s HARD 

Just tryna look like a cute lil twink out here ahaha thank uuu
Thank you :) 💛💛💛
Thank u!! I don’t get specific style compliments often and I work hard to reach a certain aesthetic so I appreciate! 💛
it’s okay the crippling hatsune miku addiction completely offsets any physical pro I have 😂
Thank you so much!! Honestly every single one of these shirts came from Walmart LOL but I will say I’ve scored some cool looking ones thrifting :)
god I love ur art I would pay real world money for a miku
Thanks!!💛
w a l m e r t
thank u person i don’t no 💛
points for the specific 3 y heyyy
ty ty tyyyyyyyysm I got them off of Arctic Buffalo on sale! but I don’t believe they make them anymore 😔 
Unfortunately I wear them every single day because my other plugs just aren’t as practical and these NEVER fall out! Maybe one day I’ll stop prioritizing miku and tattoos n get some more 😂
thank yewwww I’ve definitely been feeling more confident as of late :) 
And thanks! I need new plugs so bad 😂
LOL they better let me promo for them at this point 👀 😂
I personally prefer handsome but thank uuuu
my sternum tattoo was one of my most painful tattoos fs 

I have two matching pieces more near my collarbones though and they weren’t too bad at all
oh perfect I’m scared of the dark-
seriously that chest piece is quality!
sorry :/

also i’m not taking offense but ppl misgender me alot bc i present masc so the king comment was kinda... yk
This is amazing, you are amazing, thank you!!!
😩😩😩😩😩😩
whoops. but yes very very handsome!
Fantastic to know!! I’ll try to work towards having the skills to pull it off reliably, thank you ☺️
wow not until next year.. so far away😪
I'm genderfluid, and on days when I'm wearing a dress, makeup, and heels, it is *pretty* uncomfortable walking into a men's room.  My boss went to bat for me with the property manager over it.  One week later, the men's room became a unisex bathroom 😁
If I may ask, because I'm so excited, how long did it take for your package to arrive? Even with covid delays/high demand?
lmao
🌟🌟🌟JEDHJS THANK YOU!!!
FUCK the search continues. You kill it though
I’m so so sorry! I assumed because you said u like to present masc I wasn’t thinking at all just typing and working I take it back no king here no way no how!!!
Ofc 💛
yk that’s a fair point but I don’t make the rules 😤
oh I can only IMAGINE! I’m sorry you’ve had to feel uncomfy but I’m glad that your management did do something to help :)
Honestly it took a little over a week which was unfortunate but with everything considering ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
If it helps target ALSO has similar shirts and I find a lot like this thrifting too!! 

You’re also super cute n pretty btw!!
oh nono dw, i do that sooooo often too. to clear up tho i am enby and also thx for editing the other comment :)
Oh wow that's not bad at all, definitely worth the wait. Thank you for your reply, I hope you have a good day today 😁
Oh shit I did not expect that! Thank u very much :) too kind
yes yes I should have asked first, assuming makes an ass of everybody! ahaha but of course my liege keep killing it out there 😤
For sure! I was just a little impatient since I bind every day and my binder had KILLED me after a rough day :’) but yes thank you you too!

It's so hard to avoid misgendering a person with outing them		"My friend did this when talking to his mom about me after I came out to him, but was still very closeted. Several times he would text me and say “I just awkwardly worded a sentence to avoid pronouns.” And I would always make him give me an example. It was beautiful.
I had a friend let me stay with him while waiting for a flight home from the city he lives in, and he used they/them pronouns while introducing me to his mom (he was still looking for an apartment at the time). Well then his mom went into a whole spiel about the “they can’t be singular” dealio all without realizing I’m actually nonbinary and those are my pronouns... yeah I just made my friend use she/her for me after that fiasco and we all just had to cringe through it.
I was on a group chat with a transgirl who wasn't out to the rest of the chat, and I was doing gymnastics to use as few pronouns and names as possible for her.
Also see: me writing about myself in a school context, lol
Personally I don't find it that hard to avoid gendered pronouns, but then I remember that I got so mad at pronouns being a closed linguistic class that as an experiment to see how devoid I could make my language of them, I created a new FB profile and spent a year never using a single one in reference to myself or anyone else. And then accidentally I never went back to my original FB profile and nobody there has any idea what my AGAB is.
One of my best friends is genderfluid and they aren't out yet. They're okay with me deadnaming and misgendering them when I mention them to my family because we've known eachother for a long time and it isn't really my place to come out for them... I do avoid talking too much about them, and I never deadname or misgender them otherwise. We'll have to figure something out sometime though.

I'm NB myself, and I am *so* closeted. I'm AFAB and I like ""feminine"" clothes and makeup as much as I love suits and baggy jeans. I guess that keeps my family from questioning me too much!
Cries in spanish speaker (basically everything has gender difference, including but not limited to most adjectives, whether you are talking about yourself or others, and and an inclusive language for non-binary people is only recently started to become a thing and a lot of people refuse to recognize it as valid)
Ohhh dear. I do this with my patients - did this today with a transmasc NB patient, person is him/he but not out yet so I had to dance around it when speaking to the parents.
i immediately switch to my native language whenever i talk about my trans friend to my parents since it uses gender-neutral pronouns anyway

(for anyone who might b curious: it's filipino :])
Try doing this in german:')

I want to move
1. try to use gender-neutral pronouns, but you can't because people will notice and call you because your parents are enbiphobic 
2. try to use their name, well you can't because you don't wanna out them and you don't wanna deadname them either
3. make a really weird ass sentence that people can't understand

Me choosing option 3: 😎
I remember I had a trans friend that wasn't out to her parents and man I just had to take the L and misgender them cause I know I would fuck up if I didn't
This is so real! 

I had to misgender a friend once at their house during a family dinner and was giving them the *I know this is wrong I'm so so sorry* look the whole time.

Thankfully my friend found the humour in my discomfort and failed attempts at not misgendering them and they thought it was hilarious. I was really proud of them for not being hurt by their parents' not so subtle insistence that I called them she/her.
This made me lol ♥️
I love Thomas. Also super true.
My language doesn't really have any convincing non binary pronouns so this is how I try to talk about myself all the time. It leads to hilarious sentences sometimes, like ""tiredness is strong in me"".
Also me before exchanging pronouns with someone I don't know
i love thomas
LMAO me when my friend and I went on a trip and my (homo+transphobic) mom called to check on me and say hi to my friend, so I asked my friend if I could use binary pronouns to avoid getting berated (we ended up using the pronouns the binary opposite of their assigned-at-birth). Funny enough, they later came out as those exact pronouns and binary identity, so I guess I guessed right back then hehe
That's Just What I Do When Talking About People Whose Pronouns I Don't Know, Just Reformat e The Sentence To Use As Few Pronouns As Possible, And Use Their Name In Place Of A Pronoun As Many Times As Possible Before It Starts Sounding Weird. Granted The Sentences Will Become Quote Twisted And Confusing, But It Still Works!
we stan thomas sanders
Uuuugh, my best friend in high school was trans and it was so awkward! He would get *so pissed* if I misgendered or dead named him but also would panic at the thought of his parents finding out. THERE WAS NO WAY TO WIN.

Ah, high school, I do not miss those years at all.
Can you give us an example? This would be beautiful (btw feel free to say no)
\*sigh\* sounds like it's time for my favourite poem

***roses are red*** 

***violets are blue***

***singular they predates singular you***

***but even if it didn't, i'd still want to make TERs dead***
What's AGAB mean? My dumb dyslexic brain auto filled assigned gay at birth and I dont think that's probably the correct answer
Oh wow are you me? I honestly don’t know if I can be bothered coming out to most of my family tbh. I’m feminine enough (I’m AFAB) for them to not notice anything so I’d rather not attract drama atm.
Shout-out to you from another Spanish speaker that struggles a whole lot with pronouns. I don't really like the ""e"" ending (for me, obviously, it's cool of other people find them good for them) so I either try to alternate from feminine and masculine pronouns or not use them at all. If you catch me looking to the horizon in the middle of a conversation I'm trying to find *•°•*words*°•°*
>a lot of people refuse to recognize it as valid

As a fellow Latine, fuck that; that's how language works. Refuse to recognize their bigotry as valid.

Plus, I've noticed that when one uses the ""e"" ending, most people don't really seem to notice or mind, and those who do are either OK with it or raging bigots.
A+ understatement, lol. Where do you want to move to?
we do stan thomas sanders
This is how our *life* feels. It's not fun.
Friend’s mom: oh, how is (deadname)?

My friend: oh... um I talked to (deadname) yesterday, at school. (Deadname) and I share the same class!
Hahaha, you definitely aren't the only one to take that acronym in that way. It means _Assigned Gender At Birth_.
that's genius whenever people ask for my agab i'm just going to say 'gay' XD
Yeah, I think that too, but that doesn't erase that I see a lot of people just screaming the RAE is basically the maximum authority on the spanish language and if it's not recognized there it's wrong. But that's not how language or dictionaries work, language is is constantly changing with the times and the changes in culture, and a dictionary is supposed to just be a recording of of the common uses of the language, not any kind of authority.
For reals, it’s a juggling act no one should have to go through, especially a teenager. I’m glad my friend was able to come out in college and be himself, he was so much happier.
bit late but i just use they when talking to anyone about anyone. no confusion can be made if you are consistent
Ahhhhh! That makes sense xD it's too early for this 😂

Being 6'3 with a beard usually leaves me being misgendered or not taken seriously, it can make it hard to like how I look. But fuck it, got my first real haircut in ages and felt cute		"I relate so hard to the misgendering. At least we have each other. 🥺 You’re  beautiful all around and your haircut looks great.
Nonbinary does not equal androgynous!  Embrace all parts of yourself, including you awesome beard and beautiful hair.
you are very good looking and anyone who has a problem with that is just jealous
I truly love enbies with beards, large hips/breasts, Adam’s apples, etc - we are so fucking powerful!!! ♥️
You’ve got a very noble and ethereal sort of look
You look good! I’m afab with hair down to my waist, so I kind of get it. I love my hair and I’m not going to cut it, but it makes it hard to come off as androgynous. I try not to let it affect the way I see myself because hair shouldn’t have a gender ffs. But it’s hard to look the way you want when people assign the wrong meaning to it
All your hair looks so soft 🥺
Your hair is beautiful!
GORGEOUS
You are beautiful, love that hair! Really nice colour.
Your hair is absolutely gorgeous - I love the color and the curls! I certainly wish I could replicate some of those elements in my own hair...
I’m straight and still think you look cute.
for some reason your overall appearance reminds me of red wine and jasmine flowers
You look so cute! I relate to being misgendered. It’s so painful.
I'm sorry people aren't broad-minded, I hope they will be in the future.
I'm digging the curls! And I couldn't agree more! Not that you need my validation or asked for it but trying to be positive without shouting hear hear!
Also thank you for posting! Yay!
Your looks have nothing to do with people misgerndering you. Just because you're fabulous doesn't give anyone the right to assume your gender ;)
what ur cute af human look at u go! dayum
oh i feel you- beard, 6 foot, deep voice... yeah.

you look great though! your hair looks soft!
Looks kind of like mine, same color, texture, and side part. As a matter of fact, you look like a more masc version of me (minus the lack of freckles).
you are what I wanna look like, lord grant me the strength to grow out my hair.
You look so pretty😍your eyes and your hair! And don't forget, you are SO valid, no matter what you look like:)
Wow, I really don't even know what to say right now...

Never in a million years did I expect to wake up to a response like this

You're all incredible people and I appreciate the hell out of you, this past week has been one of the hardest I've ever had. Thank you so much for your kind words, it means the world to me
you’re super pretty!!!
You kinda look like Jesus. The weird made up white Jesus, anyway.

You look lovely

You have such a calming vibe, like if I upvote this I’ll get 10 years of good luck
Adorable
You do be lookin a lil cute tho

I love the fresh cut! The curls are PRECIOUS 😍. Also, your eyes are beautiful ☺️
You are precious loved and worthy!
Those loose curls are so cute <3 also your eyes are GORGEOUS and I would commit several crimes to get skin like yours omg. Keep rocking it, friend!
Your hair is so pretty! I love the soft waves!
Your hair is so pretty! I love the soft waves.
You’re gorgeous
Oh gosh...You are a stunning human being 💛
Heyyyy!!!! I am a 6’ nonbinary person with a massive beard and I live with the same perceptions. Your hair looks great!!!!!!!
You are beautiful! As a 4ft11 enby I am very jealous of your lovely height.
You're indeed really cute :D
You look so cute!! And I love the beard with that hair length looks very nice!
Oh... Welcome to the club!
Being 6'4 with a beard I can relate to that a lot
I'm so jealous of your hair asfdhsfqw
You are one good looking person and I am SUPER jealous of your gorgeous ringlets! You rock them!
You look so luscious and pretty 😭
your hair is immaculate omg
Your curls are to die for!
Your hair is absolutely stunning! You’re beautiful.
You, your hair and beard are beyond cute 🥰
I love your curls, they're so pretty 💕
Looking good!!
You ARE cute
You’re very lovely and pretty! Thank you for sharing <3
You look super cute! You have beautiful hair.
Super cute! Love this cut for you.

\*\*My kiddo is 14, 6ft, NB, and starting to grow facial hair. I'm going to show them your pic so they can see how good you look. They are a bit of a princess so I have already shown them Jason Van Ness.\*\*
You’s a super cute human! 🥰
Your curls are lovely!
I'm not gonna lie, you look like Beard from Hotline Miami and that is the HIGHEST of compliments because he is very cool
You. Are. Cute.
THIS THIS THIS
Hell yes, exactly this!!!!!
It is pretty bomb hair
I’m not sure if this makes anything better or worse, but I’d say I look pretty androgynous and it doesn’t help the misgendering... people cling to binary gender :/
your identity is valid no matter how you choose to express!!
Lmao why are you trolling a two week old post on a nonbinary subreddit?
Read the room - not exactly appropriate here.
Honestly, it's hard to properly express how touched I am by that.

 Also how incredible it is to see a parent that's as caring, involved, and dedicated as you seem to be ; especially in regards to what your kid is currently navigating.

Thank you for that, the world needs more parents like you, hope that you and you kid are doing well in these crazy covid times ❤️
Ooooo shit I see it!!! I'm not super familiar with the series but yeah, that definitely tracks

Well, now I know a second last minute cosplay I can pull off if I end up at a convention with friends (my usual go to is sanji from one piece because I'm a chef and lazy)
My kiddo went something like this 

age 10 mom i like boys. 

Cool me too.

age 11 mom i like to wear pretty things.

cool me too.

age 12 mom, I don't feel like a boy or a girl. 

great lets look into this. 

age 14 the idea of relationships and ""stuff"" makes me squirm

\*my aro ace self\* Cool, me too. lol

&#x200B;

My niece actually re-introduced HERSELF to us a few months ago, my kiddo is lucky to be surrounded by a literal rainbow of people. I wish more kids had that.
That speaks volumes towards your relationship and parenting though, the fact that they came to you about those things in the first place

I absolutely love my mom but at any of those ages the idea of saying any of those things to her sounds terrifying

She's someone who's open minded and would've never judged me either, we just never reached that point in our interpersonal relationship"	n3m8pr	NonBinary	2446	1.0	2021-05-03 02:50:45
My girlfriend made a meme based on true events. I love her so much.		"Luigi being nb kinda really fits imo (for someone who hasnt played any mario games)
💖💞💖
Oh my god I love this! Thanks for sharing 🤗
Awesome art. 

Know that feeling all too well though.
This meme gave me gender envy of Luigi >:(
That's so cuuute

Omg slay
lovely. what did the original say?
I love your girlfriend for this too 🤭 The problem is both me and my partner are Luigi-types in these scenarios so I'm sure we look ridiculous going back and forth to get behind each other 😂 I'm certain our friends have heard us say beneath our breath to each other many times, ""you ask..."" ""no, you go ask!""

I guess our cat has the Daisy energy to make up for it but she's not asking for anything other than more food and more playtime. She's a goofy girl.
This is beauty.
Luigi > Mario
I with all seriousness told my friends that Luigi transcends all genders
Luigi is an egg. Too scared to come out. 

Luigi won a mansion. 

""Great!"" Luigi thought. ""Finally, a place to figure myself out without fear of judgment.""

Place turns out to have almost every room haunted. 

SMH
As the Younger sibling who always played Luigi. Yes. I mean look at me now, genderqueer and proud
I absolutely had to! I can’t contain myself ❤️❤️
""Excuse me, he asked for no pickles!""
100%, but I'm def biased cus green is my fav colour and red is my least favourite
Correct, Luigi is indeed taller of the two brothers.
Trans gender is officially short for “transcends gender”
Thank you
Why am I only now finding out that always me wanting to play as Luigi was gender envy all along
Omg I’m going to start telling people this
Is it really? I'd love to see the source because that sounds awesome.

I know the trans prefix usually means ""across"" or on the other side of something.
Apparently they made it up.
They just came up with it
I know 😊
I cannot possibly be the first person to think of that but yeah lol"	10tlyqs	NonBinary	2296	1.0	2023-02-04 17:29:30
Feeling super dysphoric rn & my mom keeps misgendering me so have some pics where I felt tons of gender euphoria (+ dog)		"Okay the blazer and shirt combo in photo one is an aspirational look for me that I have never nailed in such a way as you!!!! Perfection ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️
Your hair is so lovely 🤩

Sorry about your mom, though. It’s rough, but living your truth is so worth it in the long run.
I like your Unnus Annus hat👉👈
Those glasses really suit your face! Looking nice.
Sick locs!
there is no jaw-drop emoji but I'd post it here if there was 💚
Looking at photos...

Would hire

✨You look incredible!✨Let your true self shine through, your mom will get with the program eventually!!
you look wonderful
Sorry about the stress with your mom, your euphoria looks great!
YOU! ARE ! VALID ! 

Correct your parents on your pronouns ! They should respect you !!
Gender envy😔
i feel that. my mom is very supportive of me and genders me correctly, but other family members do not. i dont live in the same continent as them, and so this past year for my birthday we did a zoom call (it was more for them than me). . and i was constantly misgendered .. not fun. 

my mom, for what its worth, sent an email later saying that she was sorry abou the misgendering and that it mustve been hard. but yeah, i totally get where youre coming from.
You’re feelings are so valid. Also you look amazing and I LOVE your shirt in the second pic!!
You look seriously cool though, no joke.
So sorry about ur mom:,( on the bright side u are truly fabulous✨
Love these pictures! You are a light! Keep it up.
Woah! You look great! I especially love your hair!
you are stunning!!! ✨ sorry about your mom, hoping she comes around eventually
Love the outfits!!

But sorry about your mom, that can be really tough, hope it gets better.
You are valid and you are perfect the way you are. You deserve respect and love. 
Btw. I love your style
You’re very pretty, I’m sorry she’s misgendered you and if it makes you feel better I think you’ve got a kind of androgynous look
Damn you look amazing! Loving the suit! 

You look exactly like the person who sits next to me in graphics class and it shocked me a bit 😅
Your glasses are so on point!! Very handsome in all pics but we have like the same kind of professional style so I’m especially loving the first pic!
You look amazing! And ur dog is so cute looks like my old dog 🥺
Is the Unus annus merch I see??
Also I love your style
That lipstick tho 👀❤️
𝘗u𝚙𝗉ƴ!
Wtf you're so cool, it's so nice seeing other enbies of color too, unapologetically euphoric and embracing themselves

Also Memento Mori, I'm so glad you were there for one of the best channels ever!
We love that Gender Euphoria™
The suit, hoodie, and dog pics are my favorite 💕
You have such a nice smile !!!

UNUS ANNUS HAT SPOTTED

That blazer looks great on you
YOU ARE SO HANDSOME and your dog is adorable!! Damn I wish I had your style. If you ever need someone to talk to my DMs are always open, friend!

Edit: sorry if you don’t like the word “handsome” I use that for my nb partner but if it’s not for you let me know!! Hope you’re having a good day 💖
Ah! All these pictures look amazing! Serious gender envy from that first picture 😂 you're doing great liege. I'm sorry the dysphoria is hitting

At least pets (especially doggos) never misgender their owners.
ur so cool wowie :-D!!
You are absolutely stunning 😍
My hair: 🤢
Yours: 🥰
Like can I have some 😔
Why does everyone look like a god!!!
I see that Annus hat 👀
I absolutely LOVE the flannel on you! (Tho you look great in all these pics :))
Adorable doggo! I'm so sorry that happens to you. My mom does that to me all the time, so just remember you're not alone. Love your outfit!
Damn you're stunning, what s your pronouns
wow you are stunning!!
Your hair is amazing, and you got great style!
I love your variety looks and vibes you create, (and your puppers)!

May I ask the hard question, if you think your Mom ""doesn't get it"" or is just plain not accepting?  If it's the latter, then please know you have a huge, accepting community that is walking this walk with you.  If it's the former, please be as patient and loving with her as you can muster.  We are all in the process of living out the seminal words of Crosby, Stills, and Nash:

...And teach your parents well  
Their children's hell will slowly go by  
And feed them on your dreams  
The one they pick's the one you'll know by

Don't you ever ask them, ""Why?  
If they told you, you will cry  
So just look at them and sigh  
And know they love you
me: scrolling through nb pics tryna figure out if I'm bi or pan

sees you being cute af

alright, pack it up lads, we're done here. definitely pan.
thank you for saying that! i'm trying hard to keep that in mind i've spent years trying to accept my identity and i think that's more important than what my mom say or does 💛
ahhh fellow unnus annus fan! momento mori 💛
This
To the dog?
surprisingly the beanie is one of my most gender-affirming items of clothing so thanks to eef & mark! + momento mori! 💛
it's super hard to correct people on my pronouns i feel like i'd sound annoying if i corrected her repeatedly but i have corrected her about 3 times before so that's a step 😅
ahhhh that's exactly how i feel sometimes when scrolling through the subreddit haha, every enby comes in a different shape and form you'll find your true form and absolutely slay 💛
I absolutely love your mom! That was very sweet of her to make light of a bad situation :) + (yikess sorry that happened to you hope you had a good b-day otherwise)
Yes! that makes me feel immensely better haha androgynous is what i'm really going for so thank you, that makes me really happy :) (respect to my primarily  masc & fem enbys tho)
Lmaooo, do I have a doppelgänger now? haha &  thank you btw! felt so happy when i got this suit
Yessss, blazers for the win! thank you 💛
momento mori! glad to see more enby unus annus fans :) + thank you!
i haven't worn red lipstick in about 3 years (because i thought it was extremely gendered but realized any gender can wear makeup!) i definitely missed the bold red lip haha
his name is nikko hehe :)
Enby poc need more representation!! i'm glad i can represent :) + momento mori! that channel will always have a special place in my heart 🥰
no u 🥺💛
ANOTHER EEF & MARK FAN SPOTTED
Yes! i'm fine with any compliment :) and thank you! this brightened my day for sure 💛
ahhh liege is the cutest thing! haha thank you 💛
his name is nikko! thanks for asking :) and you're so sweet! 💛
awww, yes nikko (my dog) has been with me through lots of hard times love him! 🥰
hahaha sure, take some! might shave my head 😳
a god? ah! i'm so flattered lol thank you haha
only the best of the best know 👀
he/they :)
hahahaha i'm also pan! glad i could help (no but seriously thank you!) 🥰
It took me years to realize what i am, and my mom can't accept it as she thinks its a form of self delusion brought about by hanging out with democrats.

I have stopped interacting with her as much as possible way before this but its kinda one more nail in the coffin.

So you can understand this is coming from someone who is walking away from misgendering and toxicity, its much better to live your truth even if someone doesn't like you for it/disagrees, you will be living with you FAR LONGER than anyone else will live with you and you deserve to be free to find own happiness. Don't live with a miserable person, do what makes you happy even if someone else tries to make you miserable for it. You are more important than anyone else's opinion.
Indeed
Absolutely!
Absolutely!
That's a good start ! 

My mom and my coworkers at work so the same thing. They're all slowly getting on training and in the meantime, correcting people on your pronouns is also validating yourself
Awwww that's the sweetest reply I have ever gotten on this app. Thank you! I hope everything goes well for you💞
yeah, it was extremely validating. some times all you need is a , ""that must be tough/hard for you"" sympathetic ear, especially if its on something you cant fully understand. we just want to be validated. 

side note: you are *sooooo* pretty and cute! (hope those r ok words). your eyes are gorgeous! love the septum, whered you get it? i need a new one.
My sister called me it when I came out and I've loved using it ever since! 💛
I love Nikko 🐶 good dog
I’m pretty sure you’d look good in anything so if you want to go for it! And thank you for the hair 🤲🏽
Youre extremely handsome my friend I hope its gonna get better with your mom
wow, your story is truly inspiring. its awful that you had to go through with that! (especially since she made your identity political ugh). i really really appreciate your sentiment! it was really moving 💛
thank you so much! i'm fine with any compliment but i appreciate the thought :) + i got my septum at amazon actually! (pic 3) it came with sooo many more, my advice before choosing tho is know your gauge and mm before choosing! you don't want a septum ring that doesn't fit you (i learned that from experience hahaha)
I'm glad you got a lot out of it. Those kinds of thoughts are what kept me going through my depression anxiety ADD symptoms and learning to accept myself for who I am.

For a more practical real-world advice, it's going to be hard to remember that especially on the bad days, even when you feel like you don't believe it tell it to yourself anyway.

I'm nonbinary, dammit, and I'm tired of getting misgendered by people in my life. They/them!		"Big same 😓 but looking amazing in those photos!
Same, my own mother and sister have not once used my pronouns.

Makes me feel stupid.
Omg those glasses suit you so well!~~
Same! Love the style you have though !
Love your tattoos!
I can't imagine someone looking at you and thinking ""ah yes, gender""
Look like a them to me 🌺
A whole existence of years can't be erased overnight,  but things evolve through revolutionary love 💕 ✊🏳️‍⚧️🏳️‍🌈
I like ur glasses
Me too. I understand how it can confuse people but it does get annoying. Especially if you let people know and they still do it. I get slip ups, but my coworkers do this. Except for one. I thank her everyday
I think i'mma steal some tattoo ideas 😂. You look amazin!!!
Oh my lordy, plz be my enby friend
I diagnose you with being heccin' cute!
Same.
Same, friend, same. Cute photos BTW :D
Oml, you look wonderful! ☺️
Same!! All day every day. Even when I have my pronouns on my pins and mask 🥲
Love your hair cut and colour, and the tattoos!
Some people in my life seem to think I'm wanting Royal pronouns and are still confused. 

I'm they/them/their/that person/that one ; but still accepting birth pronouns for now. I'm not used to the language I want just yet so I've not been correcting people much. 

More annoyed by the glares I get when I'm washing my hands in a public bathroom than anything at this point. Old ladies seem to be very convinced I've ""got man bits and belong in the man bits toilets"" by the way they glare at me and my slightly hairy upper lip and flattish chest. If there was a bathroom for people that aren't a male and aren't a female I would be there but most places still have only the 2 options here.

Edit: my point is ""you are not alone"" and I see ya. Hopefully with time more people will use your pronouns without correcting them first.
Damn what a handsome theyby
fuckin lets gooo
love the last pic ahhahah
Gah you look so good! As much as I love my long hair part of me really wants to try that style xD
I have nonbinary friends at college! You look so witchy and cute! 🖤
Same here; my friends aren’t acknowledging it much, but you look great to me!
Same! My partner is literally the only person who respects me. Even my boss and co-workers, who constantly *claim* to be allies, outright refuse to use my pronouns.
I feel u fam 🥺
You're gorgeous
I see you!!!
You look super cool, like someone I'd want to be friends with
See that person over there? They are an absolute hottie :)
dear non binary person you are very attractive i do however feel the urge to share my apologies for people being too inconsiderate and lack the basic human respect to use your proper pronouns and gender we shall send them the goblin immediately 
yours truly another non binary person
You look great on that picture.
Omg those tattoos <3 I thought I was in r/goblincore at first
A never ending struggle. But, you look amazing.
Omg same! My parents refuse to use my pronouns and my coworkers forget 🙄 like just the constant never ending he/him is such a pain in the ass.
Ohhh so much gender envy. You look awesome!

And yeah, I feel that too. Trying to teach my dad the right pronouns and he's just not getting it. 😔
I feel that. All I hear is she/her, even tho I always wear a pin that clearly states my pronouns. I'm exhausted by it
They're so attractive✨
Unfortunately relatable
SAME! i look very fem and i'm closeted :(

it pains me every time i get called ""she"". i feel more of a connection with they/them and he/him. :(

&#x200B;

you look great though!
Honestly style inspiration 👍
They / damn sound better cuz damn person u look splendid
People put too much importance on being called a certain thing. Pronouns are pronouns.  Who cares.  Focus that energy on something more productive and fulfilling.
[removed]
so cute!
Preach
Omg that second photo. ❤️❤️❤️
Oh same, I told a friend that I’m non-binary and that I would like to go by a different name. She still calls me by my “dead name” and uses gendered pronouns (not really my dead name yet bc I’ve only told her). It makes me so angry but I’m not confident enough to correct her every time.
what an amazing they/them being :3 looking very beautiful uvu
If your non-binary then why does it matter?
If your non-binary why do you care?
thank you!!
I know that feeling. Though I'm happy I'm not called bloke anymore at least
Give them time. Y'all are training them to respect them. Totally glowing enby in that photo!
No offense to your beloveds, but those feelings are there's to have. You are your own and we support you 💛🌟
that's so valid and hard! i assure you that you're not stupid though. i hope they change
THEY'RE stupid

And ur hair
thanks!! lmk if you wanna see the full half sleeve more clearly!! it's all self-done patchwork
why thank you dr.!
I know next to nothing about them >!heh, ""them""!<, but if possible, maybe a wig would allow you to keep your current hair length while trying on a shorter style?
thank you! i really hope your friends get with the program soon!
thank you!! i love tattooing myself, i'm working on a half sleeve at the moment. ideas on what to add?
I'm sorry you're hurting and I hope you feel better soon.
that's really so hard! it definitely feels like being disrespected. if you want to be friends it might be worth a chat with her to get her on the same page?
hm good question. i wish more people naturally saw/referred to me as my real gender, nonbinary, instead of my biological sex, and it causes a disconnect. but honestly, you're right that maybe i shouldn't care so much. regardless of how they see me im nonbinary anyway :00

also sorry if i misread your text tone lol it just got me thinking
It's been like a year though. I just think they don't understand/care
Hey buddy. Dunno what's happened to you that's made you want to go on the internet and try to upset strangers but I hope things get better for you 💜
this is my favorite compliment i've ever received omg
This is our storyline too
They still are,  even as we post this! Keep glowing!
Oh sure yes!
Idk. How about a completely made up symbol, so if anyone asks what it means, you can make something up?
Maybe. I’ll try talking to her about it. If she doesn’t try after that, then I’m not sure I wanna be friends with someone who doesn’t even try to respect me.
No worries 
Your cool
some people just can’t be changed, unfortunately. i hope you have other people in your life you can rely on in that way, friend. 🫶🏼
aww 🙈💛🤍💜🖤
:0 i honestly love that! like a word in a language that doesnt exist or something
I have one friend who is Non-binary conscious but I don't see her much unfortunately.
This was our experience for faaaar too long. We let them die never knowing our true inner nature, and remember the good they did and keep faith that they would have loved the evolution of ur unique being. And sometimes those ppl are unfortunately still living 😕

time to get misgendered by people at my job		"Don’t you just love when ✨people✨
Epic non-binary eye roll to prepare for binary shenanigans 🔥💜
Right?

I swear to FUCKING GOD. If some sweet little old lady calls me 'young lady' again, I will pop a blood vessel.

Like... I get that some people don't know. It is fine to get frustrated by strangers. It's fine when an acquaintance slips and spends way too long apologizing for a really little mistake. It is fine when sometimes people just forget and need a refresher, or you have to explain what 'nonbinary' is. It is fine. 

But my god. The patience. It takes. To deal with people who think of *none* of that and just keep calling you ""lady"". ARGH. The previous is mildly frustrating, but doable. The latter? I would be ripping out my hair.
Omg the two tone eyebrows is such a look……
I have my pronouns on my name tag and people always seem to read my name just fine but they/them is unintelligible apparently 🙃
I'm not gonna attempt to gender you at all, but I will say you look great and your hair and tattoo are 🔥🔥🔥
don’t worry about them you’re slaying 🤝
How do you deal with that? I wanna get a job again and I'm afraid of my social anxiety from possible misgendering/outing getting in the way :(
It's always really hard when strangers (or customers you see all the time, but they don't know) misgender you. But I always find it worse when coworkers who you're out to misgender you or struggle with your pronouns. I recently left a job that I had been openly nonbinary at for over a year, and I still got misgendered by coworkers on a daily basis 🙃 and some of them got angry with me when I tried to correct them!!
This is why everyone gets nonbinary treatment from me unless a gender preference is given.  By nonbinary treatment, I mean I simply say things like ""Thank you"" without adding an arbitrary expression of gender on the end, which feels awkward anyways.
bro is exquisite
Time to misgender them back 😎
😔

Sorry homie it be like that
ok but you look cool as fuck and im very jealous

really sucks getting misgendered constantly :\[\[\[
Thought you didn’t have pupils for a sec.  Very r/voidpunk
you just EMBODY the ""my gender is non-corporeal"" vibes here.
Love this hair 🔥
I have my pronouns on my lanyard and tell my colleagues about my pronouns and how I identify as.


All 30+ (except 1) still refer to me as she/her. 

Live Laugh Gender Dysphoria ✨❤️
on my way home from getting misgendered at work 🤙🏻
you’re so cool looking btw??? the hair??? the EYEBROWS??? Can we be friends fr
🙄🙄 I feel you
I love your hair 🤩
:0 you are very cool!
I hear you 😩 hope you have a good shift at work
Your eyebrows and hair are amazingggggg
Literally everyday and I hate it
WHERE HAVE YOUR EYES GONE
Ughhh I’m so sorry 😔 I deal with the same shit all the time. People “ma’am” and “girl” me nonstop 🙃
You look so fucking cool 💚🖤
You look so gender omg! I also get misgendered literally all the time so I get you haha, stay strong sib
My sympathies, dear.
Every single day they’re like 🤡
i'm sorry we can't read your mind
[deleted]
c'est le vie
My manager put my pronouns on my name tag for this reason and maybe 1 in 100 people correct themselves and so far I've had 3-4 people ask if I'm pregnant/what gender I'm having/when I'm due (I'm NOT pregnant btw). Just love ✨people✨ 
Some coworkers just laugh at the audacity while others ask why I don't correct the misgendering, honestly I'd get more frustrated having to do that all day than just letting it slide (plus I don't know how to do that without coming off rude)
Ugh I work at a record shop and we get a lot of special orders in for people. I usually have a stack of them with each persons number on it so I can call them and let them know their cd or record has arrived. That stack of CD’s is almost always a guaranteed handful of “thank you sir” “alright bro” “hey man thanks for calling.” Some days I get through the whole day without being misgendered until that point
On a side note I looove your hair especially the green very cool !!
Saaaaame! A majority of my staff is non-binary so we respect each other but customers _just don’t get it_
Somehow it always feel like they god damn know and make sure to remind you that you can either be a man or a woman (in their little pea brain). How many time can a person say miss or maam or sweet girl or any specific gendered words in a sentence, strangely way to many time. Im a cashier and idk why but every old woman that speak to me always have to add the miss or maam at the end of aaaaall their sentence 

Its even more annoying that my work place wont allow me to wear a pin with my pronouns on it but still say they are for diversity
You give me gender envy
I feel that... 😭😭😭
Love your hair and piercings! 😎🤝💚
Can I ask where you got your pink ear jewelry? It's super cool!
I feel that on a spiritual level. I live in the south so no one gives a damn or cares to try and correctly gender me
A very /r/VoidPunk stare.
Honestly in my opinion pronouns doesnt   actually mean whatever your gender is because  a friend of mines who is non binary told me this but anyways if they keep  misgendering you just quit your job and get a better job because its not worth your time if you  feel annoyed by them misgendering you 

but if its a high paying job, just kindly remind them that your gender is.......

either way thats all I got I'm sorry
Haha that happens to me all the time at my job as well. I totally feel that. XD
Idk how you guys didn't get used yet. I mean, I admire your perseverance but still it stress me less when I at least pretend that I don't care. And honestly, I prefer to think that I don't care, really. It makes me feel less miserable and ashamed of myself.

Honestly, no one really care about me, so why bother
Oh yes, 🙄people🙄
People 😒
Us silly little nonbinarys going about our forced binary lives ❤️🥵👌🏾
For a second I was concerned cuz I couldn't see their pupils :rofl:
Holy fucking mood, but in my case it's 'young man' or something similar.   


But I feel it get's far worse when you try and correct someone and they go off on you for it...
I feel that, I've gotten kind of hung up on being called ""sir"" by employees at stores. ""Can I help you, sir?,"" ""What can I get you, sir?,"" ""Do you need help finding anything, sir?"" Like, my whole thing is wanting to be androgynous, so people instantly snapping to calling me ""sir"" is a bit of a bummer, it just makes me feel like a cis guy.
100%, I usually give strangers a pass even though it's irritating af. It's the coworkers I've been out to for 6+ months & given *detailed* explanations to misgendering me that really get me down.

Annnnd the one employee at my regular grocery store who's just so *aggressive* about it. We're talking ending every sentence with ""lady"", ""ma'am"", or ""madam"". I wish I was exaggerating but I'm not...and she does this when I'm presenting more masc too. At least she does it to everyone, so it's not targeted or anything. I always try to avoid her line/the self checkout where she's stationed whenever humanly possible lol.
thank you !!!
A lot of older ppl don't know what it means when someone includes their pronouns or possibly can't read the font if they have poor eyesight. It's very annoying, but it's not usually personal, just ignorant.
im supposed to have a tag with pronouns but my manager won’t buy tags for anyone anymore for idk what reason
thank you so much!!! my pronouns are they/them! im cool with any compliments and cool with being called any form or bro, dude and im cool with bitch lol
it annoys me but i just try to think about how they don’t personally know me so it’s not like they are attacking me in any way. if that makes sense
same !!!
had to do it to em
thank you !!
Ughh I’m so sorry - that’s horrible🫣😣 I own my own business and it’s very successful, however I work and live in a very religious area, a lot of rural work, churches, religious people, etc.  A lot of awesome folks in the cities I work in, but I live about 45 mins from the cities.  If I came out publicly as non-binary and dressed how I wanted to, it would literally ruin my life and I would not make enough money to survive.  I have to work with others (on a subcontracted basis, need the money) who are so damn anti-trans it makes my teeth feel like they’re gonna shatter because I’m having to clench them so hard every time some dumb shit gets said. 
My partner and I have talked about moving, but in my kind of work, it takes a very long time to build a clientele, and we rely so much on my income we literally could not survive.  So. Fun. 🥲 that I built this business while I was still in denial of my identity due my religious upbringing.  It just feels so impossible some days to get up and try to pretend I’m cis all day at work so that I can continue to survive…it’s so shitty.  Sending love to everyone on this subreddit, being misgendered on the daily is so fucking exhausting and depressing🫠😔🫶🏽
it was actually pretty good today thank you !
Most people usually tell people when they get it wrong, then it's just purposely being disrespectful if you keep doing it on purpose.
maybe don't assume strangers' genders then it's not that hard to use neutral terms with people whose pronouns you don't know
???
spencer’s i think !
omg same
yep. language barriers can come into accessibility/understanding there too
Yeah I get the older people and those with language barriers but it’s ✨every✨ customer that does it. I think there was one time 4 months ago when someone apologized for using the incorrect pronouns after seeing my name tag. Other than that, nobody seems to notice or care but I still keep it on my name tag because I feel more comfortable having it there
Could you buy yourself a big ol’ pin maybe??
I would keep pushing for one, or get a pin for yourself! I added my pronouns to my name tag without asking and my managers didn’t say anything about it
You summed up my gender perfectly. They/them pronouns. Dude, bro, and bitch ok.
'Sexy fukkr' cool?
Highly annoying to be misgendered but it's not usually intentional. Personally, although it's annoying, I understand that the old lady calling me dear, ma'am, miss or young lady is trying to do it in a respectful and endearing way. They are trying to be nice to the best of their ability they just don't understand my needs, which, if they don't know me, is okay as far as I'm concerned. 

Ma'am makes my skin crawl, but I don't blame the person for calling me ma'am bc based on my look, I can see how someone would reasonably call me ma'am.. I have softer features and dress mildly fem. It's just not personal they are talking a guess that the 2 binary options that they know exist, they prob don't know anything beyond the binary construct.
Had to do it to ey/em

Goblin is a queer term of appreciation, but I guess not everyone knows that. Deleted.
100%

Just to add, the fact of the matter is the world doesn't revolve around anyone. As much as someone else might not understand your gender and be accidentally offensive and ""should know better"" or ""could learn"" there are things we are all ignorant about and could improve on or learn. All of us have biases to unlearn and all we can do is our best.
It sucks, it shouldn't be the way it is. I personally take comfort in knowing ignorance isn't usually personal that's all.
yeah i'm really going to let someone who's active in r/transmedical dictate how nonbinary people should feel about our experience...lol not
like your post history gives hella exclu vibes and now you're here being dismissive on a 2 week old post? you really feel the need to take your issues with nonbinary people out on us in what should be a safe space for us? you really think infighting with other LGBTQ people is a productive use of your time when conservatives are currently OBSESSED with attacking the rights of all LGBTQ people and we should be standing together right now? miss me with that
yeah, fully agree

You don't know how I present, you don't know if I have dysphoria or not. You truscum types LOVE to regurgitate the ""you need dysphoria to be trans"" thing at nonbinary people like nonbinary people can't have dysphoria, I wish that was the case my life would be a lot easier. If that was true I wouldn't be needing to figure out how tf I'm going to pay for top surgery.

When someone misgenders you but not as AGAB		"Why did I read that as assigned gay at birth
Literally preferable to agab
I’m non-binary (afab), show miniature horses, and entered a gentlemen’s driving class a few weeks ago. One person offered to use my phone to take a pic of me and my partner with our horse later. As they handed the phone back to my partner they said “here’s her phone…HIS phone!” Correct? Not quite. But still felt amazing to be seen and respected!
People assume I’m cis because of how I present, and I’ve had people try to maliciously misgender me and it makes me laugh, like yessssss, affirm my  non-cisness, bitches!!!!
Getting gendered as ANYTHING but my AGAB is euphoric for me!
Haha yeah several years ago I had the very odd experience of finding out that basically everyone I knew had independently assumed I was binary trans and long since on HRT, versus having just developed that way. It was super weird but not distressing.
I'm stupid but does this mean assigned gay at birth?? bc if so then. yes. me too (edit: I just realized what that means. my bad.)
This works for both cus it could either be “assigned girl at birth” or “assigned guy at birth”
I've found that being referred to as masculine once or twice feels good, but after that it gets kind of uncomfortable. Not sure why.
I get gendered an almost even mix of he/she and the rare beautiful person who uses they/them. It's Novel and cool when it first happens but.... I'm fucking sick of it. It's annoying. I never know what someone thinks I am, it makes it somewhat scary to exist and meet new people. Say for example someone has been assuming a man and then they see me walk into a women's restroom? It just causes so much awkwardness and discomfort I wish it was normal to just use they/them when you're unsure of someone's gender.
Both yes and no... I have so many mixed feelings on this
Yeah that happened to me in a Minecraft server once. I am afab and I guess gamers just think everyone is a dude. It was nice at first but when I told them I prefer they/them pronouns, they kept calling me a dude and I got uncomfortable. Interestingly, it made me feel like I was an impostor. I felt like I was faking being a man. But it wasn't even my fault they used he/him pronouns for me. I told them I was non binary. Just didn't tell them I was afab because I am pretty sure they would have just started using she/her for me instead...
I'm AMAB but have had two different people think that I'm AFAB/transmasc, which was very validating in an extremely confusing way lmao

It is I, The Unknowable Gender Haver...
Being misgendered is how I found out I was NB. I thought it was the coolest thing ever, and started looking more androgynous on purpose.
""you were born a man, act like it!"" no and no lol
Gonna go ahead and say it: this is just as bad as being misgendered with your agab.
it happened to me twice, where someone referred to me as he, when im afab and use they/them pronouns. it was actually really nice :)
I still remember when someone thought i was a guy because of my voice , it made my day
On the dating app I'm on I got misgendered as an Amab (it says I'm Nb on my profile) many times and I'm like *nods*👍 nice that I'm not seen as a female.
AGAB... Assigned gamer at birth??
right? it's almost as if confusion is my number one goal
I've been called ""Sir"" twice in my whole life, and it was so much better than being called ""ma'am.""
Yep. An emergency room put me down as ""He"". I'll take it.
Im on T and at this point where i get misgendered as a trans woman. Like, they think i am amab and that theyre boosting me up by referring to me femininely and somehow thats a lot more tolerable than them misgendering me as if they know im afab?
As a very much non-passing amab nb, hopefully that'll happen someday <{
Doesn't work like that for me unfortunately. But still glad people when others get acceptably (mis)gendered
An then I have to open my mouth and my squeaky ass customer service trained voice makes them change it even though I didn't dispute what they said :)))
My DM's daughter (who I've met like twice) frequently asks her dad ""who's that guy?"" when we're playing D&D via Discord. I am elated every time.
Sorry, what is AGAB? 🤨
I wish. I’m AMAB and I keep getting called he/him by everyone, even to those I’ve said I’m they/them to
I also love that the person in the reaction gif is non-binary. One of us!
I wish I would get that.
I’m a mail carrier (afab) and I have an elderly customer who just says “hey buddy!” Every time they see me. I also get “sir - er, um… sir?” From a lot of people. Makes me smile.
Was having an internal discussion with myself the past few days about this... just don't refer to me as my gender assigned at birth and I'm happy
As an AMAB I prefer literally any other pronouns to my AGAB
As someone with facial hair, this will never happen in my entire life.
I love it tbh
all gregory are bad
All genders are bastards
same, everytime
Broo me too but then I was like ohhhh assigned gender at birth
I read as ""assigned girl at birth""
exactly
God yes it's the funniest shit when transphobes see for example a trans man that passes extremely well and then goes ""he'll never be a woman, no matter how much he tries, everyone will always refer to him as a man"" and it's always like NO ONE TELL THEM, SHHH
same :)
it means assigned god at birth, duh
hey that's cool never thought of that!
I joked to my friends I’d prefer if they change pronouns for me every other sentence
I mean, I use they/them for people (until I can ask) even if they look binary, just in case, and I think it's fairly normal? It's like putting away your cart at the grocery store, it might take like a pinch of effort, but it's just part of living in a group with other human beings. 
TLDR; respecting others is totally normal, there's just also assholes that go out of their way to misgender people
That's totally valid. I suspect I only get a kick out of it because it's rare. When I worked at an assisted living home, being called ""Miss"" was fun at first, but got old before I quit. It's happened maybe twice in the last 13 years.
You and I are a rarer subcategory of people, sadly.  😞
yeah same here :) it actually just occurred in a comment thread to me which inspired me to make this post haha
haha same. It seems to be the most you can hope for with most people
right same. Usually it's older ladies but they often ""correct"" themselves after but still the initial sir is very nice
yeah it seems like the best I'll get from the average person is gender confusion so it is nice when that happens lol
assigned gender at birth :)
:)
Right, or those posts being like ""trans men are men and you can't tell me otherwise!!! 😤""

Like yes, you are correct, moving on...
Hahaha!! Omg I’ve heard that shit before
God, that's even better. thank you for the clarification. 🤣
I'm pretty sure you can actually do that
I have lots of GQ friends that prefer this.
I self-identify as female and am gay, but don't tell my dad. 😂 ""You're a f--kin' man! You've got a d--k!"" 🙄
c'mon dad you really never heard of a chick dick before?
My dad spent the first ten years of his life not knowing anything past straight and White (this was the early-60's).

y'all ever just hide in the bathroom at work cause you're tired of getting misgendered? (they/he)		"I'm sorry that's happening to you m8
On the other hand, you look real cool ~
gods why are you so cool omg
The freckles are flawless 🥺🥺
My work doesn't have any gender neutral bathrooms - thankfully I work from home 3 days a week 😔
OMG you are hair goals!
Love the hair
Yuuuup I feel like an idiot but at this point I'm ready to throw hands with some of my coworkers. I don't care if customers misgender me they're strangers. But my coworkers?? I see them more than any of the people I love, my support group that I worked so hard to build. I'm 27 and I've worked really hard to keep good people around me. I've been super depressed about this and working wayyyy too much. Still not financially secure either >:/
I wish

Most of my work is outdoors, so its not really possible

But good for you that you can do that \^.\^
You just have a precious face
my mother’s house but same
I’m sorry you have to go through that :( 

Personally I think there should be courses on gender and sexuality. (they’d fit right in with sexual harassment) Coworkers and employees will start the progress on correcting the stereotypical gendered greetings and phrases by replacing he/him and she/her to they/them. This would be a very useful tool for people working in communication as they talk to people frequently.

I wish people would at least try to use my pronouns. And if it’s too hard then use my name 💀 like bruh
If I could get away with it I’d wear a sign as a hat XD
Nope. I try not let peoples opinions get to me.

They don’t know me and are just picking a noun they see best fit at the time present.

Now those that do know you and still misgender you they can go suck a lemon.
Yeah. I go back and forth on when I wear my pronoun pin, some days I think it's not worth the hassle and I get misgendered as expected, but when I wear it it feels like I get misgendered more often. It's never outrightly malicious, but I think the intent is there clearly enough. So I try not to interact with customers often.
i'm sorry that happened to you :( also i gotta say, i LOVE your hair and your whole look! you're giving off some peak anime protag vibes /pos
To the point where I quit trying
Your very cool
If you like cookies, I'd bake you some. <3

My liege, how do you style that cotton candy mane of yours. It looks sick
The bathroom is a great place to have a breakdown ask how I know 😅😭
I started my friday off last week being misgendered as my boss told everyone I was promoted. Very much a mix of emotions, and yes, I did go hide for a while to get over it afterwards.
[deleted]
I use the family bathrooms or unisex
yee (they/she)
Literally did that today
Legit have done this on more than one occasion, for more than one reason. I guess cause you can lock yourself in, you feel safe.
You look badass af
First time seeing another Vesper out in the wild!
But then no one will see your perfect makeup! 🥰
VRO YOU LOOK SO COOL, WHAT?!
I would but can't :(
I have my pronouns written on my apron and I still get misgendered all fucking day 😤 I feel you 😮‍💨
You look incredible
Lmao I’m doing this right now
ugh yes. would just sit there in the handicapped single stall restroom for a long time sometimes since nobody would check... (they/she on our end)

glad I don't work there anymore.
Supeeeer off topic but you are so fucking beautiful. Like you legit look like a video game character that I spent an hour and a half customizing.
You look like an anime character and I am loving it, love your hair and makeup :)
Yes, yes I have
in my last full-time job - definitely. i'm out in school so i don't get misgendered much (fortunately!) and in my current part-time job i don't have a toilet to hide in lol
yo you look cool asf 
also i can't stop trembling wh
Big same but also damn bro you are serving
Damn, the hair and freckles, dude you look amazing !
Well. ....You look SO young that if I found you lurking in an employee bathroom, I would not for a second believe you actually worked there >_>""
why are you so cool, seriously, your face is enchanting
yes, at school literally no one (not an exxageration) genders me correctly
Yup…
Same here 🙃 I’m sorry you have to go through that. Hopefully it’ll get better one day 💛🤍💜🖤
Thank you 😂
I huff dust
thanks it's a filter 😅
Same! My partner helps too, corrects ppl at work A LOT.
Thank you! 😊
Thank you!
It's a constant struggle for sure 💀
Oh shit, hope the weather doesn't treat ya too bad!
I think you meant indescribably horrifying 😎
Oof I'm sorry, thank god for queer internet communities amirite?
Honestly yeah, that's such a good idea! Shame they probably won't do it most places, but more inclusive places might! At one of my old jobs they were very good about it and we had several other trans coworkers, it was nice!
I had the training through a school I worked at and it was already so outdated that going through it was a massive cringe-fest.
They won't let me have a pin or anything, not even on my hat 😔
It's face tattoos or bust
Ugh! For sure. At my last job whenever I had my pronoun pin, I had customers reeeeaaally stressing that ""ma'am"" out on purpose and I wanted to strangle them.
my look is black t shirt for work but thank you 😂 when I'm home i definitely feel much more like myself 💀
Sometimes I pretend that every time someone says ""ma'am"" they're saying ""man"" and stuff, but god it's really hard to keep a positive outlook with shit like this
Aww thank you
🍪🍪🍪 cookies!! 🍪🍪🍪
I don't know, I have to wear gloves and put my hands in lots of stuff, but jewelry is a great idea, thank you! I may just start wearing my pronoun earrings every day 😅
thank you, perfection is a scam but I'm glad it hurts to look at me! ❤
you can fight me for it

I'm gonna be honest I just shake my head a bit and it stays pretty fluffy 😅 I'm too scared of frying it to properly style it with heat tools or anything lol
Ikr? It's sad the amount of times I've cried in work bathrooms but they really are the perfect place
Wow! That really sucks, I would ask for a promotion name tag or something and put pronouns by your name if possible! I also started recently talking and joking about being trans more often and surprisingly, at least one coworker started trying her best to use my proper pronouns after that. I hope it gets better for you! 💜
Yes 😂 I'm v proud of it

Why is it so hard to correct people 😅
Precisely!
thank god for online queer communities (and also my dad’s house)
That’s nice to hear 😔
Oooof i bet
For pronoun use?
I get a lot of ""thanks man"" and ""thanks bro you're the man"" and it's never outright mean but it feels very pointed
“I don’t mind the gay but this more than 2 genders is nonsense” or “File says your a man so that’s what I’m calling you”

Where can I get some?
lol okay Lyra/Will
Transphobes love to complain about trans and nonbinary folks getting ""offended"" when they get misgendered, but I've had so many transphobes get super offended when I correct them on my pronouns. I work in retail so I have to do it a lot, one customer just angrily said ""not my fault"", like what kind of a response is that??? Love when my coworkers correct customers on my pronouns for me because sometimes I just can't deal with people 👋
yeah my dad’s real chill and it keeps me sane
Damn. 😶
Can't go back to prison not after the *incident*
The dust store. Ask for bub.
Whom'st the fuck is that
i've had a manager, after trying to explain to them my they/them pronouns, that it's ""discrimination"" and ""disrespectful"" to be called what i prefer... :|
Wow! Yeah that's rough to deal with. I'm glad your coworkers have your back! I've been thinking about just misgendering back every cis person that misgenders me, then see how offended they get.
<33
Ask Bub for pixie dust, not the kind the angels make.
http://lgnavigators.weebly.com/uploads/5/8/5/2/58521739/his_dark_materials_omnibus.pdf
Wow! That's insane. I would for sure start misgendering that manager and flip those tables on them cause that's hugely inappropriate. Like yeah it's what you prefer, it's also *who* you are and they're not respecting your whole ass identity by saying things like that. That also does sound bad enough to report if you're interested in that.

Truth!!		"I feel like the people who make the biggest effort not to respect pronouns are the ones that would be the most offended if you used the wrong ones for them.
Agreed. 

My absolute favorite Blaire White moment was when she made Ben Shapiro admit that he should use a trans woman’s correct pronouns in a social setting.
No, the nonbinary people are just gonna stop talking to you or coming home for the holidays. You played yourselves.
Source: am the nonbinary people.
They just do it to make the queer person feel ashamed of themselves, I think. Ashamed for being different, I hate that.
My coworker is like this. We recently had a new MtF girl start with us and coworker REFUSED to use female pronouns. I said exactly that to her: that she's being an immature child and we (and HR) would VERY MUCH welcome her finding someplace else to work if that is going to be her attitude.
An overwhelming number of bigots are immature.
When you meet someone who ""doesn't use pronouns"", say, that's cool. And use only the pronouns they don't prefer with them. Call dudebro ""sis"". It's *fun*.
Sounds like this goes both ways
Or will bend over backwards apologizing if they thought you were cis-gender and accidentally misgendered you
They’re both the same side of the shit stick but definitely a rare W for Blaire.
Happy Cake Day!
You don’t have to love somebody’s every viewpoint to watch their stuff. 

Like Joe Rogan… I disagree with him about half the time. But I’m not watching JRE to watch Joe. It’s about the guest, not him. 

I would never have “met” awesome people like Jewel, David Choe, and Forrest Galante if I refused to watch JRE.

That said, Blair is a lot more politically centered than Ben. I have a lot of respect for her, because she’s the person who gave me the courage to transition. I thought trans people were ideologically homogeneous until I found her videos."	xdhwi9	NonBinary	1274	1.0	2022-09-13 20:36:25
Was flying ALL day yesterday and every single person I spoke to misgendered me. I don't even know how to feel about that haha		"I have a they/them shirt too and this always happens to me when I wear it. I'm like hello. It's right here in huge text. I've even had people who compliment me on the shirt proceed to use the wrong pronouns 🤡
If they miss the shirt and mask, that's when you bust out the they/them brass knuckles.
Wow. You can lead a cis to pronouns, but you can't make em speak.
*overhears misgendering* Yo, their pronouns are right there. Have some respect for them, because you'd be bothered if someone addresses you incorrectly too


Cis people are dense🙄 Don't let them deter you from being you🖤
Stupid question- how does misgendering with strangers happen so often? I can't even remember a time I've addressed anyone by anything other than their name. I try to use they/them to refer to everyone I don't know well in the third person, regardless.
I have BEEN there. I went out with a similarly loud They/Them shirt and hat, and got misgendered perpetually.

Love the mask, and you look as androgynous leaning masc as fuck

Sorry cis people are so oblivious ♡♡♡
Those people obviously can't Read. You rock They.
I eventually told myself it was a combination of I have a very feminine voice, I'm short, and I was bringing home a dalmatian puppy. So even though I wore a binder, packer, and traditionally men's clothing, plus the shirt and mask...the voice and puppy took up too many brain cells for people to read. 🤷🏻‍♀️
Cis people forget how to read when presented with a trans/NB person.
This post is to show to people who say Well how should I know, you don't have a neon sign flashing over your head with your pronouns on it! Turns out even that would not be enough sometimes.
I love this outfit but it's sad that people would go out of their way to misgender you when it's so obvious what is correct.
Ooof I feel this. Yesterday I was in a *diversity and inclusion* task force meeting at work with my pronoun pin and Mx. pin on and still no one got it right even once.
Jerks, just jerks. I am sorry you went through that, but I am totally impressed with your confidence nonetheless!
In my experience, people just can't manage to use singular they pronouns unless they've practised for a while. And most cis people don't have a reason / can't be bothered to practise

It sucks. I'm sorry you're having to deal with this :(
Some people are just assholes. I have a friend who's a cis female and she sometimes wears a pronoun pin with she/her on it. Every time she does there's at least one person who'll address her as sir because they think she must be trans to be wearing a pronoun pin. Those are the people I'd like to push into a lake!
Dang, you look cute (also, same ~~hat~~ hair!)
Good lord! How?
Wish I could have been there to aggressively gender you correctly *and talk over all of those bastards*
This is why I specifically want to get a shirt that says he/him

*checkmate transphobes, you just called me Miss! Now I feel better about myself, and you just admitted to going out of your way to TRY being a POS*
Cis people cannot be reasoned with. They go out of their way to be obtuse. It’s maddening.
That *sucks*, I'm sorry.

I love your mask, where'd you get it?
Even though I've never worn pronoun pins myself, I used to work at starbucks and knew and talked to many people who wore pronoun pins to work, or hats or masks that said their pronouns on them. And yet customers would still not gender them correctly. Just because the majority of people you interact with *can* read, doesn't ever mean that they actually *will* read. And it's a shame.
i have a they/them pin i wear at work and i feel like some people go out of their way to misgender me lmao
""That sign won't stop me because I can't read.""
Cis people can't read when they are too lazy to gender people properly. ""I didn't notice"" ""I'm too used to your old pronouns"" ""They/them is so hard to use""
Next time carry a bottle of water and spray them when they do it wrong, that's what I'm considering
Woooooowwwww
same, i sometimes feel like i get misgendered MORE when i wear my they/them pin than when i don’t! it’s super frustrating.
Assholes! They’re probably doing it on purpose unfortunately. Cis people seem to have very strong opinions on things that have nothing to do with them…
cowabunga it is
I was bringing home a dalmatian puppy, so a lot of it was people talking to me and then talking to whoever they were with. Or the security people or other airport staff talking to each about me.
In the US at least (not sure where OP was flying to/from), especially in the south where I live, people address EVERYONE as “sir” or “maam” almost by default, or preface any time they say your name with “Mr.” or “Mrs.” as a matter of so-called politeness.

I know I’m never ever gonna be seen as anything but masculine, will never be addressed any other way, but the culture here is SO gendered that many people can’t get by without folks misgendering us simply as a default interaction.
Omgosh thank you!!!
TFW having a puppy is gendered -__-
Hol’ up- you were binding, packing, masked (1/2 your face is covered) and a walking fucking billboard of your pronouns - and it sounds like you were getting she/her- this smells suspiciously like it was intentional. We’re you in mostly square states?
You could literally have a choir of angels flying behind you singing ""they them they them they them"" on loop and they'd still hit you with your AGAB pronouns.
Thank you!
This is a perfect example of why cis ppl putting pronouns in their bio, wearing a pin, etc, is *so* essential to help drive the movement. The assholes need to understand that **everyone** has pronouns
Thank you!
Hahahahahahah I LOVE YOU

I've noticed that too! I have several they/he pins that I adore but it's like people either don't notice them or are intentionally ignoring them. Not sure which is worse. 🤷🏻‍♀️🤦🏻‍♀️
I got yelled at- screamed at- in school in Georgia for saying ‘yes’ instead of ‘yes, sir’ to a teacher
Yeah I lived in the South for a long time and refused to address anyone by those terms. It’s just icky and weird.
Boston, Chicago, Dallas, and Albuquerque

Albuquerque also had an absurd amount of people trying to get away with not wearing masks. So much so that it was literally someone's job to hand these people masks and explain --federal-- law. But that's neither here nor there... 🙄
I'd go for that tbh.
I mean, it’s a power move to feel better, and also out transphobes for being transphobic
We got a “not all cis” here!
It's not a true fix, but I've found a trans flag plus the ""opposite"" pronouns from your preferred usually get the correct results with cis assholes.

I'm afab, used to dress femme, long hair, makeup, etc, & had a ""she/her"" button on my bag, and people went out of their way to call me ""he/him"" 

I'm still figuring out how to make this work with enby pronouns...
I live in Georgia, have for 30 years. It sucks.
One day I hope the world can hug collectively
On one hand, yay for getting it to work! On the other hand, what the fuck that is horrible that you need to do that just to get people to use the right pronouns.
Luckily I only lived there about 2 years. I can’t even imagine what it’s like trying to get people to respect pronouns and stuff down there. So much for southern hospitality.
So so I, fam.. some day..."	opfyh0	NonBinary	1225	1.0	2021-07-22 15:20:04
Using they/them is easy…. as long as it’s for a trans woman.	"I met my grandma for the first time as an out adult, post-testosterone, and introduced myself with they/them pronouns. She constantly uses she/her pronouns for me anyway, claiming that they/them is just soooooo hard. And like, she’s old, I get it, I can be patient and correct her. For years. Whatever. 

But my little sister came out as trans and my grandmother seems to have NO problem using they/them for her instead of she/her. 

Why is they/them so hard when it’s MY pronouns but it’s “easier” to use when misgendering my sister?!!!! Where’s the fucking logic in that????"	"That's actually an old joke in the community, what's the easiest way to get someone to call you they them? Come out to them as a trans woman who uses she her pronouns. It's a tale as old as time
The logic is that she wants to missgender you two. So now you know she can use they/them but she'll only do it to missgender a trans woman in this case.
""Have you tried actually trying? Like, actually putting in effort? Like fucking any effort at all?""
""they/them"" is easier to use because it un-genders your sister and is therefore insulting.

""She/her"" for you is a move to infantilse you while rei-fying your agab.

It's all calculated impolite behaviour.

The cis math absolutely checks out when you understand the equations and not just the ""pronoun answers.""
I thought maybe you can play game with her too. Since she uses your preferred pronouns with your sister and viceversa. You can tell her she must be confused because she is old already. Maybe she needs to go see a doctor, her memory is not right... And you introduce yourselves (names, pronouns, ""we are your grandkids""...) very slowly and loud. Everytime she gets the pronouns wrong get upset because she is getting old and makes you sad, you reintroduce yourselves again... I know it's petty, but she started it xD Hopefully she stops out of embarrassment or anoiance
Grandma is making it clear you're not welcome. You might wanna do the same.
Bigotry and being mean then disguising it as an age thing, sorry to say. She's mean spirited about it and I'm sorry you have to deal with it.
They're great at it when the intent is to purposely avoid correctly gendering us. There is no logic to it. Pure contrarian bullshit.
similarly: afab she/they’s never get called they and amab she/they’s never get called she :(
SAME. My mom constantly uses she/her for me despite me requesting that she use they/them - she claims ""it's so hard"" and she ""needs more time."" I came out to her around 5 years ago, so I'm genuinely curious just how much time she thinks she needs/deserves. My friend that has known me since kindergarten (so, almost as long as my mom has known me) got my new name and pronouns down almost immediately.

Meanwhile, my mom uses they/them for my girlfriend, which is really bizarre considering that *she has only ever known my girlfriend as a woman.* It's so frustrating. I'm willing to tolerate a lot of disrespect toward myself (read: I am a pushover and bad at enforcing boundaries), but I draw the line at disrespecting my girlfriend. I've been seriously considering telling my parents that I won't visit them anymore if they can't get it right, but I'm worried that this isn't a serious enough reason to warrant cutting them off. Idk.
This happened on an Irish radio program where they were discussing the trans ""debate"". The nonbinary person was consistently she/her'd by the host and other guests, yet when a trans man came on the line, everyone used they/them to talk about him.
This is not an age thing. One of the most supportive people in my life is in his 70s. Like sure he was confused when I came out, and he hasn't always used the right terminology for me. But he's done research on his own and he's clearly trying his best.
Yep. My parents use they/them for my trans sister instead and still deadname her. Idk why they don’t just use he/him at that point
I go by They/She. I used to go by She/They, but that was just an invitation for people to ignore the They part. I use They/Them for myself constantly but sometimes She/Her works too. I’m still very feminine, but I’m just a person, a smol kitten, not a woman.
Call her grandpa the next time you see her and see what happens. emphasis on the ""pa"" part.
how to make this work for an afab person
Idk man, my mom started using we/our for a friend of mine after she came out. ""So, [friend's name], what are we up to nowadays?"" while talking to me about her lmao
And then they're like ""ohh but it's so hard to remember"" even if they've never known the person by any other pronouns...
i am out as a trans woman but am secretly nonbinary so im kinda doing this......

but really it was that i thought i was a trans woman at first, and i kinda do prefer she/her, sort of....but i think mostly because the experience of being misgendered with they/them feels like total shit because you know and they know why they're doing it. i unfortunately kind of associate they/them with that feeling now which sucks because i think i would at least like them just as much as she/her if not more otherwise
ok wait wow this is interesting cause i'm a transfemme, i use they/she in that order because i don't mind she and i prefer they but cis and straight people who try to be queer friendly tend to default to she with me unless i specify. it seems like everyone around me assume i'm a woman or am trying to pass as one as soon as they hear trans femme but obviously transness goes so much further than just that
Kinda Weird That She'd Use They/Them Instead Of Upright Using He/Him Honestly, Maybe In An Attempt To Look Supportive Despite Not Actually Looking Such, Or Just For Plausible Deniability If Called Out On It?
Gaslighting grandma for the win
Tell people you go by he/they. It seems to work like a charm even for the allies I know. 🙄
Buy a nerf gun and use it on whoever gets it wrong. Maybe an  airhorn if the situation requires it.
Same: come out as a trans woman who uses she/her pronouns.
Woah. That is wild. I’ve never seen someone go the we/our route… wowwww
It's probably cis math.

You have to ""earn"" being a man. And doing so is an impossible task if you're afab.

If you're amab and a trans woman, your man card only gets revoked until they find a convenient time to use it to misgender you, and then it's temporarily re-issued to the holder.

/j
That's unironically what I do. I use he/she/they pronouns so I just tell everyone I'm out to he/him so there's about a 33%/33%/33% chance I'll get called any set
Actually, fun fact. When I went by they/them pronouns, nobody had a problem using the correct pronouns. But then I put he/they as my pronouns, and suddenly everyone messes up and uses she/they instead. The logic??? Idk.
I did that, saying if they/them is too challenging they can use he/him, but they still just use she/her bc they’re bigots
Oh shit new pronouns dropped???? Jokes on her I like those pronouns now and I am commandeering them.
i actually really fuck with this it’s so much better than xir/xim in my opinion bc those are not words - we/our those are fuckin words bayyybeee and it’s actually understandable how one would use them in a sentence it’s awesome - so for ppl who don’t understand this - they/them gets a bad wrap for being plural when it’s only one human and i’m sure we/our will too but i like this idea really bc it suggests more than one gender in one and that is the purpose of the plural in this scenario i believe anyway
Ah Of Course. ~~Jokes On Them I'm Smuggling Man Cards Out To Anybody Who Wants Them, Can't Stop Me!~~
lol I might try something like that. I accept all 3 but honestly prefer they/them, but I'm also a very masculine looking AMAB, so as you can imagine he/him is the norm. I'm sure if I switch to she/they I'll get a mix of they/them and he/him
i feel and i’m a nb person when u go from they/them to a gendered pronoun + they i find if someone uk is born female for instance uk as a feminine energy and they present as such, then they come out as they them but then switch to he/they — first of all i gotta be honest i mix up he/she pronouns at least 3 times a day and this goes for cis ppl/gender non conforming ppl/and/or my cat’s pronouns and it’s so not on purpose and this whole pronoun discourse in society right now has me so bugged out that i can’t even mix up my words without feeling like i’m hurting someone sooo that being said if one switches from she/her (OG)>>>they/them>>>he/they there is going to be an adjustment period and if u look feminine and a person doesn’t know you ik it hurts but u can’t help the way a person perceives you. but it’s f they disregard the they part entirely or just purposely say she they’re obviously just dicks - sorry for my run on sentences i’m not adding grammar sorry y’all
I corrected my MIL the other day and she just rolled her eyes. Alternatively, I play D&D with Europeans that apparently have never dealt with this before. They proceeded to say ""She er... He/they!"" Which is just facepalmingly stupid. It's one or the other not both!
*Our* pronouns
I don't think I was issued a man card, but I bought my spouse The Woman Cards as a gift a few years back, so I can just borrow some of those, right?
Omg you talk like me. I totally agree. I wanna be good but I mess up pronouns all the time. And also when you're from a bilingual family or are bilingual it's so easy to mess up pronouns. Some languages don't use pronouns or use gendered anything for the most part. My coworkers mess up pronouns, my mom messes up, my girlfriend, me... I tend to default to they for everyone. It's the safest and easiest. I also plan to come out to my parents about being non binary... ( I'm about to be 32.) I bought a comic book from Amazon to explain it lol I think it's called, ""A Quick Guide to They/them Pronouns"" by Archie Bongiovanni. It honestly has always bothered me when my parents say feminine words around me about me, mostly my dad. It just feels like he's saying it on purpose. So hard. Always referring to me as, ""your daughter, She!"" I know of course that isn't true but the more I learn about myself and have accepted that I am non binary, it has been grating me more and more. Uh... Spilling my heart out uh hahaha my bad. Anyway. Point is, I know it'll be hard for my parents to correct themselves. I know they care for me and love me, but this is such a new and hard subject for some that I'm scared of their reaction even though I know they are great parents. I never really talked to them about personal things ever. Okay uh yeah it'll take time for people to get it.

merry crisis everyone! i hope y’all have a great day and family misgendering is at a minimum <3		"Is it pure coincidence your hair colours match your clothing? You look awesome but now I'm wondering about the organisation needed, either weeks of colour-coded clothes or constant dyes, either way... Yikes!
*mumbles in the closet*
oMGGGGG 
I LOVE your hair!!!! And you piercings, and just your whole face!! You are so cute, and if you don’t like being called cute you are so handsome!!
And if you don’t like either of those you look so cool!! I’m jealous tbh
Can't get misgendered if you spend the whole day in bed! 

taps_temple.jpg

Don't worry though. Am not alone. Haves dog. Doggo doesn't gender. 

Thanks for spreading the joy, friend!
i love your hair!
Ooh, your hair is amazing. I wish mine was as fluffy. It's orange right now :)
Great Christmas! I actually got a enby pride flag from my family!!

Btw awesome hair
You look so cute! I love it.
holy hell im so fuckin jealous of your hair!!! you look amazing big goals merry chrysler ❤️💚❤️💚
merry chrysler!
can i just say you are FUCKING GOREGOUS -a very gay/bi/pan/hella confused girl
I love u
😍
Grandma misnamed me several times & dad accidentally referred to me to lady once but corrected him & it was okay. Grandma has called me my birth name all week & my patience is wearing thin. Lpl
Merry Chrysler! I've been ""baby girl""-ed more times than I can count since I've been home, but I got a few boy shirts this morning. It was a Christmas miracle!

I hope you have a good one too! You're super cute; I love your hair and glasses and piercings!
I came out to everyone and nobody was surprised. It was like being terrified of a monster behind a door, opening it, and finding a kitten.
I love your hair and your piercing!
My family had a dinner with friends who don't know I'm enby, and at one point, my brother actively stopped himself from using a pronoun for me, like he started to use one, but stopped himself, and just referred to me by name.

&#x200B;

That was nice.

&#x200B;

It should be noted, my brother is supportive of my enby-ness. I think he didn't want to out me in front of a bunch of conservative evangelists, so he just named me. It felt good.
You are adorable!
Hot
i didn’t even notice that haha i’m so lazy w my hair i dye it like 3 times a year
Same. *hug*
i love being called cute :)) thank you sm
aye that’s so amazing!! s

Misgendered by a trans person	I just got told by a trans woman that I'm just a girl who added they to their pronouns to pretend to be non binary. I'm so upset. I feel like I'll never be taken seriously in my gender if even a trans person can misgender me like this.	"I’m so sorry, friend. It stings so much when coming from other trans folks…I couldn’t care less about the cis at this point, but being seen by fam feels so necessary. 

My doctor’s office when I lived in the big city was staffed almost entirely with queer and trans people and every single time I went, binary trans women misgendered me. And my pronouns are in my chart, tattooed on my neck etc. There’s no missing them. It’s painful and I’m so sorry you feel like this rn. 🫶🏻
Fuck that person. I am sorry you had to hear that from a trans person.
Trans people have internalized transphobia too. Lots of ""fuck you I've got mine"" among any marginalized group. Plenty of assholes.
So you know how abused kids reenact their abuse sometimes? I feel like that never really changes even when people get older. They don’t have any better claim on YOUR gender because they’re not Cis. This dummy probably thinks a lot of silly and harmful things. I’m sorry that happened
I blows my mind how some other folks in the community still believe they know someone else's gender better than the other person. I'm nonbinary as well and got misgendered at the gym, while wearing my they/them pronoun pin very visibly, by a staff member who was ALSO wearing a they/them pronoun pin. It was so surreal. Like, this ain't it homie, what the actual fuck. I know it's not on the same level as what you experienced but at the root of it, people in the community need to be more aware of how much power they have to hurt each other. It's bad enough when cis people invalidate us but when it's other trans folks, it's so much more damaging. Trans and nonbinary people should be safe humans to go to for other trans and nonbinary people.
You’re valid. Anyone can be an AH, it doesn’t affect your right to be yourself.
As a non binary AFAB who prefers they/them pronouns this is one of my deep insecurities.
I've had some devastating things said by binary trans folks over the years, until I medically transitioned. 

Honestly, it's very typical of queer community. Some of the worst comments I've gotten about my asexuality were from allo queer people. Bi folks get lots of hate from gays and lesbians. 

We're all insecure and hurt and sometimes one marginalized group will attack another marginalized group. I can see how it would be hard to be a binary trans person, especially a trans woman, go through the hardships of a visible transition, and then see someone else claiming a trans identity while not undergoing those same struggles. (There are of course plenty of different struggles for non-medically transitioning trans people!) 

Here's the deal though: you don't need to struggle to be queer. Our struggles bring us together, but so do the beautiful things about queerness. It's not just about dysphoria, it's about euphoria. Whatever makes you feel like you're not a cis is literally all you need in order to be trans. 

The cruel comments from binary people, trans and cis, will continue. I'm sorry. Non-binaryness is new to a lot of people and challenges a lot of norms and it will make people be cruel. I hope your knowledge and comfort in your gender will increase over time and you will be able to ignore them. Your non-binary community is here to support and celebrate you. Any amount of transness is enough transness - you don't need to prove your gender to anyone.
As a trans woman, fuck her, we don't claim her, you are valid af!!
thank you all so much, I really needed to hear this ❤️
Hey, you ARE valid! No matter what anyone says, your gender is valid. Being trans doesn't mean that they can't be an asshole. There can be many reasons why they said that, maybe they had a bad day or were mean because they themselves heard it and were hurting. I'm sending you virtual hugs!
The opinion of someone not living in your shoes carries 0 weight in how you comfortably identify. The queer community still has a lot of internalized ick to work on. 



Do you, love.
Binary trans people can be shitty to us sometimes. They act like our existence somehow invalidates theirs. I'm really sorry that happened to you. I've had it happen to me plenty in the past; it seems like we're the community punching bags atm.
A lot of binary trans folks seem to take issue with non-binary people.
As a trans woman who is good with they/them and likes the idea of being at least futch: fuck her. Especially since for some of us that’s a stepping stone, and even if it goes no further you’re still valid.
[removed]
You’re absolutely non-binary. I’m so sorry she was shitty to you.

I’m a trans woman, so maybe this will help you heal even in the smallest of ways~
Trans people can be transphobic too. Sorry she was rude to you. There are lots of good people out there cis, and trans, binary, and non-binary who will accept you for who you are, those are the people that matter.
And here we learn an important lesson. No matter how marginalised, no matter how much you think someone would learn the gift of empathy, no matter how much you'd think there'd be solidarity: pricks are universal. Cis, trans, NB... \[Buzz Lightyear meme\] pricks, pricks everywhere. Sorry you had to meet this one. Tell them to go fuck themselves and move on. You're a nonbinary star.
I feel like a lot of binary trans folk are super judge-mental and uncomfortable about non-binary and genderqueer identities 

Not saying all are, but I’ve found that vibe from a lot of them

I’m non-binary transmasc and often feel scared to show my gnc/fem side in trans spaces because I’ve been criticized for the times I do, 
I’m accepted when I’m presenting as a guy, but if I dress androgynous or fem I’m seen as just a girl with short hair instead of my non-binary self I’m proud to be
Honestly some transgender people are really inconsiderate.

Noone has the right to tell you that your identity isn't real. Noone should ever tell you that you are just trying to seek attention, that non binary is just to look cool or fashionable or is bullshit.

Yet, there are some who still do because they think it's only them that are entitled to being called transgender. They don't even think for one second that non binary is real, because to them it doesn't count. Frankly I've seen a few subs that hated non binary people, there is even one sub dedicated to this!

Ground breaking news for them folks: the definition of being transgender is applicable to anyone that does not identify with their assigned gender at birth.

So the best I can tell you is to honestly not react to this. There are the subtle kind of transphobic comments that are worded in a way that will make you feel angry at the person, and it's designed to be like this, so you feel manipulated. React and you'll look like an ass. And yeah there are the bold ones who will outright tell you that you are not trans.

It is absolutely awful but all I could recommend is to ignore them. I know it is upsetting but there is not much one can do about it. Fighting over who has the right or not to be transgender is pointless, certainly.
Sorry you had to hear that nonsense. Don’t let them get to you, you are just as valid as any one else. Hugs x
That's pretty disgustingly hypocritical of them! I'm so sorry!
My therapist once told me that your likely to find the most discrimination inside the community itself. Same thing for bisexuality in the gay community.
> I feel like I'll never be taken seriously in my gender if even a trans person can misgender me like this.

You may be making the mistake of inverse stereotyping, where instead of assuming inherent evil in someone trans you're assuming inherent virtue in someone's judgements because they're trans.

Trans people of all kinds are still human and capable of making most of the same errors of judgement as anyone else. And calling you ""just a girl with they pronouns"" is way the fuck out of line.
A lot of trans people really don’t like NBs, unfortunately. It’s something I’ve noticed for years. They treat us the way cis people treat them.
Unfortunately being trans (or any other minority) doesn't automatically make someone not an asshole.  It just makes them a trans asshole instead of a cis asshole. I'm sorry you had to deal with that.
Sadly just because someone is trans doesn’t make them a good person there are a lot of us though that are not complete pos’s though please don’t give up hope because you are valid and loved by a community of people who accept and care about you plus she was probably jealous enbies are usually the coolest and best looking people 😁
transphobes, *any kind of transphobes,* fucking disappear challenge
Coming from a trans woman fuck that person. Gender is not as simple as people would like it to be. And i really hate people who try to force others into the gender binary.
OP should know that their pronouns are 100% valid and they don’t have to do anything to prove it. I want them to know that I support them and I believe them. What that woman said is nasty and hurtful but it will never change that fact that you are you. ❤️
$5 says she's had someone say something similar to her at some point and unfortunately she just ended up projecting it onto you

So essentially, it has nothing to actually do with you and everything to do with whatever issues she's dealing with so I would advise against making her an authority on your identity
unfortunately, there’s a lot of internalized transphobia in the community. i’ve seen it mostly in binary trans people, targeted at non-binary people a lot of the time. someone being trans doesn’t mean their opinion on your gender matters. i know it’s easier said than done, but try to just not give her any power over you. she’s projecting her insecurity on you, it’s not actually about you. keep your head up and continue to live your truth!! love ya
that wasn't the trans talking, that was the asshole talking. she can eff right off. People who disrespect others' pronouns are an embarrassment. You are taken seriously here and you will be in many other places. 💙💙💙
Gatekeepers/truscum suck ass, I'm sorry you had to deal with this shit :(
That's crazy wtf
Yo fuck that girl, she's wrong.
Trans people can suck too. Cis people aren't the only shotty folk out there by any means. 

You are valid and that turd-burglar can choke on her vape.

Signed,
A pissy non-binary trans woman
Binary trans people have said to me that “I’m the reason trans people aren’t taken seriously”. So apparently transphobia is my fault because I’m non-binary 😂 I just laugh at them. They’re losers.
Being trans doesn't mean you can't be transphobic! It's like all the biphobia that exists in the LGBTQIA+ movement. 

I'm sorry that she made you feel bad about yourself, I believe on your gender and even that I don't know you here's some online support.
There's this frustrating thing in the trans community where people don't take feminine presenting nonbinary people seriously; if your born a female and like makeup and heels but go by they/them like myself you'll get people who think your ""she/they"" when in reality I am ""he/they"" I just dress feminine. I had alot of trans people including my own nonbinary friends who were more masculine than me not take me as seriously or call me she because I was effeminate.  Keep your head up op. Your pronouns are important to you and us.
Heya. I'm a trans guy. IMO, you're always valid
Thats very rude
That's horrible, I'm so sorry people treat you like that!  You are NOT a girl, you are non-binary and don't let anyone tell you otherwise.
Lmao sounds like some truscum/transmedicalist trash. They are the blair whites and buck angels of the community. Fuck em. Pieces of shit all of em.
I feel you on this one.I had a conversation with an ex friend of mine last year (he’s a trans boy)who said that nonbinary,gender-fluid people etc.. are just mentally ill and they should get help.At that time I was at the begging of subconsciously understanding my gender;so when he said that I was..flabbergasted and became silent. I’m happy that I didn’t open up to him back then I just wish I knew more non cisgender people I could relate to irl.
they're just an asshole people who are demi are nonbinary and you deserve to be correctly gendered
Ah, yes. The community gate keepers. So exhausting sometimes. I’ve gotten that, disgusted looks and an internet argument by another trans person saying I’m not also trans if I’m nonbinary, and to stay in my lane. I have to laugh at the fact that things sail right over people’s heads and they end up turning into a bit of what they try to avoid.
That person was a twat. And amazingly stupid. Like mind blowingly stupid. Ignore them. They’re literally so stupid their opinion holds no value.


Also?
They just told you they feels powerless. 

Powerless people will either try to be good, or find someone else to dominate and have power over. 

That’s why Alt kids has the audacity to try and hate keep Metallica. Which is ridiculous, and misses the point of the alt community which is to be welcoming and accept anyone. And rock out. 

That person just told you they are, or they feel, weak. 

And they want to drag you down with them. 

Don’t let them. They’re lashing out in spite.
That person is a gatekeeping idiot. You're as valid as fuck and don't let anyone tell you otherwise.
Were you taking to Blair white or something??? That’s pretty rude
Sadly misgendering happens more than we would like it to, however, there are a lot of assholes within the LGBTQ+ community who are just as bad as straggots
trans ppl are not incapable of being assholes with transphobia. I learned this hard being Black. Just b/c you're part of a marginalized group doesn't mean you don't reenact oppression
I’m sorry, that sucks. 

Unfortunately being part of a minority doesn’t make you immune to bigotry. Binary trans people can hate non-binary people, gay men and lesbians can hate bi and ace people. Queer people in general can be racist, ableist, etc. Anyone can hate anyone, basically, and *being* hated by other people doesn’t automatically make you a good or empathetic person. 

I realize that doesn’t make it better though. It sucks that we get hate from people inside the community as well as outside it. I’m sorry this happened to you. 💙
That's a shitty person. We need to remember that every group of people have good people and shitty people. Yes a trans person can also be a dick.
❤️🧡💛💚💙💜
Demi-phobes are the worst, especially as an AMAB Demi-boy, because they just make my own self doubt louder
They are completely transphobic. Doesn't matter if they are in fact trans themselves.

Presentation does NOT equal your gender, hormones and hrt do NOT equal your gender.

You are completely valid with how you want to identify and present.

Love u xx
I've had this happen to me, as a gender nonconforming person several times from both binary and nonbinary trans folks. It usually is in response to me pointing out that I'm not cisgender (because you know there's nothing like some complete stranger online thinking they know me better than I know myself).

Ignore the haters, they are just insecure and uninformed. And they don't deserve your headspace.
Fuck people who gatekeep being trans like it's a special clique. We love you, we accept you, and most importantly - we see you. Their opinion is worthless - you are you. That's all there is to it!
That sucks.  Keep being you.

People who accept trans and criticize NB make no sense and drive me absolutely mad.
Well hear this from another Trans girl then. You're gender and identity are fully and completely valid!! I promise!! Don't let people like her get in the way of you experiencing your gender identity to the fullest that you can. You are valid.
People try to cut others down to make themselves feel less miserable. It sucks if it comes from someone who you would think would be more supportive. If you think you have yourself even partly figured out you are doing better than most. So be you, be proud, hold your friends and loved ones close and fuck everybody else.
The worst thing anyone has ever said to me was said by another non binary person, who called me cis because I don’t have any plans to medically transition in any way anytime soon.
I know the feeling. Just remember who you are. Other people will mislabel you but that does not define you. If a trans person did that to you, that's a reflection of one individual and not the entire community. Stay strong buddy. 👍
my guess is that she is insecure about being “trans enough” and feels she has to put down other trans people to make herself feel better. it’s a really shitty thing to do and i hope you know that you’re so valid, and you are the only person who gets to define yourself.
there are some super shitty trans people out there, unfortunately. I honestly don't understand where it comes from. I had to throw a trans woman out of a support group once because she wouldn't stop shitting on nonbinary people :(
Binary trans folk can be pretty shit to non-binary ones, unfortunately, because you’d think they’d get it better than most. :/ 

Just cause someone is queer doesn’t make them a good person/ally — punching down is pretty common for oppressed groups and individuals, even if we try to dissuade it (unfortunately there are group cohesion and emotional benefits to it, so yay.😬(obviously, the target needs to be *outside* your group/perceived group for the cohesion benefits))
I hate in-transphobia...
(Yo, whoever was playing with the upvote button w me on this one, cuz it was on 666,hmu)
I’m sorry this happened to you. Unfortunately so often binary trans people even exclude non-binary people in their fight for trans rights, despite us being under the trans umbrella. I remember when binary trans people were pissed at the x being added to womxn to show inclusivity because they are women and completely forgot that x was meant to include non-binary, gender non conforming, etc. So they erased our inclusion calling it transphobic because they were only focused on the binary transitioned trans experience, and not the trans umbrella as a whole. Often they even bulldoze trans folks who never want to or can’t transition, even if they are within the binary. 

I think there are some people who are deeply insecure and treat it as some sort of oppression olympics, and they use internalized transphobia to assume non-binary people who don’t give androgyny have no obstacles or oppression, when that couldn’t be any further from the truth.

I think a lot of binary trans people who focus on transition are so stuck on fitting the gender binary that they forget that just because someone outwardly appears as something doesn’t make that so. It’s a constantly struggle as someone AFAB who’s non-binary and still comes off quite femme. The level of hate even from our own community is unbelievable. I am sick of it. A non-binary person can look however they want and still be non-binary.

I think people forget that even if we look like our gender assigned at birth doesn’t erase the deep feeling of not being able to be who you truly are, in fact it actually makes it worse because we are always assumed to be something we aren’t. I don’t want a full transition or to wear binders and that means for my whole life, to look the way I want, people will always assume I’m a woman and automatically give me she/her pronouns. So in my gender expression, I am always misgendered. They forget there is a privilege in transitioning and being in a binary, even when trans.

To be honest my best experiences are with other non binary people and my worst experiences were with binary trans people because a lot of them still uphold a toxic binary system and toxic gender roles. (Obviously that’s generalizing from my own experiences)

They make assumptions someone has it “easy” and want to tare them down. They use their own trauma to traumatize those in their community. It’s true that hurt people hurt people. But that doesn’t make the behaviour okay.

I’ve never quite felt comfortable being in the “trans umbrella” because of these experiences. I feel like there’s cis, there’s binary trans, and then there’s those of us who are non-binary, non-conforming, etc. And because binary trans people are in their own realm and can just as easily enact transphobia against anyone who doesn’t fit the binary, it just feels weird to be meant to be in the same community when they never care to learn our experiences or fight for us, but we are always fighting for them. It’s why I’ve specifically seeked out non-binary spaces as they tend to be better and less oppressive. There’s a general understanding of wanting to be everything and nothing. And I love the comedy of understanding completely when someone says “I identify as a frog” or random stuff like that. Like eff the binary, eff gender, eff being a human lol.
Even when someone should have a wider perspective, people are still people and people sure can suck.
Happened to me too. Tran woman would call me her and we had met a few times and I made it clear each time that I'm nb trans fem. She would say ""we know you're a girl"" 🥺
There are shitty people across the board. Hope you know you're valid in whatever way you may identify now or in the future. Don't let anyone tell you otherwise. Wishing you the best.
It hurts but it is the way the world is, even people within the community don't always see eye to eye. But we will just forget their words a movie on :)
Something people seem to forget is that just because someone is LGBTQIA+ doesn't automatically mean they're a good person. We have an unfortunately large amount of internal bigotry between the various differing parts of the community 🤷‍♂️ humans suck sometimes. I'm sorry you had to deal with that
I'm so sorry that happened, as a trans woman I'd like to apologize, and assure you that many of us Think you're completely valid❤️
It’s so sick that this is happening even in our own community. I’m so sorry
Don't let one idiot keep you down.
You've likely met a transmedicalist. I had an ex-coworker who was one, but also identified as nonbinary (the duality of man, I suppose), and that set back my coming out by a lot. It made me insecure in my identity and like I was somehow appropriating something.

Truth is, what other people think literally does not matter. They cannot know your gender because they are not you. You are valid, I promise.
It’s ok, you don’t need people to tell you what your gender is. People ask all the time and never use them for me. You just got to ignore them and let it go, when’s the next time your going to see them?
There are trans people who havent actually unlearned transphobia they were brought up in. 

And there are trans people who ""punch down"" so to speak to feel mote validated by ""acceptable society"". 

There are jerks and assholes of every identity. 

Its unfortunate that theyre like this but they by no means are the majority of the community. Though, at times and in certain places (almost always online places) they can be the loudest.
Bad intolerant people exist in every community. So sorry friend. If you need to vent about it I’m here
Omg based
Trans people are people, and some people are bigoted assholes.
But that’s just my knee-jerk reaction. In real life when I was misgendered by a trans woman, I recognized that she was newly trans and a trauma survivor and was desperately hiding in the binary because she thought it protected her. It won’t. It never will. But she doesn’t know that yet. It’s not an excuse for the behavior, and some people are so hopelessly tied up in it that they’ll never let the binary go. No matter where it comes from, you don’t deserve it. You deserve so much better. It may take work to respond to people like that and to refuse to accept that treatment, but you’re worth it. And you’re valid exactly how you are. Most trans folk I know are deeply supportive of me, so I try to soak that in.
I'm so sorry this happened to you ! Binary trans people can be just as mean as cis people
Sounds like that person still has some self loathing issues.
I'm sorry you had to hear that from ANY person...
Seconded. Every group has bad apples. Unfortunately another person being part of the same minority group as you doesn’t automatically mean they’re in your corner.  There’s a lot of internalized shit going on in some people’s heads, and sometimes bigotry against other minority groups as well. The world sucks that way.

I’m sorry that happened to you OP. Just understanding *why* doesn’t make it hurt less. You have our support. <3
This. I used to work for a trans person who mis-gendered me constantly. I REALLY needed the money on this contract at the time, or I would've just quit.   
I would gently correct her every time. She then went on a rant about how nonbinary people just ""wanted to be trendy"" and a whole lot of right-wing rambling. I ended up firing her as a client.
Thank you. I LOVE your username
If it helps at all, I once accidentally misgendered someone (who was not there at the time, thankfully) and was reminded that they actually went by ‘they/them’, and I, because brains are dumb, replied ‘oh crap, you’re right, he does!’ 

Odds are decent it was less a personal choice on their part and more the fault of a brain on automatic pilot on mental infrastructure laid down when learning the language with binary gender categories. 

Still no fun!
Ah I'm so sorry that happened to you. Its so painful coming from trans+ people because they should know how much it can hurt.
Auction house?
Yeah I really hate it. I mostly use she as well as they because I know ill mostly be perceived as a girl so having she as a pronoun gives me slight control over that, but I so wish I could just use they/them.
One additional thought I've found comforting: cis people don't worry about being ""trans enough"". If you're worried about it... that's a sign you're trans.
I believe most often its people medically transitioning both non binary and binary get frustrated by what they perceive as people not medically transitioning taking up the majority of space in the community. Which in some cases I can understand when people who desire medical transitioning feel side lined considering lived experiences are so different and transitioning is still something that is a huge burden. However, I don't believe that the reaction to these frustrations should be to belittle others and deny their identity. A lot of binary trans people who medically transition specifically are often the most awful in this regard.
>Honestly, it's very typical of queer community. Some of the worst comments I've gotten about my asexuality were from allo queer people. Bi folks get lots of hate from gays and lesbians. 

I've definitely had my fair share of negative experiences relating to asexuality (and aromanticism) from queer people, had a lesbian friend who kept telling me that I ""just haven't found the right person yet"" and also a different one that told me that I'm probably gay.
FYI these are in response to me coming out as AroAce to them.

>Here's the deal though: you don't need to struggle to be queer. Our struggles bring us together, but so do the beautiful things about queerness. It's not just about dysphoria, it's about euphoria. Whatever makes you feel like you're not a cis is literally all you need in order to be trans. 

Simplest way I can say is that if it feels right for you, go for it. You don't need explicit euphoria or dysphoria, all you need is to have a connection that feels right.
I once dated a nonbinary person and they refused to correct anybody on my pronouns, called me their girlfriend on numerous occasions, and never switched up my pronouns. Another enby person I knew once said nonbinary people were just ""looking for attention"". They were literally nonbinary❗️Some people I stgs
Thank you <3
Thank you so much <3 I looked on their page and it seems like they just share comments like that to lots of people, but it just brought forward some worries I can usually ignore

> Binary trans people can be just as mean as cis people

I think most of all; anyone can be a fucking prick regardless of what kind of struggles they've been through. There's no guarantee that someone won't be an abusive asshole just because they are part of a marginalized class. Hell, I had to help my trans woman friend out of an abusive relationship with a trans woman.
I think there’s a segment of binary transfolk who—consciously or not—think that if they can invalidate someone else it will make them more valid in their genders. Or like. That if it weren’t for enbies “making them look bad” then cis people would take trans people seriously and not be giant transphobes. 

Which is, of course, not how anything works. But its a lot safer and easier to hurt an enbie than to hurt a transphobe so thats how it shakes out sometimes. But its comforting to me to remember that it has nothing to do with me, and that how other people choose to handle their stress and insecurities doesn’t have to matter to me. I hope its helpful to you too.
Actually I feel like they can be meaner, since they usually know more ways to be hurtful and can do it in a way that comes off as a firming to other LGBTQ members.

An example of this that I have personal experience with is Egg culture, which generally has the idea of trying to force people who are ""in denial"" to come out against their will. Granted that's not what it's supposed to be, but it still unfortunately happens that way since a lot of egg culture is based on gender conformity and a lot of people there will say you're ""in denial"" or that ""it's a sign you're trans"" (almost always referring to Binary trans).

Here's a quote from one of my attackers, trying to convince me that I'm binary transfem TW Enbyphobia:
>!""I'm saying you're an Egg because you seem to have an interest in dressing as something other than your AGAB, you're obviously not Cisgender. People can be either Male or Female and you're clearly not male, because males don't enjoy things like that if you keep lying to yourself you'll never be happy""!<

>!Bonus points for encouraging me to buy and take Hormones from the black market in later messages!<
""Every group has bad apples.""
So true! One would think that a person that shares someone else's struggle would also have compassion for them. But in way too many cases people just isolate themselves as the only ones who could possibly have this certain experience and deny that someone with a little different point of view may have a very similar struggle.
May that be a far right politician who's gay and actively works against others who are also gay or a trans person who neglects the possibility that outside their bubble there could be enby people who share the same struggle.
Homophobic homosexual people, transphobic trans people, it's really absurd but always kinda the same toxic mentality.

I wear a button that says my pronouns and it helps. My presentation is ever more ambiguous so that helps too but it sucks to feel that I need to present a certain way to be taken seriously. 

So far my best day was the time someone wasn't sure which bathroom I needed when I asked to use a restroom that was locked and yesterday when I bound my chest successfully for the first time with tape and I felt so perfect I didn't want to take it off.
Thank you so much <3
You’re welcome :))
Womxn wasn’t created by gender expansive people as a way to change cis people to include us, if it was, it would be a different conversation. It was created by cis people to ensure that women’s groups and feminist spaces signified they were inclusive of more than just women (aka showing it isn’t a TERF or transphobic space) without having to list every single identity.

While it’s easier to understand by writing it all out, this was done for brevity and things like bios or business names or spaces with a character limit. And as a writer myself I know very well that it gets extremely tedious having to write out or say women (including trans women), non-binary, gender non-conforming, gender expansive, etc. every single time. And things like that can’t fit in bios.

When this first started it was very clearly explained everywhere I saw it, so I do not have the same confusion as you. I however prefer women+. Again when I saw this introduced it was in a book and explained in depth what the writer meant. It was a cis person finding a way that worked for them to explain a long list of people without having to write it out every single time.

I also think anywhere these things weren’t obvious to the viewer it was also meant to start a conversation around inclusivity. So if other cis people ask what it means, you’re telling them about the importance of inclusivity and also showing your values. It also helps weed out the transphobic clientele and people around you.

Not all language will resonate for everyone. However my specific example here is not to talk about the language itself or argue about semantics  but to give an example on how certain language or things help to include non-binary people but binary trans people call it transphobic because they only think of their experience. They saw it and automatically assumed it meant cis women were typing to distinguish trans women as something else, when that wasn’t the case at all. It is in fact calling it transphobic that is the transphobic action.

In truly inclusive places they will use various forms of language to symbolize inclusion. That can be things like “those socialized as female” to signify AFAB people who were raised as female, or some people use “gender expansive” to signify an umbrella. Regardless, what people use isn’t going to feel right for everyone and it’s never going to capture everyone properly. That is the non-binary experience - we are everything and nothing and so having labels in itself to define us or box us in feels wrong. That doesn’t mean their purpose isn’t helpful in a step toward making safer spaces. And our preferences also can’t negate that something else can be helpful to others even if it’s not to us. Language is meant to evolve and will continue to and it doesn’t evolve lightly without consensus from a huge group of people.

I personally only feel comfortable showing up at event spaces that signify they’re open to non-binary people in some way, that includes the use of things like womxn or women+. If they don’t I actually ask them so that I start a conversation and help them to learn that inclusive language is necessary if they actually mean to include beyond cis and trans females and that actions need to be taken to ensure it’s a safer space. While womxn isn’t my preference, I still see it’s worth. And in the context of this conversation it was used only as an example of transphobic erasure by binary trans people, not as a discussion about the word.
This^ 
my partner was sexually assaulted and then stalked by an afab nb person but he’s masc so didn’t feel like he could say anything about it and they abused that to the point of moving around the corner from his apartment.
Yeah me too, I've noticed that when quite a few people see it they only use my name and no pronouns. 

Ahh I'm so glad you have these moments!! <3
Thank you for making me more informed and giving me a good read! in retrospect, I wasn't being very wise in making my ignorance your problem... sorry about that."	z4klri	NonBinary	958	0.99	2022-11-25 18:36:02
Someone told me I wasn’t androgynous enough to be they/them	"Dude kept misgendering me, and when I corrected him he told me he “just doesn’t see me that way” because my presentation “isn’t really androgynous enough”. 

Oh come on! 

My usual presentation is “man bun tech bro”, so it really stung to hear that I’m still not butch enough to have “earned” my pronouns. Short of a teat yeet, there isn’t much further I can go!




Edit: Thank you all so much for the support!  I feel validated and seen, and I appreciate it. Androgyny is its own style thing and embracing or not embracing that style doesn’t change my right to have something as rock bottom basic as pronouns respected. 

For the folks telling me to misgender this cat right back, though, nah. Calling a man “her” as punishment for bad behavior plays into all the sexist, misogynist, and homophobic tropes that men are better, women are lesser, men loving and/or having sex with men is bad, bisexuality doesn’t exist, etc.  I’m not gonna drag entire disadvantaged groups through the mud just to get back at some bumhelm; I’ll probably just let him know the reason why Imma peace out, and then lose his number."	"Yeah that's pretty yikesy.

Remember, it's not your fault you get misgendered. Dude is just an arsehole.
You don’t owe anyone androgyny. You don’t have to embrace any specific presentation to be nonbinary. That guy sucks, and his comments are bigoted nonsense. So sorry you went through that!
Fuck that dude
Good thing androgyny has literally nothing to do with being nb
It's nothing to do with you, mate. You're awesome

That dude's just an ass
""oh shit, I put on the wrong gender this morning, my bad. I see you're wearing butch lesbian today, I should have noticed earlier- sorry, I'll switch to she/her"".
Dump that guy, yuck. I'm sorry. You are valid, your pronouns are valid and you owe nobody androgyny
I hate these people. I had a coworker when I started in my shop who referred to me with my AGAB. I corrected her the first two weeks, until I heard her going on to a customer, not even covering who she was talking about, misgendering me the whole time, while talking about how I wanted to be be referred to as they/them, and how ""such a waste of a girl."" Thankfully the manager moved her to another store, but it took a while of me complaining to them and bringing up the word discrimination a lot 🙄. Tldr: people suck.
Screw that jerk.

Also ""teat yeet"" killed me 🤣🤣🤣
No such thing as looking nonbinary. Androgyny is not a requirement of nonbinary. I can't stand people who think you can look queer. It's one thing to try to signal to other queer people that you're queer(I wear a trans pin, pretty obvious stuff) But when you deny someone's identity on your own preconceived notions of that identity you are a fucking asshole.


I personally choose violence in these situations, however possible. From being casually rude remarks to fully aggressive, whatever you think it will take without getting you in trouble. 


You are valid. Fuck this asshole.
Dude sounds like a right dick. You do you. I can just chill in sweatpants and a Colombian soccer jersey and still be NB. Not like there’s a dress code or whatever, lol.
Well teat yeet is the best thing I've heard on the internet this week if it's any consolation. Also who made that one lord of pronouns? Sounds like someone who hasn't earned your time or consideration.
some people can't handle the idea of people outside of ""man and women"" if they don't ""look the part"" enough. it's very annoying and invalidating. also sad. it all has to do with looks. how people who've been making rules for society all these years want to see things. they respect you based on how you ""pass"" in the eyes cis people.
i feel this.  i have a deep voice, and people are constantly misgendering me as ""he"" even after i share my pronouns (they/them). 

we shouldn't have to ""earn"" our pronouns.   our expression on any given day doesn't define us.  if we want to be masc one day and fem another day and andro another day we can do that, and fuck what anyone else thinks :)
To hell with him, do you, stay you!
I ask people that tell me such things why it matters or why the gatekeeping.
The argument past the insult is like trying to eat soup with a fork.

I have yet to hear a reason why only afab can be truly non-binary or that looking super masc or super fem denies your non-binary...

Humans like that are just not keeping up with society and are most definitely in the minority thankfully.
I would have been so tempted to laugh in their face and be like:

""Well, either I'm not androgynous enough or your understanding of the world isn't big enough, honey.""
Wow fuck this guy. You literally did nothing wrong, he just refuses to see you for who you are. What an asshole. Gonna change his pronouns to was/were.
Why can’t people see that there are male presenting non-binary people, female presenting non-binary people and androgynous non-binary people. We are all unique.
ugh I really dislike people who link gender identity with gender expression.

you are very valid and do not owe this person an explanation. it's not your fault for being misgendered at all. people are just assholes
I'm very feminine, and I'm non-binary. In a way, it helps you root out the shitty people. You are deserving of love and respect no matter your presentation, and you are absolutely valid.
Oh, man. You don't have to look or present a certain way to use certain pronouns, so you don't need to look androgynous for they/them. Unfortunately, some people just love to be assholes. Try not to let it get to you and just keep being you :))
[reminds me of this bigender meme](https://www.reddit.com/r/Bigender_irl/comments/q3giuc/bigender_irl/)
I hate people like that. Judging by looks is terrible, and always a huge red flag to me.
Can I do a stabbo?  *Please?*
Tell him he “really isn’t open minded enough” to be talking to you ✋🙄
Androgyny is not the only valid non-binary identity/presentation... the idea of there being one valid form of NB is totally backwards. Even if there was a well-established androgynous archetype, all that means is that there would start being non-trinary people.
I've had a similar experience. This guy I was dating said he wouldn't using he/him for someone without a dick. 

They can fuck off or learn to respect people!
absolute dickhead that's not the point of being non binary 

being nonbinary is how you see your ideal self and no one else should decide that for you
My partner is a femme presenting enby and is as valid as I am as a masc presenting enby. They are free to express themselves as they feel. People just don't get that. We are all valid and it shouldn't matter if I want to be referred to as cupcake. My choice.
Tell them to go fuck themselves.
Being non-binary/ using they them prounouns ≠ being androgynous. Tf?
There's not such thing as ""not androgynous enough"", fuck that cishet and the dysphoria they throw around

You're a light in this world, now go eat crackers 🍘
What a jerk! I hope you dumped his ass.
This guy is a complete a—hole. Dump him. You don’t need to look like his idea of androgynous to have your identity and pronouns respected.
It’s almost like he doesn’t understand androgyny isn’t about how others identify and perceive you, but how you identify and perceive yourself.
That person just sounds like an asshole. Your identity is your own, and can not be determined by another person just because they think you don't look that way enough.
I hate when people say dumb shite like this. A good comeback is misgendering anyone that misgenders you.
You don't owe anyone a goddamned thing.

You are valid.
I feel this. Am amab and hear this more frequently than I’d like. Not femme enough or not trans enough. Without going on estrogen and getting tits I’m just never NB enough
Kick em in the shins
Remember yall: Being Nonbinary doesn't equal androgynous!
His shitty opinion on whether you meet his personal standards for specific pronouns doesn't make you any less valid. He is just an asshole. Next time you see him keep referring to him as she and when he gets angry explain that he isn't masculine enough to have he/him pronouns. Bet he changes his tune real fast
Ahn... do you need to look androgynous to be they/them? Wtf? 😶🤦🏻‍♀️
Don't mind these kind of people. The only thing you need to worry about is how fabulous and awesome you can be 👍
You could be the most conventional ""manly man"" the masciest masc that ever existed. You're still Nonbinary. Its internal not external. That guy is a dick
What does this person do when they encounter a very feminine-presenting man or very masculine-presenting woman? I bet they don't misgender them, so it's probably just an excuse to be a bigot.
I envy the imagination of the binary and the cis.  The things they ""see"" seem so real to them.
I suffer from this too. I feel too feminine to be considered non-binary. What really helps is following other people who are non-binary and present the way I do. It’s really affirming.

Just remember, non-binary has NO look. That’s the whole point of it! :-)
Fuck that dbag
Androgyny is very strict. Like, it’s usually femme white people in all black masculine clothing.
Ugh, hate that. Like, it’s one thing for somebody to perhaps not know your identity or even to know it and mistakingly refer to me in a masc way on a day that I am presenting masc - that’s normal human stuff to me - but for someone to look me in the eyes and essentially just say they reject me??? Thats painful and they just don’t even get it because they can’t fathom a world without comfy boxes, or at least don’t respect me enough to share in my world.
That’s just being a jerkass for the sake of it. He ain’t worth your time
Ok no im pissed at that dude. You don’t owe anyone androgyny and its certainly not your fault if someone misgenders you. You don’t have to “earn” the right to use your pronouns, that’s a ridiculous concept. I hope that that dude isn’t bothering you anymore.
My close friend who is a super woke, poc, queer social worker likes to pull the ""Well you PRESENT masc, so..."" Try maybe gently reaffirming how important it is that you are gendered correctly? A little compassionate but stern conversation can go a long way.
That’s bullshit. You’re free to present yourself in any way you feel comfortable. My partner is non-binary and presents very feminine and uses she/they pronouns, but it doesn’t make her any less non-binary than me. (A very androgynous person who uses they/them/any pronouns) non-binary people come in all shapes and sizes.
There is nothing I can do to look Androgynous. I am doomed to always look female. I have huge boobs and very Fem features. Shaved the sides of my head and wear wife beaters. I'll still look female. 😨😨😨

I feel you. I wish just once someone would be like....
 "" I'm sorry, just can't tell what gender you are.""
Bro, I remember I posted a picture of me wearing an outfit on Instagram and captioned it ""Looking hella androgynous I LOVE IT"" and my ex boyfriend texted me saying that it really wasn't because even by wearing a flannel shirt and a fadora, it doesn't make me androgynous. I was like, ""well what do you consider to be a more androgynous outfit? "" and he said, "" what? No, you can't be androgynous based on clothes. You have to have feminine and masculine features to be androgynous."" And I felt like I lost a few brain cells when seeing that.
Dude someone could be the most feminine/masculine motherfucker on the planet, but if they say they are non binary, then that’s what they are.
Oof, thats what scares me the most about coming out publicly. I really like my beard (it could be a little fuller though, thanks body), I've wanted one since i was like 10 and i absolutely hate my face without it... But it's an instant beard=man...
Sounds like he isn't human enough
Thanks. I really needed to hear that it’s not my fault.
This
Thanks. It was a second date, so maybe “don’t fuck that dude,” is more apropos, lol. 

Thanks, though. For reals. Y’all’s reaction has helped me solidify that I don’t actually need to put up with what doesn’t make me happy.
Word.
Truly, because it doesn't matter how he sees you. If you say you go by they/them pronouns, then you go by they/them pronouns. Full stop. Not up for debate, regardless of how he sees you. I'm sorry this happened to you
I was so glad to realize androgyny was optional, because I have no fashion sense to begin with and didn't want to have to think about buying new clothes or maintaining a hairstyle.
Which is funny, because this guy sometimes goes by she/her and uses the femme form of his given name (think Julio/Julia). I pick up on where he’s at that day and pronoun appropriately, which kind of makes his malfunction over my pronouns even worse.
Moved her to another store instead of firing her? YIKES.
I prefer not to sink to their level. Anyone who can force me to be a violent, cruel person has full control over me, and I refuse to give anything or anyone that control. I stay kind and non-violent because it’s the most fundamental aspect of my identity and ethics.
>>Gonna change his pronouns to was/were. 

I love this!  Thank you!
Right?  Friend of a friend is High Femme as all get out, but my friend still manages to call them by their proper pronouns.
You are so right. I think I just added a new Dating Shit Test, there’s no reason for me to put up with this crap. 

This particular guy was pushing my boundaries anyway, I think this is as good a final straw on the “Nah, I’m good” side of the scales as any might be. Thanks for seeing yourself out, Mr. Misgender, don’t let the door hit ya where the good lord split ya!
Right? Dog knows I’m not gonna….
This is true, but I feel like I want to pick my battles. I’m already the Kind and Patient Poster Child for disability (especially hidden disability like mine often is), sometimes I am just tired of putting on that beatific educator smile and I dowanna.
Oh dang!  I guess there’s reasons he’s an ex, then!
First, it is absolutely in no way whatsoever your fault.

Second, of course you can use they/them, it’s literally and actually NEUTRAL, everyone can use it.

The guy’s a jerk!
Far out, this happened on a date??? What an asshole. You absolutely don't need to put up with why doesn't make you happy. I am quite happily single, but I refuse to let anyone into my social circle that doesn't respect my gender identity (or lack thereof) or the gender identity of any of my friends. 

""I just don't see you that way"" sounds like a them problem, friend.
The fact that this happened on a date is wild. Like yeah dude that's how you convince someone to continue seeing you, disrespect the fuck out of them and then make it seem like it's their fault(which btw it absolutely isn't and you owe no one androgyny which is absolutely not a requirement of being nonbinary). That guy should teach ways to show you're a walking red flag 101.
100% do not fuck that dude. Not worth spending another second of your life on.
Right?  I’m absolutely tragic with clothing and makeup, too, and maintaining a hairstyle just seems like so much work…. I have the tech bro man bun because I’m too lazy to get my hair cut regularly and that’s the easiest way to keep it out of my face.
What the fuck 😭 so it's not even a cis man, they're gatekeeping smh
While I admire that practice, it isn't for me. I am very comfortable asserting myself in any situation. To me, being told to be quiet and kind is giving people power over me. I've been told to behave since I was a child. I refuse. I will defend myself and my friends. You cannot make me accept mistreatment. 


You do not deserve and will not receive my kindness if you are a bigot. 


But I fully understand and respect pacifists. My husband is a pacifist. I love him dearly. But if a bigot was screaming in my face I would not ask for his help to gently talk to them. I would (redacted) 😌
Oh, dude is a straight asshole. The audacity.
YESS, don't put up with ittt! My very much ex boyfriend used to do that all time 🙄 So not worth it. Best of luck in the dating scene!! <3
You should.
I want to start a company for the little ones in the LGBTQ+ community where I tell people to go fuck themselves when they misgender. 

I'm the last of seven children. 
I took shit from no one.

Next time just walk away. They don't want to respect your boundaries, just pretend to be a NPC.
Hey, that's totally fair.
Haha! Yeah! I'm actually really glad we broke up. I started realizing that we weren't that good for each other after out break up. So good thing that's over!
Like wtf is he doing going on a date with someone whos gender he isnt cool with. What a freak
God damn, right? 

No way am I jumping hoops just to get someone else to demonstrate basic human respect. Fuck that.
Wait till that guy learns he's not straight because he's attracted to them
Be yourself. There’s wisdom in asserting your own power and defending yourself / your family / your community as well. All the best.
To clarify, “Friend” is not “Dude who Misgendered Me”. My friend has been super solid with my pronouns all along.
This was in the last two minutes of a date so we parted company pretty much right after this anyway. It’s been really bothering me since then, though. He was so casual, telling me he referred to me as “she” to his friend because I’m not androgynous, and basically blowing off the correction.  Like, non-binary people can have hips and asses and curves, too. It’s just that my curves are non-binary curves, this glorious cleavage is non-binary cleavage, and these “lady parts” aren’t attached to any kind of lady.
To be fair, this guy wasn’t straight before he met me, either. He might need to expand his definition of “bisexual” beyond just “attracted to both men and women”, but he knows he’s 100% not straight.
Same to you!
I meant the person in the original post.
Fair enough. Friendo is pretty rad and I don’t want him mixed up with Mr Misgender. :)"	qntq9p	NonBinary	944	1.0	2021-11-06 05:33:56
I think I might be trans non binary but my girlfriend is a radfem: an update!	"Hey! I'm the same person who wrote about questioning their gender and thinking about continue transition while having an openly radfem girlfriend. I have some news that I wanted to share with yall!

First, this week I went to a transgender clinic with a non binary friend. I felt really comfortable, my friend was even surprised! They said I looked so happy while talking about transitioning and that I'm definitely not cis. I agree, while talking about how I feel and my desires I realized I certainly have a more similar experience of what being trans is rather than being cis. However, I still don't feel worthy of calling myself trans or non binary. 

I also talked to my mom about my dysphoria, and gave some ""discreet hints"" about not being cis and she was very okay about it! She was only confused why my dysphoria is back, but I'm feeling the same lol, so no worries. But I'm don't feel safe yet to talk about medical transition, I'll wait until I'm more comfortable and sure about my identity.

Second: yes, I broke up with my (now ex) girlfriend. It was a respectful conversation, where both sides were heard. My questioning wasn't the only thing that made me want to break up, she did some little things that made me upset during our relationship that didn't get better. She also have some personal issues she's working through that were also impacting our relationship. 

During the conversation, I said she didn't treat trans people with decency and that she, from my perception, have a very simplistic idea of what being trans and dysphoric is, and due to that I was afraid of talking about my situation with her. She said that it wouldn't matter if I identify as any label of trans, that ""she even has a non binary friend"", she would still love me and treat me with respect, but she would still see me as a woman. She also said that the not so good thing she calls trans people are only ""jokes"" but she wouldn't misgender them or anything (even tho she still does that). After breaking up, I felt relieved! I'm exited to discover myself again and meet new people!"	"Congrats 🎉 amazing update it sounds like things are going well and you’re in a good position to grow, explore, and take care of yourself as a unique and special person. I’m so happy for you💜🌈
Congratulations and good luck moving forward
No radfems. Only rad femmes
Oh thank god I’m soo glad you broke it off.
Aww I remember that post. What a fucking victory. Love to see it 🥲
your ex was a little dick. i hope the rest of your journey is much better! my one piece of advice is to take shit from no one
Thank GOD for this update! My friend, I was genuinely worried about you, and now I’m seeing this?! You got yourself to a point where you went to talk about this openly, and felt okay with that. That’s a huge step. I know after my first appointment with a gender specialist i felt a lot more at ease. More accepting of myself and what I may want in the future. 

Medically transitioning isn’t necessary but for a lot of us it’s the only option to get piece of mind in our bodies. I’m currently weighing up the pros and cons of top surgery, it’s a big thing for me, and it’s okay to take the time to consider all the options you have, or don’t have. 

I’m really happy you got out of that relationship, because telling a person “I’ll support you but I won’t ever believe you or accept you as yourself” is NOT supportive or kind or okay. That’s the opposite of support. If it were true, they wouldn’t have  said “but I’ll see you as a woman”. I’m sorry that they couldn’t even for a second out aside their own bullshit for you. Because you sound really cool and super nice, it’s their loss completely. 

So go and thrive, it’s the best way to live your life. We don’t get given a whole lot of time, never waste a minute on doubting yourself or who you are.
Go fucking get it, you absolute monarch 🏳️‍⚧️❤️💜
Can we normalize not affirming TERFs as feminists? They are not feminists. They are transphobes who weaponize feminist ideas to focus their hate.
💖💖💖
Congratulations 🥳 Hope your self-love journey w/your new identity goes well! 

Came out as Nonbinary back in May 2021. 💖
She wouldn't do anything disrespectful yet would still see you as a woman.. lmao good thing that's over
Wooooo boy! I can't tell you how excited I am reading this. I didn't even read the other original post you made, and I don't know you at all, but I'm proud of you! These are huge moves towards self actualization, way to go.
Good job!  I'm proud of you!

(Although, I do wish people wouldn't use radfem a short hand for terf - it's a specific branch of feminism that can also be trans-inclusive. And most terfs aren't even real feminists, let alone radical ones).
So glad for you! And so good you broke up with someone like that: if she doesn’t see you as who you are, that’s not respect. There are plenty of other ppl who will actually respect you.
😄🎉
wow your ex is just yikes
>she would still love me and treat me with respect, but she would still see me as a woman.

tf? This is absolutely NOT treating a non-binary/trans person with respect. 🤬

If you are enby/trans, you are not your AGAB and don't want to be treated like it 😠
❤️❤️❤️
I’ve been waiting for this update! Live your best life and know that you’re valuable and wonderful.
Congratulations!!! We’re proud of you ♥️ keep going! You got this
So so happy for you
💜💜💜
Im so happy for you. I hope the rest of your journey goes well.
i don't think i saw your first post so i'm not familiar with your story but i'm so glad to hear you're feeling better and making awesome progress on your gender journey! happy for you 🥰
Waah, I'm happy for you! <3 I feel like you know this, even if your ex gf and society tried to surpess it; you are totally worthy of calling yourself nb and trans, say it with me ""I'm worthy and valid"".
Amazing update!! Congratulations and I'm wishing you the best of luck and all the happiness with everything in your future😊
Youre doing amazing! Im proud of you! 

And dont worry about calling yourself non binary.
If it feels comfortable for decribing yourself go for it!
Both terms are umbrella terms that cover a great deal of different experiences! Non binary is simply not always fully feeling like your agab. Whether that is genderfluid, demi, a-gender etc.
Congrats! Sounds like you have already made huge steps in your journey! Never forget you have a whole community here to support you! 🏳️‍⚧️💕
Happy to hear you are doing better and have people who support you.

I am kinda questioning if I trans too but have not yet gone to talk to a mental health professional about this because I have not found a person who is openly LGBTQ supportive. Like gender dysphoria is still labeled as *mental illness* in my country.
Thank your for the update! I’m so happy to hear that things are looking up for you. I’m very happy that you’re able to stretch your wings and grow into yourself.
Keep being an amazing human being!
Radical Feminism isn't inherently transphobic, it is merely the belief that social restructuring as well as political laws are necessary to achieve feminism.
Quotas, the debate on the male gaze, the fight against gender norms and roles are all parts of radical feminism.
TERFs misinterpret radical feminism to their liking despite many radical feminist authors being trans-inclusive, please don't let them take away this tradition from actual real feminists.
And I'm glad you got red of her, she seems toxic asf.
YAY! So glad to hear you're doing better :)
I am very proud of you! It can be incredibly hard to leave the ones we love in order to move forward comfortably in our lives. I wish you happiness :)
Congratulations 🎉 and proud to read the edit 😊
I'm glad for you, cousin. I wish peace and happiness for you. That took courage and strength to get through. Be proud.
Hi, I commented on that post! So glad to hear you're in a better place now. I wish you the best on your gender journey ❤️
I didn’t see the original post but good on you for being able to break things off! Here’s to hoping your journey is a great one! 👍
 good thing u broke up with her
Good job taking this step for yourself. Proud of you.
You have earned this massive W. I admire your agency and taking control of your life. I wish nothing but blessings for you from here on out💖

Remember to love yourself, monarch🌺
🙌🏻
I love the double meaning here. Not only is monarch a nonbinary term for royalty but also a type of butterfly which is appropriate as well.

Idk why I'm tickled so much by this, but I am.

ninja edit: also, sorry if I'm being lame for literally explaining the joke, but it is too good for people to just scroll past.
I apologize for that. I thought radfem and terf were synonyms. But yes, my ex is trans exclusionary. I didn't want to date someone who say really bad things about people like me and make me feel unsafe to talk about my situation.
Agreed about radfem vs TERF. There *are* radical feminists who are trans-inclusive, and I worry that we run the risk of alienating them if we say radfem when referring to the TERFy ones.
unrelated but i love that DF avatar
You're right and you should say it. Radical feminism is a very cool thing that was co-opted by very hateful people
Not sure why you are getting downvotes for effectively saying the same thing I got upvoted for. Trans-inclusive radical feminists do exist, and not just in a soggy toast “well, I’m inclusive by not being exclusive” way. Many radical feminist ideas have contributed to our society(ies) becoming more accepting of gender binary non-conformity in the past several decades. Let’s not throw out the allies with the shitwater!
Oh it was GREAT for you to explain it, because I didn’t even know what I did there
I bet they've never read any actual radfem theory either, most theorists were hella pro trans.

And if they've read any, it's probably the idiots that wrote transsexual empire and the other idiots that started political lesbianism.

Misgendered by the weed man	Like bruh. You're the weed man. You literally sell drugs. Does it really harm you that much to call me they/them she/them even if I'm not all dolled up? :Fuckoff:	"""Misgendered by the Weed Man"" would be a sick name for a song about identity
People who sell weed come from literally everywhere on the political spectrum. Unfortunately. Ask me how I know....


Wish politics had nothing to do with it though.
Sometimes I forget not everyone lives in The Netherlands lol I was like ""Why do you need a dealer when you can just go to the shop?""

Anyway; that's really shitty and I hope you're doing well!
I’m not going to piggyback the comment below me by two that sounds like it’s trying to reach for problems that aren’t there, but this always confused me about black market dealers. 

When I was younger I hung out with not amazing people (drug dealers) and I remember, vividly, at the start of the pandemic when I’d be hanging out at my bffs bfs house (the trapp house). These grown ass men were hugely enraged that someone even had the audacity to suggest getting the vaccine. Like bro. I have literally watched you do a line of coke on someone else’s keys, and you’re afraid of a stick and poke???

So I’m right there with you on it being super weird how close minded black market dealers tend to be. It’s weird lol.

Edit: two words bc I’m dumb and bad at reading
That's so weird to me. Being a weed dealer means your work kind of IS your relationships with stoners and smokers, who often are pretty chill, laidback, and V happy to get their oui'd. It's so easy to just be easy going and respectful. I guess this is a different breed of weedmen, cus all the one's I've met that are consistently successful and moving good product are ... just like lovely and chill.
It feels weird and wrong wrong when I see bigots smoking weed. Like that’s supposed to bring people together. How dare they mix their bad vibes with this sacred herb
Don't bite the hand that feeds you weed...!
This is why I steal it from my mom 💅 (why doesn’t that emoji come up when you search gay. SMH, so homophobic)
I used to have a dealer that would always call me ‘bro’. I never said anything because I’d always buy from him in my pijamas and without make up, etc. But this one night I was all dressed up and when we met he was shocked lmao. The day after he talked to me and wanted to hook up wtf. I said no and never ever heard from him again lol
The weed man is not someone who should be trusted for anything but weed ime
Damn that sucks, I love going to the dispensaries here. They've been some of the best about being inclusive, ironically better than the pharmacies and labs I go to which love to deadname me.
Not defending his ignorance but maybe you’re just another client to him? If you told him your preferred pronouns, maybe he forgot? Or maybe he just doesn’t care… good luck finding a drug dealer that is considerate of your feelings lol
Sorry that happened.

Today i walked with headphones (was about to turn on the music but they were off) and walked past a man talking on the phone who was like ""I'm shocked. I just saw a man wearing polished nails. Holy fuck"". I can't believe people can be shocked by stuff like this, I've barely started out my transitioning/gender expression. I don't really care but it kinda makes me wonder about the safety of this shithole country I live in :'D

I'm a druggie (recovering), and all of the people both in recovery and active addiction (like plugs) didn't have an issue with me expressing feminine traits or using she/her as amab. There's a lot of negatives to this subculture, but I must say they're mostly tolerant and open-minded IME
Not based weed man >:(
That really is frustrating.. And sad to hear. Hopefully , that person finds some  enlightening on their end..
nb dealer here u can find better i promise
I don't know many, but I wouldn't expect a drug dealer to be all that accepting.
My weed man does home delivery and has reasonable prices, he can call me whatever he wants lol (no, in all seriousness, that really sucks, OP, I wish my weed man didn't misgender me either but he doesn't seem to be one of those people who would ""get it"")
Yeah i hate that shit so much too. People be focusing on the wrong stuff sometines
Time to find a new weed man, my friend.
They’re probably a libertarian who wants to protect their individual “liberties and freedoms”
I can't imagine a plug who behaves like that tbh. I mean, the guy all my friends and I used was the ""chill"" weed dealer, like you'd go hang out and get smoked up if you wanted to as well.

Is legal cannabis a thing in your state? It is here in MA meaning I can buy basically whatever I want if I have extra money. Also my dad gave me some dispensary weed he didn't want either.
im sorry for this experience they just making money in their perspective, if he's chill tell him ur identity
I understand your anguish. But can we not shame people for their choice of how to make money. Would you shame a sex worker?
Idk why you’re surprised, as a transfem manufacturer and distributor of multiple substances, and sales rep depending how you look, (trying to be pg cause idk how this sub is abt drug use) I have to completely hide my identity to be able to do about 70% of the business I do because people would either hurt me or try and refuse to buy or rob me. I will say, I have had all of those things happen due to my gender, and I kinda like it when they do, cause me and one of my business partners are pretty serious about business, and people look really corny as fuck begging for forgiveness and giving me all they’re drugs and money under the circumstances I put them. But eh, it’s morally better and easier business to try to avoid having to do that, just not as profitable sadly. Also not as fun, I’m telling you, being a semi powerful drug dealer and making transphobes and homophobes pay, i always take a video making them say “I’m sorry for robbing the cute transfem drug dealer because I thought she was an easy lick, I really just am super broke and can’t afford dabs, I wish I could get money like them because she is just so hot and sexy, and I am inferior to both of these homosexuals who are literal trap stars making money I couldn’t dream of. I will do whatever they tell me to until they are done and have taken back what’s theirs x2. I can’t call the cops because I would have to explain that I killed a kid with fentanyl lying about what the drugs are. please forgive me for my hate crimes daddy goku and mommy hunter.”  ( telegram names)        

PSA THIS IS ALL IN A GTA ROLL PLAY IT IS NOT REAL.  🥸

Edit:yes I’m talking about a somewhat specific event. But only cause it was the funniest how it happened.
When things are made more ambiguous overall, then you cannot expect everyone to know everything. Especially if we lived in still a very visual based society. Dont get too hung up on it I would advice.
Had my guy round once and name dropped Jordan Peterson in my presence. Like. Like. Nah. Luckily he’s chill enough he listened to my reasons why that’d never happen again 😭
Mines an older lady that doesn’t know what a non-binary is. I let her off
I've never had a weed man (except mooching off my dad's) but if he continuously misgenders you after being very clear about your pronouns and identity, it's time to find a new drug dealer hdkmxhdkd
I would never misgender while you share your body with me and I share my sticky icky no seeds no stems ride me like you wanna you little enby femme

Woot!
I'm so sorry and this post is a MOOD
This just makes me feel so thankful for mine. Mine is a raging leftist who has celebrated and supported every step of my transition. Sorry your weed guy blows.
Idk how it works with you or others, but personally I've never had the issue of being misgendered because I've never been gendered in the first place. I mean, the people I've know will say bro or dude, but I see that as gender neutral in most contexts. All the interactions I've had are: 

Dealer: here's your stuff
Me: here's your money

Done

I do empathise with you though, people like us often get misgendered at work, at restaurants and in other daily interactions. It shouldn't happen when your getting your special stuff too. ]

Yeah it's really unfortunate. You'd think the guy helping you get high would be a little more open minded. Its Gucci though. This is why I consider them ""contracted help"" 🤣🤣🤣🤣 gotta go find a new one
sorry, random question, i've been considering moving to the netherlands for some time, partly due to how accepting it seems, but is it actually an accepting place? how is it to be queer and genderqueer there?
Oh man, it was such a big deal here in California when weed got legalized.  I don'tuse it myself, but I remember how stoked some of my friends and family were.  Way easier than getting it illegally or driving up to Oregon.  

So. Many. Dispensaries. There was a huge shift from outdoor grows in remote areas to warehouses in the cities, too.  It was a big impact on the economy.
I live in Canada where it's legal but people still use the black market because the prices are better.
Or just know a guy with multiple options at 75 ounce. Outdoor but all good
[removed]
Yeah like I could understand if it were a couple times he forgets but it's been damn near every time since I've known him.
🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Preach!
I feel this about a local sandwich guy... He sets up right outside my workplace's front door and his cheesesteaks are *incredible* annnnnd he probably wouldn't get it. 🙃 I did tell him my new name, since he calls them out for folks' orders, but I didn't bother going into detail about why it was changed. 😅 Luckily I don't know if he has ever gendered me at all. He only calls names or talks to people directly, so it hasn't really come up.
I don't meen to be rude.. but I think they were refering to being, accommodating to, now this may be an old word but, alternative culture.. someone in that line of work. I would think being in a more alternative business minded. Picticularly due to clientele there would be more.. consideration and open on that type of thing..?

Please tell me if I'm way off here. Thanks!
I think it's more like, you'd expect a drug dealer to be more open minded because in that line of work you encounter all walks of life and have firsthand experience with being marginalized. Not about shaming the profession.
I'm not shaming him, I've sold weed before. I know the struggle. I haven't done sex work but I have friends who are in sex work and I think it's rad. It's just obnoxious because we've had the conversation before.
Most of the old hippies are pretty cool if you explain.  The pothead subculture definitely overlapped with queer subculture ""back in the day"".
did we just become best buds?
Okay but you're legally obligated to send the song to my discord when you're done.
Okay but you're legally obligated to send the song to my discord when you're done.
NOT IF I DO IT FIRST ?!?!?>!/ (joking)
Me too!!!! Jhahahaha
""contracted help""? is this dealer white?
It's not as accepting when you live outside of the major cities, apart from how the language isn't very genderqueer-friendly. A translation of ""they/them"" does exist, but feels awkward when using it so practically no-one does. But apart from that, it's still more accepting than most other countries, I think?

Most people are kind and lovely, some people aren't. I think the thing a lot of people struggle with more is how direct and no-nonsense Dutch culture is compared to theirs.
Yeah Im visiting halifax in june and my friends are like we get pre rolls at the liquor store and im like bruh I smoke all day everyday in Murica at 75 ounce from my hillbilly rural friends. I cant afford to visit you guys lol
Please don't peddle conspiracy theories

That comes off as extremely shaming.
Seems so, What's Up? 😂
That weed man isn't selling the best buds I tell you hwat
I don't know how long it's going to take but I will try to remember😭 if anything it's definitely going on this sub
NAHHH LETS HAVE A MUSICAL WEED-OFF
thank you for the answer! my language's version of they/them is also fairly clunky and awkward, so im not too bothered if i cant use those.

honestly, i think i'd enjoy the directness, im high functioning autistic and **really** dislike any sort of ""sugar coating"", and have gotten several comments on how im too direct lol
It's more a comment on how They're putting themselves in more dangerous or awkward situations than just calling me by my Preferred pronoun, not shaming them for what they do. I wouldn't shame anyone for how they make their living. We all have to make money some how. I sold weed and mined crypto for over a year to cover my costs during COVID. I know how the struggle is. I understand how you interpeted it, but Im not coming after anyone for what they do and not everyone's back-handed comments on the internet are immediately shaming people for what they do. G recognizes G.
I wonder if you replaced drug dealer with any other job titile that deals with diverse people if you would consider it as shaming, for example ""you're literally an ER nurse"". To me it doesn't, it just points out the irony of the discrimination in relation to the people they work with, it doesn't shame them for their job choice
don’t mind me, i’m just gonna *sobs quietly*
Remindme! 6 months

Hahah, as a fellow autistic I love my culture! 

If you end up deciding to move here; I'll leave you a couple of tips! Make sure to learn about our culture, try to learn a little Dutch! We do have a housing crisis right now, a lot of people live at their parent's still because we don't have any elderly homes anymore + during corona a lot of people bought houses just to rent them for way too much money. 

I recommend visiting cities like Zwolle before moving if you're able. People are really connected there & there's way more Dutch culture than in cities like Amsterdam since there's just so much tourism & people with other (wonderful) cultures there it doesn't really show you how Dutch cities really are. 

Besides that, if you move into the bijbelbelt or like, anywhere a lot of farmers are, it's not extremely safe, I find, to be out in the open with your sexuality or gender-identity when it strays from the ""norm."" 

Be careful, and if you end up moving here, let me know! :)

YEAHHHH I'M SWITCHING TO BASS THIS YEAR AND YOU CANNOT TELL ME THATS NOT THE MOST STONER INSTRUMENT
thank you so much! yes, i've heard about the housing crisis, im hoping it'll get better soon. if i do end up moving there, its probably a few years away as i have to finish my studies first. 

do people in Zwolle (for the most part) know english? i know some Dutch, and i can piece together sentences since Norwegian (my native language) and Dutch are fairly similar, but i cant hold a conversation yet. 

yeah, i guessed the more rural and orthodox areas would be less safe, i lived in a small farming town (like 600 people small) as a kid and any form of queerness were very much looked down upon (though its starting to get better there luckily!)

sorry for bombarding you with questions, i just haven't been able to talk to a Dutch person who's similar to me (being queer and autistic) but what's it like to be autistic? like, is it openly accepted, or is it something you'd hide? im privileged in the sense that i can realistically hide my autism, but i'd love to be open about it. in the town i grew up in, any form of mental health talk was very ""dont ask, dont tell"", and that included any form of disorders as well.

thank you again!
lmao
Holy shit this is my favorite comment thread in almost a decade of Reddit.
bruh lmao
NAH NAH BRO THATS COOL AND ALL BUT ACOUSTIC GUITAR HAS GOT TO BE *THE* JUNKIE INSTRUMENT. LIKE... THATS SOME STONER SHIT RIGHT THERE. mine's even got a little sprout engraved in the head :)
Most Dutch people in the whole country can speak at least A2 English and have taken exams in the language, you'll find a lot of people switching to English if you struggle with Dutch, but a lot of Dutchies will appreciate you trying & will try to conversate with you if you ask to keep talking in Dutch.

Autism isn't really a big deal if you have it here! I'm very open about it & most people are kind about it. You don't have to hide it, but sometimes people will get frustrated. 

People might call you an ""autist"" but it's mostly used in a funny way. When people say ""Ik ben zo'n autist"" (I'm such an autistic) they mean they're being nitpicky or something similar. (Like needing things to be a certain way.) It can be used in the ""you're weird"" sense, when someone's being silly. Overall it's not a big insult and most Dutch autistic people don't really get offended by it because they also find it funny.

However, people might not understand or think you're just overreacting or whatever, just ignore them!

Don't worry about the questions, keep 'em coming!
great! im actively trying to learn Dutch at the moment, and im planning to stay in Zaandam later this year, so im hoping i'll be able to have some conversations in Dutch. i also checked the train, and i'll be able to visit Zwolle while im there! 

im so glad autism isn't a big deal! im also glad that its something people can joke with, as i personally often joke about it now that i dont live in my childhood town, and im tired of people (neurotypicals for the most part) being offended on my behalf hahah

thank you so much for taking the time to answer my questions though! its really nice to know what to expect :)
Cool! Zaandam is amazing, they have great mustard there.

If you're ever near Zwolle and want a tour; let me know! I live near there!

And it's absolutely no problem, it's fun to talk about my country and culture!
thank you!! thats very kind of you! i might just dm you later this year if everything works out, i'll be in the Netherlands for a few weeks this summer :) and i'll be sure to try Zaandams mustard!"	12blwfq	NonBinary	907	0.98	2023-04-04 15:06:54
Please send some positivity & love , people on insta are bodyshaming / bullying / misgendering me because i use THEY/XE pronouns and I have a body hair I'm comfy with my body I do not wanna shave but cis het men and women will send death threats , bully and HATE because i don't fit in their ideology		"You’re giving me enby envy!
You look incredible, you give me gender envy tbh, don't listen to them they're stupid and awful and block each and everyone of them. You look splendid, don't let them hurt you. ❤️❤️
bruhj they suck, you genuinely look very pretty (not in a femme way but yea) and you're literally give me envy with that hair of yours!
It breaks my heart that such a lovely and kind person is receiving that kind of hate! Keep being yourself friend, you have my support and a whole community behind you. Never forget that and never stop being yourself!!

You and your pronouns are epic and I wish I looked like you

You look amazing!! Those people don't know what they're talking about, I love your fashion sense

 Especially when they look as amazing as you!!
Yoooo. You are handsome and gorg af. Vibes all day in that shirt love
Why should somebody shave?
I, for one, am glad you don't fit in with their hateful ideology. you look terrific and deserve all the happiness 🥰
You look gorgeous! And the hair is serious goals. Keep doing you, because you're.obviously.doing.it.right.
Block 'em. You're pog. You're valid. You have us.
Also, I go by the same pronouns!
The moment I saw you my brain went “that might just be the coolest person I’ve ever seen” your whole vibe is AMAZING. I’m so sorry that people suck, people who have lived their whole lives feeling forced to live in the binary of life (not just gender) hate it when they see others who are stronger than themselves. To be yourself in a world full of people pretending is truly an amazing thing. Also I read energy’s and auras and yours are both very kind and warm :)
You look great and the shirt, accessories and hair style really suit you! Don't pay attention to the haters. Embrace yourself 🤗

Body hair is beautiful.

>“Your boos mean nothing, I’ve seen what makes you cheer.”

>”Every breath I take without your permission raises my self-esteem.”

💛🤍💜🖤
I’m sorry people on your instagram are hating on you for how you want to express yourself - its completely uncalled for. You look extremely [word of affirmation to your liking (i dont wanna use a word that you’re uncomfortable with)] and how you’re comfortable in your body is phenomenal. Keep trucking along and block everyone that thinks you can’t present how YOU want. All of us here will 100% have your back no matter what. 💛🤍🖤💜

you are giving me big gender envy.

Why must you do this to me :(.
Woah woah, firstly im so sorry you are receiving bullying and death threats that is straight up wrong and they have no respect. Secondly, thank you for being open and visible, people like you help others to feel comfortable and safe in their bodies. And lastly you are VALID, you are LOVED and you are a seriously majestic human.
Dear, you look gorgeous, ignore the toxic people!
I'm so sorry you have to experience that sort of online abuse and harassment. No one should have to.

You keep doing you, no matter how hard they try to bring you down. You're someone that goes against whatever the hell they believe in and live outside of the box they think you belong in. People lash out at others because the internet allows for no real repercussions for online bullying.

Don't worry about them. You're living your best life while they go about their little insignificant lives and that bothers them. You look amazing. You're stylish. You're strong. You got this.I'm here if you need to talk.

p.s ur hair is amazing <3
I'm so sorry they're treating you like that. You look so cool and stunning, body hair and all. You have such a cool style, I really love that shirt.
Don’t be ashamed of having body hair. Everyone has it whether they like it or not. Don’t let the cis hets make you feel bad about being yourself you gorgeous bean
You are gorgeous. Let them be upset about how you don’t fit into a box.
Fuck them, your fly af
You are always valid as you are, and should be able to be comfy in your body!! Come for good vibes whenever and as often as you need to avoid the haters! ❤ sending oodles of positivity ✌
they are such idiots and u are amazing!!! your body hair is beautiful and so are your pronouns. stand by you ❤❤
you look so good
(1) You are honestly a striking human being
(2) Your andro vibes are giving me major inspiration
(3) Nobody knows your body better than you do
(4) Bullying and cut downs are far and away most often an attempt at reactive control because on some level these people feel threatened 
(5) I hope you’re having a good day and my DMs are here for you if you aren’t 🖤
By god you’re handsome 🌻
You look amazing!! Walk away from the haters and don’t look back!
listen to me! you are beautiful just the way you are and nobody has a say in it. if you are worried go to somebody you trust and that you are out to and ask them for help.you are loved and people care about you. live your life baby!
You look awesome. I am jelly!

Also, you looking awesome has nothing to do with your not deserving bullying, no one deserves that. If ever you were to look in the mirror and not like what what you see, you'd still deserve all the good things :)
You look amazing!
I wished I looked like you. You are awesome and your body is yours. Don't let those haters get to you.
You look absolutely wonderful and I'm sorry those ppl are giving you trouble
Fuck the haters! You are fabulous and valid!             💛🤍💜🖤

So happy for you dude! That’s awesome on all accounts!
Agreed! I grew it myself ☺️
Your username is just 😗👌🏻
Thanks! I got it from my mom!
THANK YOU!!
It’s been so hard. I live in Indiana, and nobody even cares about inclusivity here. Correcting people is literally met with eye rolls. I sent an angry email (my NB bud looked over it first and helped make it a lil less feisty) to my boss, her boss and HR. It was very well-received, but now they have to act on their words.
They/them :)
Truly! And my scathing (but controlled) email was well-received!
Ayee thanks ! Ngl I'm surprised it wasn't taken already, its an alternate title to ""dad rock""
Happy it was well received, but wish it was already in place of respecting everyone & their pronouns! My work is more ~liberal~ but I still have to fight for my pronouns to be respected, their solution was to add pronouns in people’s bios yet still end up misgendering me! 🙄 

Oh yeah her pronouns are they/he, please respect her!!! 🙄
Oh, damn! I’m really really glad to hear that. Great news!
That’s amazing. I can’t wait to tell my partner.
OMG that makes my blood boil
It was wins all-around! But currently dealing with the emotional fallout that led to me sending the email. I knew it was coming... just didn’t know when. People really don’t understand the pain that comes with continuously being invalidated through misgendering etc.
They really, really don’t. You’re absolutely right. And they’re usually so privileged that they don’t want to understand, either. Hopefully the fallout is manageable and everyone comes out the other side for the better. Best of luck to you!!"	mr3ouf	NonBinary	851	1.0	2021-04-15 00:23:33
My boyfriend constantly misgenders me and argues with me on trans/ non-binary issues. I don’t know how to explain to him.	He even refuses to Google any of the terms I use and it feels like talking to a brick wall. I love him but he feels like he is purposely trying to do this to get me upset and trying to force me into the mold. I’ve tried time and time again to explain to him how I feel and how this affects me.  I don’t know what to say anymore, he tells me he loves me and then he pulls this and I don’t know how to feel. Not to mention half of my friend group misgender me it’s just feeling like a mess.	"You don't, he's wilfully ignorant.

He's shown he doesn't respect you, he doesn't love you, so you need to consider why you're with him.
Baby you don't explain yourself you leave him
dont be involved with people who show you no respect. break up
The solution to the problem isn't explaining. People can respect you even if they don't understand you.

Just because he loves you doesn't mean it's selfless or that he's even got your best interest in mind. Love is just a feeling -- for that feeling of love to make a healthy relationship, there needs to be an aspect of altruism and willing to change behaviour for the better of both people. You've already done enough by letting him know his behaviour is damaging you, you probably have tried to help him and make it easier for him. You aren't responsible for his actions.

It's very sad that he's willing to risk destroying the relationship and you for this.
I'm sorry you're going through this. you deserve to be surround by people who respect your wishes. it sounds like you've done all you can. you might try one last time to make it clear, to both your friends and boyfriend, that this is important to you, but at least with the bf it sounds like it won't make a difference. you deserve to be around people who bring you peace rather than distress.
*time to get a new partner*
throw the whole boyfriend out.
I'm sorry, this sounds super stressful. Someone who loves you wont try to make you upset on purpose and wont misgender you even if they dont fully ""get it"".
If someone who claims to love you consistently pushes you back into a mold for their own comfort, it’s rather likely that they are more in love with their own comfort than they are with you. That’s a really sad and scary place to be, but you do not need to abide or allow it. 

Setting clear boundaries, communicating your intent and clarifying that this is make-or-break for you might well be a hard conversation to have in the coming days. This man doesn’t get to push you into a binary for his own comfort; that’s wrong, and at the very least it’s terribly unsupportive of you and who you feel yourself to be. 

…. also, I might be reading more into it than there is here, but if someone is intentionally trying to upset you to push you back into a gender binary, that fuels fairly abusive and gaslighty. Those would be big ol’ red flags to me.
Break. Up. With. Him.
Sounds like you need a new boyfriend (or no boyfriend) and new friends. Why surround yourself with people who constantly disrespect your very existence? Because they say they care? Their actions say differently.
He doesn't respect you and/or he has a religious/political agenda that he feels is more important than you.  I'm sorry :(
Your relationship will end. It is your choice how soon. I would recommend sooner rather than later. His behavior indicates much broader problems, such as a lack of respect for your general happiness and well-being.
You're on a subreddit full of non-binary folks who love you and support you.

Dump him, date one of the nearly 200,000 of us on here, frankly.
Honestly, he's being an asshole and it's transphobic behaviour. After the first coming-out and explanation, it is not your job to continue finding ways to explain to him. We get enough shame, doubt and misgendering by the outside world you shouldn't have to experience this at home as well, somewhere that you HAVE THE RIGHT to feel safest and most seen. I would ultimatum him -- he can either respect you and SEE the real you, or GTFO. For your friends, I'd give a few more ""hey would you mind using my proper pronoun"" reminders (because they don't necessarily live with you and see you every day), but you can set the same expectation of them as well -- ""look, I've asked you enough times to please respect who I am... etc""

You deserve better on both fronts
It's time to part ways..
This is where you firmly and consistently set and keep boundaries. Make it known like ""Hey when you say/do ______ it makes me feel _______.  if you do this again we can not and will not be together."" AND THEN THE HARD PART keep that boundary. Of they say/ do the action again its on you to walk away. No explanation no bartering no going back and forth. Just a ""because of your actions this situation is not one I wish to be in."" And cut all contact and ties. Does not matter if it's someone you consider a friend or a partner.
As someone who's been in a similar position, end it. You need to be able to be yourself, and be respected. Take care of yourself 💚
You don't dear. You dump him. That's shows so much disrespectful to your person.
Dump him. Don’t date someone who is willing to disrespect you.
Dump him. You deserve better than that
Red flags. You need to leave this person, now.
I’m so sorry. Honestly, it sounds like he doesn’t love *you*, he loves the person he wants you to be. You deserve someone who loves you are who you are.
As the saying goes, when people show you who they are - believe them.

He has shown you how he really feels about your identity, and about trans and non binary issues in general. He has shown you that what he loves is his idea of how you could be, not who you are.

You could either just leave him; or you could give him an ultimatum - make sustainable changes in these areas or you leave. Personally I think I'd go for the first.
I'm terribly sorry to say this so bluntly but your boyfriend is a jerk, so is half your friends. It literally takes no effort to address someone by their gender. I've been there, done that. Dropped anyone who didn't respect me and let me tell you something .... IT GETS BETTER.

I have a boyfriend who doesn't misgender me, I have a friend group that doesn't misgender me, that is how it should be because they all love and respect me. Shit even some of my coworkers address me as they/them.

I love and respect you, though. You deserve SO MUCH BETTER. When you feel that love from people who accept you as you are, you will not settle for anything less and let me tell you, sugar, you deserve to be treated well and respectfully.
Oof. My ex wasn’t accepting of my identity, but he at least did the research. Maybe this is a jump, but if he’s willing to act this way about something so important to you, there is a chance it won’t even stop at that. This is a part of you. Your partner should accept all of you, even the bad parts (not that this is ofc). I don’t mean accept in like a toxic way, he doesn’t have to agree with everything you do/say.  Just that he should take the time to try to understand you for who you are.  
Also I think it would help to reach out to people in the LGBT community near you if you can. Depending on your age and where you are that would look differently. Most of my family misgenders me so it makes it hard to be around them, but thankfully I have friends and a partner who accept me the way I am. I know it’s scary, but you’re not alone. I wish you the best!
Listen, the man can't love you while denying a fundamental truth about your basic existence. Dump him and any friend who doesn't respect you and your pronouns. Get better people in your life. You deserve it.
Break up with your bf and friends
A lot of people here are saying he can't love you if he treats you so badly. This is incorrect. He might love you but you should still leave him. Loving someone should mean that we respect them and treat them how they wish to be treated but that's not the case. People love each other and do awful things anyway. Love is not enough. You should leave him. I don't want your situation so set yourself up to leave. Start making new queer friends too. You don't deserve this.
Your boyfriend sounds like a genuinely bigoted and emotionally manipulative person. You absolutely deserve better. He’s not worth your time.
He likes his fantasies more than he likes you, DUMP HIM
I would leave him or put your foot down. If he cant give you the bare minimum of referring to you how you want to be referred to as well as not educating himself then he doesn't deserve you. I would also consider giving your friends the same treatment.

Everyone deserves more than the bare minimum and it's an insult to get less than that.
Alexa, play Get Another Boyfriend by the Backstreet Boys
I am so sorry, but he doesn't love who you really are, he loves the version of you he has created in his head.
You cannot love someone you do not respect. If you don't listen to someone when they tell you what's important to them, then you don't respect them.

From what you've said here, he does not listen to you, he does not care to know what's important to you, and he absolutely does not respect you. So why keep trying? I suppose you could lay it out for him, that he clearly doesn't respect you so how could he possibly actually care about the real you and therefore love you. But it's not likely to change anything. That being said, sometimes it can be important to say these things for yourself. After a bad break up I *needed* to tell him what he did wrong, not because I thought he could or ever would change, not because I hoped to get back together, but because I needed to put it out there how shitty he was. The safer way to do that is to write a letter that you never intend to send (burning is a good option to put those thoughts ""out there"").

You know your situation better than we do. But from what you've described, your boyfriend does not currently love you for who you really are
He's telling you he loves you but not showing he loves you by his actions!
Talk is cheap 
He needs to learn, it takes time and effort, as it did with my partner.
You are worth the effort!
I have made this mistake before with my ex before I realized I was non-binary myself as I honestly didn't understand it at all as I was never really exposed to what non-binary was. We worked things out and we dated for a while after that. 

So what I'm trying to say is if they love you, they would be willing to accept you for you and respect you. Misgendering you and arguing with you about it just shows they don't care as much for you but for how you look which is not what you want. You want someone who cares for you. If it was me I'd end the relationship which is what my ex was going to do before we had a very long talk about it which I took to heart which your bf seems to be unwilling to do.
I hate to say this, but this doesn't sound like someone who is going to remain your boyfriend.

Love is blinding, we have good histories or want to see the best in the people we feel for. But the fact is you and the trans community are not getting any respect from him, and respect pretty fundamental in any good relationship.

If he loves you, that means respecting you. If he loves you, that means *not* being completely flippant and disrespectful towards who you are and others like you. It sounds like you have tried exhaustively to educate him, so you may be past the point of ultimatum. Cuz the only thing I could recommend in the ""fix relationship"" route is an ultimatum to wise up or you're out. You know your relationship best, but to outsider me this sounds like you should already be out.

If it has to go that way, you might feel bad for a while. You might miss him or feel lonesome or think maybe he might change now. Maybe he will someday. But for you, there will be others. The heart is resilient, you will find others who make you feel whole and happy, and all while giving you the respect you need. Don't ever settle for less.
Look, no amount of facts about trans people will ever chabge his mind. I think your strongest tool to make him understand is telling him how his actions make you feel. 

Tell him every time he misgenders you, you feel bad and shitty and all the rest that I am sure you know better than anyone. Even if he doesnt understand, the bare minimum has to be him at least havinf empathy for you.
Why do you want to be in a relationship like this?
Just dump him.
Why are you with him?
Cut contact with him and those ""friends"". If they cannot respect you in such a simple subject then they don't deserve you.
This sounds incredibly harsh and obviously it’s outside a point of view, but he doesn’t sound like a very supportive boyfriend and maybe you should just leave if it’s safe to do so it sounds really hard for you and I wouldn’t like to put up with it if it were me
This is absolutely NOT a description of a boyfriend. This is an abuser. Throw him out
I know this is hard, but if he doesn't respect you and your choices, I think you should leave him. Your identity comes first, and no one gets to stand in the way of that!
He doesn’t want to try. He’s not doing this by accident. 


My husband, among the straightest and cisest of people I know, proudly proclaimed to his family once before we were married that I was ‘binary’ - he’s got the spirit for sure, even if the terms might be wrong. He’s excited for me. I feel the love and respect from him and he shows it to me. His love and joy for me shines even though he’s never really been in queer circles, so a lot of this is new to him. He’s a thoroughly decent human being and ya know what? That should be normal. 


Like ok, not all relationships can survive someone coming out, but for the love of god arguing with you and wilfully misgendering you? You deserve better! If he’s really not willing to even try, and he continues to argue with you about it, is he ever going to change his mind? If no, is that someone you want to spend any time with?


Best of luck, honestly this whole situation is so difficult. I’m so sorry you’re going through this
Drop that mofo. You deserve someone who will RESPECT you. Even if they don't understand. And will do the research. Damnit. Sounds like I've done more research on the Sonic games my boyfriend likes than this man has done into being able to respect your identify.
The bar is in hell.
Dump him
Oof I'm sorry. He's definitely not the one for you.
He doesn't truly love you if he doesn't respect you enough to care
Dump his ass
Agreeing with others here that see the writing on the wall.. he doesn’t actually love YOU. Maybe he’s trying to still love a version of you from the past or a version of you that he wants to exist, but it doesn’t sound like either of those scenarios are the real you. I think you’re totally valid to leave him. He’s shown you who he is and how he shows you emotionally. It’s your responsibility to choose better. It’s not your responsibility to teach him basic human acceptance. You can’t make him change. But you can find other people who are the change that you want to see in your life. 💜
You can't talk to someone who won't listen, just like everyone here has said, he doss not respect you or value your mental well-being. You need to have a serious sit down conversation where you tell him whats going to happen, he either respects your identity or the relationship is over, if he tries to argue with you or guilt trip you DO NOT give in. You stand firm and tell him that this will not be negotiable. I understand that it would be really difficult, trust me i know, i had to cut my parents out for this same reason. You can do this though
Time to kick that dewche to the curb, seems like.
Seriously, ask him if he still considers himself straight, and if the answer is anything other than an INSTANT ""of course not, I'm with you"", *move. on*.
This is textbook emotional abuse. You don't deserve this - you deserve so much better. The hardest thing about getting out of an abusive relationship is that you may never stop loving the person who is hurting you but at a certain point you have to choose yourself. 

Good luck, and stay safe ❤️
If he loved you, he'd accept you as you are.
get rid of him. thats all im gonna say.
Like others have probably said; sounds like you're being manipulated, time to consider the options and tell all involved parties. Please seek the company of humans and non-humans responsibly following this (not saying you didn't, but I do know sometimes we don't know what's going on till someone says something).
People will respect you even if they don't understand, they just need to put in the effort, he nor your friend group seems to be putting in that effort.

Ex of 3 years was constantly in arguments with me a out this stuff, I have a trans little brother and he just refused to accept him, no matter the amount of explanations and time.

Now my bf of all of a week accepts that I'm questioning if I'm non binary and vibes with my little brother even tho he doesn't fully get either.

Some people simply won't respect you no matter what and it's not your job to fight for them to change, its to find people who will respect you without u having to beg them.
He's not trying. You deserve better.
You need to make queer friends, everyone around you sounds like they suck.
The bottom line like many of these comments is that he doesn’t respect you. Respect is the basic non negotiable foundation of any relationship. Leave him!
There is no magical phrase you can say to get him to care about your feelings. You don't need to understand something to respect other's feelings. I absolutely do not understand people's love of professional football but I'm not going to go up to someone in an Eagles football jersey and tell them their team is stupid and they should just accept that they should be a hockey fan like they were meant to be. 

You have told him how this makes you feel. He is choosing to act like this. When people show you who they are, believe them.
You can’t fix this with explanations. You should not be forced to argue about your own existence and validity. I understand that it is very hard but you need to dump his ass and find someone supportive who’ll love you for who you are
That man is no longer your boyfriend. Tell him he either has to take you seriously or get out. His respect for you is missing.
That's the neat part, you don't. Otherwise, break up with him.
And why is he your boyfriend again?
My parents are like this, but I just ignore it because there's no point in fighting a brick wall in the first place. However, I do recommend you make it clear to your friends how you would like to be gendered. If you get lucky your boyfriend will either realise that he's the only one who misgenders you and fold to peer pressure or your friends will talk to him about it.
Don't, just run
""he is purposely trying to do this to get me upset ""

You love this man? You don't love you? 

What would you advice your best friend to do if their boyfriend was not on their side? Do that...
The magic words are: ""I'm breaking up with you""

Seriously if he upsets you on purpose he does not respect you. He is not worth it.
Dump him. Then he can identify as an ex. Stop trying to explain. He doesn't care.
As a mental health professional and therapist, my advice is put things together to break off the relationship. It doesn’t matter how much he claims he “loves you”. People that love you don’t do things to purposefully hurt you and refuse to work with you on something that matters so much. The fact that he won’t even do research and stuff shows me he’s using your relationship and “love” as a way to control you.
throw the whole entire man away
This sounds like abuse to me - doing something shitty and disrespectful, violating your boundaries and not honoring who you are; then saying ""I love you"" and making up, but then doing shitty thing again. That fits very much into a cycle of abuse.  


You deserve so much more than this prick who doesn't respect you. Please care for yourself and get out <3
Run.
This isn’t true love. Someone committed to misunderstanding you and not respecting your gender identity only likes your for what they want you to be, not who you are. Dump him, you can do better.
[removed]
I don’t know how to say this (autism is a bitch sometimes). But were the two of you together before you came out as NB? He says he loves you but I’m wondering if he loves an idea of you that he deems socially acceptable. 

Regardless, you deserve someone who loves you wholeheartedly. You should never have to hide a part of yourself from someone who says they love you. I’m sorry and I hope you find the strength to leave.
My friend.

Throw the whole man in the trash.

One of the BASIC fundamentals in a relationship is communication that goes both ways. This is healthy and normal. If someone is refusing to do even a basic task like that for you, that requires almost no effort. Is he really worth keeping? How can someone love you and put you in destress? You have to take your own value into account here. He's misgendering you and will keep doing so. You're worth more than that.
Ditch him :p
He does not respect you love
I know that it isn't always easy, but I am 100% certain that you should leave him.
looks like your bf and half your friend group need to GTFO of your life
Um. Are you sure you love him? Doesn't sound like he loves you or respects you.
Please update this post saying you dumped his stupid ass. The man is transphobic. He doesn't respect you. He doesn't care about you. He doesn't love you. It'll hurt now when you gotta break up with him, but in a week, a month, a year? You'll be so glad you did. That you didn't waste another day of your life feeling bad about yourself and who you are. You're a beautiful and amazing non-binary person and you don't need to be worrying over some dollarstore piece of shit bigot. He was goddamn *lucky* to be ever dating someone as wonderful as you when you're so far out of his league. The absolute loser can't even see how blessed he was and he fucked it all up. Now it's time for you to kick him to the curb. Get him the hell out of your life and go be happy being you. Being single and comfortable with yourself is *always* better than being trapped in a relationship and miserable. You don't ever need to explain yourself. You are valid as a non-binary person and anyone who doesn't respect that is not worth a second of your time. You deserve to be happy.
You.Deserve.Better.🖤
It’s not your job to educate him. Move on and save yourself a lot of wasted time.
you shouldn't have to explain anything, he should accept you as you are. it definitely shouldn't be a fight.
you're gonna put those boundaries and find new people who will respect them
Look, I've had people I was close to treat me this way and it's not worth it. They don't care about you or respect you, if they did they'd support you. Your life will be better off without those people in it. You deserve someone who treats you well.
i used to think people close to me did this by mistake and they were just clueless, but really they are just pretending to be clueless. he knows how much it hurts you.
Dump his ass
Love is an action. He is showing you he doesn’t love you. Leave him, he will not change.
Leave him. I was there. It’s not worth it he doesn’t love you he won’t change.
This doesn’t sound like a good relationship
echoing what so many people are saying - please leave. 

been there and it’s heart wrenching. You don’t need that.
Fuck him, fuck them. Everyone deserves to feel respected in their relationships
Four words: Get out of there. If he isn't going to accept you, he doesn't deserve you, end of story.
Throw the whole boyfriend straight into the trash.
Dump his ass right now. Fuck that shit
he doesn’t love you, he loves what he wants you to be
Start misgendering him and if he gets pissed, maybe he’d get the point

If that doesn’t work, leave him cuz he shows he doesn’t respect you
Breakup. The key aspect of “boyfriend” is FRIEND. And he is being a terrible friend.
BEEN THERE, GTFO!!!
Get you a partner who actually respects you and dump his willfully ignorant ass
Find a new boyfriend
Honestly, dump him. That guy doesn't respect you and hence isn't worth your time.
Do you think he may just be struggling to accept it? He may be very attached to a flawed concept of who you are, and this may be the selfish byproduct of that.
If he loved you, he would hear what you have to say about how you feel he is treating you over your identity. If he isn't willing to treat you with basic dignity, then he is not worth staying with. While some may mock me for saying this, what he is doing *is* abusive.

Remember, they are *NOT* your preferred pronouns. They are your pronouns. He can either use the right ones or he can just not refer to you at all. And the same goes for the people who lie about being your friends. If they know you don't go by what they are calling you and they aren't even *trying* to get it right... They can piss off.

And if they don't get why it's such a big deal, you can always take the nuclear route with those individuals by telling them they have a choice: stop misgendering you or you'll start misgendering them until they get the message. And take it to an extreme. Go out of your way to start calling the guys ""Miss"" and gals ""Mister"" *constantly* as a substitute for any time you could possibly use their name.

And if they get upset with you for that, ask them how they think you feel having endured it for so long with, by this point, equal if not greater malice. Because make no mistake, when a person refuses to change bad behavior, that *is* malice. Ignorance and malice are not mutually exclusive.
My ex bf couldn’t comprehend the idea of me being non-binary. We didn’t last long after my self discovery.
I knew he loved me, the version of me who only displayed their feminine side. As a cosplayer I only have male character cosplays, every time I’d try kissing him while being dressed up as a male chara he’d push me away telling me it’d feel gay because I don’t look like a girl 😂
I kinda knew we won’t last after he pulled this first but it wasn’t the only friction between us. We were dating for 11 years I was engaged to him for a year and I had to break it off 4 years passed and although I’m still single, I’m also a lot happier.
I’m still friends with this guy tho because we’re like family and despite this major hiccup he’s a decent person and a great friend. (My main language doesn’t have pronouns so he can’t misgender me 😂)
Hit him with a big stick
I’m sorry you are dealing with this. If he loved you the way he claims he does he would respect you. Break up with him.
dump him
Speaking from experience just dump him. My ex was like that about my sexuality and it seriously was not worth the mental/emotional trauma. Ditch the ""friends"" that are misgendering you too (if they aren't willing to learn or try it's not worth the effort).
This doesn't sound healthy to be in. Honestly either he respects you or you leave. Shouldn't give someone the option of disrespect without consequences. You can't let someone walk on you like that, it's abusive and not good for anyone.  

Hoping for the best for you
He loves an image of you he has and it is different than the new one you are trying to paint for him.

Doesn’t mean that can’t change but if things continue this way you are in for some hard and painful times.
Put glass in his cereal :/ he’s garbage
Dump👏🏻him👏🏻
Tell him to kick rocks
Dump him
He’s gotta go.
Coming from someone who might be normal... I think showing enough compassion to at least humor you is the bare minimum of being a *friend*.  

If something your friend does hurt you... and it doesn't cost much to relieve the pain and you let them know about it.. then that's basically a toxic relationship.  It's time to branch out to more people who are open to your identity.  

This gender thing is relevantly new and it will take time to get on board and to accept it.

I believe relationships are about compromises.. and I don't think pronoun counts as a big one.  .. in fact, it's insignificant.  

Personally, I don't care about which pronounce people use on me... but this isn't about me and my lack of feelings, it's about your feelings.  I believe you want to be around people who make you feel like you're worth having as a friend and give you some respect in regard to this new and different thing.
it's clear how much you love him from how much work you've done trying to help him treat you better. unfortunately, he doesn't seem to be reciprocating that work. you can't convince someone to treat you well; either they want to, or they don't. it sounds like he doesn't. I know it's scary & hurts, but I think you should throw out the entire boyfriend.
you deserve someone who actually values and care for you, hes not worth it
You're dating a transphobe? Wtf
My egg started cracking like a month after I got married. My new husband flat out refused to use they/them pronouns (at that time I was just politely asking to try them out). I should have left him then. Fast forward two miserable years I was filing for divorce, another two years later I'm finally starting to live my truth and wish I didn't waste so much time on him and similar men. Granted, in my situation I wasn't exactly ready to accept myself as trans yet, if you are then why are you with someone who isn't?
I'm sorry you're experiencing this, you don't deserve this. Your attempts at educating him and your friends is only half the battle, they have to willingly learn and try. Def lean on this community for help and comfort!
>he feels like he is purposely trying to do this to get me upset and trying to force me into the mold.

Yes. This is almost definitely what it is.
I’m sorry, that’s terrible. 🙁

Maybe you should break up over this, but you might want to first ask him about his feelings and motives. Why is he acting this way? I can imagine that he might have some complicated feelings about losing his monogender partner, or what it says about his own monosexual orientation if he loves a nonbinary person.

He’s probably not the right guy for you, but there might be room for more mutual understanding as you two disentangle.
Wake up and break up. He doesn't respect you. If he did he'd make an effort to learn. He isn't. You can stay with him and be miserable, or leave and find someone who will accept you for you.
My partner recently came out as nonbinary, and while it's been a struggle for me to understand and adjust at times, I can't imagine not putting in the effort to give them the most basic respect regarding their own identity. You're who you are and deserve to be recognized as such. Time for a serious heart-to-heart with him to see if this is something he feels he can learn to accept and celebrate, or if he can't picture a future with a partner who does not ""fit"" into whatever binary gender he is attracted to.
no. that's not acceptable behavior for someone who is supposed to love you. sit him down and tell him he needs to shape up. If not, consider leaving the relationship. Strongly consider.
leave him
Break up with him lol
He doesn’t love you. He views you as an object to be fixed. Leave him. Now. Before he does any more damage.
I know its difficult to hear this because you love him but if he cant accept you for you, its not meant to be.

Dont live your life with someone who chases what you used to be. You are the you of the present. The past is dead.
He chooses to be a toxic influence in your life, you should look to remove toxicity from your life.
T4T is the answer
You explain it to him by leaving him. That’s all he need to know about the community, we don’t want to deal with his nonsense.
Explain to him by dumping his ass
Uh. I'm not going to tell you how to live your life, but I would think that intentionally and repeatedly insulting you on such a cornerstone issue would be grounds for discussion of the relationship.

There's a barrel minimum of respect one should be able to expect from a partner and you're not getting it. This flag could not be more red if it were neon, on fire, and literally growing out of Rupert Grint's head.
This 10x. Don’t let his man disrespect you. Love yourself.
If he loves you enough to be your life long partner then he would listen and respect your feelings. He does not thus he is not worth it. I would suggest telling him he is driving you away by not respecting your gender and pronouns and give him an ultimatum and follow through with the consequences. It may be scary but you may need to start preparing to move away from him. I would also tell your friends that you are giving him an ultimatum. This is not directly giving your friends the ultimatum. But it Will make it Clear you are serious about your gender and being respected with the correct pronouns. Do 👏 Not 👏 Let 👏 Anyone 👏 Guilt 👏 You 👏 Into 👏 Backing 👏 Down 👏!!! You are worth more than that!!!!
Exactly, my bf would never purposefully misgender me but he still does not understand because he has never experienced being outside the binary but the difference is he fucking loves me and respects me
Yeah to boyfriend, no to friends. If these friends are trying but get it wrong a lot of the time٫ that's excusable. Obviously it's tough to hear٫ but life is tough. If they are trying٫ and take it seriously when they realize they made a mistake٫ keep them around. One needs friends much more than a SO and these ones don't seem to be fully at fault. Being misgendered is one of the unfortunate struggles of being non binary. Just gently correct and discuss. Be open.  And break up with your boyfriend٫ he sounds like a willfully ignorant bitch.
Cant upvote this enough!
I’m rather young but an adult. It’s like my fist serious relationship so this hurts even more. I’m going to listen to the advice given to me from the lovely people here who even though made me cry again, made me feel so much better and accepted. I can’t thank you all enough for the support. I’ll be talking to him privately soon.
^True. Love alone isn't enough, it requires ACTION.
Alexa, play Bleed by Anna Nalick 

""Well it's been almost a year to the moment/
When I finally realized it was over/
And I knew that love wasn't good enough of a reason for me to stay""
Okay but transphobia ARE wrong for how they feel and I’m not sorry about it. If you don’t support non binary people get off this subreddit and sure as hell don’t reply to this. And don’t say you’re not against non binary people because if you’re on his side you clearly are.
It’s also worth noting that the worst case scenario here isn’t a breakup. 

The worst case scenario is never breaking up, and having to live with this pain/judgment for the rest of your life. 

Frankly? Even if it’s just another year or two of carrying this pain, or even a month, that’s so much worse than the relatively-short period of heartbreak you’ll feel following a breakup. 

Plus, like… it’s hard to see it this way, but it’s better for him too. If he doesn’t want to be with a non-binary/gender queer person, then both you and him need to have the confidence that he’ll find someone else. 

We often think of breakups as an act of cruelty, but that’s wrong. Trusting that this individual you love has enough value to be loved again? That’s truly an act of love and compassion - and if you prolong a breakup, you may be hindering them from finding something where they can be truly happy. 

Above all else, please be kind to yourself, and respect your limited time on Earth. There are ways to break up with someone and keep their friendship. There’s no way that pretending to be happy will ever lead to being truly happy.
I will clarify too -- this does not have to be an ultimatum. This could easily be a boundary, and should be one tbh. ""I deserve to feel safe, accepted and supported in my life and especially in this relationship. When I am misgendered, it makes me feel xyz. I'm unwilling to continue to be in a relationship where my identity is not respected. This is a firm boundary for me."" And if he continues to disrespect your identity, you have made your boundary explicitly clear, and you should leave.
This 100%

My husband also doesn't really understand the whole nonbinary thing. We're both on the spectrum and for him the psychological not matching biology stuff doesn't make sense. But he does his absolute best to not misgender me. If I'm having a day were I'm feeling more masc than fem he'll use masc pet names for me cause he knows I might be more comfortable with them. He asks me what terms I'd rather him use for me instead of assuming the fem ones are right.

The point is even someone who doesn't get the whole being nonbinary thing is still capable of respecting you and your identity.

He's choosing not to, and I'm sorry to say but you likely won't be able to change that.
I was also in my first relationship! He at one point acted like I had trapped him?? Into dating a non-binary person. He didn’t want me to meet his family, I literally had to pee outside bc he didn’t wanna let me inside the house he shared w his family. He was 25 haha. Love is a powerful feeling, don’t let the fact that you feel like you should be together, make u stay with him.
This x20
The grieving of a relationship that may already be lost is temporary. 

The damage of gaslighting and disregard for one's own needs can last a lifetime.

Staying with someone you've invested feelings into who is not or no longer invested in You is self-harm. An ultimatum is necessary at this point, and so is keeping the promise to leave if things don't improve.
Much cleaner follow up
This is really good advice for communicating something that is introducing a problem in a relationship.
That is an ultimatum though...
[removed]
X30
Cut that bitch out and let them deal with their loss. Don't be afraid of cutting people out that don't deserve respect
I see what you’re saying, because offering an ultimatum seems like a kindness. It feels like the fair thing to do - especially when you feel like you “owe” your partner something. 

That said, as someone who has given this same ultimatum, and regretted it?…

If you have to threaten someone for them to respect your pronouns, that’s not true respect. 

A partner should use your proper pronouns because they want to respect you, understand you, and show their appreciation for how you’ve invited them get to know you better. 

When it comes down to it, sharing your pronouns communicates, “I trust you with these. I trust you won’t hurt me, and that you want to know me better.”

An ultimatum is like saying, “You’ve hurt me, and I’m certain you’ll hurt me again unless I give you a threat.” 

As I said, I’ve given the pronoun ultimatum before. I’m infinitely happier now that I’ve found someone who respected my pronouns since day one.
A boundary is a rule you set for yourself to keep yourself safe. An ultimatum is a rule you set for someone else. They can be similar but there are important differences.
Exactly.

Because it's more than ""just a pronoun"". It's a single crucial title for one's authentic identity. Having that ignored or deliberately abused is saying more than ""I don't acknowledge your pronouns"". It's saying ""I don't/won't acknowledge You and what's important to you as important"". 

Offering an ultimatum is less a kindness to the other person and more setting self-respecting boundaries that are non-negotiable.
My ex used my pronouns even when we were breaking up. And we live in a Spanish-speaking country, so almost all the things we say are gendered, andthe respect for others' pronouns isn't so ingrained in the culture.
We were breaking up. And she respected my pronouns. What your partner is doing there is exceedingly disrespectful, for someone who says that loves you.
Yes, and having to state ""if you do this, we are done"" is giving an ultimatum.
Boundaries should be discussed anyway, but having to remind someone like that would be giving them an ultimatum."	yqvy65	NonBinary	841	0.99	2022-11-09 21:21:33
I am leaving my job due to being misgendered 24/7. I’m proud of myself for standing up for myself and prioritizing my mental health. 💗 Decided to celebrate by getting dressed up tonight...		"Those earrings!!! 😍
I left my job for the same reason. F them, you’re going to be better off!
Love the tats! And good for you, I’ve social anxiety so it’ll be hard If thats the case
Just WOW!!!!!!! 😍
GOOD FOR YOU!💗
you look AMAZING!
I like your ink dude. What's your favorite?
Hell yeah! I left my job for the same reason and my new job is validating my gender at a level that I didn't even think was possible. My managers already told me that they would make sure everyone uses my correct pronouns!!
Your eyebrows are killer!
So proud of you!! You’re definitely better off without them.
Love your tattoos! Congrats on doing what's best for you xx
Im jealous. I wish i could. Good luck at the new job.
Love the earrings and tats. Good on you for standing up for yourself. If you ever need someone to talk to, dm me. I will support anyone who needs it.
Very sorry that people suck and couldn’t take the bare minimum to make you feel comfortable. Hope you find a new one that validates you!

Also: HOT DAMN
Those tattoos are amazing
You're both brave and beautiful. Congratulations on being an Icon tbh
Good for you.
thank you! my favorite is my tiger 🐯
That’s awesome! I’m leaving a job where everyone except my managers puts in the effort to gender me correctly. At my new job I can already tell it’s going to be better because my manager even lists his pronouns in his email signature!

Just got misgendered by a cis gay man	I really want to scream i'm in a zoom class room and someone speaking to us misgendered me despite me having my pronouns in my zoom name and him proudly declaring that he's a gay man earlier. I am just soooooooooo sick of cis queer people lmfao idk if i'm being unreasonable but it feels so much worse when a cis gay person misgenders me? or does anything transphobic? like y'all really aren't paying attention, huh	"Omg. My m*nanger is the yaaaass queeniest of white gays and he *always* misgenders my partner. Who is amab. Which doesn’t matter, but apparently it does to HIM. Luckily I use all pronouns and am un-misgenderable 😈 or I’d be fukkin miserable dude
I live in a queer community in a major California city and the difference in how I’ve been treated since coming out (and appearing) from cis gay men was *shocking*. Like, out of their way rude. 

I know it’s not most people but don’t think queer people can’t be clueless about enby/trans. Some openly hate us but this is the safest neighborhood for me so I’m here, dealing.
yoo this happened to me in tHE MENTAL HOSPITAL ?!?!!! this guys would Not stop asking what my partner ""was born as"" and i had to literally be like ?? you wanna know what genitals they have??? and he j kept being like ""haha u know us old people""......... he was 32
[deleted]
A cis gay dude once told me, ""Oh I don't care about pronouns."" And then proceeded to misgender me. It was a great experience!!! :))))
They're the top of the queeriarchy, and want to stay there.
every time I meet new ppl I tell them I'm nonbinary and my pronouns are they/them and they will not hesitate to misgender me IMMEDIATELY
I came out to my cis gay therapist as genderfluid. He didn't judge, but he clearly doesn't really get it, as he, while trying to reassure me, told me one of his patients is a trans man, and he told me his dead name and used feminine pronouns. I was so taken aback by the wording I didn't even think of correcting him until way later. I think some cis people are just clueless. It clearly wasn't malicious, he is actually supportive, but it still made me cringe. 

Remember, y'all, cis white queer men are often the weakest link in the community.
Idk why but usually gay cis man or lesbian cis woman (specially the man) have this feeling of putting others in the community down (and sometimes just so they can get cishet aproval, wich is fucking weird)
It's real ""pulling the ladder up behind you"" energy except they don't seem to realise they can't do that when they haven't yet gotten up the ladder.
I really don’t understand this mindset, if you’re a queer person, why would you treat other queer people like shit?
Welcome to the shit show.  Even the well intentioned cis who you open your heart to will fuck up.  Repeatedly.
I find cis queer (especially white ones) all too eager to throw trans and other gender nonconforming people under the bus because they are afraid of losing the meager progress they’ve made already for themselves. A cis gay white man nowadays loses almost no privilege anymore for being gay and they like that and want to keep it that way.
A lot of gaymen are transphobic af, also feminists lesbians
I've learned to not expect anything from cis white gay men. There is so much sexism, racism, and transphobia in that community. There's a reason why gay trans men feel more comfortable with lesbians than they do with their fellow gay men. It's really sad tbh..
Omg it's so annoying, I'm AFAB, which doesn't matter. Since my pronouns are They/them. But even tho I introduce myself with my pronouns, does anyone use em??? NO! JUST MY FRIENDS! 😭
A cis gay man told me (an enby) non-binary isn't real. To my face.
It's a bit of a misconception that all gay people should be supportive of all other people's issues. 

Generally ALL people should be supportive, but in every group there are closed-minded assholes. 

It's sort of a tough lesson to learn in life cuz you think marginalized groups would be supportive of each other, but that's just not how life works. I work in the nonprofit sector so I really appreciate and value and support and celebrate when marginalized groups support each other, but it just doesn't always happen
Yeah, I always will think of a person in a shirt covered in rainbows and saying ‘good vibes only’ mocking me to my face about using they/them, while she was at work in the customer service world! Dang! She was my best friends co worker and was terrible for months until she finally was fired.

(And was also queer, not just a rainbow shirt lol)
Yeah, you can’t trust cis queers all the time. You’d think they’re more conscious about this stuff but then you realize that, at the end of the day, they’re cis and gender/pronouns is something that they are apathetic about. A lot of them don’t think highly of nonbinary and trans people. It’s really disappointing how much disregard there is within the LGBTQ+ community.
Sick of people thinking just because they belong to one identity/community that they can disrespect other identities/communities. Being gay doesn't give you a pass to be transphobic. I saw Jewish people who thought being Jewish gave them a pass at being racist (saying that as a Jewish person), trans people who thought they have a pass at being misogynistic etc.

I don't GET it. You don't get to hate on people just because people hate on you. Don't disrespect other people especially when you know what it's like being disrespected for the way you were born.
It's why I kinda don't feel immediately safe if I'm in a ""queer space"" irl, there could be terf lesbians, transphobic gay men, ace people who think allosexuals are inferior. I'm queer and the level of judgement and abuse I get from my own community is ridiculous.
The weird part about life is that you can be gay AND sexist...conundrums everywhere
White cis queer ppl are the reason there's so much fragmentation in our collective community and they blame cis het ppl of color for it, welcome to the lgbt :)
sucks when lgbtq people misgender people. there’s a gay guy in my university and he’s also extremely transphobic
I was at a bar waiting for my friends and a group of cis gay men noticed me sitting by myself and invited me to join their table. I told them my pronouns multiple times and I have a full ass beard and they kept calling me she/her. Then asked if I wanted to be a boy so much (I’m non-binary) if I’d be signing up for the draft. As soon as my friends arrived I noped tf out of there
You have every right to be upset and I’m not trying to excuse this person’s mistake.  However, I am a non-binary person who uses they/them pronouns and I occasionally slip up and use the wrong pronouns for my nonbinary roommates.  I make every effort not to do this and am correct probably 97% of the time and always correct myself if I mess up, and I feel terrible every time it happens.  I talked with my gender therapist about this, and she said it’s from the societal conditioning we receive growing up.
Same! Currently doing an online counseling course. And even though my pronouns were in my name, the lecturer still misgendered me. You'd think as a counselor you'd be a bit clued in on not doing that. Made it hard to focus that day. A couple students messaged me privately to be like wtf, so at least I wasn't alone.

It's like we're not apart of the same community like what-
MOOD. I spent all last year's pride getting misgendered by white cis gay man that think the fight is over. It annoys the hell out of me.

I'm fortunate to have some good eggs in my personaly community, but the ""queer"" scene where I live is very much white, cis and gay, with little respect towards trans people.
I came out to a trans woman as non-binary and she said non-binary people are weird and should just “pick one”. Unfortunately even trans people can be transphobic 😪
honestly i’ve stopped trusting monosexuals with my identity, regardless of if they’re a straight man or woman or a gay/lesbian person. i’ll always be she/her to them.
Did you try correcting them or letting them know that you prefer certain pronouns privately if you don't like to have a confrontation publicly?
I work for a NGO that is active in asylum support for LGBT people and in the NGO I'm the only one not cis, but we help a lot of non cis persons as well ofcourse. They struggle with pronouns and gendering people correctly, and it angers me so much
It could be that he just didn't look at your name and didn't mean to be rude
I am struggling so much being mostly attracted to cis men. I wish I was a lesbian they look like they have so much fun 😭
“Sick of cis queer people.” Okay. I was here because I was trying to learn and understand, but I’ll leave.
Yeah no if you are a gender or sexual minority and you are hating on a fellow gender or sexual minority, wether you feel a kinship with them or not, wether you respect their identities or not you’re trash.
OMG what? I'm sorry but im confused... WHO?
I'm glad I found this thread because I feel off about actual LGBT members putting down others in the same community. Like ok, I expect non queer people or conservatives to side eye if they hear ""non binary"" but not our guys.

My bisexual friend didn't know what deadname is (he also asked like ""wtf is deadnaming"") I explained to him and he was all ""are you freaking serious?? People actually cry about names they had most of their life?? Lmao how soft can you be"" which not gonna lie, that actually hurts because he reacted this way and didn't bother to put himself in the place of trans people, especially that he's closeted because of living in a mostly Christian neighborhood. Unfortunately some people, lgbt or not, don't care unless it's their own skin.
Same. Call me ""it"" and these hands are buy one get one free tho lol
Hehe, they have no power over us!!!! 😈
I use he and she pronouns so they have to deliberately use they/them pronouns for me despite the fact that I present as a boy and am amab
Small thing, but the word ""manager"" isn't actually gendered despite how the word appears, it comes from the Latin word 'maneggiare"" which just means to handle/train horses originally, but has been expanded to include people over time obviously. Not important, just a fun thing I found interesting. Also, fuck your manager for misgendering on purpose.
Shit should be considered sexual harassment, that's like asking if ""the carpet matches the drapes."" Like back the fuck off dude, my private parts are none of your fucking business, that REALLY SHOULDN'T NEED TO BE SAID
No fckng way they actually referred to themselves as ""old"" when they're literally les than halfway through the average life expectancy. People are so weird 😭
people are so fucking gross
the icing on the cake was he has his pronouns in his zoom name too lol
Cis dudes are still cis dudes in the end...
[removed]
Bruh if he doesn't care about pronouns then how would using someone's preferred pronouns be an issue
This right here
Okay there’s a lot to unpack here, but I wanted to say: deadname or actual name - it is so NOT AT ALL legal or ethically acceptable for your therapist to be naming other clients to you (or anyone for that matter)!!! I’m sorry that your therapist has a lot to learn as far as gender identity and the like go… I would also be seriously concerned about this egregious disregard for confidentiality.
Find a new therapist. If he’s going around giving personal info about patients, he is not a safe therapist to be around. He can talk about other patients but not in too much detail and absolutely not with their name. For your own safety, switch to a different therapist
I’ve noticed a trend of Cis Gay Dudes especially who love to be THE token gay, and bully other queer people away from their cis/Hetero social circles
It's so fucking odd how people that get the slightest bit of leverage in society just immediately start kicking down on the next oppressed minority. Like really, even they of all people can't expend just a bit of empathy
Especially white cis gay and lesbians
I wouldn’t say “usually”  I’d say some of them do this and the ones that do are a rather vocal minority. This statement you made is kind of a huge generalization. Cis queers are not our enemies.
It’s mostly because they’re afraid of losing the power they have over others
While the LGBTQ+ community is one with a broadly overlapping goal of acquiring equality, in reality that very large group is made up of smaller communities and individuals who may not have any overlapping goals with others in the community at all. On top of that, some have an ""I got mine, you get yours"" mentality when it comes to acceptance and rights, and many are happy to forget that intersectionality is a thing. Most people in the community are not cis gay abled white men, but many people forget that there's more to fight for after that demographic got the rights they were vocal about. Many people forget that there are aspects of queer identity beyond ""gay"" that are important to people.
Nope. Feminism is trans-inclusive. Second-wave ""feminism"" is pretty transphobic and bioessentialist and in many ways not at all feminist in the slightest, but current feminist theory is not. Lesbians who are trans-exclusionary tend to actually not be feminists either, as the flavour of transphobia they adopt flatly denies that non-binary people exist because ""gender isn't real"", disproportionately punishes and polices cis gender non-confirming women for their perceived masculinity while blaming trans women for having to do so, and then immediately turns around and infantilises tomboys and GNC women to protect them from the influences of evil trans men in case we snatch them up and turn them trans.

People who are also feminists are not transphobic, by and large. TERFs are not feminists.
> also feminists lesbians

Huh? I know plenty of transbian feminists who are hardly transphobic. I think you mean TERFs, whose ideology tends to align nicely with that of literal Nazis these days. And, yeah, Nazis aren't big on inclusivity.
I’ve personally had far more experience with allosexual people believing they’re inherently superior to me and other ace folk than the opposite. Occasionally I’ll see the “I don’t have silly sexual attraction distracting me” rhetoric, but it’s almost always from a teenager, and almost always shot down by others in the community. Or it comes from allo folk who misguidedly assume it must be “so nice to not have to worry about that!” 

Not to say that you haven’t experienced that personally, but idk. I don’t think it’s necessarily fair to claim that’s a concern when asexual folk make up SUCH a small percentage of the community, and are often pushed out of queer spaces as “basically straight” or “just trying to be special,” etc. I think my odds of encountering explicit sexual conversations that make me uncomfortable in queer spaces are probably higher than a single allo person being targeted by an ace person in a queer space. 

Also: Allosexual in square quotes concerns me.
Could you explain what is being allosexual please?
I feel this too.
Fr! I did this once to my comrade...

I was hella tired so it absolutely was not on purpose but I had *never* done so before and NGL I think they quit our DSA because of it. 

They looked *hurt*. Sad part is, I think they and I were the only people who even noticed. 

I feel *so* bad. 💔

I do believe people about their identity but when my brain is dumb it 100% goes back to ""masc=he and femme=she"". 

I need to unlearn the gender binary but fuck that's a big one. (It doesn't mean I won't try but Gods it feels so daunting.)
Monosexuals?
>monosexuals
Ah yes, let us further divide the community into us and them. Very good 👍🏻
No, and it's not really the point. I've spent too much of my life correcting people (and plenty suffering in silence too!). I'm tired of cis ppls bs
No he called on my name which he only knew from reading off the zoom list which has my pronouns
it’s not fun to get fetishized by holding hands with another woman
K bye
As a queer person, have you never felt ‘sick of straight people’? I sure as hell have. As an m-spec I’m often sick of monosexuals too even if they are queer. If you are here to listen and learn then do it. I’m cis (more or less) and I wasn’t personally offended by this because I know I’m not like the person they are talking about.
My hands are bisexual.
Ngl I use they/them a ton and by default now.
uj/ Ya wow how dare u not use they you’re just begging to be misgendered snowflake 🙄(/rj) 

(actual uj/ sorry you’re getting this reaction fam it’s bullshit)
Based. If they do we will attack
FACTS and the thing that boggles my nuts the most is the fact that he would make a point tht his main personality trait was being gay and in the lgb(t?) community....
he tried to relate to my mom when she was visiting by saying ""us old folks just cant get these pronouns right haha"" or some shit like that after misgendering me and it was just ????? shes TWENTY YEARS older than u brotherman
I’m 31 and a teacher (so I spend lots of time around people 6-12) and I can assure you:

31 is ancient.
at 32 you do start to feel ""old"" around teenagers
Fucking classic
How woke of him 🙄
Are you a cis gay man? Is so, do you respect people's pronouns?
I am also sorry your therapist has a ways to go in learning about gender identity. 

Honestly, I would find a new therapist who has a better knowledge/understands you better and also just doesn’t straight up violate patient confidentiality.
I live in Mexico, so switching to a different therapist would mean risking more than my name. First off, I can't economically afford a different therapist. Second, my currenttherapist is both a psychiatrist and a licensed therapist, which means I don't need to go to two different people to get my therapy and my medication. And more importantly, I could end up with a homophobic and transphobic therapist. Or someone who says I don't really have adhd. I could end up risking more than I would win. My therapist was my teacher once, and I've built a good rapport with him. I feel comfortable with him and even with him it took me way too long to ask him for a consult because I have social anxiety. Switching therapists is not an option for me. It was also the only time he ever said something about anyone else.
it's like they get theirs and then forget everyone else behind them. tbh i feel like the cis gays called it a day after they got marriage equality...
Just because someone's a minority doesn't mean that they're allies, even to their own demographic. They're just like every other selfish person. Cishet society offers a devil's bargain, and some people are willing to take it.

I think the saddest people are trans people who are transphobic to help them pass, or who want to be cis so badly they take on a cisnormative mindset.
Yep
Sorry, I really put that in the wrong way. What I meant is that when a queer is going agaisn't trans/nb ppl, it's usually them.
Yeah I'm not saying all ace people but it's precisely because they are a minority of a minority that doesnt get alot of attention/social support, can open the door to incel-like behaviour and instead of going to therapy a vocal minority of ace people just create trauma Olympics, gatekeepy echo chambers filled with tons of hate towards people not in their group and even those in their group that dont fit their rigid standards. I've found this with other queer people too. Again not all queer people mainly the ones who lack any maturity or emotional regulation skills which is lots of people in a university or internet environment heck even in my mental health community queer space. Just because they're a minority doesnt mean they won't be dicks and doesnt excuse abuse of any kind from them just because the majority group has life easier. I've also experienced abuse from heteronormative straight people, but had more extreme and radical treatment from the echo chamber circles.
I'm sorry if you felt personally attacked by this if you are sex repulsed or sometimes feel this way yourself. Changed quotations mark allosexuals, mainly included it because it just reminds me of all the times radical reactionary feminists quotation mark men and just throw away all the substantive theory about dismantling the patriarchy and how gender roles also affect men, and just use their twisted form of identification as a way to incite hate and cope with their trauma with amab people in unhealthy ways, like be transphobic or sexist and abusive. But if it causes you concern, I'm willing to change it. I don't really have any problem with ace people, I happen to not be allo at all,  I'm asexual, a trans woman, demiromantic towards all genders, a person of colour, have multiple neurodevelopmental and psychiatric diagnoses. If anything i am more oppressed than many of the middle class white queer people in these spaces yet i dont feel the need to justify my intersectionality, cope with my trauma by hating other people. And to reiterate it isnt all queer/ace people ive found some really kind and validating people in these spaces too. Its just I've spent alot of time in a mix of queer and ace spaces and in either space experienced alot of vocal (predominantly white middle class) minorities that project a hatred of the 'other' and hurts/makes people uncomfortable with it. We shouldn't normalise hatred because all this does is make your social skills and opportunities suffer, no one really likes extremely hateful and reactionary views regardless of how oppressed the person is. Oppression and intersectionality opens the door to express feelings but not to incite hatred and really reactionary behaviour. I've learned this with not only queer people but with the radical politically involved people. It's why I no longer expect minorities to be safe or anyway superior to majorities, the possibility of assholes exists in every group.
People who experience sexual attraction. Opposite of asexual.
I’m guessing in reference to having a sexual attraction that only pertains to one gender (straight, gay, lesbian, etc)
>Monosexuals

I think that means people who are attracted to one and only one gender (e.g. only attracted to men or only attracted to women).
Yeah, i think if we care about things like this. We also need to be outspoken about them because they might not be the main attention of other people. People in general are more involved and busy with themselves. So I understand when people misgender me especially if my presentation isn't very obvious to what my identity is. People just look at visual cues of how we present and try to match a gender to that. 

But I understand where you are coming from and how it can be frustrating.
I had someone who claimed to be a ""linguist"" say that they can only be plural because it was in the past like language doesn't change all the damn time (if they were actually linguist they would know that as well as it being used singularly for hundreds of years)
I get it but I hope that if somebody tells you that they don't use they them pronouns then you will change which pronouns you are using. I do realize I am using they/them pronouns for my hypothetical who does not use they/them pronouns.
Sounds like compensating to me. Like people who insist that they aren't racist because they have black friends
unrelated. i really like the phrase “boggles my nuts”.
The fleshy prison sure does, I guess.
Jesus really revealed it all with the debt forgiveness parable, humans are so bad at it
Which is especially close-minded given that we've now seen how fragile SC rulings can be under future corruption. None of us should stop fighting for each other's right to live until this shit is locked in stone.
Thank you! :)
Yeah, that's correct. Strangely enough I've never met a bisexual, polysexual, pansexual, omnisexual, or other persons attracted to more than one gender that has an issue with pronouns, same with people on the ace and aro spectrums.
But what does that have to do with someone respecting your gender? There are trans lesbians and gays is it not disrespectful to imply we’re more likely to be transphobic bc we are bisexual?
Ik what it means. It doesn’t have anything to do with people respecting your gender.
And actually for longer than singular you. People are often so confused to hear that!
For sure, it costs nothing not to be an ass. I've thought about purposefully miagendering the ""I don't do pronouns"" people and transphobes to see how they like it
it was more the culture shock for me
For me lately, I've gotten the most transphobia from cis pansexual folks. I don't understand it.
I might've noticed something similar. 👀
Could not tell you, tbh. I’m just interpreting
Yeah I don't know what it is, probably just a coincidence."	y7b0lt	NonBinary	766	0.98	2022-10-18 16:02:16
A family member has rampantly misgendered and deadnamed me at 2 events despite people being there using the correct name, so I used their graduation gift to buy binders. They arrived yesterday right in time for the start of Pride month!		"Ayyye recently said fuck it and bought my very first bi, nb, and demisexual flags!! They be arriving later this week and I plan on keeping them in my room for now. I won't be able to hang them up due to homophobic family members but at least I'll have them ready when I'm in a safer place. Now I just gotta work on getting myself some binders : DD
That is iconic. Also great pic and the binder is fantastic!
I LOVE the binder, you look fantastic! I'm so sorry about your family member, you deserve better than that. But good job doing that for you!
They say the best revenge is living well <3
Good job
I conic
I loveeeee this! Good for you :)) Also, this is probably the cutest binder I've ever seen.
And that’s called “fuck you” haha
You are such a legend for this!
Excellent choice! Happy Pride!!
I just bought a rainbow binder too, and I love it so much!

Went to a wedding out of state where I wasn’t out to anyone. I just need someone to call me a handsome guy. Non-binary FTM They/He	Went to a wedding on my partners side. I haven’t come out to any of them yet. It was awful being deadnamed and misgendered and having to wear a dress and makeup. Only his cousin knows and thankfully my partner and his cousin used gender neutral terms. But fuck it was a rough weekend.	"Can you get this jar for me handsome 🫙?

Not being able to be out and being misgendered sucks, I hope you’re taking care of yourself as you bounce your handsome self back from it.
Looking handsome as hell mate.

I’ve done a couple of formal events Masc and it’s always my favorite. Thankfully I have another formal event later this month I’m buying a new outfit for!
Thank you 🥺 I always like to say “I thank my dad for his jaw line and my mom for her legs” 😜
I bet your just as if not more handsome! 
Thank you for the hugs 🥰🥰🖤🖤🖤
Definitely going to have a big cup of tea tonight watch some of my favorite queer media. This week my husband and I are hitting the gay bar too 🥰
Not awkward at all’ 
In both my haircut is about a week plus old. I have super dense hair that grows fast. 
But I usually ask for a trim on top with the clippers. (Not sure what guard length they use) 
For the sides In the second picture I asked for a mid skin fade, the first picture I asked for a low skin fade with a slight drop in the back, and wanted to keep the darkness up top.
It was rough tbh but all together I did have a really fun weekend. The wedding was beautiful and the cake was chocolate which is my favorite 😍
I love it when people say I give daddy vibes cause I’m the biggest bottom ever 😭😭😭
you are SO valid and deserving to be who you are!!!! 🫂 hang in there!!

*TRIGGER WARNING* All I said was I'm tired of reminding people who already know my preferred pronouns to not misgender me.		"Block them immediately. This person and their bigotry is not worth your time or attention. I know it’s easier for a removed party to say that but in the end if someone comes at you with this shit at this level for a comment like that there are deep seeded psychological issues that they won’t address, and they are not worth your time
Lot of self hatred inside this person. Take it easy, friend. I know this stings like hell but you are safe now 💛
Thats gotta be the biggest hypocrite I've seen this month
That was written by a horrible person who hosts horrible feelings. The insults almost feel like projecting, tbh. If this is what they spent their time on, they're the ones who don't have anything to offer to society.
Today I learned that pronouns are gay
holy fucking shit I'm so sorry this happened to you
Sounds like that person has no friends, and no life. Sorry they’re taking it out on you. I care about your pronouns if that helps
This is like, verbatim what my own brain tells me all the time.

Really sorry this person said all that to you OP. I can guarantee you bring a hell of a lot more good into the world than they do.
I'm sorry this happened but also this photo should be marked as spoiler/NSFW so it's blurred and you have to click through to see it. I saw the photo and its content before I saw your title because I'm mostly on subreddits where the post itself is the content and the title is just attribution/metadata/other unnecessary information. And it was very jarring :/
Oh no, those are words I've been thinking lately; fuck them you're beautiful and the world needs you.
Weird that they decided to talk about themselves in the last message...
They are projecting their own insecurities onto you bc that comment is way too specific to be anything but that. Block them and move on.
Define irony.
I Can Guarantee You The Person Who Wrote That Contributes Less To Society Than You Do, And Assuming That's A Representative Sample Of How They Think And Speak, They Definitely Make Life *Far* Worse For Anyone Around Them.
Ugh, transphobic bullying, they can’t even be original. Glad you blocked and reported them, but also take this time to remember that they are the social equivalent of unflavoured pasta and you owe them no mental time!
This person is miserable and most likely hates themself.. sad

People like this have negative worth in life.
They can get fucked, no reason to attack anyone like that.  

You, on the other hand, are loved, welcomed, and deserve life, peace, and love.  I'm sorry you had to experience this, and may you have a many blessings this holiday season!
5 SPaG mistakes. I can’t help but think of a connection between a lack of education and the various -phobes
^Pronouns ^aren't ^gay^, ^they're ^human
Anyone who says stuff like that is a moron. If they genuinely believe that, then they don't care about you. Moreover, they don't actually care about anyone and are incapable of feeling close to another person, because they're too caught up in their own misanthropy to see value in others.

That being said, you valid girl.
Seeing messages like this just makes me think about how I have never, not even once, sent a hostile message with slurs and with the intent to tear down a *stranger* and try to make them feel bad. Whatever ""value"" this person thinks they add to society, such a message demonstrates that they're a net negative due to hate and bigotry, and how it's expressed in such toxic ways.

Even if I actually was a worthless nothing... I'd still be higher on whatever imaginary Social Credit scoreboard this weirdo thinks people are ranked on.
Time to share this behavior with your shared social network so everyone knows what a homophobic piece of shit this person is.
V rough what a dweeb I’m so sorry sweet angel! Hope u have good trans community around u 💖💖💖
I'm so sorry this was said to you, especially unsolicited. you deserve better than this and you should never let someone else's hatred bring you down, you will always be supported and loved here 🤍
you are not alone
Don’t people get bored of caring so much about what other people do? How do your pronouns affect them? If you ask to be called a nickname, would people call you by something that wasn’t that? I don’t understand people sometimes.
\*puts a mirror in front of this person and leaves quietly\*

Seriously, they seem to be talking about themself and their own feeling of futility and uselessness. It's still no time for sympathy though. Block that fucker and forget about them. There's nothing but trouble where this came from.
That person is 100% projecting.

All those things they said are intrusive thoughts they have about themselves.
When someone is that reactionary and aggressive, you have to wonder what they're refusing to deal with internally. And what you're reminding them of in themselves.
One could literally copypaste that last message straight back at them and it would be far more accurate.
Man, fuck what he thinks. All that comes to mind for me is ""You must have heard all of this said to you, too. Id pity you but you're as bad as the person who did this to you.""

Just remember that everyone. This dude is talking like hes all knowing and has his shit on lock. But do you know why he is putting so kuch energy into finding you and hating you? Its because deep down he is severely messed up. Again, I dont pity him because he is making it everyones problem but his own. I just say all this because he deserves to be forgotten and you dont. He is not and will never be above you. His views will always be inferior because he's doing hurtful things and youre just trying to be you.
“No one gives a fuck about your gay pronouns” says person who gives a HUGE fuck about your “gay” pronouns 😂 These people crack me up
this person is obviously not okay. you matter. they… clearly have mental problems and/or an echo chamber of a life because the majority of people do not think that way. you’re cool. fuck them
Mmm that reminds me of a conversation i had recently abt pronouns 
“Jesus didn’t use pronouns”
- “Who?”
“Jesus.. Yk Jesus Christ”
- “Oh I don’t think i know her”
“Him”
- “See you can care about pronouns good job *headpats*•
This person just feels like they're trying to cope with their own insecurities by projecting them onto someone else. There's a reason why people who struggle with feeling confident in their appearance's primary choice of insult is usually 'you're ugly'
You are valid, you matter, and you have a loving community that supports you no matter how you want to identify or present. Your heart is more open to love when you know and accept who you are, and the love you'll find will be deeper, more honest, and more pure.

I pity this person for being so closed off to the world around them. While they're still spitting vitriol, you'll be basking in the warm glow of your friends and chosen family. ❤️🫶❤️🫶
Honeslty if people like this dickbag began to ignore us and pretend we didn't exist we would probably be happier.
Reply to then and say this ‘you’re right. And in fact when I do what you’re saying I’ll staple this message to my forehead and send it to the press and all y socials so everyone knows it’s because you told me to’
Isn’t it sad this person told you how insecure they are? Message back ‘wow this came from the heart. Projection is real. . You matter. You have worth. You don’t make anyone’s lives worse. I was scared too in your position but the love of my community carried me though. I’ll be there to listen when you want to talk’
I'm not a violent person, but $h!t, this makes my blood boil, and do unpleasant things to this git.
OMG! How dare someone say those words to another human being??? They shouldn’t even say such things to an animal. 

And I understand you’re tired of reminding people of your pronouns and tired of being misgendered. In my case it’s gotten so bad I’m just sighing when it happens coz I simply don’t have the energy to always tell them: my name is …, my pronouns are…, don’t ma’am me, and so on and so on. Nothing wrong with stating you’re tired of it. 

Obviously this person felt triggered by you and your identity for some mysterious reason and felt justified saying such awful things. Of course they have no reason to be triggered by you and certainly don’t have the right to say that shit. But if there’s one thing I learnt, it’s this: what they say and do to you says more about them than it says about you. It tells me they’re an awful person I wouldn’t want to hang out with or even talk to. They’re the one with the problem, dear. Not you. Always remember that.
People like this always love to have their words and actions coming back to themselves, as it's the only logical thing to occur with statements this degrading. 

They are still at the starting line of understanding, while you are likely well on your way. We all walk this by ourselves but support is present along the right paths.

Wrong paths hold that classic self centered anger, echo's and destruction. Best to move away from this.
i'm so sorry you had to read this, i hope you push this person away from your life, they don't deserve you or your attention, you're so worthy and valid!!!! you deserve lots of love and care  :(
Fuck I'm so sorry you had to go through this...what a scum
Bet you they have nothing to be proud of so they take their misery out on others
Wow, someone has been brainwashed by capitalism to see value through the lens who ""what can you bring to the table"", sounds like a vary sad, and angry individual.

100% not worth the air they are breathing.

Also, really? Thats the best they had?

We have all heard significantly worse before.

Ignore this lowlife, he will never understand
God damn. How could someone be so hateful to someone who is just living their life? Hey, you are significant, and wanted, and loved, and valuable. They're just terrified of their bigoted worldview being challenged.
I hope you are okay and safe <3 you are valid beyond words
This person is simply toxic and hateful, full stop, no matter what your pronouns are or your gender you’re much better off removing them from your life.
What a sad, sad human. Imagine being this horrible. 
You’ll find your people. This person does not deserve to have you in their life, and you certainly don’t need them in yours.
This is whisper isn't it? A lot of people on that app have problems they need to vent. It's not the best place to go for support.
Fuck that dude all you asked for was common decency
The thing about responses like this is that they don’t really think this about you. This is how they feel about themselves, and when you were brave enough to live as your authentic self, they felt mad and sad that they are not as brave, so they lashed out. This does not excuse the behavior, but I hope it gives you some comfort. You are resilient, you matter, you are in the arena, and this insecure scared person is in the cheap seats. I love you 💖🏳️‍⚧️💖
Aw whisper, a complete and utter shithole
I am sorry mate. Some people are a pain
Fuck them. This is absolute projection. Miserable loser.
Delete this troll....
There's so much self hatred in them they end up projecting. No mentally stable person would say something like this. Just block them.
They have nothing better to do than to harrass people. I know it's hard but ignore them. They aren't worth it
You know what I find interesting? This person is telling you everything about their character, as if this person has a mirror facing them
So full of vitriol. No love, compassion, respect, decency. There are many roses in the world but just too many pricks
This person is going to die forgotten and alone. I'm sorry you had to bear the brunt of their shitty, damaged little ego
Garbage person projecting onto others. Brush them aside.  Don't need that kind of negativity in your life.
this person is projecting and i hope you know everything they said is a nasty lie and you deserve for people to recognize you correctly
Well that’s awful. But also like this person is probably going through a gender crisis themselves and is taking out their confused rage on you. I’m sorry for you
It’s mean but I don’t care, I always drop a no you, uno reverse card or please stop projecting on me before I block and report them.
I'm so sorry this happened to you 😔 Good thing you blocked and reported them. Please don't listen to them, respecting people's pronouns and not misgendering them is a basic kindness and should be normal. Do you need a hug?
I love the ""say something nice"" message the app tries to lead you to, and that this ps of sht has totally ignored (as well as empathy).
I’m so incredibly sorry this horrific bigotry and hatred was directed at you.  They seem to really hate themselves and their life, but I know that doesn’t make it any easier to read something like that - sending you love🫶🏽.  The world is a MUCH better place with your light in it🥺💙
definitely not a friend or a smart person
I’m going to be honest, reading this I audibly gasped at how disgusting what this (pathetic excuse for a) ‘person’ messaged you
Someone is projecting the shit out of here it's unbelieveable
I did block them.  And I reported them for harassment/bullying.
AMEN!!!
Yeah, this person belongs in a 90’s classroom, they’re projecting so hard.
I do love asking these kind of people “and what are you worth?” Just to have them tell me what they think of me by spouting ego-centric bs that totally isn’t how they perceive people who are happier than they are
This right here. That person is projecting their self hatred.
That implies that there are straight and bi pronouns
Yeah I had that voice too. It can be an aftrtimage of what you were told if you were a victim of narcissistic abuse. If youre dealing with that I recommend therapy, maybe Cognitive Behavioral Therapy specifically - or reading up on the techniques involved if you cant afford help. In general you cant just reject or dwstroy that voice, its something you have to kind of transmute through habotuating self love. For me it was a long process but it was worth it.
Thanks for pointing that out.  I fixed it so it's blurred now.
Yeah that really was a surprising and sudden manifestation of hella projection
Forgot to link this video: https://youtu.be/XuFGUVF3lEY

Admittedly, the situation is much lighter in said video. But, it's the same basic line of thought being made fun of.
I hate when people say Jesus didn't use pronouns.  Jesus literally said ""I am he"" at one point, meaning his preferred pronouns were he/him.
10/10 best reaction you could’ve had. You are valid, you’re pronouns and identity are valid, and that person should never have said shit.
PERFECT!!!
Legendary burn. Almost as bad as when you touch that projector near the light spurce lol
It’s giving “I’m not allowed to express myself, so neither are you!!! How dare you!!!”
There are????? Why was I not told about this?
Thank you for the advice, I appreciate it. I have been through a lot of abuse, and I do get therapy for it.
Im glad youre getting help. Its definitely not easy, but I believe that youre on the right path and it can get better for you. Good luck!"	zny41s	NonBinary	753	0.99	2022-12-17 04:32:17
Getting misgendered at the pool & beach <<<		"I'm sorry that's happening!

On the plus side, you look fantastic!
reasons i hate public pools/beaches

1. swimsuits show b o d y shape
2. wedgies
3. my hair gets messed up and looks ***DISGOSTANG***
4. cant wear eyeliner :')
who did i fight
Killer hair colour!
Hair is 💥 and you look great.
I'm surprised anyone talked to you during a pandemic to even be in a situation to misgender you
Awe I know how it feels.
You have the COOLEST hair omg
it’s ok!!! Thank you 💕
Possibly people being rude as hell and talking loudly *about* OP not directly to
Everytime I hear a ridiculous claim by a hot female they sell porn.
Tank uuu
This is why I'm strictly a cat-person, not a ""people-person."" My heart goes out to them, I would be so pissed if this happened around me"	n9chmc	NonBinary	749	0.99	2021-05-10 18:36:05
My family found my address and sent me a passive aggressive/ misgendering birthday card. So I corrected it.		"Did you send the corrected one back?
Sorry they sent you that card, I understand how that feels. My family didn’t sing happy birthday or write me any cards this year, because they refuse to call me by the name I’ve chosen. I just got “Happy Birthday!” texts with no name. Felt super impersonal and lonely.
i want to be a genderless blob too! where do i sign up?

edit: holy shit, why all the upvotes?? i just want to be a genderless blob >_>
You forgot to put a grade at the top...
Send your family a box with a dead rat In it
Power move!!!
I would shove it back in the envelope rts recipient unknown - it can't before you can it or it would have the right person on it.
Sorry that happened to you .. But Happy birthday you amazing genderless blob ! (I love that term lol)
My dad sent me a text on my birthday, 5 months after coming out and our big blowup fight. Misgendering the entire time, saying how he'd never forget *my* birthday (I didn't send him or my stepmom messages for theirs at all). 


Sorry you have to deal with that, OP. Especially the pettiness of sending you a card in the mail. I hope that one day they can see how they've treated you and make amends for it. You deserve better!
Happy birthday you wonderful blob! 🥳
""With your own unique perspective""

""Wait not like that""
this sucks so much and my heart goes out to you. but also this opens up so many opportunities for trolling. send it back with the corrected gender. send them misgendering cards, call your mom Steve, overthrow the government, it will be great.
This is the only appropriate way to respond in this situation. Send it back
But you're the best blob, OP! 

Happy birthday, sorry about the family.
When I read the crossed out genderless blob I immediately wanted to do this on my kids next car they would love it ! I’m sorry they are so unsupportive
This is bullshit and they deserve the corrected card. I imagine you’ve already had conversations several times with them about this and they are intentionally being ignorant out of denial. 

Happy Birthday, genderless blob fren.
Hello fellow Blob! [this is the song of our people](https://youtu.be/AK5jyVCdXwc)
Now that’s an idea!! Lol
Came here to suggest this lol
That’s awful. I hope you find people that will be your true family. My dad hasn’t spoken to me since I came out a few months ago. His signature on this card was the only time I’ve heard from him.
May I propose a name for the genderless blob club? We should call it the Ditto Collective, it sounds cool and it means we can have a cute pokemon as a mascot

EDIT: r/DittoCollective is now a thing for anyone interested! :)
This is why I love this community. ❤️ haha!
I am an orb, I will ally with the blobs. We provide soft light and warmth.
Better yet, make it an alive rat
Lol I moved to another country ages ago to get away from my conservative town. I don’t think I’m allowed to send animals alive or dead to another country haha 😆
Damn op you know you gotta misgender them in every card from now on
*do it*
OMG YES
I would rlly like to be in that club
>Damn op you know you gotta misgender them in every card from now on

please
Sign me up.
COUNT ME IN!
*somebody make it a sub pls*
No, they'll be mean to the rat!

Get them poo or something.
Yeeeeeeeeeees!!!!!!!
Consider it done: r/DittoCollective

I have no idea where to go with this sub I just made it this morning
Better yet just don't get them anything 

They don't deserve anything
YESSSSS <333 thank you 😭

The unexpected downside of being androgynous is the misgendering is perpetual on both sides. Could use some validation. (they/them)		"You look like a cute faerie who lives in a mushroom. I love your look!
Love the moon and stars aesthetic you've got going on here. 

Envious of your androgyny 😅
Ohhhhhhh it really do be like that... :( Cis-passing non-binary people talk about androgynous enbies as if we start getting gendered correctly lol. I also did not expect the reality

You look very androgynous/ambiguous btw. If that was you transition goal, congrats on succeeding! Also your hair is a great colour 😮
Love the hair, love the smile! You're hella androgynous, like, just wow, you look amazing!
I totally get that! People have to always stare at me to figure out if I'm one gender or the other but I'm neither. It's a bit weird. 

Also, you look absolutely great in this photo!
You are super aesthetically pleasing, kinda like the stars. Very nice to look at. 10/10.
I love your hair
I don't know how to help with validation, but your hair is so godamn cool ;u;
💚💚💚💚💚💚💚
You’re a gorgeous human. Keep doing you. 

It’s not your fault or any judgement on you that people misgender you. It’s their inexperience showing.
I would love to look that androgynous.
The price we pay for being ourselves..
💚💚💚💚💚💚💚
Gender: hottie
You are a stellar being and deserve to be treated as such!
i mean yeah all my pans are clattering but that's because the theyness is _so_ strong!
Hey friend! What’s it like working in Maccas? I’ve heard it’s a tough job sometimes. I had friends who worked there and they faced a fair bit of harassment. On a happier note, those glasses are gorgeous and really suit your fantastically androgynous face!
You seem to look good on both your They side, and on your Them side. ;)

Also I'm fascinated with your eyes matching your hair in the first photo.
Omg they looks so awesome and stylish! They should definitely show others their style and help them be themselves 🏳️‍🌈
Not gonna lie, if you served me, me and my partner would not stop talking about how awesome they looked. You look awesome! Sending positive vibes
Your necklace and tattoos omgggg
I love your hair! Your aesthetic is 💫💫💫incredible
the green forest elf vibe tho absolutely magnificent you amazing person your androgynous looks makes me jealous
Lovely green hair and y'all are cute. I hope the day is good. Do something nice for yourselves when you can. And drink water.💕
i love your hair!! i have green hair too <3 the best color
Wow! This is the level of androgynous I strive to be 👏👏👏 the choker is a great look on you btw
You’re so cute - so valid haha
the look, the androgyny, the GRIN! new life goals registered 🥰
You look like one of the fae. Binary genders are beneath you, you're too cool for them
If they misgender you on both sides or don’t know what to call you, then the androgyny is working. You are valid and cute and you definitely own your androgyny 💛🤍💜🖤
your hair makes your eyes pop😍 gorgeous
They have such a cute nose piercing and I love their hair color! That shade of green suits them so well 💚💚
Aye fellow mcdonalds employee. Keep your head up people are dumb.
Awww thank you so much!! Your comment made my day :)
You look amazing and I too am envious. I would love to look someone in the eye as they internally struggled with their own perception of how to label me. Such power with which to crush the binary.
Thank you so much!! The androgyny is absolutely the goal, since I’m genderfluid but usually stay around the agender area. But that just means I get misgendered twice as much now haha (I identified as FTM before).
Always on the lookout for more stars and moons stuff for myself 😅
Such power, indeed!"	sby4sw	NonBinary	718	1.0	2022-01-24 22:15:02
Came out to my therapist, I don't know if I wanna see her again	"TW: Transphobia, dysphoria

(TL;DR at end)

I recently started accepting myself as non-binary, Agender specifically, after working through internalised transphobia and enby-phobia (I guess?). And about a week ago my mum asked me if I was trans because she had been suspecting that something was up. I would've come out to her sooner, but she had previously shown openly transphobic behaviour, but it turns out she's changed and is very accepting and supportive (although she doesn't really understand what non-binary is). 

Now, I've been struggling with bad social dysphoria which (among other things) has been getting in the way of confidently going out in public and finding a job, so I thought it would help to speak to my therapist about it so we could work through it. So in my most recent session, I told her that I hated that people perceived me as a woman and how uncomfortable it makes me. So she asked,

""Why don't you want to be a girl?""

I said ""I don't like it, it feels wrong""

then she asked ""do you want to be a boy?""

I answered ""no""

She asked, ""why do you want to cancel yourself?""

I just sat there, confused. So I asked what she meant.

And she said, ""Why do you want to take away a part of yourself?""

And I was like 'what the hell is she talking about? I just told her I'm not a girl or boy, there's nothing *to* take away.'

She just did not understand at all. At first I gave her the benefit of the doubt and thought, 'oh, she just doesn't understand what non-binary means, but I suppose she could learn,' 

But she just looked confused and then did the whole ""you have to be one or the other"" ""there's no in between"" ""p3n1s or v4g1na"" ""only 2 sexes"" thing. 

I tried to explain that being feminine and being perceived as a woman is very uncomfortable and just feels wrong, and I essentially told her that I wanted top surgery (which she referred to as a double mastectomy) and to appear gender neutral. 

And so you know what she asked in response? She asked if I had any s3xual trauma. I don't, but like, how is that even relevant? 

She kept asking, ""imagine if you got everything you wanted to look neutral, then what?""

So I was like ""??? Then I would be happier and more confident because I'll look how I feel like I'm supposed to, and I'll be able to not feel dysphoric for once in my life ??? "" 

To which she would respond, ""That's not going to get food on the table/pay the bills etc., you can identify however you like, but it's not going to help you to get a job or earn a living."" and ""I know what it's like to think like a boy, I grew up surrounded by them. I don't even own a dress. My b00bs are uncomfortable too, the first thing I do when I get home is take off my bra. I don't like hanging out with other women, all they do is gossip and \[other stereotypes\]."" And then she did the ""when they dig up your skeleton they'll see a woman's skeleton"" thing and other ridiculous arguments.

But she understands that you can't change your thoughts/mind, y'know? She kept saying that ""you can change how you look as much as you want, but that won't change your thoughts."" 

And I thought 'EXACTLY ?? I want to change my body to fit my thoughts/mind'. 

She continued, ""you'll only ever have feminine thoughts""

To which I said, ""I've never had feminine thoughts.""

Her response: ""No, you've always had feminine thoughts. Let's simplify it all the way down. Do you sit down to pee?""

I was like, ""?? Of course I do?? It's easier than standing up, why would I do it any other way? That's not even a 'feminine thought', it's a practicality thing.""

And she started questioning how I would transition to be gender neutral by pointing out all the things I'm dysphoric about, and saying ""double mastectomy is very hard to get and its very expensive. How are you planning to pay for it? I know your family can't afford it. How are you going to change your voice? Or your bone structure?"" She was acting like I had brought this all up on a whim and not like I hadn't been thinking thoroughly about it for at least the past 2 years. 

I stopped listening to half the things she was saying coz I was so mad/frustrated at her ignorance. And after a while I just stopped saying anything because I was not in the mood to argue about it, especially because I'm terrible at arguing. It probably made her think she was 'winning' the argument.

Then, and I don't know why she felt the need to do this, she told me about her friend's son, who is a trans man. She showed me a picture of him and was saying how he got top surgery, bottom surgery, and probably also hrt (I can't remember), all the while misgendering and dead-naming him. She was like, 'this is my friend's *daughter*, \[dead name\], *she* goes by \[chosen name\]. *She* had this surgery, and that surgery. *She's* not really a woman, but *she's* not a man, and this is a picture of *her* when *she* was a little *girl*."" \*shows picture that is literally a young boy\*

She says that no matter what I say, her opinion of me won't change, and that I'm free to identify how I want to. But from what I experienced, she won't fully respect my identity and will always see me as a girl, which is exactly what I was afraid of. She managed to trigger my dysphoria, anxiety, and depression all in one go. She just wants the best for me, she's nice, but I don't know if I'll be comfortable going to her again.

&#x200B;

TL;DR: I came out to my therapist about being Agender, and she didn't understand at all and was very transphobic about it in the typical transphobe way, and I left feeling worse than when I went in."	"Yeah hell no. I'm nonbinary, and a mental health therapist. Too many points to note which were inappropriate, so to summarize: all of what they said was shit. That's not therapy. It may take some searching but competent therapists are out there. Hang in there pal.
I’d send her a message telling her she needs to do research if she is going to be working with trans clients. Let her know why you left before you leave. But definitely leave. Therapists are supposed to be your support not your bully
Trust your gut, OP. ABSOLUTELY find a new therapist, and I’d even report her to her college because it’s pretty unethical what she did. Not just gross, but she straight up put you in danger by doing what she did. 

You know yourself, be true to you ❤️
Yeah, report them and never go back. That's just a basic lack of professionalism.
Good god that sounds horrible. I hated reading that, really sorry. This person should definitely not be practicing for trans or probably any queer people. Or maybe just any people.
Is there any way you can report this woman? What she said to you is absolutely disgusting and could have had disastrous consequences for someone who was in the wrong headspace. I’m so sorry you went through that, she is wrong (as I’m sure you know from having more than one functional brain cell).
Oh my god, i got frustrated just READING that. Jesus fucking Christ. Ignorance is not an excuse to talk to someone that way! As someone who is going into this field, this was handled so poorly by her. It's one thing to simply be uneducated about trans identities, but she doesn't even care to learn. 

Im so sorry you had this experience with someone who is supposed to be an educated professional. I encourage you to seek a new therapist <333
>""That's not going to get food on the table/pay the bills etc., you can identify however you like, but it's not going to help you to get a job or earn a living.""

What even is that? 

That sounds like a lecture from your parents about job prospects, not the kind of thing a therapist should ever be saying about any form of self care! ""How is making yourself happy and taking care of your mental health going to put food on the table?""  What the fuck.  You can't put food on the table if you're too depressed and dysphoric to work.

She sounds like you just said your dream is to be a dog psychic, not that you're talking about your mental and physical wellbeing. 

If you can OP, I would see if you can find a queer or at least queer and trans friendly therapist. My therapist is genderqueer and it's revolutionary never to have to explain my identity to them.
Holy shit, I would've walked out as soon as she did this

>she just looked confused and then did the whole ""you have to be one or the other"" ""there's no in between"" ""p3n1s or v4g1na"" ""only 2 sexes"" thing.

This therapist should not be seeing people. She is extremely ignorant and transphobic as hell. I'm so sorry you went through this
people who say and believe shit like this shouldn't be allowed to therapists, there literal job is to talk you through your problems and help you achieve mental stability, not to trigger every fucking alarm in you, constantly mistreat you and be extremely offensive to patients

you are agender and valid, and no one but you can take that away from you. Your therapist doesn't want the best for you, if she did, she wouldn't deny your thoughts and call you crazy for not conforming the society's extremely bullshit gender norms/ideas
So thay sounds like she was mega projecting onto you (she clearly has *issues* around her own gender, at least others of her gender) and yes absolutely do not go back to her.
Fuck that therapist I’m so sorry your are going through this. I would definitely never see her again.
Even without the awful transphobia it sounds like your therapist is very unprofessional, they shouldn’t have shown photos of someone else. I hope you can find the therapist you need. :)
This is the worst of these experiences I have ever heard. Holy fuck. Yeet this therapist into orbit and report the shit out of her!
That's not even on the same post code of what a therapist should say.

Ithat's what my idiot mom said when I came out.

Run!

(And leave without paying if you can, they don't deserve a cent.)
okay that last part about the friend's son is def some sort of violation of confidentiality. get out now.
What a disgusting person. Bigots like that shouldn't even have a license to practise.
You need to find a new therapist. 
Your therapist works for you. 
You deserve one who will support you.
I specifically sought out a LGBTQ+ therapist (and that was before I was questioning, I just was seeking safety and ENBY is now a topic I explore with her). If you can, I recommend doing the same if you can. Therapy is such a vulnerable activity and what you shared here is worth reevaluating that relationship imho.
So she's openly phobic towards you, projects her own experiences/feelings onto you, tries to guilt trip you into not seeking treatment...she should not be allowed to practice therapy.
Haha report that therapist
“If they dig up your skeleton they’ll see a woman’s skeleton” bitch if they dig up your skeleton you could be misidentified as a man, skeletons are not that fucking easy to sex.
What a nightmare!! Everything she said is wrong, cruel, biased, and foolish. This woman is deranged and uneducated, do not go back
I only read most of that but the part where the therapist said the thing about there are 2 sexes you have to pick pick one and....omfg..when they dig up your skeleton!??!?!

This woman is not your therapist. She has big terf energy.

This brings me back to coming out as NB to a cis female close friend and her laughing it off like bro you are huge just be a bro, bro.

 Finding a good therapist even when you are cis is a process it's like going on a bunch of dates until you find the person you have compatibility with.

 Sending you NB love and pride.
It's frustrating to hear how much a fellow therapist failed you and failed to uphold the professional ethical standards we are supposed to follow. Clearly this therapist is not competent in managing trans and gender diverse concerns. This therapist should probably get some training. It can be daunting to either bring up this conflict directly with your therapist or go through the process of finding a different one. Either way, you deserve a better counseling experience and I wish you luck however you decide to move forward.
Wow, I am so sorry that happened to you. Please take care of yourself! Even if she believed all of those horrible things, or didn’t know what you were talking about, as a therapist, her responsibility is to non judgmentally help you with what you are experiencing. And boy, did she fail at that. Ugh. So sorry. 😢
I’m so angry on your behalf!! Cancel yourself?? Seriously??? Sounds like she watches Fox News. 

If anyone ever starts talking to you like that again, you are allowed to stand up and say, “This session is over,” and walk the fuck out. Slam the door on the way out if you like.
Report that shit. Whatever their professional organization is send a passed off letter.
Fuck this. As far as the sexual trauma thing goes, it is relevant. Some detrans people- women specifically- transition to become male or transmasc as a response to sexual trauma. They see their gender (woman, usually) as being why they were targeted (and that’s often at least partially true) so they begin to hate their woman-ness for getting them hurt, even though, you know, the only person responsible is their attacker/rapist. Other times, it’s a cognitive thing; they were attacked as a woman in a woman’s body, so they mentally dissociate from their body as a way of separating themselves from the trauma. Sort of like someone changing their name to escape bad things they did/had done to them in the past. It’s complex, but her comments beyond asking if you had sexual trauma were entirely irrelevant and she is not paid to tell you that what you feel is or isn’t real- it is, purely because you feel it.
Your therapist sucks. She sounds like a fundamentalist religious counselor type. Don’t listen to any of what she spouts. She’s not nice and she doesn’t have a clue what the best for you is. You deserve so much more.
This this is the reason why we need more Queer Affirmative therapist
Get a new therapist.
There is more than two genders and sexual 😤 transphobes and homophobes need to learn that
yeah fuck that therapist. she is literally doing the opposite of her job
Please leave that practice and fill out every negative review possible/you're comfortable doing.
I'd report her
Dump her. But also, she is being abusive. Not sure if she is private or with your provider's office...either way figure out a way to complain, report, or make your voice heard. And leave a bad review if possible.
That was horrible. Unprofessional. And disgusting behaviour. You should never have to feel that disrespected in a setting that is supposed to be a safe space to talk about anything on your mind. Not okay at all. Report that, exactly what you wrote and how it made you feel, and find someone new. I know how hard it is to get a new therapist and start over. But that would be better than someone who doesn’t respect who you are. That won’t help you at all, it’ll just hurt you. And at that point. Why pay the money to be lectured at about how you don’t know who you are? I’m so sorry you had to go through that OP. No one should be made to feel like they have to shut down and ignore a therapist in your own therapy session.
Not only does she sound like a bad person, she's a terrible therapist! Take it from someone with a whole ass psychology degree, you're never supposed to let your personal beliefs influence how you treat your clients/patients. I'm also Dailey certain she broke several codes of conduct by showing you photos and discussing the personal details of her friends son. 

Absolutely find a new therapist! There are so many good queer friendly ones out there who will understand help you! 

Best of luck ❤️
Unbelievably cringe therapist, fuck that. I’m sorry you had to deal w that
New therapist and COMPLAIN about that one. She shouldn’t be practicing
Holy shit. Excuse my language but that lady is out of her ever lasting mind! Don't go back to see her, you can get a therapist else where who isn't homo/transphobic, respectful and, supportive of you and your goals. I'm so sorry that happened. Hopefully you find a better therapist that is a decent human being. There are apps that offer therapy from therapists so that's an option. Sadly, I have never seen a free therapist but you could see if they have financial aid or if your insurance covers it, that's me assuming you're in the USA or Canada, I admit I know nothing about how other places do it, but I digress.
Naw.

I had a non-binary therapist, and they were absolutely amazing.

I had gone to them for a few different things, but when I mentioned going on HRT hopefully sooner rather than later they were super accepting and after hearing me ramble about how I knew what changes there would be, that I wouldn’t necessarily adore some but also wouldn’t really have a PROBLEM with them, that I knew the risks, blah blah blah, they had nothing much to say other than support.

Wish I coulda kept seein them but insurance changed, and now I ain’t got any at the moment, but I’d like to think they’d be real happy for me with how far I’ve come in only about a year.

Your therapist tho? 

If you’re able to, I’d definitely consider finding a new one.
Holy shit I am SO sorry this happened! That therapist shouldn't even be licensed. I'm a therapist and I'm agender and even if I wasn't and didn't understand, our role is to support the client, seek to support them in gaining insight, and work toward *their* goals, never to be condescending, transphobic, and violent like this. Definitely support you doing what you need and want for YOU and you have every right to file complaints with the practice and licensing board if you want to. Sending you lots of care and encouragement ❤️
You are paying them . You can get up and leave. Fuck this lady and never go back. There ARE gender understanding therapist out there.
Yeah so... You should report her, in my opinion.  I'm nonbinary and also work in mental health and if anyone at my work said this bullshit they would get fired SO fast.  Like, my coworkers don't always get it and sometimes they say ignorant shit because they don't understand, but it is literally company policy that we have to use people's preferred names and pronouns and the agency as a whole is in support of LGBTQ+ rights even though I work in an area of the country that is transphobic AF.  If she's a solo practitioner then idk if anything will be done, but if she works under any kind of agency she would likely get fired, which tbh she deserves.  Even beyond her shitty opinions, if she talked to someone like that even if she was in the right, she would STILL be behaving extremely unprofessionally.  No therapist should ever be that condescending and outright dismissive of a patient, regardless of context.
She doesn’t want the best for you if she intentionally triggered you like that my fellow NB friend. Even if they didn’t understand a good therapist wouldn’t have gone out of their way to do that to you.
I have an amazing she/they therapist, you need to find a new one. You deserve so much better!
Please please please find someone competent. This is absolutely unacceptable. 

I see that you're a bit hesitant to find someone new but please do! This is really, truly not acceptable. This person is harmful. You should not continue seeing them.
Therapist: time to shop for a new one.

Your mom: her attitude was crap but she had questions. It sounds like she might be open to learning. And if she truly does love you no matter what, she will be. Share some resources about gender theory with her so she can begin to understand how gender is fluid and a construct. 

Love and light to you, I'm sorry coming out has started this way for you.
Nope nope nope please never see them again
I hope you report them and are able to find someone new. You deserve better!
My significant other (a man) pees sitting down. Does that make him a woman??

Yay on your mom not being gross!!

Find a new therapist.
I had my 80 year old therapist say that my being nonbinary was a defense mechanism / excuse. The next appointment was our last, and she seemed surprised. But I found an LGBTQ+ friendly therapist that I moved on to. It's much better having a therapist who believes you. Move on from your transphobic therapist. ❤️
I told my psychiatrist and psychologist that I'm genderfluid leaning towards feminine and they immediately asked which pronouns I'd like them to use. You need a new therapist.

I'm sorry you went through that. I've had a few weird comments from my respective therapists but when I've asked them to explain what they meant it was perfectly reasonable. I hope you get it sorted out!
Jesus fucking Christ, never go back there. Consider reporting this (her) to the licensing board as this sounds like conversion therapy and is not how you conduct a therapy session in any way shape or form (I’m a therapist). You deserve better. Please do not go back to this monster.
disgusting, please don't come back
I noped out of the paragrah after the pee note, pease change therapist. She is just transphobic and inappropriate.
“Feminine thoughts”? What is this woman saying at this point ☠️☠️☠️ I’m sorry please get a better therapist if you can and report her for transphobia if the institution has the rights for
This therapist sounds like she's chosen the wrong career. I'd find someone else.
There is more than two genders and sexual 😤 transphobes and homophobes need to learn that
There is more than two genders and sexual 😤 transphobes and homophobes need to learn that
This is so gross. You're not crazy OP. Do not trust this person with your well-being
I’ve always been nervous to come out to a therapist or just a doctor in general but I’ve done so reluctantly and every professional has been super accommodating and respectful. I hope you find a therapist who actually does their job and doesn’t let bias and their own ignorance dictate their practice!
I’m so sorry for the horrendous treatment by someone who should know better. I don’t know where you are but I hope you can find someone that can provide the affirming care you need and deserve.
As a non-binary therapist in training and also a client in therapy with a therapist who fully supports my being non-binary, you deserve *so* much better from your therapist. You deserve a safe space to be yourself and to be heard. But what she was saying here was so full of hate and misunderstanding. :(


I hope that she's been good for you in other areas, but this therapist clearly has a *lot* of transphobia that she is completely unashamedly projecting onto you. She needs to take a step back from her work and work out why she has an issue with trans and non-binary people and not see any clients in these groups until she's done some very serious personal work!!!

I hope you're doing okay, you are who you know you are and your identity is real and valid!! <3
Thank you for the trigger warnings♡
Highly unprofessional, please OP don't go back to her. And obviously don't believe one thing she has said, it's 100% bullshit.

She also should be reported for outing her friend's son. WTF is that? Showing his picture, outing him and dead naming him to a patient? She crossed several lines there.
LEAVE!!!
omg this isn't just don't see her again, this is don't see her and file a grievance with her site director or supervisor. the way she's asking about how you use the bathroom screams ""what genitals do you have"" and in a therapeutic relationship that question is incredibly inappropriate and borderline sexual harassment. a therapist has power over their client and they need to recognize that and attempt to level the playing field. deciding how you feel for you? that's disgusting. what's the point of you even going to these sessions if she's just gonna write your story for you? I'm so sorry op, it's so hard to be trans and be respected in healthcare. I wish you the best in finding a new therapist ❤️
I'm stuck with medi-cal and can't get any therapist other than either a) terrible untrained fools or b) mean old boomers
she was really inappropriate to you, i’m sorry to hear it
Holy shit.  I’m so sorry. Please don’t go back to her, she’s not a safe person.
>She kept asking, ""imagine if you got everything you wanted to look neutral, then what?""

>So I was like ""??? Then I would be happier and more confident because I'll look how I feel like I'm supposed to, and I'll be able to not feel dysphoric for once in my life ??? "" 

This!!!!!!!! It feels great!
*n*^(th) comment saying you need to find a different therapist and drop that one double quick.
fire her! that is unacceptable. I've had my therapist question why I refer to myself as she/her occasionally when talking about times when I was identifying as a girl. I was like, well in my mind, during those years I was presenting/identifying as a girl, so that's the frame of reference I have for myself in those years. I feel like I was trapped in that identity for so long because of family and partner expectations, so it feels like my divorce and resulting self-discovery was a whole new chapter in my life and I'm not the same person I was.
Time to find a new therapist. It's okay to fire this one right away because she can and will cause you damage. What she's doing is abusive.
I don’t have anything to add other people didn’t already say. I’m just really sorry this happened to you. Obviously the way you were treated was wrong. You deserve so much better. There are other therapists out there that can support, validate, and help you. 

This one just turned out to be a real stinker.
Report her
Everything she said was pretty much a summed up list of transphobic talking points. Like point for point.
This person does NOT have your best interests at heart. She’s completely nuts. Better no therapist at all then having to deal with that horseshit.
Just wanna say the whole ""when they dig up your skeleton it will still be a woman's skeleton"" argument is bollocks anyway. I don't remember the specific details but I saw a tiktok saying skeletons are actually gender neutral and they can't tell the difference. Despite what people think
What the actual hell?

This person sounds about as unprofessional as you can get. I am appalled that people like this advertise themselves as therapists, should be fucking illegal or something- jesus.
Everyday more genuinely don't understand how people can trust therapists....
Please review this provider and mention that she is blatantly transphobic and pushes traditional gender roles, so other trans people know to keep away.

YIKES
what an awful therapist, fired immediately
She sounds awful
Using a ""Professional"" job to spout utter nonsense like that (Especially in a position where vulnerable people have to open up about their thoughts) should earn nothing more than a brick through a window.
Yikes. You’re going to need a second therapist because of the first one. That’s awful
She should have therapy, not you. Never go see her again, be you🥰 you got this!💪👏😘
That sucks. Therapists are people. People can be transphobes. And transphobes almost never change. You just didn't know, 'cause it hasn't come up until now. At least there is no doubt about it.

File an official complaint to the organisation she works for and any medical association they fall under (don't forget to mention she leaked personal info from another person in your session either, including their picture and misgendering them), give one star ratings on healthcare related websites, burn her on socials and NEVER come back.
I literally can’t believe my eyes. I’ve read a bunch of therapy horror stories but damn, this is on a whole other level. 

I’ll give her the benefit of the doubt and assume she’s just extremely uneducated, which is still unacceptable tho because all therapists should be able to work with trans patients. 

However, I think her approach was also quite rude, aggressive and unprofessional because she was clearly pushing her views onto you, which therapists aren’t supposed to do. When you come out, your therapist shouldn’t question, investigate or challenge your identity if you don’t ask them to; if they do, it literally turns into borderline conversion therapy. 

All of her inappropriate questions and remarks make her sound like a massive terf tbh, she’s clearly not the right person for you imo and even if “she could learn”, it’s not your job to educate her
Make sure you give her a bad review on whatever services she's with and tell people she's extremely transphobic so nobody else needs to deal with that.
She’s toxic as fuck. Extremely narrow minded. It’s dangerous.
You need to find a new therapist, specifically a gender affirming / LGBT sensitive one.
The digging up bones argument is so stupid bc it’s not like I’m gonna be alive to care that an archaeologist misgenders me. Like how could I even care how my bones get gendered when I’ve already been dead for hundreds of years?
I am so sorry! When I came out to my therapist the only thing we talked about was what name/pronouns I wanted to use and if she should note it in my file so the front desk knew too. 

What your therapist did is so horrifically out of line. I would not go back to see her. You don't owe her anything and if you don't feel comfortable telling her you don't want to see her anymore you can just ghost her. Her behavior was the antithesis of nice and it sounds like she's more worried with her comfort than what is best for you. 

Again, I'm so sorry you had to deal with that.
Please report them too. They shouldn't be saying shit like that. It's detrimental and in no way in line with any ethical code for therapy standards. She needs more of education and to stfu with her personal opinions.
I'm so sorry this happened to you. Do not go back to this therapist. You deserve to have your identity respected. It's scary how many therapists are openly transphobic. You might want to check out r/therapyabuse
Im sorry this happened, hopefully you’re able to find a better therapist soon
use the website psychology today and you can find queer friendly therapists 💝
1) I’m so sorry. 2) why the fuck aren’t therapists required to understand gender dysphoria??? 3) fuck her. 4) find a new therapist.
so sorry you had to go through that. Your therapist is a transphobe, you deserve better
Yeah that's not right. I would have told her higher ups about how she treated you. It's always a bad sign when therapists invalidate their patients and try to win arguments with them. I hope you told her to stop misgendering you and that it was making you feel uncomfortable so she got the picture. That was really mean and insensitive of her. Oh and don't even get me started on the archologist stumbling across a ""male"" vs ""female"" skeleton cring bullshit. These people are so narrow-minded they can't seem to figure out the difference between the central nervous stem and the skeletal system.
Sounds like you may need a therapist to get over the trauma your therapist caused you. You should send her a bill and report her to the board for causing you trauma. That’s almost, if not actually, malpractice.
That's not a therapist. That's a transphobe
Fckkkkkkk this person. Leave and report them. That's not how a therapist should be AT ALL.
God.  My therapist was like this too.

I didn't fully tell him I was trans but I mentioned my gender feeling wrong often.  And I requested the use of my name ""Sunflower,"" which he seemed to respect at first.

But over time he started writing my dead name on my schedule cards and when I brought it up, he said:
""Are you running away from your past by changing your name?""

I said no, I just didn't like my old name because of the trauma and parents divorce drama surrounding it.  So I picked a new one that made me happy.  (And fit me as an Enby)

I wasn't trying to ""turn into someone else.""

Then he starts trying to convince me that Sunflower is weird and MIGHT work as a middle name.
But I should pick something normal.
Then he said: ""You look like your name is Patty.""
I straight up looked and dressed masc, and he'd made comments about my weight before (no offense to anyone with these names) so I knew him suggesting names like ""Patty, Bessy, Bettsy"" were also a jab at this.

I just grimaced and made up something about that being a character from Doug and tried to get back on track with the session.

So glad I never had another with him after that.

He did zero to make me feel like I could be vulnerable.  Especially about my gender.
I have several friends who have fired their therapists after a bad session. On top of that, most have requested to not pay for their final session, or requested to get their money back if they had already paid. Simply explain that instead of being helpful, your last session was extremely harmful and problematic, and that you either won't be paying for that session, or that you'd like your money back. 

Also, please report her to her governing body immediately. She requires a license to practice, which means she needs to uphold a certain code of ethics. Your provincial/state governing body should be aware of your session and they should investigate her. They can revoke her license if it's serious enough. Please report her so the next NB doesn't have to suffer through the same experience.

I'm so sorry you had to experience this.
If you can, definitely find a new therapist. If you feel comfy and want to, you can report her. If you want, you can also leave a review on Google/ZocDoc/whatever medical site she’s on—that way future potential nonbinary and trans clients will know to avoid her
I'm so sorry that this happened to you. I'm shocked, she really neess to get with the times otherwise she should get her license revoked. The last thing a therapist should do is make you feel triggered, absolutley find a new one.
Holy shit, I am so sorry that happened to you. Never speak to this awful woman again. She is straight up full of shit.
I probably wouldve told her to go fuck herself
Gosh, your uncertainty about the situation made me think the transphobia was going to be SUBTLE or something. Fuck going back, I don't think she even deserves to get paid for that session
what kind of an excuse for a therapist is that
I'm really sorry that this had to happen to you, i hope you are getting better
Non-binary therapist and supervisor here. You can report her to her licensing board for ethical violation and discrimination. Someone like that has no place in the mental health field. The American Counseling Association (leading association for therapists and counselors) and the American Psychiatric Association (leading association for psychologists) both recognize nonbinary identities as valid, and clearly state that failing to respect an individual's identity is discrimination and therefore in violation of the code of ethics. Link to the APA guidelines [https://www.apa.org/practice/guidelines/transgender.pdf](https://www.apa.org/practice/guidelines/transgender.pdf) 

You are amazing courageous to come out and it is infuriating that she did not treat the gift of knowledge that you gave her with the respect you deserve.
That therapist needs to stop practising.
That’s so so so inappropriate let alone discriminatory. I’d call it bullying.
It is not her place to “inform” you on you (especially when she is just trying to protect her narrow world view, not actually provide you with any accurate or helpful insight)- it is her job to work with you to understand yourself better (which means listening to YOUR input and respecting that) so that you can build a happier, healthier life. 
Yikes on a skateboard.
I am so sorry you have been so badly let down by a so called professional who should be there to help you.
Hi, I’m genderqueer and a therapist and I’m so sorry you experienced that! Not all therapists are competent. You owe this therapist nothing. Do whatever you want to take care of yourself. Ghost her, email her, scream at her… and hope you find yourself a therapist who can support you along your journey! ❤️
So sorry that this happened to you. It is great that you came out to your therapist, but terrible that she revealed herself to be an ignorant and blatant transphobe. This is a gift to you because you now know that you must find another therapist. Imagine if she was more subtle and messed with your mind for years? Good on her for being so blatantly obvious with her bigotry. So unprofessional.

Get. Another. Therapist. Now.
This sounds incredibly unprofessional to me. I don't want to jump to conclusions because I don't know the full context, but based on what you've described here I'd say she's a bad therapist. Not only is she not supposed to give you advice and tell you how to live, she's also not supposed to let her personal opinions and ignorance interfere with your therapy. If I were you I would quit immediately - it sounds like she is not interested in doing research to gain perspective and be more trans-literate. It would be incredibly hurtful and damaging for the client (you) in the long run, or even short-term.
Go to one more session... And record it. Keep that record and pass it on (in some places you may need her consent to record... In which case, you can force her to admit she doesn't REALLY believe what she's saying is legit).
In some places, this may be enough to get her in serious trouble. Damn.
Op what’s your region? If you live in cali specifically OC my therapist is nonbinary goes by she/they and they have tons of recourses on therapists who are super loving and helpful I also know another therapist cis woman who’s queer and although she herself isn’t trans she fully supports and hears everything lovely woman also does emdr therapy to help release trauma trapped in the body
🚩🚩🚩🚩🚩🚩🚩🚩🚩🚩🚩🚩 If a therapist ever makes you feel like they aren't listening to you, they aren't doing their job right. Start looking for a new therapist.
All that u are saying fits my feelings so well. I get a major dysphoria when someone just assumes my gender. I have never felt like a girl nor a boy even before I was just putting on make up to fit in not cause I wanted to. I think the last time I put on make up was when I was 16. I am 25 now. Or wear certain clothes to fit in or act a certain way. Now I am like h*ll if I care what people think of me. (Does not help my dysphoria when someone adresses me as girl, woman, dauther, she or her tho). I have not come out to my parents or familly cause I don't feel the need to. I think deep down they will always see me like that. But I have come out to friends and they are all supportive. I have my pronouns in my bio's of my socials so probably familly who pay attention will see that I guess.
hell no. definitely stop seeing her, like don't even go to the next session. 

like the fact that she just went directly into ""attack mode"" instead of taking a nonjudgmental perspective of hearing you out, is just bad. 

when you get a new therapist they should def hear about this too. what your (hopefully former) therapist did was a total breach of trust. good therapy relies on trust. what she did was harmful.
Depending on what country you're in there are boards you can report her to. The only good that can come out of this is making sure she doesn't do it to anyone else.

I'm sorry you went through this and I hope it doesn't put you off from therapy altogether. I went through a series of therapists that just didn't fit at all until I landed with my current one who is queer herself/very knowledgeable of the queer community and I've been seeing her now for 8 years. I for sure recommend looking into therapists that specialize in LGBTQ+ care going forward. Best of luck
Hi friend, another enby therapist here. I agree with others that she should be reported to her college if you're up for it, not just because of her disgusting and completely unethical transphobia and homophobia but also because of the way she gave you private information about her friend's son. He isn't her client so technically she didn't break confidentiality but it's still completely unprofessional to talk about someone else's medical procedures and to show their photo without their consent. So gross. You deserve SO MUCH BETTER this woman needs to know that this behaviour is not only unprofessional but actively harmful.
I would start looking for a new therapist immediately and also let her know why you don't want to see her again. While I doubt this will make her reflect on her words and do some actual research, she should know that you felt hurt and offended
Spend some time searching for a therapist that specifically works with trans/NB people. I try to do this with any medical provider I will have an extended relationship with. I’ve just heard too many horror stories about our interactions with the medical system. 

Do not go back to that therapist, though.
Did you choose your therapist? I ask because some don't have that privilege. If you do, please change your therapist.
That’s just a bad therapist period. My husband is in school to be a counselor and there’s just so many red flags. Sorry you went through that. There’s definitely a counselor that can help you so much better. My therapist is one of my biggest supporters.
This sounds unacceptable and really traumatising to have to go through this. I'm sorry you've had such a shitty exchange with your therapist. You deserve so much better. I'm a therapist myself and unfortunately it seems to be common to find transphobic therapists. I'm always worried for any trans person. If you want help reporting your therapist please let me know. I'd be more than happy to help!
Exactly what you said. 
It makes me so professionally offended when  I see these posts. People are vulnerable with them, they claim to be a professional, and then they treat people like this. It makes my blood boil
Exactly
not a mental health professional but if you don't want to really talk at all you could cancel and cite refusal to acknowledge Gender Dysphoria to start a paper trail. https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/gender-dysphoria/symptoms-causes/syc-20475255
will do
yah and if she did it to op she'll probably do it to others
 I think the therpist was trying to say that being nonbinary is hard which I get but you can't just choose not to be yourself. not being yourself is a lot harder in the long term
This bitch straight up did malpractice. Seconding reporting her.

[But OP, please don't feel pressured to report her. Take care of yourself first.]
i don’t think so 😔 she works independently, so there’s no one else to go to
Just hopping in to add that yes if she is a licensed professional the governing body for her certification has a way to report. The ACA is an example, NASW as well
Same, I barely could read all of it, imagine being there to experience it! Sounds like hell. Please OP be safe and find a new therapist, everything about this was just SO wrong 😵‍💫
They're not supposed to. This is definitely against the ethics code and they need to be reported.
yeah i thought so too
i was just about to say that! archeologists say this all the time. they have to guess on what they were buried with, that’s all they can really go off of
oh thanks for telling me, i wasn’t aware of that
yeah my mum has said that she’s willing to learn about it, and she’s going to help me get top surgery :)
Depending on where you are you could try looking online for a queer friendly therapist, or even a queer therapist. There’s a few resources like the Trevor project and PFlag that you might be able to use to find a good therapist.
sorry to hear that, i hope you’ll be able to find someone good soon, maybe online?
it was bizarre to witness, she just pulled out every typical transphoic argument in the book
I’m sorry this happened to you, I hope you have or find someone better to talk to who supports you 💚
Sunflower seeds may help lower blood pressure, cholesterol and blood sugar as they contain vitamin E, magnesium, protein, linoleic fatty acids and several plant compounds.
before doing this OP: please research your areas laws on recording people sans consent in private settings. no matter how horrendous this woman is, it is not worth you getting into legal trouble.
Glad to hear you're leaving, no one should have to hear that from their therapist. Wishing you the best!
She has a licence I assume. That means an agency is regulating her. You can report her to that agency.
Maybe find sites to leave a bad review?
Here in the UK I believe it’s covered by the HCPC!
Me too! I also thought that she was projecting. She sounds like a very unhappy person who chose at some point to just repress her gender dysphoria and lean into social gender norms. 

When people have true self assurance they don’t beat your round the head with their world view. You accepting their world view or not has no bearing on their own opinion of themselves.

Self assurance is quiet. 

However, when people rely on external structures, such as societal values, gender norms, markers of status, etc, to bolster their sense of self, challenging those structures challenges their self concept and they go ballistic. 

I guess it is extra surprising from a “therapist” because one of our expectations of them is that they must have spent time looking inward and finding that deeper sense of themselves. But, I hear so many stories about bad therapists, I guess they didn’t all get the memo.

Sorry you had to go through that. 

But for what it is worth from an outside perspective you were clearly the person operating from a deeper sense of self knowledge and wisdom. While she was lashing out irrationally and from a place of insecurity. She was placing more value on the seeming of her own life than the being of her own life. I wouldn’t wish that on anyone. You caring about being yourself more than seeming to be what society expects was threatening to her. She sounds deeply and desperately unhappy and you will do well to get clear of her.
Also especially since they’re going off of how the bones develop depending on muscle attachments and that humans aren’t that sexually dimorphic making it very difficult to sex people in general
Hopefully maybe! A Millennials would be nice
Pulled out the greatest hits, one after another. It’s clear cut
I hope you do as well.💞
Happy cake day
i’ll see what i can do
Cheers!
Please know this isn’t your fault. You don’t have a duty to report her but hopefully it will prevent someone else getting hurt. I hope you’re doing okay ❤️
If you're in the US, this looks like a useful guide: https://blog.opencounseling.com/check-a-therapist-license/
If you are in the US you can report her to the state board, and if you utilize insurance you can also report her to your insurance."	11196wq	NonBinary	698	0.99	2023-02-13 14:13:29
How do I get misgendered wearing this?!?!		"Honestly, I don’t expect half the population to even recognize enby colors at a glance. I have a few pins now that I’m not as worried about wearing “subtly” because I feel like most folks who recognize it will be chill with it.
Main honest reason, people don’t pay attention enough.
We had a whole program at work recently, which is a pretty big national corporation. Partnered with PFLAG, did like some Livestream and QAs concerning genders, sexuality, subtle/overt discrimination in the workplace etc. 

Just by seeing people in the live chat. I legitimately don't think a majority of the people from my company could've even told you what non-binary meant before hand. Probably still wouldn't be able too. I think there's just a pretty decent chunk of the population that just doesn't really know about anything more than gay/lesbian/trans. Or if they've even heard the term non-binary, are just confused as to what it means.

All that being said. That's a pretty fucking dope hoodie and I want it. Haha
Most people probably don't know what ""non-binary"" means yet
It really does show how ignorant most of the public is. Its like cis people basically determine gender on 3 obscure features and they are never the same.

“Is that person slightly shorter than the person next to them?” FEMALE

“Does that person have well developed shoulders?” MALE

“Hmmm that person with a short male haircut, polish military field jacket, men’s leather boots and a beanie is walking kinda smoothly.”  “EXCUSE ME MA’AM!”
Felt that, I am constantly wearing my he/They pin on my hat and people still manage to. People can just be oblivious about it. :(
No one reads.
I’ve worn a straight up covid mask with my pronouns on it and people still don’t get the hint.  They’re literally on my face - I don’t understand how people don’t notice, but I know for sure some people truly just don’t notice. I started a new job recently where a coworker saw the pronoun pin on my backpack hanging in the break room before she noticed the pronoun mask on my face. After seeing the pin, she came to me to apologize for misgendering me and never did it again, so I am positive she just didn’t notice the mask. So weird.
Maybe get a pronoun pin?
Anything beyond the rainbow flag is generally unknown outside of people covered by said flag.  The concept of non-binary is only slightly better known than the flag and the shirt does not, at a glance, convey anything about gender.  Ignorance or ill-attention explain most of it.

Assholes explain the rest.
That's a really cool hoodie
Because people are morons 🙃😑
There's a lot of ways of being nonbinary. Maybe the person was guessing and expecting you to correct them if you had different needs?
I love that hoodie! Where did you get it?
Love the jumper! Can I ask by the way where you got that necklace? :)
A lot of people still don't know what any of that means. I told a guy that my roommate and I use they/them pronouns, and he thought I meant we were a couple.
Coming from a blind person who resents the fact that I wouldnt be able to see this irl, I would imagine that either people just dont notice or dont know what it means. Im so sorry you keep getting misgendered and I hope it gets better for you
I have a have a genderfluid sticker on vehicle and nobody even has a clue what it means. People only recognize the rainbow.
A lot of people don't know what nonbinary means, and the flag is only really recognizable to enbies and their allies. I'd go with a pronoun pin if you want to give general strangers the best chance of gendering you correctly.
Most people have any idea what non binary even means. I didn't even know and I never even heard of the term until yesterday.

Someone was wearing a shirt that she sells in this sub and to me it would just look like it was just random blocks as the design. You have to give credit here. This is all so new.
I have a massive pin at work that says “MY PRONOUNS ARE THEY/THEM” and people don’t read it

Don’t overestimate others’ attention to detail.
add that even if your clothes did suggest a gender, i don't believe they do, i'd still be an ass for assuming your pronouns
Two things:

Firstly and mainly, most people don't know what nonbinary means. Even fewer of them know the flag colours. If you wore a shirt that said in big letters ""I'M NOT A GIRL OR A BOY. MY PRONOUNS ARE THEY/THEM"" and they misgendered you then that'd be on them for being stupendously unobservant.

Secondly, not all nonbinary folks like non-gendered terms and pronouns. For example I'm nonbinary and love masculine as well as neutral/non-gendered pronouns and terms. If someone assumed my pronouns were they/them exclusively because I was wearing the nonbinary flag I'd be pretty annoyed.
i got misgendered at pride once, and i thought that was bad. it LITERALLY says non-binary on your hoodie!
Idk
nothing about your attire gives me a clue about your gender
I didnt know what it was til just before i came out but im not the type to go up and read a small print on anyones T-shirt either
Where did you get that hoodie
Most people haven't even heard of Nonbinary as a gender term. We need a lot more awareness in the world
The hoodie says Game Non-Binary
Yeah... true
Yes!   

Typically I respond the following when people are self conscious about how they look. But it also shows how oblivious people are too.   

You want a mirror (bathroom or full length). You will want to take a step back from it about 2 feet. Then quickly glance at yourself. That is what people see when they ""look"" at you. It's not much and just major features.   

My other favorite thing to comment is about doppelgangers. When I use to identify as my AGAB, people would always tell me I looked familiar or had a doppelganger. But if you took a look, it was like comparing Mila Kunis to a Kardashian. Similar hair and skin color. But not the same. At all.       

They were only looking at the super obvious main features I have. So anyone who had similar features to those obvious things = my doppelganger. Even if when you looked at them compared to me, we looked nothing alike.
Yup. I'm pretty sure that is it, assuming they actually read the hoodie. Most people won't read your clothing, so don't expect them to have done so.
Exactly. Those in the service industries know this well. The general public aren't exactly bright.
Yeah, you don't have to use they/them pronouns to be nonbinary so it's usually better to specify.
Hmm, My parents bought me pride flags for xmas and a necklace came with the non-binary and trans ones... I'll have to ask them where they bought the flags
https://www.lookhuman.com/design/372116-game-non-binary/97200-black-md?gclid=EAIaIQobChMIv_nUn-vw8wIV03NvBB37gQiwEAQYASABEgLsl_D_BwE Got it for xmas
Bold of you to assume most people have the cognitive awareness to read things.

Jokes aside if there’s one thing I learned working at a convenient store, it’s the people do not pay attention to anything in writing.

We had a big sign at the door that said no public restrooms. I got asked where the restrooms where at least 4 times a day.

One of the doors was busted once and we had a sign on a pedistal, blocking the door, and people still tried to use it.

Sign at the register saying there’s never more than $50 in the till. Regularly had people try to make a $10 purchase with a $100 bill.

I don’t even have enough faith in the collective intelligence of humanity that most of them even understand what non-binary means.
not all non binary people go by 'they/them' though, if that's what they mean by misgendering.
A lot of people still don’t know what that means. Also, no offense to OP or anything, but without something that actually indicates the pronouns one uses… well, it’s not like we all use the same pronouns just because we’re non-binary. Makes it hard for people to just know sometimes.
Exactly
That's so sweet of your parents! There is zero pressure but if you find out please do let me know :)
Ty
Can also confirm. Work in a gallery and people grab and touch the art all the time (even with signs that say do not touch), push past signs and barriers that blatantly state no entry or special ticket required. I’ve watched people read signs that stand directly in front of them, in their face that say this doorway not an entrance, and walk around it. I’ve even stood in doorways to visually signal ‘you cannot enter’ and people still try to push past me.

Aside from that though, we are a minority. Most people on the street don’t know what our flag means (they only know the rainbow one) or what nonbinary is (frankly there are also lots of LBGTQIA+ people who don’t know because it isn’t part of their specific identity thus they might not self-educate or engage) and when we are immersed in our own culture and community in our own lives it can be frustrating when the signs seem blatant and obvious.

But then again, people can be so negligent and self-absorbed in public places towards everyone else around them, it’s hard not to be frustrated just on principle.
Yeah I work in retail at a big grocery store and the amount of people who ask me where the regular bread is / the bread asile even tho on the signs it literally says bread on it is insane. At the registers it's even worse people try to use cash when it says card only
I’ve been accused of staring at boobs when trying to read shirts, I usually ignore them now tbh
is this why my best friend is a dragon
True true. But the necklace doesn't have pronouns on it either
Yea I was just pointing it out
https://www.amazon.com/Eugenys-Nonbinary-Pride-Flag-Non-Binary/dp/B08ZD5G4KF/ref=mp_s_a_1_3?crid=2W88BTQ360UN7&keywords=nonbinary+pride+flag&qid=1640900868&sprefix=nonbinary+pride+fla%2Caps%2C441&sr=8-3 Here you go
The whole being entrenched in our own culture making things seem obvious is such an good point. It’s SO easy to forget that most random people have no idea that a NB flag even exists or even is aware if they know anyone who’s nonbinary.

Like I’m not nonbinary. I’m binary trans, but that doesn’t mean I can’t learn more about myself by learning more about nonbinary people and the concepts behind them. In turn I learn more about people who are different from me. Win/win.

Unfortunately it’s very easy to forget that not everyone feels that need (or even know to think about) to understand things, and sometimes you have to interact with them.

In some ways I’m thankful I didn’t figure myself out until later in life. It gave me a very solid base for the way I approach the general populace.

I really hope my whole point wasn’t swallowed up by that stream of consciousness I just spewed out haha.
Thanks a million :)

getting misgendered on a daily basis is lame but this theybie is about to get their pronouns tattooed!!!!		"Never heard about getting pronouns tattooed, sounds cool! Also, that's a very stylish outfit there!
Yessss!
I love your shorts!
Where are you going to get them tattooed?
oh you have given me the wholly cursed idea of getting ""She/Her"" tattooed on my forehead please someone be my impulse control
Bold, I like it! :) Would you show us the design?
Can we be friends and go together?
Theybie.  I like that.
Can’t wait to see the finished piece!

Am I justified in wanting to cut off a friendship with someone I've known for 4+ years because he 1) purposefully misgenders me after I've asked him multiple times and 2) constantly disregards my identity?		"I do not believe the length of a relationship has any bearing on its quality. You may have had your arm for your whole life, but if it is gangrenous it must be severed.
You are always justified in choosing who you want in your inner circle. This applies to friends, but also to family.
You're always justified cutting off people who refuse to accept and respect you, no matter who it is or how long you've known them.
Yes just yes
Someone who doesn't respect you isn't really a friend.
You don’t need to justify ending a friendship. If it’s not working for you that’s absolutely fine. You don’t owe people your friendship or time!
Yes, they are telling you they're no longer your friend. Listen and walk away.
Yes. If this person is intentionally disrespecting your identity, then they don't respect you.

You don't owe your friendship to someone that doesn't respect you.
Yeah, just because youve been friends in the past doesn’t mean he’s not actively treating you like shit now. Cut him out, he clearly doesn’t respect you and you don’t deserve to be sitting here questioning whether or not you should put up with that level or disrespect. Drop him
Just in case you needed any more validation: YES, you are most definitely justified in cutting out people from your life who are hurtful and harmful, no matter how long you’ve known them.
Yeah, I recently cut off a friend I've known since 2015 because of their transphobia.
Hell yes. If he doesn’t respect who you are, he isn’t a friend
Yes, that’s not a friend
Yes. Apparently this person doesn't care about you, and is only in the relationship because of what he gets from it. Don't waste your time begging people to care about you, it isn't worth it.
100% justified
I mean that's why I stopped talking to my entire family. I don't care how long you've known them. If they can't accept you, fuck it you don't need them
You can cut off a friendship for any reason or none at any time. You have no obligation to be anyone's friend.

Also, let's be clear, this person is absolutely not your friend. They are a bad person masquerading as your friend. A real friend respects and loves you for who you are and who you want to be, and would never purposefully torment you like this.
The same thing happened to me in November - one of my mates constantly dissreguarded my gender and constantly refused to accept my pronouns. Due to an escalated event with them, I have not spoken to them since. It is most certainly justified.
Yes, you are fully justified. They're constantly and willfully insulting you.
Throw the whole man away.
100% yes 

If you asked me if you are justified in punching him in the fucking throat, also yes 

Buut if you asked if you were justified in giving him a swift kick to the gonads…. Mmmm…. Lol jk still yes. Kick him in the balls.
I’m gonna take the less popular opinion. If you’ve known them for four plus years and just now started to change your gender, your friend might just be unable to shake the habit or doesn’t see it as a big enough deal in their mind. It’s a problem but it’s up to you if it’s a friendship ending problem or a you just need to be more assertive with them problem.
If you've known him for 4+ years and he doesn't respect your identity,, that's not a good friend.
Start misgendering him. Or just leave, you don't have to stay
Fuck em. My ex best friend threw a 6 year friendship down the drain by deadnaming me because I called her out for not showing up to work. Cis people who keep that in their back pocket are pathetic bigots and its always over the prettiest shit. He'll keep doing it if he knows it works.

I dont have friends except my partner since coming out and its still better than friends like that.
Yes
They seem to want to be friends with a version of you that isn't there anymore, and maybe never was, so that whole long friendship might have been a misunderstanding in the first place.
yes
Yes
They are not entitled to your friendship or to be in your life no matter the length of time or what they have ‘given’ you during the time of knowing them. If they do not respect and/or accept who you are, they do not deserve to be in your life. Period. It is completely justified to cut someone off if they continuously overstep your boundaries and disregard who you are. It’s not only good to cut out toxic people to better your quality of life and have better friends, but it also helps build confidence in yourself for standing up for who you are and enforcing boundaries creates a better relationship with yourself. If I let people walk all over my boundaries, not only are they disrespecting me but I’m disrespecting myself. Cut them out of your life! You deserve it.
Yes yes yes how can you be a good friend to someone who doesn’t even make an effort to see you how you see yourself?
Save yourself the pain and don't talk to him anymore if he really isn't assed to respect you :(
Don't worry about whether a reason is ""justified"" or not. If you don't feel safe and respected in a relationship, that's more than enough to cut it off. You deserve people that make you feel good to be around :)
You very much are
>Am I justified in wanting to cut off a friendship with someone

yep!

>because he 1) purposefully misgenders me after I've asked him multiple times

doesn't sound like a friend to me, then
I cut off years-long friendships because people were racist or homophobic when that bigotry wasn't directed toward me.

You are completely justified with cutting off a friendship with someone who won't respect you or your identity.
Absolutely
yes
What would you say to another trans person in your situation?
We are allowed to set boundaries with people, and anyone who is willing to hurt you like that does not value your time and friendship like they should. 
The world is harsh as fuck, we don’t need to further subject ourselves to any extra abuse or invalidate ourselves for the sake of anyone else’s comfort. 
Continuing your friendship let’s him know that it’s an acceptable way to treat YOU and any other trans person that has the misfortune of interacting with him. 
Be kind to yourself, you deserve better 💗
Yes
Yes. You are fully justified.

We get to choose to have people who respect us in our lives.
Block that toxic misogyny out of your life. NO ONE has the right to disrespect you as a human, no matter the relationship.
Yes. I was in a similar situation recently, and at the end of the day, I didn’t feel safe or comfortable to be myself around them, and that wasn’t okay.
of course you are, why should you be a friend with someone who is so ignorant and a bigot to you
Yeah I think ya are
RESPECT- if they use the wrong pronouns they are disrespecting you. relationships of any kind need respect
Yes. It is your life. You choose who gets to be part of it. 'Friends' family, anyone who doesn't treat you with the basic common respect you deserve, can go.


Blood ain't thicker than piece of mind.
Uhhh

Yea
yes
Not at all I ended 20 year friendship because the person flat out refused to ever use or acepet that my name was changed ""nope I will always call you deadname"". Bye to anyone who dose that on purpose my friends still mess up on name sometimes quick correct and move one the way it should be.
Without question
the biggest mistake i have made in friendship is thinking that just because it's been forever means it has to keep being forever
Do you honest think any of us here would tell you to tolerate blatant disrespect like this ?!
Yup you don't have to remain friends with anyone especially if they are disrespecting you
YES
You are the gate keeper.  
You chose who you let into your life.
Do not compromise.

In the long term, 4 years is nothing.
He clearly does not respect you.
Cut toxic people out of your life.
yes
You don’t need to justify not continuing a relationship with someone. If you don’t want to continue to be their friend you don’t have to continue to be their friend. No one is entitled to access to you.
If he was willing to keep a healthy relationship with you, he would gender you properly. If you think it's right go for it and cut it off.
Yes, perfectly justified. He does not respect you, why would you want to be friends with someone like that?
For me friendship requires respect and healthy communication. I would never presume to tell you what to do, however for me if I felt disrespected like that I would have to limit my interaction or terminate the relationship. 

Those who judge don't matter and those who matter don't judge
You don't need justification to cut off a friend. If you want to cut off a friend, then go ahead.
trust me cut them off ( it was the best thing i ever done).
Listen: it’s not going to be easy. It will hurt. Trust me when I tell you it’s worth it. 

I used to live with a group of friends that I knew for about 6 years and lived with for about 3. We were very close. I considered them family. We cried and laughed together. They were my people. Then I came out as nonbinary. For about a year I lived with the constant misgendering. “It’s hard to remember,” and a million other excuses. So I drew a line. Two days later they taped an eviction notice to my bedroom door. 

One year later, I don’t know anything about them, and I’m the happiest I’ve ever been. It will be worth it.
yes
There is no point in keeping somebody around who does not want to respect you.

  It is a toxic situation and will eventually bring you down.
You deserve better. Time to move on.
Yep. You have the right to cut anyone who fucks with your zen.
Yes, filter out any toxicity that you can, It has no place in your life.
You beautiful child... that ""friend"" is not a friend. A friend is someone who supports you and cares about you, the real you, not demands you be their idea of you who never was.

(I'm pretty sure this is basically a repeat of every comment here, but it demands repeating)
It really depends on how much you value the other parts of your friendship. I've definitely had friends who don't understand, but because they're very dear to me I take extra time to try and get them to understand how important it is to me and get them used to it. But if you find that the exhaustion or disappointment outweighs the other parts than you have no obligation to entertain them further.
My friend of 11+ years and her husband (friend of 10+ years) still don't acknowledge my transition on a normal bases. I don't know they've ever used my pronouns (they/them).

That being said I'm not expecting them to pick it up anytime soon. They also tease me about my pronouns on rare occasions and when they do I know they are coping with watching a friend change and come out their shell.

Sometimes people are worth forgiving
Yeah

Tell him that too

Go up to him, stand proud, and 

“Hey. We’ve been friends for a while, and I value our relationship. But, it’s clear you don’t. You are constantly misgendering me, my gender or pronouns are not up for debate or a request. You are going to start using them, or I can’t have you in my life. You need to decide if you value our friendship or going a little out of your way to wrap your head around a new concept more.”
Yes. Sounds like a shitty friend
You are definitely justified in cutting ties with people who deliberately disrespect you
You are more than justified. It's scary, yes, but I did the same thing with a ""friend"" I've known since freshman year to the very end of high school who was always toxic and actually yelled at me when I corrected my pronouns once during my own graduation party and said ""Look, I've always seen you as a girl, just accept it.""
You'd be justified in cutting off a friendship that just wasn't interesting. This is hanging out with someone who actively disrespects you. No need to feel bad at all.
Are you justified because he disrespects you? Absolutely. Anytime someone refuses to accept your boundary is disrespect and you need to enforce that boundary. You deserve people around you that respect you.
Yes
Yes, 100%
Do it. You’ll feel so much better
I’ve had shitty people end relationships on a lot less, so a genuine person like you should be alright to end it with valid reasons.
Idk about others but you have my blessing, cut that a-hole off and never look back 🙌
absolutely, he sounds like an ass
that guy can go fuck him self
Absolutely, if someone who you've known for a long time purposely doesn't try make you feel comfortable as yourself, especially if they do it over and over again,  you are fully justified to cut the relationship.
yes. i’ve done it. it’s not worth putting yourself through that just because “i’ve known them for so long”
Yes you are absolutely justified, a person like that holds no respect or regard towards you and your feelings. No one needs that kinda stinky in their life, you deserve better
yes
Yes you are justified. I cut off a friendship just a couple of weeks ago from a friend of 5 years because he wouldn't stop calling me derogetory words for being a femboy
If he does this to you after you've asked him to stop just cut him off. I had to do this to a friend, though we haven't known each other as long. We still kinda (almost never) talk. I just hope things get better for you.
Anyone who purposefully misgenders you isn’t worth keeping as a friend
You are absolutely and completely justified
I personally have never had patience for this when I've told them and givin ample time to adjust to what I've told them. It's like having someone close to you refer to you as ""It"". If your not important enough in their life, to where even the smallest form of respect can't be afforded to you, then I can't see how it's not justified.
Yes, without question. The 4+ years doesn't matter if this person doesn't respect you.
they do not value you as a person if they cannot respect your identity. how could he ever value your friendship if he cant even give you basic human respect? ✂️cut em off✂️
I’m definitely using this metaphor later, if you don’t mind.
Perfectly said. 
Also my brain said 
Me to my right arm* "" better not join any gangs or I'll to chop you right off.""
The classic metaphor, yea pretty much
Especially to family.
Exactly. I would have saved myself years of pain and stress if I had cut out a couple toxic people much sooner.
lmao...made me actually laugh out loud to the ""punching him in the fucking throat"" part
I've actually started transitioning in the past two years, but I came out to them and my other friends three years ago. I passed it off as adjusting, but he's gotten more aggressive lately.
Probs not the most trans friendly way to do it, but tbh this might actually help get some people to understand how it feels
Go right ahead.
Okay, I’m in favor of the popular opinion now 😂😅 I think you deserve better than that. I’ve cut off a toxic friend before. Just stop communicating with them.
I'm usually only for retaliation for empathy. This is what I do to my Narcissistic parents and it works more than not. And when it doesn't, walk away, they don't want to learn
Can you elaborate?

Edit: in the process of probably cutting my mom out of my life right now (it's her call if she'll go to joint therapy with me) cause she doesn't talk like she respects me, and can't see how the things she says are rude. I suspect my mom is narcissistic too.
When my mom would do some petty like trying to force food she hates into meals, I would do it to her. Of course, she would complain, and my response would be ""Oh yeah, I hate when people do that to me."" Shocked pikachu face. It took a while, but she realized I would respond in kind to whatever she said. I forced empathy on her. She still tried things on occasion, like she is testing to see if I dropped my guard, but it never works. I can *not* say it would work for you, but it's a good way to test how they react to their boundaries pushed."	skgwp3	NonBinary	596	1.0	2022-02-04 16:06:24
When a friend of yours is purposefully misgendering you and on the inside you're just like		"Guess they aren't a friend then.
That's not a friend, that's an asshole.
 where they at I’ll come borrow their knees in a polite manner
That’s not a friend, you don’t deserve that - look out for yourself and find better ones
Welp, time to make new friends and ditch that asshole~!
Yep, fake friend here! You deserve better!!! I was constantly misgendered by my Ex-friend and her excuse was ""she didn't understand it"" but understood it well enough to fit in with others, she did all this when we were no longer friends. These people aren't friends, they don't respect you

&#x200B;

Note: Sorry for the rant felt fitting though
>Purposely misgendering

>Friend

No they aren't.
Sounds like you need to update who you consider a friend.
not sure if ""friend"" is the right word for them
I have a friend like that. She gets mad at me each time I tell her ""that is transphobia"" because she does it to transpeople too, but only if she has known them for a long time. ""You will always be a girl to me because you have been a girl this whole time."" And if you list off what makes you not a girl that is just what makes you you. I know your feeling, and I wish there was a way to get my friend to also realize what they are doing is wrong.
Not your real friend, so drop that fucker like a rock.
""*Those beneath me can't insult me and those my equals wouldn't.""*

If they are intentionally misgendering you, they aren't your friend
'Friend'

I THINK YOU MEAN THIS PUNCHING BAG?
Not a friend then
Purposefully?? Nope. That’s no friend. I have a couple friends who aren’t out so I don’t use their pronouns around folks where there could be backlash, but this is something we discussed beforehand and I’m prepared for it. 

You need to cut off this “friend”. Especially if they haven’t even talked to you about it (I can’t imagine a reason they’d do it but you know what I’m saying)
That's a piece of shit, not a friend
ohhh not a friend at all
Nope, that's not a friend
Get rid of that friend, right now
Most definitely not a friend you want to have.
'friend'?
Your friend must show you basic respect or they do not deserve your friendship
Doesn't sound like a friend.
That's not a friend
I don't know the details of y'all's relationship, but this behaviour doesn't have to be endured. Whatever you feel for them, you must put your well-being and self respect first. Somebody who hurts and disrespects you like this deserves to be cut off, regardless of any history.
Where’s the friend here? All I’m hearing about is an asshole
Why are you friends with them still? They're an asshole
Ah, yes, a ""friend""...

*Against Me!* educated me to piss on the walls of the houses of people like that.
You can prevent this from happening with a simple technique known as murder! Not advocating it, simply informing you of the option.
i see a lot of people on this sub telling folks to just “drop” anyone who doesn’t make an effort to respect their gender. while this would be the ideal solution, not everyone has the luxury of having people in their life that affirm their gender. OP - if your life is filled with supportive friends and this person is just bringing you down, you should definitely reconsider if you want them in your life or not. however, if this friend is really special to you and you don’t have many other places to turn, you could try to have an honest conversation with them about why/how they are hurting you and how they could improve the language they use around your gender. if they truly care about you they may be receptive.
literally my brothers 🙃
*fiend.
Definitely not a friend if they are purposely misgendering you.
Not 👏🏽 a 👏🏽 friend 👏🏽
Hope u cut them off! Block
that's not a friend!
Cringe weirdos
Doesn't sound much like a friend to me
And on the outside you are just like: *blocking the asshole*
“Friend”
Please don’t mistake them for a friend anymore!
Dump their ass
Definitely not your friend.
That your ex friend did what???
A friend wouldn’t misgender you on purpose. They’re not your friend.
they are not a friend
Uh that’s not a friend buddy. I’m really sorry. Drop them for the new year. You deserve better
That’s not a real friend
they're not your friend
you should start misgendering them
Full disclosure: I'm not non-binary, I joined this group to learn more about non-beanies if I'm being completely honest. Def won't be posting, rarely commenting bc I don't want to impose on this space. That said...

My last relationship I was in they were non-beanie and even when we fought (which we did A LOT) I tried to make sure I didn't misgender them. It was hard bc I knew them since before they came out as enby. I can't say I never did, but if I did then I corrected and kept going. We broke up a few years ago but I still refer to them using they/them pronouns bc... that's still their pronouns whether we're together or not.

If your ""friend"" can't respect you as a person even when mad, they've got some growing to do. Could you teach them? Maybe. Is it your job to? Nah, but you can choose to.

I would ask questions if I thought my partner was in a good (enough) state to be able to discuss it, but for the most part I had to look stuff up online to better understand and de-program myself. Some people will put in the time to, others won't (sadly).

Up to you if this ""friend"" is worth trying for, but off the cuff call... well I'll leave it to you. Find people that will continue to treat you as who you are even if you're fighting with them.

Good luck! 💙
If they're not doing this for your safety, they're not your friend
throw the friend away
I wouldn't have any of that. If it happens again I'll rip their heart out and tie their arteries to the top of a lampost.
You have my axe
And my bow
Get crowbarred bitch!
That is a bully, not a friend.
Dump her ass
This isn't am instance of ""not making am effort,"" they said it's intentional. Someone who intentionally hurts someone like this is not someone anyone should have as a friend.
This is a good comment. It’s easy to say “you shouldn’t be friends with that person”, but real life is often more complicated than that. It’s a case-by-case basis
And my longsword!
And my flaming catapult
The ""case"" here is that someone they thought is a friend is *purposefully* misgendering them. Imo this comment is just affirming a constant trend of minorities being constantly pushed to put effort and and time benefit of the doubt labor into people that don't give a shit about their emotional well-being. There's not even the excuse of them being family here. I'm tired of being told and seeing others being told that we have to ""give people time"" when they're actively (and in this case *INTENTIONALLY)* hurting you. It's not a good comment at all.
It really isn’t that complicated though
And my improvised weapons!
How can you be so sure?
Purposefully hurting someone is toxic behaviour and fake friends like these should be dropped immediately. Otherwise it’s an abusive friendship. “Waiting” for them to change their mind is putting OP in a harmful situation so being more selective about their friends is the only way to be in a better position
If that’s their only friend, there’s a good chance that’ll make them feel worse than before. Or maybe it’s a conditional friendship - maybe they’re coworkers and if they stopped being friends it could be awkward, or they have the same classes. There’s a chance it’s a family friend, too, and that would bring up unnecessary complications.

The point is, it’s easy to say “drop that person” without knowing the history or context behind their friendship.
If the context was that important they would’ve mentioned it
They didn’t give any context tho
That’s what I’m saying

Got misgendered yesterday so this is my ✨affirmation✨ (they/them)		"oh don't worry about the misgendering thing. it's just a bug, the developers are still working to fix it. have a nice they!
Wow! You look wonderful! I’m sorry someone misgendered you, you are a wonderful they who deserves a world that is full of validation and happiness!
that sucks, I'm sorry you had to go through that :( regardless of how others gender you, you look cool as hell and are more powerful than any transphobe !!! have an awesome day!
Hey they 👋
I love your outfit so much
That's literally everytime I leave the house, it's almost impossible for me to pass because I'm 4'10
Cute muter fuka
Goth people is an instant join for this sub

First encounter with Reddit transphobes	I posted in a non-LGBT sub to vent about a family issue and mentioned, in *only one phrase out of a several paragraph post*, that I’m nonbinary.  And instead of people discussing the actual subject of my post?  I’m just getting a bunch of downvotes and complaints about “nonbinary is the new vegan” and “don’t fill your post with unnecessary info” and “oh you only said that for karma”.  I literally told one guy I only said it so I wouldn’t be misgendered and he fucking misgendered me to someone else a few comments later.  I want to cuss them all out but that would probably just cause more problems.  Ugh.	"I told a friend that I'd accidentally come out to my dad and he hadn't spoken to me in days. The friend's response? ""I don't think nonbinary's a thing!"" How helpful.
Try telling us here in this sub just what’s up. We would be glad to help if we can.
I went in and upvoted you,  downvoted the assholes.  And shit, that sounds like an incredibly rough situation with your brother.  Best of luck to you
A simple remedy don't mention you're anything other than cis on a non-LGBTQ+ subreddit most of them are full of losers like that it's why if and when I need to post on a non queer subreddit I don't mention I'm trans I just say I'm a woman if it's necessary
fuckin hell, people are rude sometimes and focus on words not related to the actual topic, i went downvoted the assholes. I hope everything works out with your brother.
Can you link the post? I didn’t see it in ur post history, I was just curious
I also had the same experience with aphobes, saying something along the lines of ‘yeah I know y'all exist but y'all can stop pretending you're lgbt, go find some friends to hang out with ’ -_-
[deleted]
Had a similar experience in another sub—I would just block them. They’re 100% not worth your time. Just cause they screech loud about how much they hate trans people doesn’t make them right, or the majority. In any case, sending you support and good vibes <3
What post? I wanna eat the transphobes
Kaveman, indeed.
Have some karma balance and remember, you're dope
I’m so sorry. It really is a very transphobic place a lot of the time, anywhere but here or other LGBT subs is full of it. :( you’re right when you say that reacting in anger will just fuel the fire. It’s really hard to ignore it, so I don’t have much advice except to take some time for some extra self care tonight 🥺❤️
Link us to the post so we can lovebomb it?
I feel this. I’m non-binary AND vegan and can’t talk about either. Fuck me for being my authentic self and kind to the animals, right?
Wait until they find me, a nonbinary vegan. I’ll blow their minds 

Srsly though sorry you’ve had to deal with that
Yeahh people are awful. And you shouldn’t have to go through that or need to defend yourself.

Maybe next time just block or mute the thread?
I went and gave some of those people grumpy downvotes. It felt weird. I like never downvote anyone… but they did deserve it. Other people constantly state their gender so why shouldn’t you state yours?
As a non-binary person myself, it can be hard to know how people will react. My mum, who doesn't always understand these things, bless her, even she wasn't judging me and asked what it meant etc, and hugged me after 🥺 I'm sorry you dont have people like that around you
Reddit is a site run by transphobes, for transphobes. The paedophiles in charge hate you but will try to claim that giving us spaces absolves them.
I'm also gonna point out that most of the time if a subreddit has True or Actual in the title, it's often a bigoted offshoot of the original version and the entire community is bent around bad faith and edgy stuff. I see so many people in the various trans subs with a similar story, and always so upset and affected by these people's words. It's long abandoned being entirely about venting something off the chest, and is now mostly for inflammatory posts. Also remember most of them are edgy teens, don't let them invalidate you. Fuck em.
I’m vegan AND non binary. I piss off a lot of people by simply existing.

Keep your chin up.
There’s a lot of bully’s on Reddit and gotta keep working to report them. Try and not respond report and block. It’s a process. I’m sorry this happened. You are real. True. And accepted!!
meanwhile everyone else probably puts 

i 24 f and my 32 m boyfriend went to the store and yadayadayada

always starting with that rather than the story, hypocrites, i dont want to know what your genitals look like in a story about straights not being okay but theres now a dog, i want to read the story and maybe know you GENDER for context
Yeah, people aren't going to like us for dumb reasons. Just do you because there's no reason to lose confidence over someone like that... I mean, the person hyper-focused on your gender after all.
Sucks that you have to deal with that. You're 100% correct. If that post had been identical except that it said 23m or 23f, not a single person would have said anything about your gender. I'm sorry you had to deal with that.
It's not like being non-binary is a new idea, so many societies have had more than 2 genders, it's just new to them and they can't get over the fact the world is more complicated than they learned in kindergarten
I also made a post and mentioned I was nonbinary and people were saying I was attention seeking
Oh trust me, everyone on this hellsite is either the most supportive person you’ve ever met, or a bully who says you’ve got a “victim complex” even though people are ACTUALLY OUT TO GET YOU. 

Remember: it can only be a complex if it’s delusional. You are not delusional. You deserve to be respected and cared for.
Yeah, I’m really loving this whole thing of “ignore the entire post for a single controversial phrase”.  FIVE PEOPLE have taken the time to either complain about it or defend the other people complaining, compared to the one supportive person and one person who actually addressed the post but mostly wants to learn more about nonbinary people.
Thank you!
About to do the same!
Mods here hate that.
Oh captain my captain
Good point.  It’s a little harder to do that when you’re nonbinary, but at least most people default to he here.  Personally I’d rather be called he than she.
Thank you!
Sure.  [Here’s the post.](https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueOffMyChest/comments/r7cvws/i_both_love_and_resent_my_little_brother/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf)  I used a throwaway because the sub rules said to create a new account and I’m not sure I want vents that might upset my family on my main account anyway.
!!!!!!!! I’m aroace too!!  We can validate each other!  (I’m so happy right now, you have no idea)
I totally just replied to your comment here thinking it was on my other post.  This two account thing is kinda confusing lol
Thank you!
Thank you!
You’re right, and I knew that.  Just my first time experiencing it directly.  Thank you for your support!
You might have found it by now, but it’s in my reply to a comment by PTfan, a little above you
Thanks!  It’s actually been kind of funny at times.  One guy literally just called me dumb.  I laugh every time I look at his comment.
Good advice!  Thankfully I’m getting actual advice now.  Possibly because I deleted the offending phrase.
I know, right?  Thank you!
IRL I actually do have quite a few supportive people—they don’t necessarily get it, and most of them aren’t great about using my pronouns...but that’s a different rant entirely.  Reddit is a whole other beast unfortunately.  Everyone here has been so supportive though!  I didn’t expect this amount of responses at all!
Ugh, I didn’t know that.  Thanks for telling me!
Thanks.  You too!
Thank you!
That’s actually why I thought to put my gender in the first place, I’d seen other people do it.

I ended up asking a couple people if they would have reacted the same if I’d put M or F.  One guy who’d been transphobic to begin with just downvoted me.  The other had been “defending a fair statement from people attacking it” (to paraphrase his words) and said he wouldn’t have said anything, but couldn’t speak for anyone else.
Thank you!
Wanna link the post? I'll go up vote and be on ur side- sincerely, your genderfluid NB pal
Thank you!
Just did too!
What assholes
I'd rather be called she than he even though I use all pronouns
Ouch. Sorry to hear and see that. I’m actually a cis person and but I have some people in my life who came out tans/ non binary. 

I used to make jokes and say bad stuff about trans and non binary people, but I’ve come to understand that it’s something that is just who you are, so for example I’m on the autism spectrum and a lot of people have been assholes to me my whole life. So why should I judge someone else for how they were born? I hated being made fun of so it’s not right to hurt others for literally the same thing 

A more understanding world and empathy is better for all of us. I hope you can shake the haters and enjoy your holidays
It's nice finding someone you can relate to haha :)
Any time, friend!
I did, thank you!
There’s two different links to it floating somewhere in the comment section right now.  You might have found them already by now, though.  Thank you for your support!
i want to do the same, but i can’t find the post! :( do you have a link lol
Fair enough.  I prefer he simply because I’m afab.  She is what I’m called IRL by people who don’t know I’m trans; I’ll take he if it means I don’t hear it yet again.
Thank you!  It’s always good to see someone change for the better, so thank you for putting in the work to do so.
Thanks I found it!
I posted a link as a reply to someone else but it’s probably lost somewhere in the comments now.  [Here you go](https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueOffMyChest/comments/r7cvws/i_both_love_and_resent_my_little_brother/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf) Thanks for the support.  Just don’t throw insults around please, some folks have been doing that and it’s not cool.
No problem! I’m still very far from perfect though lol. 

Regarding your other situation that sounds really tough. I would straight up not be able to deal with my parents adopting another kid and the focus being off me and yes I’m grown. I understand you can’t take him back to the store because he’s a person but it seems maybe he’d be a way better fit going somewhere else. I know that sounds really cruel and stuff but sometimes enough is enough and you were there first
thank you!! and i would never, i just downvote the transphobes and the mean replies
I reported those hateful bigots both to the sub mods and reddit.
I’m glad!  I’ve learned you can’t be too careful, unfortunately.

Have been getting misgendered so much lately - feeling more dysphoric as ever. It’s been a battle to not accept what people are saying and let them put me in a box. I don’t wanna be perceived as a “man”. I am non-binary.		"I really like the whole look, the eye shadow looks great on you
I think you look very good :) septums are the absolute coolest piercings imo
you look fuckin awesome. i would absolutely want to be friends w you haha. p.s- don't downsize the septum!!!
Your eyeshadow is beautiful (sorry if that's a too fem compliment) and your septum piercing looks great too.
I don't want to be perceived as female... Yet everywhere I go it's ""ma'am"" this and ""she"" that. It wears me down. Totally get how you feel.
i love that your eye makeup matches your shirt a little, the blue/green/yellows look really nice on you
you look beautiful (love the septum!), don’t let the world get to you
You look amazing! Hang in there. Prove them all wrong!
you look so cool! I get very queer vibes in the best way possible
Love the piercings!
Ahh you look so cool. I love ur whole style and I’m sorry that you have to deal with being misgendered :(
You just did that badass photoshoot the other day - go look at those pictures and fuck the haters! ❤️

Edit: I am so, so sorry that I have misremembered you as the person with the cool photoshoot I saw recently.  However, you are just so rad, so the fuck the haters part still works.

TL;DR: You're great and anyone who thinks otherwise is a bonehead.
Y’all are the shweetwest - reading all the comments got me feeling safe happy and validated. I’ve got nothing but smiles rn
I love your makeup, do you have any favorite MUAs? Dabbling more with it can be gender affirming.
You are a valid person. It's so hard dealing with it, especially a long run of people inducing dysphoria. It's not much, but I wajt to leave you with a quote from a Zen Buddhist's koans that I think about a lot:

**Some things, though right, were considered wrong for generations. Since the value of righteousness may be recognized after centuries, there is no need to crave an immediate appreciation.**

- from Zengetsu's *No Attachment to Dust*

You are NB, the truth of who you are is not invalidated by a world of intolerance. In fact, they ought to catch up with you, but they want to live in the world of yesteryear. The ignorant will still try to tear you down, but know that you're a great person, regardless of how others may wrongly prejudge you
Does the eye shadow match your shirt? Either way it looks cool as heck
you are beautiful!! don’t let anyone ever make u feel like u are not ur non-binary self. fuck all these bitches who misgender u. they ain’t worth any of ur time!!
you literally look so cool holy fuck??????
As a fellow non binary, who gives a fuck how people perceive us. We don't need anyone else to validate our gender except ourselves. I just see it for what it is and understand their point of view is just an old way of thinking
You're absolutely gorgeous and I understand perfectly what you're going through, I am very sorry people are misgendering you, you deserve to be treated with respect and accordingly with who you are. I also read that that's your first attempt at make-up? Good grief, give me some of your skills, that looks amazing! Have a good day and always try to be surrounded by people who get it, the internet is a very nice place to be sometimes<3
10/10 inducing that gender envy. You look awesome!
Friend, your cool!
I'm sorry :( It's the same problem I have with my boobs... you have facial hair and people automatically associate it with masculinity. Thing is, it looks good on you; and shaving it close would probably give you skin problems anyway. I can't bind because of scoliosis and asthma, so I can't change how I look very much, either.

If it helps any, I can definitely see both femininity and masculinity in your face... the gentleness in your eyes, the care you've taken with your eyeshadow, the artistic way your dreadlocks are dyed. I don't know if you're bigender, but that's kind of how I'm reading you. You're rather good-looking, you know. 

But take it from another person who often gets misgendered: Who you are isn't how you look; it's who you are in your brain, in your soul. You can look any way you like, and still be who you are. In friendly environs, I highly recommend a pronoun pin; in less friendly places, just stay safe.
You look like an enbie to me, darling. Chin up, you look fabulous. ❤
I am an attack gremlin and ready to smack anyone who calls you a man. I can be paid in goldfish crackers
Ty this was my first time attempting to do my make up. I want to get much better at it but would say overall it’s not bad for a first go
Aw ty ty - I’ve actually been thinking of downsizing my septum but I love it so much so idk yet
i feel like septums are the staple nb piercing lol
Its gotten so big that it just gets annoying bc it’s always in the way when I’m doing things lol oh also hell yea totally down to be friends!
No worries I actually love being called beautiful it makes me feel more at ease when I’m called beautiful
I try to put it in its place. We aren't normalised in society and the majority of people's brains are scanning others binarily. They see facial hair and it's an unquestionable signal of masc./male identity. Or breasts and it's an unquestionable signal of fem./female identity. I could be wearing a fucking dress, shave my legs, pitch up my voice, and have awesome makeup, but GOD FORBID there's facial hair cause then I'm everyone's trendy dude man sir bro. 

Would be nice if being non binary was in people's awareness more. Ever since learning about being non binary I realised anyone can be. It can look like whatever the fuck one wants it to look like. I aim for androgyny in presentation, and I'm fortunate to have been able to confuse passing strangers at times. But if I don't seem to balance out what I'm wearing vs how my body looks, it must lean too masc as that's how im referred to when ordering coffee etc. 

But i present and dress for myself first and foremost, and if anyone appreciates it then that's awesome. I just wish it would take way less for people to be like ""hmm not sure how to address this person as they could be non binary"" without wearing a massive THEY/THEM shirt, pronoun tags, telling people straight up. I don't feel comfortable with any of those things. 

I just want to live my life and be recognised as non binary, but it's not going to happen unless I make it super obvious. I don't owe that to anyone. I think a nice middle ground is to drop unnecessary gendered language. I hope culturally it's recognised how pointless it is. But then gendered language is super affirming for other people and that's valid to me. Arghh. I have no fucking answers.
I understand where people who misgender me are coming from it’s just exhausting. I’ve tried explaining to folks near me how to respect my identity but they just think I’m a “man” in drag.
Come to nyc and I’ll shower you in golf fishies
This is your FIRST attempt?! What?! Wow, you are already so talented. The shape of the liner is so impressive. Well done!
That's great! It takes a lot of people a lot more tries to get it this good. Hell I struggle to get it this good and I've done makeup for several years.
Do what makes you happy
It's the unfortunate part of being non binary transgender vs transgender in the binary. We don't get to pass or be affirmed by strangers unfortunately. It's just something we have to live with. That part of our dysphoria will never go away as it does for binary trans folk.
I know that feeling. I have the same problem with boobs that you do with facial hair. It's like you have to yell in people's faces about it before they'll realize you don't fit into the binary.
Yeah I totally get it. But at the end of the day, fuck em
XD happily!
Yeah, I'm suspecting they're an artist of some type... or at least artistic, or used to detailed work.
Im an artist so I just thought of it like painting -  thinking of make up as make up is stressful bc there’s so many things to learn about it
Yeah. At least it's somewhat protective... even if we'll never be seen as enby at first glance except by people in the LGBT+ community and allies (and sometimes not even then), we're less likely to be targeted for transphobic violence by strangers because we're less likely to be identified as trans. Not that it never happens... not that we don't get homophobic violence by people who read us as gay whether or not we actually are... But it helps us slip into the closet if we have to. Kind of a sad consolation prize, but you take what you can get, you know?

In the end, though, better to just stick together regardless of everyone's individual risk levels. Comparing who's worse off isn't going to do much good; we just have to work for everybody's benefit. And luckily, a better world for enbys is a better world for binary trans, and vice versa.
I'm gaining a sense that you're right. This is all new to me. Still feel like I know way more about myself now that I'm not lying to myself. Working on being proud of who i am and loving myself. Figure if i can do that then it doesn't matter what anyone thinks.

I don't want my pronouns respected	"I usually work remote but I went into the office today and got misgendered a lot. And it sucks because I'm coming up on a year of being on HRT and my voice has changed a lot. But I still get misgendered. and my boss has been really good about getting people to respect my pronouns and people apologize for not but.... that's not what I want

I realized I don't want people to respect my pronouns

I want people to see me as my gender and act accordingly. 

now, I realize that genders don't come with set pronouns. but people call me the pronouns of my agab because they still see me as my agab. so in some ways it kind of does, at least in cis society. 

it's just so frustrating. I hate that I'm filled with anxiety every time I go into work. I shouldn't have to over perform gender just to be seen as myself. I hate this."	"totally felt that last line as an enby who’s trying to present more masculine even tho i have long hair. like why i should i cut my hair to be seen as more masculine. this society is in shackles when it comes to gender.
I understand what you mean. I want to live in a world where gender doesn't mean what it means here. I want to live in a world where people see me as me.
Relevant tweet: https://twitter.com/leannekmho/status/1434481765305958401?t=roEuqwF6NVXAi_QGa-L3cw&s=19

for those who don't want to click, it's a super short thread by @leannekmho 

""when i ask you to use they/them, i’m not asking you to indulge my pronouns while you still view me as a woman. i’m asking you to pay attention, question, unlearn your ideas of gender to fit me in your worldview, which,,, news flash! it’s 2021 you should’ve been doing that already

which includes thinking critically about how you use gendered language not just for me but around me—addressing groups as ladies and gentlemen, making jokes about how men are like this and women are like that, assuming gender stereotypes about other people in front of me, etc.""

They worded it a little harshly (which is entirely justified, it's extremely frustrating!) so I wouldn't want to send this to a confused but wanting to be allied person, but reading this helped me figure out how to explain it to people who are genuinely trying but don't quite get it
This!!! I agree with this. I don’t care if a person who still sees me as a woman respects my pronouns, cause that’s not the point. I just want to be seen as non binary, genderless. If they can’t even do that, there is no point.
Honestly, I want people to call me by my name  – not my pronouns. I present my birth gender, and while I've accepted male pronouns, it doesn't describe me enough. Sure, I'm male, but I'm also not male. I'm partly female, and I'm partly something else altogether. I am me. Not a  set of pronouns.
This!! Tired of people memorizing my pronouns instead of seeing me as non-binary. Sorry you’ve got to go through this friend
I’d like to add, some people may see your gender as non-binary but may accidentally say the wrong pronoun. For example, if your thinking not to call someone he/she, and due to the nature of the word he/she being on your mind, you might accidentally say it. It’s happen to me in the past with a friend, and I felt very silly for saying something I wasn’t trying to say.
I totally feel that. Especially when we get new people at work. And I'm 8 months pregnant at the moment so it adds an extra layer of confusion to everyone who knows. Sending good vibes your way, you beautiful human.
ill take any and all pronouns, i just dont want to be treated differently because of percieved gender. i want to be treated as a person, not a male person or a female person.
I would like a world no one would dare even guess. Pronouns are literally always asked for, or neutral ones used.
I like your username
Wow ... You worded that so well! It hit me like a train.
There is a ungenuine feel when people need to be reminded to not misgender you. I can imagine the self-doubt and frustration this brings.

Sending my love, I hope the future surrounds you with less idiots and asshats. <3
Yes this is what I want too
I feel like this exactly. I just want others to see me the way I see me.
To be honest, I wish gendered pronouns didn’t exist. It would be so much simpler. I recognize that it can be validating for people to be gendered correctly by the language others use, but too often I find that it starts to feel a bit performative.

We want to hear others use the “correct” pronouns when referring to us, because it shows that they recognize our identity. But at the same time, people can be instructed to perform respect without actually believing it. Or even if there is a genuine desire to be respectful, it hurts when people have to ask or be corrected because it means they already see us a certain way.

Unfortunately the gender binary is so deeply ingrained in society that we can’t really help assigning a binary gender to people in our minds based on their appearance and voice. Speaking as someone who fully believes that the binary is BS, I still find it impossible not to do this. And that really hurts.

I don’t want people around me to feel like they’re walking on eggshells, or pretending to see me in a way they don’t for my benefit. Honesty is really important to me and I hate the idea of being treated like I have glass bones, especially if it’s only because PC culture says people have to.

At the end of the day I just want to be seen for who I am, and cis society makes that pretty much impossible. To me, pronouns are just another symptom of a broken system and should be phased out entirely. Abolish labels, abolish stereotypes, abolish gender. Okay rant over, cheers!
I agree!  I don't think using the right pronouns always comes down to respect.  I mean, you don't call it respect to call a cis woman ""her"" or a cis man ""him"" so why does it suddenly become respectful to call a nonbinary person what they are?
On a related note, I have the same problem at school right now.  I'm AFAB and like pretty clothes and accessories and though I've had top surgery I wear bulky sweater in cooler months to keep warm.  I wore a necklace with my pronouns on it, but no one really noticed.
I worry about that so much. I try not to think about it but sometimes it by gets to me
I can get behind the ""I don't want my pronouns respected, I want my gender respected"" - I have a frenemy who acknowledges me as nonbinary and transmasc, but is otherwise just ""too lazy to use my preffered pronouns"" (his words, not mine)
So fucking true I really resent having to do more to make people understand or accept me
i get that 100%
every time my mom misgenders or deadnames me or my brother, she says ""im sorry, i didnt mean it."" the thing is, though, she does mean it. she still sees us as ""the girls"" when thats not what we are.
add this to: things I felt but couldn't put a name to until someone else put it into words
afab here, and just got a buzz cut in an attempt to look more masc. not only did it not work, it somehow makes me look more like a woman. 

its like I'm giving off ""40 year old lesbian in a committed relationship and a mortgage"" vibes if that makes any sense.
ME TOO and it really pisses me off. If I had short hear when I bind and pack I would probably pass with a mask but of course the long hair tips people off. But I don’t WANT to cut it.
Yes this 👆
Agreed. That would be the thing.
Ooooh yes! This 👆
sure, that may be the case for some people, but it was not here. it's not a matter of something accidentally slipping up once and then doing it right, it's them misgendering me consistently, apologizing, and then continuing to consistently misgender me.
Oh. As NB and having carried/birthed two mini humans. It can be so confusing for other people. Just cause I decided to do that doesn’t mean I’m no longer NB. I remember hearing other pregnant people say things like, “it gave me an excuse to stop shaving.” I didn’t shave before, so… “Oh, you get to wear men’s clothes because they’re more comfortable”. Or even my husbands’ shorts. Nope, these are mine. I also had someone give me a couple nursing dresses that were so frilly, pastel, covered in a micro floral print. Donated those without even trying them on. They belonged on Little House on the Prairie."	qinyj3	NonBinary	550	0.99	2021-10-29 22:26:19
Boyfriend thinks I am faking being nonbinary.	I’ve never had someone be openly aggressive to me about me being non-binary before until tonight. It feels really bad. This person said people think I’m a joke for using they/them pronouns, and that I am definitely cis because I present cis. He screamed in my face. I don’t blame people for misgendering me because I have long hair, usually shop in the women’s clothing section, and wear makeup. I don’t ever correct people when they use she/her to me, even though it makes me uncomfortable when people call me a woman. I like presenting femme. But to have someone tell me my identity is just… a lie… hurts on a really deep level. That I am being a bad ally for identifying as non-binary. That I am stealing someone else’s identity. That I am a fake. It really hurts. And that other queer people are also questioning my identity. I feel insecure. I want to cut off all my hair. I don’t want anyone to look at me or think I’m a woman ever again.	"Thanks everyone for your supportive words. I have decided to break up with the boyfriend. This has just been one painful thing on top of many other painful things, and I know I deserve to have someone in my life who respects me and loves me for who I am. I reached out to a few real life friends tonight and they all agreed too. Breakups are hard but it will be worth it to stand up for myself and show myself some respect. 💕 Thanks again all.
I’m sorry you’re going through this. This is emotional and verbal abuse. Massive red flag.
Hello I am a they/them, masc-presenting AFAB enby. I don't own any make up or dresses. I have short hair and work in a male-dominated field.

You can tell your boyfriend that I think your identity is 100% valid, and there is no such thing as ""stealing"" someone else's identity. I don't even know what that means. 

Go return your boyfriend and get your money back.
I'm sorri 🤗

Honestly it sounds like he's afraid of you being anything other than cis and this relationship might not last 😥
Boyfriend sounds like an ass.

Edit: congratulations on dumping the jerk
Hey that’s a huge red flag. That type of behavior is completely unacceptable and would make me afraid for my safety. I’m so sorry that you are feeling so invalid and insecure after what he did to you. Please consider the fact that your BOYFRIEND  is the one making you feel so bad about yourself. Is that something you want in a partner?

Please sit down and think deeply about what you want in a boyfriend.  What would a loving and fulfilling relationship look like to you? If your boyfriend is not living up to that standard then he needs to go. The bare minimum in my eyes is not getting in my face to verbally abuse and invalidate me. Please be safe and look after your own health and happiness. His behavior is horrifying.
Ahhhhhh congratulations on being single now OP! Sorry you had to deal with that stupid ex
As an AFAB fem-presenting enby, I'm gonna jump in and say OP totally didn't steal my identity either. 

The search to find the poor enby whose identity was stolen continues, but things aren't looking good guys, we might never find them. OP, on the bright side, you are on your way for a brilliant career as a professional thief cause I must admit this first heist, although amatorial, was absolutely flawless :)

(In case it wasn't clear i was 100% sarcastic pls don't blast me thank u)

Also I'm happy to hear you dumped him lol
that's an unacceptable way to treat someone. of course youre valid <3
Ditch the boyfriend. You should never be yelled at for your identity, and honestly should generally not be yelled at at all (barring being about to injure yourself or others)
Heard you broke up with him, which I am glad to hear, because you deserve better. It's never easy to leave someone you love though, or even just someone you care deeply about. I hope you're doing alright. Just know you are loved and supported here. Also, you'll find someone who loves you just the way you are eventually, don't forget that - how you identify is valid and there is nothing wrong with it.
Good that you're breaking up. Not accepting you for you isn't something a partner will suddenly change. 

> that other queer people are also questioning my identity

Those people are assholes. Nonbinary isn't ""one"" thing...

> I want to cut off all my hair. I don’t want anyone to look at me or think I’m a woman ever again.

You can't control others, only yourself. Don't cut your hair just because others are jerks if you like having long hair. Even if you cut your hair off, some people will just find another ""reason"" to misgender you.
Hey I’m an AFAB femme non-binary who solely uses they/them but doesn’t correct people when they say she/her. I have long hair and shop in the women’s section because I think women’s clothes are cute. 

I’m non-binary as fuck. And so are you.
I have a boyfriend who supports my gender identity and doesn’t feel uncomfortable about me being myself completely, autism included.  I hope that you will find someone like that for yourself.
So glad you're breaking up. You don't need that negative energy in your life
dump his crusty ass and block him, i dont understand why you still stick around. he doesnt give a crap about you or how he makes you feel. im sorry for what he's put you through tho, your identity is valid.
Update: the deed is done. The breakup text has been sent.
I'm sorry that happened to you, I'm glad you broke up with him, he sounds shitty. You are nonbinary! Doesn't matter how you present. Just in case you need to hear it again.
I’m so sorry this happened to you. Your identity is not up for debate. 

This is also kinda the reason I’ll stay in the closet indefinitely. If my boyfriend acted like this toward me, I don’t know how I could cope.
Good riddance to him, everybody should be supported by people who love and validate them 💕
Fuck him. You could be AFAB and dress like a 60s women straight out of a kitchen utensil commercial and that wouldn't make you less of who you are.
A lot of people are saying break up with him. Don't break up with him - dump him. There's a difference.
I’m sorry you are experiencing this. As a mostly femme presenting non-binary individual who doesn’t advocate for themselves, I feel this in my soul. I just take the misgendering and laugh it off. I won’t speak out because I am non-confrontational when it comes to matters about me but I will speak out for others. 

Does this make you or I any less of our identity? No. I think it’s more of a reflection of the society we live in. Should we have to advocate for our gender identity when it is known? Should we be in positions where others knowingly misgender us and laugh about it? It’s harmful and kind of abusive and not okay. But whether or not you’re comfortable to speak against it doesn’t make you more of a “woman” or a “man”. You are still what you identify as. Their choice to accept that and behave is a reflection of their character not on your identity.
Good for you for breaking up with him. 

People can’t seem to understand that non-binary does NOT mean androgynous. It’s not a third gender that rides the line between man and woman. It simply means that you don’t identify as a man or a woman. 

Non-binary is in and of itself an extremely vague label, and IMO that’s a good thing. 

Im a non-binary person who very much looks like my AGAB, but that doesn’t make me (or you) any less of a non-binary person.
I'm so sorry. These aren't good friends or partners if they can't make room for the fact that nonbinary doesn't look like one singular thing and one can present differ ways and be nonbinary. You deserve room to express yourself authentically and be affirmed by people who truly love and see you. 

You aren't fake and you aren't invalid.
What a prick. Glad you're dumping his sorry ass
I'm so relieved to come to the comments to see you kicked him to the curb. Good for you. I present femme 80% of the time, still an enby. You don't owe anyone androgyny.
Tell him the only thing you’re faking is your feelings for him. You deserve someone supportive.
Hi, Im also nonbinary and present femme because well, making myself appear androgynous takes time, money, and effort that I don't have right now. I use any/all pronouns and mostly just cringe when someone calls me a woman or girl.

I'm sure others have said it, but I will again anyway. You don't owe anyone androgyny. Present how you want to for whatever reasons you want to. You aren't stealing someone else's identity. A huge point of being nonbinary is that you get to define your own expression, whether that's within or outside of typical gender norms. 

I'm glad you're dropping the boyfriend.
I just wanted to drop a comment to say presentation does not equal gender, and you don’t owe anyone androgyny.

I struggled with my gender identity for a while, finally settling on gender-fluid (though my personal experience is somewhat bi-gender as well), and even on days that I am male, which is most days, I present femme because I don’t feel like I need to reject “women’s” clothing in order to be a man.  The fact that I have dysphoria and would be willing to get my tits cut off is proof enough for me (though I’m not saying that you have to have dysphoria to be under the trans umbrella).

I read through some of the comments, and I’m glad you’re cutting off your relationship with someone so judgmental.  I wish you the best of luck moving forward!
I apologize 4 the queer ppl whom say such and wanna assure you that you're 100% valid.
You mean ex-boyfriend
The boyfriend sucks a lot and I’m happy you are breaking up with him. If you have no attachment to your hair and like the idea of presenting more androgynous, short hair is something I’ve liked and has made me feel better about presenting femme still as well :) most importantly though present however you want. Non-binary doesn’t look like anything, non-binary breaks the gendered need to stuff everyone in boxes. You can be a femme non-binary person. It’s okay.
How are you doing? I think we are all here for moral support 💜
I can tolerate a lot of wrong assumptions because there's much I'm not ready to share, and even more I am not sure how to share and show; but not from a partner. A partner should hear me, not scream my wrongness.
This person sounds hurtful and to be honest abusive. Very glad to see you decided to end things with this person. 

You know who you are, don't let assholes dictate to you who you are.
I'm sorry that other ""queer"" people think this as well. They're probably cis gay dudes lmao
Tell him to eff off and stop being such an immature twat, you deserve better. Presentation and gender aren't the same thing, and nonbinary is an umbrella term for a bajillion different genders, anyways.
Sorry this happened to you. You should never have to cut your hair or get a surgery or not wear gender oriented clothes or not do gender oriented things just to be “more non-binary.” Anyone who tells you any different doesn’t even know what they’re talking about. Doing any of the above will never ever make you less enby.
Yeah sometimes friends and family for me are like this. I mean they don’t try to misgender me on purpose but it’s not like an active practicing either where they literally identify me using “they/them” as part of their speech to me and I cut off all my hair so lmao. I identify as she/they because I think it’s too hard for most of them to use anything else. I am very fortunate to have a partner who supports me and even offers his clothes to me. Sometimes I get very agitated where I have to say loudly “I’m not a girl” like I did a few times at game nights. It’s not great that you’re being ignored (too). I definitely empathize with you. Personally if my partner wasn’t able to accept and support me, I don’t think we could be together. I think your boyfriend may have issues with it because it may make him feel like he needs to question his attraction towards you, which isn’t fair. It’s just odd he’d be so belligerent towards you like it’s hurting *him*. He’s obviously embarrassed but he should be embarrassed about himself and his behavior. It’s been a journey for sure but just know you’re not alone. ❤️🏳️‍🌈
I am an afab femme presenting enby (although I’m not trying to be femme presenting but people tend to gender everything and think that I am… but I did get called a tomboy by a cis friend who didn’t know I was enby the other day so that was a nice change despite being gendered lol!) 

Anyway.. I completely get the fears of people thinking your identity is a lie and wanting to change things about yourself for people to see you differently because of that. And ultimately if that makes you the most comfortable and happy with yourself, go for it. But don’t think that you have to in order to be valid in your identity as non-binary. Because it’s called called non-binary for a reason. And outside the binary doesn’t necessarily mean you present androgynous or as the opposite gender you were assigned at birth. You can present yourself and express yourself however you want without assigning a gender to it. 

Who said that long hair is for femmes and short for mascs and that’s it for everyone? That’s the same as saying pink is automatically a girls color. Gendering everything is creating a binary. Wearing what you want and expressing yourself however you want despite traditional binary gender roles is non-binary.
Your boyfriend is not respecting you, and he is not loving you for who you are. You deserve a partner who truly loves and supports you.
That ain't your boyfriend anymore. That is a pile of refuse.
Oh bb I’m so sorry that’s just terrible. I’m glad I saw your update and you left because the level of disrespect here is astounding. Be kind to yourself, your presentation is yours and yours alone. Keep looking however makes you happy!! Sending love and validation
Cuz your boyfriend's a b*tch! No seriously that's some terrible treatment, you so deserve better! You are non-binary, you are valid, and if you can afford that, dump him as soon as you can.
pls just leave your boyfriend, you deserve better. Honestly be glad its not your parents assumed that they think know everything about you when they really dont. Last year, I told my mom that  my gender expression Androgyous and you know i thought she took pretty well or so  I thought. but  I still having those questions about it  because I wanted to feel comfortable in my own body despite me not experiencing any gender dysphoria. When I found out about Gender nonconformity made feel like I belonged int the LGBTQ community 

&#x200B;

The one thing that made me feel disappointed was my mom telling me That androgyous means non binary just  because I told her that I dont care which clothes I would wear whether if it for a female or male I would still both.............. but shockingly enough this after when I told her that I was Genderqueer.........and well It didnt go so well my mom told me that Genderqueer means that Im a lesbian  and that I was accepting theses labels for no  reason. parents are gonna make damn assumptions about you when they dont know everything about. I didnt say her that Girls, identify as nonbinary, all I want was for her to accept my gender expression and Gender identity
someone once told me something that has stuck with me for years: breakups almost always suck, but they're also almost always *good* things. the changing or ending of a relationship usually signals a time of growth or healing. in your case, it sounds like this is learning that you deserve to be respected and don't have to settle for people who don't love you the way you are.

there's no such thing as ""presenting cis,"" although I think we all know what is meant by it. having long hair doesn't make you less nonbinary anymore than having short hair does. doing makeup or dressing fem doesn't make you any less nonbinary than having a beard or dressing masc. what's ironic is nobody would have said you ""present cis"" if you were amab. why do they thing there are different ways to present nonbinary depending on our AGAB? that sounds, well, pretty binary. ignore them <3
I breathed such a sign of relief reading this comment, no joke. Anyone who is comfortable screaming at their partner, calling them a joke like that is not someone who will provide a healthy relationship. You deserve so, so much better. It'll be hard in the short term and so insanely worth it in the longterm, I am so proud of you ❤️
I’m so relieved to hear that. I’m also so sorry that you had to be let down so badly by someone who is supposed to love and support you. I hope this is just one of many steps you take to actively bring love and happiness into your life. Its a hard thing to do and none of us are perfect, but you don’t deserve to be abused in the way your boyfriend abused you. Please always remember that 💜
I agree that breakups are difficult, but if the person can’t accept you for who you are, then it’s not worth it. You’ll make it work, and you have our full support!
Good on you sweetie! If he's able to treat you like that once, he'd probably do it again, and you deserve better! Remember, no matter how femme or masc you present, you are 100% valid!❤️
Best of luck love, breakups hurt, but yeah, sometimes it's the thing which has to be done to preserve your self worth. 💜
I'm so glad to hear this. Sending all the good vibes your way.
Good for you OP <3
People suck 😥
Yes! So sorry you had to deal with that. You are valid as you are and your identity is yours to decide. Best wishes ✨
Life’s too short to stay with abusive and non-supportive partners. You made the right call. 💖
Proud of you!
Your identity is your own and I’m proud you stood up for yourself! I hope all the happiness to you, and thank you for being an inspiration in our community! ❤️🙏
You deserve happiness and supportive relationships - the right people are out there and are able to love you as you are. I’m 48 and have been happily with my wife for almost 13 years when I finally put the obvious pieces together that I was non-binary. She was and continues to be supportive and loving and understanding. And accepting as I slowly navigate my way through this, switching to he/they, etc.
It’s good that you broke up with him and tho it may be hard you don’t need that toxicity in your life. You will find someone out there for you I believe in you.
I'm so glad.  My first thought reading through this was ""holy shit why does the title not say EX-boyfriend?!?""  Nobody deserves to be treated like this, and ESPECIALLY not by their partner.  If your partner isn't affirming your gender identity, they don't deserve to be your partner.
Good for you OP! He sounds ignorant and hateful. Good riddance
I already know this sub has got your back, but I want to be another voice telling you that you are valid and you deserve so much more than what this person is giving you. Sending you so much love and strength- it will be difficult but you deserve better.
wdym ""red flag"". Instant Break up
This made me smile. Thank you. 💕
Afab, fem-presenting enby, here too. Nope, my identity is also safe.
Yes! Exactly! My most complimented shirt is from the boys section (not mens) does that make my 30 yo ass a little boy? 

I have to remind myself all the time too, especially when I wear makeup, there's no way to present nonbinary.
Honestly kind of shitty. I do feel super validated by everyone who has commented, I am not at all doubting my identity, but my feelings are really hurt by the boyfriend. I am a non confrontational person and I have been trying to work up the courage to try to talk to him to break things off, but it’s so hard. I am also worried he’s going to make fun of me to his friends (who are also my friends) and just afraid of everyone talking about me behind my back about my gender identity being fake. I feel a little traumatized tbh. I don’t want to be yelled at again.
> having long hair doesn't make you less nonbinary anymore than having short hair does.

It makes you more metal, lol. General length of hair being gendered is silly.

> breakups almost always suck, but they're also almost always good things.

To put it another way, breakups suck, but so does being in a relationship where both people aren't happy.
nah Life and people suck the most
I don’t think they disagree. A massive red flag definitely constitutes instant break up
Yesterday I neatly folded my identity and put it on a chair, but today I can't find it. OP must have stolen it. :P

OP, glad that you are getting away from this person! I think he is deeply misogynistic and loves feeling better than women. That is a reason why he gets so aggressive when you want to get out of that little box.
Crap, the mystery deepens
Exactly. There is only societies expectations, which the point of enby is to shatter 💜
Do you live together? If not, I'd say do it over text and if your friends get gossiped to, show then this post.
Yeah I know, I just heard ""Massive Red Flag"" for everything on r/Tinder
I as well, I swear I put it somewhere, but I just can’t find it anywhere, I have my sneaking suspicions about OP. Just kidding, what’s my gender (*can be*) your gender. Anyone who gets mad at you for “stealing their gender” doesn’t know how gender works. As long as your gender is what makes you comfortable, then that’s all that matters in this sense.
I did it by text. I completely cut things off and said no contact.
Alright, well probably don't take social queues from r/Tinder
Good for you! You doin okay?
Yeah, hanging in there. Luckily I have like three friends that have been talking to me through the process so I don’t feel totally alone. I have pushed people away a bit in the relationship… but luckily I have some really awesome friends that know I’m NB and support me all the way.
Good, I'm glad you have support!"	11pvntq	NonBinary	532	0.99	2023-03-13 01:03:47
"My parents say that i ""won't be taken seriously"" when applying for jobs because of my chosen name on a CV"	"The title may come across as my parents only trying to ""protect me from discrimination"", but read the post for context. (TLDR at the bottom)

I (16) am non binary, and have been identifying as such for three years. my parents are not supportive and continually misgender and deadname me on a regular basis.

I was in the middle of writing a CV as i want to apply for a part time job over the summer (in like a bookstore or a school shop) and i asked my mom to quickly review it to see if there was anything i should add or remove from it. After giving me tips, she noticed my name at the top of the document and told me to change it to my deadname as they ""wouldn't possibly take me seriously with a name like that"".

i prefer not to share my name online for privacy reasons but my chosen name looks like a nickname for my deadname, so it won't be as obvious that i am a trans person but whilst still making me feel comfortable with the name as it is different to my deadname.

my dad agreed with her and told me to change it as it was not ""formal"", everything escalated into an argument. it wasn't even about the job anymore, it was the fact that they don't take my gender identity seriously as it's ""too hard"". it's really not a big ask. i'm not even going to come out at the workplace. literally my tutor, year head and the deputy principal of my school call me my chosen name when that's in a formal setting lmao.

i know i'm valid and they're simply ignorant people when it comes to being transgender and lgbtq in general, and quite frankly they'll never learn, but it's just really hard when you have your primary caregivers trying to dictate who you are and what you should be just because you're their child. i just want basic respect from them.

tldr: i'm aware that the possibilities of facing discrimination as a trans person are there when it comes to jobs, but i'm not exactly outing myself as a trans person at the same time, just as someone who doesn't go by their birth name. my parents think this is an extremely big deal and demand that i use my deadname as i ""shouldn't be taken seriously for my chosen name"" and they mock me for it, not for my protection or anything.

EDIT: i didn't know until now that the word 'transgenderism' is a derogatory term, so i have changed my wording in the sentence it was in - my apologies for that!"	"Put what you want to be called on your resume and job application. Put your legal name on things related to taxes. Any company that would pass judgement on someone solely because of their name isn't a company worth working for anyway.
Will some places judge you on that? Yeah. Do you want to work at the places that won't hire you because of that? Probably not.
I'm NB and used to work in HR.

Weird names get noticed, yes, but I can't imagine it would be judged. If nothing else, those names are more often birth names given by parents than chosen names, not to mention folks from other cultures.

I seriously can't see it being an issue, even a trans-phobic place wouldn't flag it because they'd assume it's your birth name until told otherwise.
[Dr. Marijuana Pepsi](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marijuana_Pepsi_Vandyck)’s name—which she was assigned at birth, not that it matters—didn’t hold her back.
I have my preferred name and pronouns on my resume and have gotten work with it. It's possible it will affect the hiring manager's opinion, but so would any other information you choose to list which could appeal to an internalized bias. 

It's just as likely to make your CV stand out as memorable and indicate authenticity.
If I waa an employer and wanted to employ a 16 year-old for the summer I would be okay if their name is Toe or Kelp or whatever. I just expect you to do your entry level job
I mean, my NB child's (12) legal given (by me) name is River. Names are wild now a day anyway. And any parent who says accepting you is ""too hard"" only sees you as an extension of themselves and their ego. I'm sorry your parents are like that. Hopefully, they will come around, but know there is a bug community who loves and accepts you.

*Mom hug* (if you are comfortable with that)
While such discrimination is *probably* illegal, that doesn't mean you won't face it. Realistically, it will reduce your options. That said, it will also help filter out some nasty work environments. Ultimately I'd say it depends on how badly you need the work.
They can fuck off tbh.

Put the name you want to be called by, I doubt anywhere would judge you negatively or take you less seriously for such a thing (and if they did, they wouldn't be worth your time in the first place)
It used to be “cover up tattoos” and other things like that.  Clearly not applicable in this day & age.  Times have changed and you’re right to put a name you’d like to be called on your resume so that if you get the job you can be known by that name.  Otherwise it’s confusing!
[removed]
I worked with someone who only called herself ""Bug"" so I think you'll be fine. She owns her own business now, the name suits her and while I'm aware of her birth name that's just a legal matter & it is just not her name, her name is Bug.
You put your name on that resume.
If someone discriminates based on a name you probably don't wanna work for them anyway.
Start calling them by their first names. 

They will correct you and say it’s their preference or a matter of respect. 

…tell them to do finish that start.
As a professional adult I’ve applied to jobs with my preferred name (I don’t say it that way just put it in the name spot on my resume) and pronouns on my resume and companies that don’t want to hire me automatically self select themselves out. Also have a chosen name that looks like a nickname for my legal name so should be fine
My CV also contains my nickname derived from my birthname and during the sessions revolving around CVs I've had at uni lately none of my tutors or the external professional running the optional sign up workshop specifically about designing a good CV had an issue with this at all.

It's like someone called Charlotte putting Charlie or someone called Robert putting Bob - if it's clearly derived from a longer birthname and is what you prefer to be called I really don't see an issue with it, especially for a Summer job as a 16 year old.
I think applying for my Job with my real name and pronouns actually raised my chance of getting hired.
Oh lord. Listen, a guy named Spoon ran for my local town council last month. It's fine. You're fine.
My name is Pluto my parents told me no one would hire me with a name like that ive had no problem getting hired. None at all. Our parents are transphobic and ignorant for thinking a name is enough to prevent you from getting a job. Do what you need to to be comfortable, how are you supposed to stay mentally healthy if you have to be deadnamed almost daily.
Its hard to say without knowing the name, but let's say it's a short version of a common name such as someone going by Jackie instead of Jonathan or Jacqueline. 


There is bias in job applications based on names (gender, race, nationality,  etc) but I think this vs ""sounding professional"" can more often be a concern when it comes to say hiring white collar profession jobs.  Might a hypothetical ""Jackie"" get turned down for a judge clerk job over a ""Jonathan""? Maybe. But you are talking about like an entry level retail job. You can look around the store first and probably get a sense of the gender/age/racial diversity of a place, and see that for plenty of such jobs will not care about something like a name.  


This isn't to say none will, since some retail can be toxic in all sorts of ways.  It's also certainly not to justify bias in any job.  No one should be judged for their name, gender, orientation, race, etc, but yes it does happen in the real world at all sorts of levels.  But my experience is that at the retail level they care far more about can you show up on time and not lose your temper at a customer. 


This sounds more like (a) your parents like your deadname and (b) are trying to sway you back towards using that full time or at least out in public. Maybe they feel it reflects badly on them, or they don't want others to find out.  Either way it's kind of a backhanded way to put pressure on you to use it, and I'm betting 9/10 times your chosen name will be fine. You could ""compromise"" by putting on the resume you show them, but submit your own name when you actually apply, if that keeps the peace.  If this job will have a name tag (very few do but some will), that can be it's own battle then.


Hope that helps, sorry for this situation and good luck with whatever your new job ends up being.
If you don't get a job because they are transphobic towards you(because that's what it is) then you don't want to be working there anyway.

While illegal in many place, discrimination does still happen. Probably less of an issue for summer entry level jobs. Nicknames are common, and I've also known people with odd legal names. 

Sucks about your parents, working as a clerk in a bookstore isn't that ""formal"" of a job. Queer people working in bookstores definitely isn't uncommon.
 There are people who will accept you even though your parents don’t. Some of the best “gender affirming” comments come from new people calling you exactly what you ask them to. Things will get so much better for you.
Most jobs I've applied for ask for my legal name and then have a field where you can enter what you're called. My LinkedIn has my legal name as well as my preferred name. If anything, it's useful because if someone calls and asks for ""Legalname"" I know it's a scammer.
First of all, you’re not applying to be executive vice president of a Fortune 500, you’re applying for a shitty retail job that probably pays minimum wage. No one gives a shit what your name is. (You WILL, however, certainly face discrimination for being trans throughout your career and even now.) Most people get jobs because they know someone. Do you know anyone who works where you want to work? If so, ask them to get you a job. Many don’t require a resume, you just walk in and fill out an application (or do it online). Use the name you want people to call you. 

(Side note: you’re not writing a CV - or curriculum vitae, which means ‘life’s work’ -you have no life’s work. You’re, at best, writing a resume, but if this is your first job a resume won’t have much on it. What you DO want to get across is that you’re serious, you’re a hard worker, and you won’t flake on them by not showing up or coming in late. You can list any relevant skills or interests you have, like ‘avid reader’ for a bookstore. )
As a hiring manager of many years. 
Your father is speaking from a different time. 
I assure you that you will be fine. 
And in fact better to use the name you want to be called. 
It's very confusing to do an interview or hire a ""Lawrence Smarmy McFancypants III"" and then try and remember to call the person Cole.
I recently went through a hot second between jobs and doing job apps. I put my pronouns (he/they) on my resume. I got hired and I'm starting my new job on Monday.

Job applications are a two way selection process. If you see red flags (like signs they don't respect queer identities, or racist hiring practices, etc) then that's your signal that this is not a healthy environment to work and thrive in. 

If somewhere won't accept you for who you are, you should find somewhere else to be as soon as you safely can. This applies to jobs, to parents, to friends, and damn near everything else.
I do a similar thing where my chosen name is essentially a nickname for my legal name for many reasons. I've never once had an issue with any employer using it as my name and I never had to out myself. The only issue I've run into is if I'm on a phone call some people think I'm saying Beth and not Beck and it makes me wanna die inside lol but really not a huge deal. I just really pronounce the k now. Apparently people don't know how to listen in person either cause I gotta repeat it like 3-4 times sometimes and it's like???? There's literally a musician with this name come on now. Y'all never heard of the letter k?

Anyways lmao, you'll be okay, ignore them. As long as you use your legal name for legal documents that's all that matters. Most employers ask what your preferred name is anyway for your name tag cause a lot of people go by a nickname.
bruh... these modern moms will name their kids everything possible under the Sun. im sure your name isnt the issue at all
If you named yourself, idk, Zagreus or Arson or something I would consider also picking a “work name” that feels decent to you. It probably WILL reduce your job options a bit and might lead to annoyances at work if people pester you about it. 

If your name is something that someone could feasibly have been given as a birth name, though, they’re just complaining about it to complain.
My college roommate was named something that looked like a nickname. If you have a name that is really out there or extremely goofy, I could understand your parents being concerned. However, I think that anyone who is hiring a 16 year old is probably not going to freak out if you are named Van or Li. Good luck with your job!
The way to protect you from discrimination is to do something about the discrimination.  Victim-blaming serves no one except the establishment. 

She's projecting her own bigotry. ""We assume of others what we know of ourselves.""  She knows she doesn't take you seriously as your name, and so assumes no one else will either.

to be -very- precise, most minors do get stuck with the shit name their parents chose for them, but! even the cis can change their names. it's just that parents don't like that. i've noticed that some parents take it as a personal affront if you don't keep the name they gave you, and sometimes has nothing to do with the kid's gender(s) and everything to do with the parents' egos and their perception of their child as an extension of themselves/achievement, so. .... there's that™
use your name.

if a company is going to discriminate against you for that, would you even want to work for them?
no.
I'm openly non-binary at my job. It's a corporate job in the game industry and I've been met with open arms for the most part. I say 'for the most part' because if people have an issue they are keeping it to themselves. 

Will you come across jobs that will judge you and not hire you because of this? Sure, that will happen even if you remain what your parents want you to be. People judge others, it's a fact across the board. However, additional risks come for us, mainly in the safety department. Only you get to decide what you will risk to be who you are. 

I risked my career, and have no regrets. I was prepared to be quietly shifted out, but I've gotten many commendations for my work instead. 

My advise is know the risks and understand the consequences your decisions can have. Then make the best decision for your life. I get you are not an adult yet, but I think we need to let kids make decisions as they get closer to adulthood. In just 2 years you will be a legal adult. 

The world can be a cruel place but it's also filled with so much beauty, tolerance and inclusion. You just have to find where you belong. 

I wish you all the luck OP!
When I applied for my job I put my birth name, thankfully I have a birth name that has like 1000 different nicknames so everyone always asks me "" so do u go by this or this ECT"" and I always can tell them my chosen name, I go by it at work, they don't know that I'm trans and Im scared to tell them (not because I'm scared they will do anything it's just not something I like doing) but on everything important
Your parents are wrong. Put your chosen name on your resume and application. When you are hired, give your legal name on your tax forms. I have the nickname version of my legal name on all of my resumes, email address, etc. etc.  It's what I go by. My legal name literally only shows up on tax forms and doctor's paperwork. 

If they won't get off your back about it, you can tell them to check the Ask a Manager blog, as she'd say the same thing.
Unless your chosen name is something like Princess Bubblebutt - which I highly doubt, based on your description - your parents are just being jerks.  Put whatever name you want people to call you on your resume.  I sometimes put *Legal first name (Nickname) Last name* on mine but that's because I'm ok with both.
Hi! I have a name that is different from my legal name. I put my name and pronouns at the top of my resume and when I’m offered the job I let HR know that I have a different legal name they need to use for legal documents. My mom was confused by what I do when this came up and I explained it to her as I just did. It’s really not a big deal. Some older folks think it’s a huge deal and makes it difficult but it’s not. I just make it clear that my name is my name and use my legal name only when I have to. Any respectable organization will take you seriously.
My name is a gender neutral portion of my birth name (think like ‘Sam’) - I am in my 30s and work as a graphic designer in a corporate finance environment. No one has ever had an issue with my name. People generally don’t care unless they struggle to pronounce a name, and even then it’s embarrassment at their own struggle in that case. 

In my casual summer jobs I worked with a “Moss” - no one was concerned by that name either. Most managers dealing with teenagers are accustomed to working with younger people with different ideas of “professionalism” and having a name you like to be called is normal. IIRC, my last University job made you fill in your preferred name - you had to type out your full name if that’s what you want. If you have to, print a copy with your deadname and let them see that - then hand out your actual name to actual jobs.
Put your chosen name. I have plenty of friends and former classmates being taken plenty seriously as lawyers using their chosen names. Because it is their name.
i can relate to this, i’m going to college in the fall and my parents are not happy about me wanting to live in gender inclusive housing
My mom said similar things when i was writing up my cv but she added that my legal name is required on a cv. I searched up on Google and it gave me several results that you can put your preferred name on your cv, no ""legal name required"" bullshit.
Just put your preferred name on there, parents can't do anything about it.

Edit: This is just a thing i noticed but the cv's with my preferred name were more accepted than the cv with the legal name.
I put my dead name on job applications because I thought it was illegal if I didn't 😭
Tell your well-meaning but stupid parents that I legally changed my name to Rizzo and got into a graduate program as a medical laboratory professional and all my clinical rotation sites love me and call me by my REAL (chosen) name. I've worked in multiple hospitals as Rizzo, both before and after it was my legal name. 

Discrimination 100% exists, but it's also societally frowned upon to discriminate against people. People (hiring managers) like to think they are good, reasonable people, and so try not to discriminate (if they are not raging assholes). 

If you expect discrimination, you will see it everywhere. If you are open to letting people surprise you, you will discover that people are willing to look past what they don't understand a lot of the time. Don't let the media make you believe every trans/enby person is struggling. The fact is, a lot of us are thriving.
Sounds like you got a good head on your shoulders, I’m sure you’ll manage to get one of the jobs you’re going for! And like a lot of others said, any jobs that wouldn’t take your name seriously aren’t places you want to work at anyways. Sorry your parents aren’t getting that.
I have never put my legal name on any resume or CV, I’m 30, and I’ve had many jobs here and there. From part time jobs when I was younger to career jobs.

It sounds like you’re already aware BUT their reaction is definitely based on their own issues and inability to accept you for who you are. Be you, put your real name (not your dead name), go forth and see how many people will accept and respect you!
Ugh you meet cis people with bizarre names all the time and they get hired no problem. It sucks that your parents are like that :/
I (nonbinary adult) initially read just the tldr and I wasn't going to comment because you have received some good answers that I agree with here, but after reading the whole post I realize that your parents sound similar to mine in some ways, and I could share my experiences with them with you. 

My parents were always very controlling. My mother dictated what I was to be called when I was younger. She had specific rules about it; I was only allowed to use nicknames she allowed. Needless to say, I've had to have them on an information diet for what I'll tell them about my thoughts and feelings. There are other reasons for that which I shall not get into here. 

Among the feelings I never had the guts to share with them (until recently) were my feelings about my gender. They don't accept me and are uneducated on all of this stuff. They would never consider using my pronouns and they constantly misgender me. They won't be open minded enough to allow me to inform them of what the truth actually is about these things, and so they will probably continue to be bigots. They also have this thing where ""humor is when we make fun of everyone we say we love, laugh about it, and you can't say anything or do anything because we'll be hurt that you took it seriously."" They'll make fun of funny sounding names, dyed hair, look down on people with tattoos and people who don't believe in their religion ... Most of it absolutely falls under the categories of racism, xenophobia, and transphobia. Because of all of this, my parents will hopefully never know my chosen name. 

About showing your parents your CV: depending on how old they are and when they were last applying for jobs, they might not be the best people to go to for advice. They may have some very old fashioned ideas that aren't really relevant anymore. You also already know that they don't accept who you are, and they are purposely hurting you by not using your chosen name and pronouns. I hate to be the one to suggest this as it is a very painful thought to have, and anyone would want to believe the opposite of their parents, but your parents may not have your best interests in mind. My parents have an agenda. That includes trying to get me to follow their religion and keep control over me. I don't know your parents so I can't say what they want to do. But please be aware that not all parents are the loving people they claim to be.
“Not being taken seriously” is shit that cissies love to hold over our heads. I say, fuck it. Apply with your name, man. If you send out numerous (and I mean maybe 10) applications with no luck, then maybe switch it up. You’ll never know if you don’t try. Chances are, since you’re 16 and applying to a summer job (and you didn’t mention it being work-study or an internship) it doesn’t matter what you’re name is.
As someone who's been in change of hiring, I can tell you that the name is nearly the last thing I look at, and frequently forget the candidate's name in favor of looking through expirience.

You name isn't going to hurt your chances, finding a job at 16 with no previous work expirience will though. The toughest hurdle is getting that first job, but it's going to have nothing to do with your name. As someone who's hired high schoolers- make an impression, be kind, be eager, be enthusiastic, and it's okay to reference that you are nervous at a job interview. 

Best of luck, and sorry about your parents. Peace and love- they likely have no idea what it's like nowadays. 


On a morally grey note- I'd be most likely to hire someone like you out of other equally qualified candidates.
Inclusivity hire feels bad, like being a token, but God damn is that a real phenomenon AND a foot in the door. It's okay to use it, and I'd encourage it if the company/interviewer feels like an ally.
I haven’t changed my name, but I am in a highly professional position and out as non-binary. They’re full of shit, and you’re absolutely fine.
I used to work for the state government (parks & rec) with a preferred name as well as my legal one.  If the old park rangers could handle it and the state bureaucracy could handle it, I bet pretty much any job you pick can handle yours too.
I put my chosen name on my résumé’s when I was applying for jobs. It also sounds like a nickname. (My legal name is now the formal version of it but I still go by the nickname all the time and would still put it on a resume.)

It never caused me any issues.
Honey, I work in CONSTRUCTION, and these burly, hairy, sweaty, constantly-spitting dudes and dudettes have ZERO problem calling me by my chosen name. I'm starting to find that many of these companies now have a place in their record keeping specifically for chosen names. I've worked with hundreds of different people at this point and exactly one person gave me a hard time. So I stopped working with him. Your parents are lame and making up lame things to try and keep you from doing your thing because they don't want to be embarrassed. They aren't actually worried about your feelings at all but they don't want to admit that. This is a really common way people try to ""nicely"" control people they are close to.

Tldr: You do you, boo!! You's a star!
Do it anyway. You don't want to work for someone who wouldn't hire you for your name anyway.
I always put my prefered name/s (I still haven't decided on a name but i usually put the name I am currently using/testing) on the very top in big font on my resumes. And then i put the legal stuff and contact info in the smaller font under it, like my legal name, my email, and phone number. I also include my pronouns. 

(Name)_______.

(Pronouns).

Legal Name: _______.

(Contact info).

This way I can make sure they know that the name I will be using at work is different from my legal name/deadname, and that I use certain pronouns. If they are thrown off by that at all, I know they don't have the same values as me and I know not to go forward with the job. My advice is to not accept a job offer where they state that they cannot use your specified pronouns and name, and they will only be using your legal name and pronouns associated with your gender assigned at birth. Even if it's a good paying job/internship, it's not going to be good for your mental health and overall job experience.  

They will need your legal name as part of the requirements for the background check, if applicable (not all jobs do this), but for the most part, many jobs use nicknames for their employees anyway, so there really shouldn't be an issue concerning them using your name instead of your deadname (unless you're in a formal setting or a government job). 

I say go ahead with putting your chosen name on your documents, but keep in mind that at some point your legal name will come across, so make sure to tell someone that you don't use that name. 

Good luck!
Hi! I occasionally get to review résumés (CVs) for new hires at my job, and the name is literally the last part I let myself look at so I don’t form impressions based on unconscious bias. That said I’m always very happy when a resume I have already found impressive has an usual, unique, or otherwise “weird” name at the top…because I’m a big weirdo and am most comfortable around other weirdos.
Having an unusual name could very well help you land the job that you’ll be happiest in anyway, and if it keeps ignorant ass hats from taking you seriously, well, you didn’t wanna work for those losers anyway.
your parents are full of shit and also abusive
When I read your title, I thought your name might be Sock or something (cool name, but yeah that resume is probably getting thrown out). But dude, a nickname to your deadname?? I see absolutely no reason why that wouldn’t receive as much respect as the full name itself.
The same thing could be said for any name that doesn't conform to dominative cultural practices and norms, whether they're chosen or given. Frankly, the idea that they mock you for having an ""abnormal"" name doesn't just signal transphobia to me but a disrespect for anything non-normative, if not some latent bigotry even beyond trans people.

I'm sorry your parents are being transphobic. I trust you know all this--especially because you said so, yourself--but just a reminder.
Your first sentence gives it away.  Your parents are transphobic and everything they say or do while having this mindset is just going to be to either an effort to turn you straight or hurt you.  Especially anything having to do with your name, identity, or expression.
put your chosen name. i am in my late 20s and have done hiring processes - i barely look at the name when i’m sorting through resumes. especially for a part time job as a teen, you’re totally fine. if a place judges you for that, i promise you don’t want to work there!
Make someone who support you check your CV instead of your parents, and when they think everything is OK apply to the job anyways. Better if they're someone who know about the topic (maybe someone working on human resources?), or if they have knowledge on queer stuff (like my psychologist, yay! :D). Yet better if both. You may have to lie to your parents saying you ""obeyed them"" and used your deadname, but the risk is worth taking imo

&#x200B;

Btw, your parents don't love you. Sorry for being too direct, but the truth must be told. If they did, they would respect your chosen name and pronouns, and make sure you feel supported by them. However, as I always say to queer people with unsupportive families: chosen families can be better than biological ones. Even if it's just internet friends on Discord or the like, find people who support you, who care about you and love you. There are lots of queer servers and chats out there, and if the cyberworld isn't your thing, I'm sure you'll find company in your local queer group
Your chosen name isn't something like ""Moonbeam"", right?
I’ve gone by a name completely different from my given name for my entire adult life. It has never given me a significant problem at work. Schools gave me a hard time sometimes, but I’ve never once been given a hard time with it from a job.
I read once that statistically, shorter names have more success in the workplace. 

If your parents can call someone ""Mrs NewNonMaidenName"" after that person gets married (yes I'm using an old traditional example - the parents are old traditional), they can call you by your chosen name.

Usually it's not that it's difficult, it's that it messes with their tiny minds.
My parents made me cut my hair before getting my green card picture taken and before applying for jobs. I would have my goal-length by today, twice over probably, if it wasn’t for that.

I feel like parents’ reaction to injustice is “just don’t belong to the oppressed group lol,” which is annoyingly pragmatic, but also very invalidating
So my sibling wanted their name to be Ender and I put a stop to that because I do want them to get a job. 

Their name is still very unique but now we can point to our French roots. 

It sounds like your name is an actual name. Many people today have “nicknames” for names- I’ve had mine for 31 years. 

Your parents are wrong.
some job applications actually have a place to put your preferred name. so while some may not like it, others won’t have a problem. just depends on the employer.
If it's any consolation -- my gf (20 & non-binary) applied to a (really good job) with their very stereotypical non-binary noun name and got it with no questions asked. That's not to say people never discriminate based on names, but things are definitely changing for the better
Never ask you parents for resume or career advice. Go to your school counselor or a younger teacher or even a peer who already has a job. 

First, the kind of jobs that you'd be applying for are really struggling to find worker's right now. 

Secondly, most business now ask if you'd like to use a preferred name right on your job application. 

Third, kids your age have ridiculous names! I would know because my daughter is your age and she had a classmate named Moxie in first grade. I knew someone who named their kid Ryder after Rider on the Storm, the Doors song. I've worked at all kind of customer service jobs and come across some really, really awful names. 

TLDR; your parents are wrong and no one is going to care. Apply with your chosen name.
Honestly, I meet cis people all the time who work in a formal setting who have odd sounding names 🙄

It’s very common practice where I live for people of Asian, Indian, Middle Eastern and Slavic descent to have their legal given name, and then a westernised chosen name because it’s “easier” for people to understand. No judgement for the names they chose at all but I have seen everything from Ken and David to Tiara, Noddy, Silver and Strawberry. These have all been people I’ve met in upscale hospitality, office settings and emergency relief.

If cis people with names like these can be not only considered but hired, then you have absolutely nothing to worry about. If the issue they have is with your name then you can rightfully assume they are choosing not to consider you because they’re transphobic or homophobic. I don’t know where you’re from Ofc but if you’re discriminated in this way in Australia, it is in fact illegal. In the end you don’t want to work in that kind of environment anyway.


From what I’ve taken from what you’ve said, I’m sorry to say that it probably won’t matter what name you choose, how you present or what you do, your parents will take issue because of their uneducated bias. 

Hold firm to who you are and remember this is your life to live and not theirs. It may sound harsh but this took me 28 years to learn: if they can’t accept you for who you are, then they don’t deserve to be in your life anymore. For the protection of your own mental health, please consider whether you want this kind of energy around you or not.

I wish you the very best my enby sibling 💜 

Peace, love and jellybeans xx
My full legal name is a nickname for a much longer name. I get asked if it's short for anything all the time, and I just say no. But besides that it's never been an issue at all. So I dont see why youd have any trouble if it's easy to pass as a nickname for a longer name.
Yeah fuck that. Do what you want. Yeah it can make things a bit harder depending on where you are but it can be worth it to not be dead named at work. I know a lot of applications I've done recently had a place for both legal name for tax reasons and a ""nickname or preferred name"" kinda category. And also if you're applying to places like a book store you'll be fine. My bf worked at Barnes and noble for a while even in a relatively conservative town in texas and he said he has almost no cis het coworkers lol.
They’re being bigoted and aren’t in touch. Your name isn’t a problem anywhere else it seems, just to them.
I had a teacher in middle school who went by a completely different name then hers. She just did not really like her name.

On official documents her birth name would show up and everyone would go ""huh? Who is that?"" because literally no one knew lmao.

But honestly, if you are not out and need a reason to why you go by another name just tell them something like ""oh i don't really like my name because it reminds me of something sad / someone that passed away"" or ""oh kids at school used to make fun of me for my name so i don't really like to use it anymore"".
All I got to say is, I got poached on LinkedIn with my first name listed as Jeneni and my pronouns listed as she/they as I’m non-binary transfemme and obviously not afab. You do you!
If it’s a place worth working the name you put on your professional-looking resume isn’t going to make it suddenly “unprofessional.” Cheering you on as you apply!!
Just want to chime in as someone with an unusual chosen name that I got a job with no issues. My name never came up - my employer was more concerned about my skills. I had a legal name change by then but they gave me the job before I sent any legal documents (and HR handles that anyway so thankfully no one in my department has seen my birth certificate). The funny thing is, even though my last name is more like a first name which I thought would be a dead give away, I still get asked ""How did your parents come up with your name?""
We were told in one of my classes that nothing relating to gender should be put on my resume. I put it on there anyway because it lets companies self-filter. If you have a problem with me being non-binary I don't wanna work for you anyway.
Let's take the practical approach: e.g. : Legal / registered / official passport  name is Nicholas. But please call me Nicky when at work.

Perfectly simple and  keeps it all largely in the middle. If someone has a problem with that you keep it simple by asking why. And if they answer - whatever answer- you keep on asking why. Un-arm any army with asking - . > WHY < ?
my heart goes out to you and i totally support your decision with the chosen name! it’s your life, your cv and your decisions regarding it!
I have my now legal name on my resume, and it does not always match the perception people have of me. I have lost job opportunities because of this, and I have still gotten jobs cause I like to think I have a pretty good resume for my age. If the name is such an issue use a letter abbreviation but honestly, it is not the make or break of getting a job and it will always be more difficult if you are trans. My best advice is to try and connect to those hiring. Bring your resume in mid day when managers are typically out if possible, email the group if that's alowed, make a good impression cause at the end of the day that got me more jobs and interviews then anything else.
yeah i know i have to use my legal name for certain things like that but this is just for how i want to be addressed at the work place, nothing else lol
My go-to solution is (first initial). (Preferred) (Surname)

So like if my birthname was John but my chosen name is Jane, I’d put “J. Jane Doe”.

It makes it clear that there’s a legal first name, but the only name that actually appears anywhere (other than legal things) is the preferred. In my experience, it helps prevent confusion. And it also doesn’t necessarily out you because there could be any number of reasons a person doesn’t go by their legal first name.
This. I put my legal name only on the few documents that absolutely require it. Everything else has my chosen name and no one has ever had a problem with it. If they do, you don’t want to work for them anyway because that would be the beginning of a long line of mistreatment from them.
This is not good advice at all. You don’t know which country this person is from and unfortunately if the work is really necessary. If necessary the name might make a difference and unfortunately people might not hire them for that reason. It would be amazing if people didn’t care about it and respected others for who they are but that’s not the real world.
yeah it all comes down to not wanting to work at a place with people who will treat you differently just because of a name
toe 😭
*accepts mom hug*
""Realistically it will reduce your options"" for a part-time job? Incredibly unlikely. A quarter of Gen Z use they/them pronouns and plenty of people use gender neutral or even opposite gender nicknames who are not trans.
I lived in a very white middle class area for a long time. I moved and got a job in a bigger city, and asked about the dress code because my previous employers had been really strict about it. My manager was like, ""ah, well, you're not allowed to have facial or neck tattoos and can only have facial one piercing, but honestly we're an urban store location so we'll probably overlook it"" LOL
This is the right answer tbh
I'm really, really surprised about how far I had to scroll for this comment. At 16, you're not applying for anything ""formal"" in the slightest; you're applying for retail or food service. They need a warm body manning the register, so they genuinely do not care what you're name is.
no. it's three letters long and if you were to look it up online plenty of other people use it as a nickname.
People go by different names all the time, or middle names, etc. It isn't something that is unique to trans people. Think somebody who goes by Matt, but their name is Matthew, or Mike for Michael. (sorry, these are just examples from my work, off the top of my head, I work in IT, lots and lots of dudes)
I mean, if that's the case, you could introduce yourself like this: ""Hi, my name's (deadname), but I'd really prefer if you called me (nickname)."" (I apologise if this comes off as rude by any chance, I'm rubbish at social interactions)
Great advice.
Well that’s just simply not true.
A quarter...? That alone so baldly, openly wrong that I don't really need to address it. And am not sure why I am, but whatever.

Regardless, even in my extremely aggressively trans-friendly city I receive noticeably fewer responses when I put my pronouns on my job application, so I'm not sure where that's coming from. Ideally you'd be right, and I get the culture in this sub is to be positive, but this person is asking for legitimate advice and society still sucks.
Then it sounds like they're just being disrespectful of who you want to be at the moment and they're trying to keep themselves closeted or in denial.

I'd just put whatever your chosen name is on the CV and only use your legal name for taxes and other legal documents. 

This could also help weed out shitty employers. You don't want to get the job only to realize you're surrounded by bigots.
yeah exactly that's what i was thinking. im not even going to come out at work or anything, im literally just going by a different name to my birth name. that's it
My son's dad has a nickname that isn't even remotely close to his first or middle legal name and only ever goes by that. We worked together for a full year before I knew his legal name was different and we only found out because our boss called him that on the loud speaker intentionally to piss him off. Also a lot of people go by their middle name. My brother actually has a first and two middle names. He's only ever gone by one of his middle names. Plus plenty of Drews who are Andrews, Richs, Dick, Ducks that are Richard, Bills that are Williams. It used to be a common thing for Johns to have Jack as a nickname, etc.
There was a study from the UK that said almost a quarter of Gen Z uses they/them pronouns and half of Gen Z includes their pronouns in things like email signatures. That doesn't mean 1/4 of people are non-binary, because this would include people who are cis who use they/he, they/she and any/all pronouns. However that is still a really large number of people.
It's been widely reported in the [media,](https://www.joe.co.uk/life/nearly-a-quarter-of-gen-z-now-identify-using-a-non-gendered-pronoun-such-as-they-them-study-finds-390943) the study was performed in the UK. I can't find an original source for it but my daughter is Gen Z and a lot of her friends are trans or non-binary. There are a lot of people who use they/he, they/she and any/all pronouns that would be part of that.

The OP didn't even say anything about putting their pronouns on their resume, they asked about putting a chosen name on their resume which is super common for people of all genders and doesn't even necessarily indicate that they are trans or non-binary. 

The culture in this sub often isn't positive and what is irritating to me is a lot of us don't have the privilege of being able to hide our identities.
Terrible example I know, but if Newt Gingrich could be taken seriously, I cannot imagine any nickname you could pick that would do what ‘newt’ could not and unserious you out of the work force. 

(I hope the name you go by is not newt. But [newts](https://www.britannica.com/animal/newt) are cool. I like newts. They didn’t deserve Gingrich.)
You are going to need to link this study. What’s the sample size? That doesn’t match up with peoples real life experience.
Oh yes, JOE, a ""social media publisher,"" citing ""a study"" without in any way linking to it, saying who did it, where it was published, why is valid, whatever. You might as well say ""my uncle Joe said it and he's a scientist and has gay friends."" Friendly media like JOE is less likely to actively try to hurt us, but that's not the same as being about to just assume anything they ever publish is true.

And to be clear, I don't have that privilege either. Getting the interview does seem to be more difficult than getting through it, though, at least in my experience, and my birth name is also my real name and is gender neutral by means of obscurity, so via pronouns on my resume are really the only point of reference that I have. I came out before I entered professional life so I can't use that as my point of comparison, and I've always had my current name so I can't use that either. We can pretty easily infer that their chosen name would be a tell that they're nonbinary, or they wouldn't be asking this question, and obviously-nonbinary pronouns are an effective proxy in this case. I think you already knew that, though.
The study was in the UK can had over 2000 participants.
No I think you're just a negative and sad person who wants everyone else to be negative and sad too.
Again, link please.
lol, okay.

I always get misgendered when I wear makeup in public but at least i look 🌟stunning🌟		"You look amazing. I love your makeup. I’m still learning makeup 
I wish I could learn that art ! You look absolutely amazing !

Ahhhhhh that eyeshadow rocks my world 🤩😍

You look great! I barely wore makeup before, but I've stopped wearing it altogether... I still get ma'amed.
Everyone starts somewhere!! I honestly learned from youtube tutorials and staying up till 3am painting the fuck out of my face lol
The only option is to be so androgynous that cis people are confused and afraid and will go out of their way to avoid gendering you. 
I feel that.
It isn't like it's anyones fault imo
Any channels that really stuck out to you?
Gothfruits and Jackie Aina are two of my favorites!!
Thanks :-)"	b48ikl	NonBinary	518	1.0	2019-03-22 18:23:33
Why do we get hate on so much?	Why does everyone always hate on us? Like I swear to god I can’t even mention my pronouns online without people being assholes to me, and it’s the same way for other enbys I see. It sucks. Like, I hate how I have to misgender myself, I hate how people go out of their way to misgender us, i hate how people act like we aren’t living things just because we use they/them pronouns, and I hate how everyone thinks we’re faking it. Nobody has told me I’m faking it (yet) but it’s only a matter of time. We can’t even be ourselves without people feeling the need to be assholes to us	"I suspect its people projecting their personal insecurities.
It hurts a lot when binary trans people imply non-binary folk are harming binary trans folk. it's only happened once and I don't think the guy meant any harm. But it's also why I'll never set foot in the ftm sub reddit. 

&#x200B;

idk why people love the gender binary so much
“I hate how I have to misgender myself”— wow i did not actually realize I do this too until I read that.
I think the non binary people are just an easy joke for people to make similar to furries or gay people in the 2000s.

We live in a culture where gender is binary and anything outside of that thinking is confusing and challenging for people.

It's not fair and it sucks but old, ignorant people will continue to die out and younger, more open minded people will be understand the difference of sex and gender and understand how to empathize with people.
Real answer : people see us (at the same time) as children, and sexual deviants. Their is also an element of homophobia.

The first because they think that every non-binary person is a twenty something or teen aged person whom is extremely naïve and misguided often this is pared with religious fear (the fear that you as a non-binary person are going to hell), these combined to make them (or at lease a part of them) legitimately afraid for you and think that you can be guided back to a “healthy” mindset.

And a sexual deviant because they cannot separate sex(biological), gender, and sex(the action) and to them this is something shameful and very singular and binary, they see it as something that is very much set in stone and (often) a mandate set by god. Those same people see sex(the act) as shameful and something that is supposed to be mysterious and wonderfully simple, and the concept that it’s not scares them. Added onto that the fact that a lot of the people who come out as non-binary are children teens or young adults and you have a recipe for people to see non-binary as the same way they see a sex crime.

The idea that sex(biological) and gender are not the same things scares a lot of straight people because if their not the same thing  they have to take a hard look at them self’s and see if their really straight or if their neptunic/sapphic. This scares them because of homophobia, and ties into gender roles and heteronormative.

The fake answer: they know that non-binary people are too sexy and powerful to ever be allowed to be truly themself as if we where we would engulf the wold in non-binary magic and ascend to fight god themself and take back all the things that we rightly deserved like the ability to become sentient bogs and three rings nestled inside each other covered in eyes and wings and on fire
When online, I stay in my happy lil echo chambers and haven’t had any direct hate about being enby.

However, at work, (not directed at me), I have had multiple mediocre whitecishet men make HiLaRiOuS jokes about identifying and pronouns or simply throwing transphobic slurs about.

(Yes, I have complained to HR and the union.
No, nothing happened).

Does that count?
Because we represent the breaking of the obsolete power systems. Our existence is a revolutionary act. We oppose everything that so many have just accepted as truth until now. We threaten their comfort and they know we will not stop until we have the right to be who we want to be.
Not sure if it helps but it's not just us, it's anyone who is marginalized, and therefore vulnerable. 

It's a sign of weakness and small-mindedness.  Strong people don't need to attack weak people to feel powerful.
I feel its because hate speech against non-binary people isn't as derided as homophobia/racism/sexism etc, so people feel they won't get called out for doing it. Literally - some people just need to insult others to feel better, and we're an easier target.
I have to constantly wear a badge that says “they/them” and a enby lanyard inorder for people to respect me for who i am when i have been wearing it for (basically) 2 years. It is truly frustrating.
I struggled for a long time with coming out as non-binary because of this. Doesn’t help that when I cut off all my hair my mom said “I like it, but I’ll always see you as just feminine” thanks mom 😌
I think the hate comes more because of people that use neopronouns. Specifically, those that take certain object names and use as their pronouns. To others this is all viewed as the same group.
The majority of the time it's actually not personal IMHO.  


People like to hate stuff to make them feel superior in a life they feel inferior in.  


Also, when someone is hating on you, they're actually kinda hating on themselves more than you. You see nobody really knows you only you, the people in your life have an image of how they perceive you based on their own perceptual biases, so what they think is you they are hating is a construct of you that only exists in their minds
A lot of binary trans people will scapegoat us for why cis people don’t take trans people seriously…when to cis people we’re all the same
Because many people are small-minded and our mere existence shatters something they thought existed unbreakable: the gender binary. 

Sadly some people need to cling to their beliefs until their last breaths, whether it's religious hate, an entirely incorrect grasp of nature or an entirely fabricated reality of their own.

Don't hide because of other people's issues. I received hate in a safe-space yesterday. They were banned almost immediately. Be yourself. Be loud and proud. Anyones hate is their problem not yours. There will always be at least a few people who will back you up. Try to focus on the love, not the hate.
There are a lot of people who believe so strongly in the gender binary that they base their whole identity and worldview around it. Whether thats terfs and their ‘all men are forever and  exclusively bad’ trauma bs or the guys who think having a dick means they deserve to be on top of a social ladder, its the same thing. People who look at all that and go ‘nah’ are extremely threatening to them. Basically they’re faced with the choice of either acknowledging that the binary is oversimplified nonsense people made up and people can opt out of, or hurting you enough to get you back in line so they can pretend their systems are perfect and immutable again. Its way way easier to just choose to hurt us. 

Fuck ‘em.
then people go out there and say ""the nonbinary community is now the face of the trans community and is making a mockery of trans people!!! binary trans people are being drowned out!!!!"" when it's like... no. of course binary trans people experience transphobia and have it bad, im not saying anyone has it worse, but nonbinary people aren't ""oppressing"" binary trans people. it fucking sucks how some people think that. i like to think it's not a lot, though, just a vocal few yk?

people just don't want to accept that people can be different than them. they accuse of us not knowing, but we know. its them who can't understand, so they refuse to. i wish i didn't have to be, but ive tried both male and female and neither of them make me happy. its a lack of empathy and a refusal to understand, or even tolerate. it isn't our fault. people did the same with gay people, hopefully with time and world adjustment people will start to see us as real and human, just like them. one day 💜✨
In Poland.. there were stickers around city with anime bunny girl saying that ""you are not nonbinary, you are mentally ill"".. Also there is hate on people who use neutral pronouns.. also there is general hate on lgbt people, because we are ""ideology"", not people..
Bc the enforced binary is connected to white supremacy and colonialism, and a lot of our society is internalized policing — aka people running around “theres only two genders!” (Why tf does it matter? Because they are cops) as well as systemic enforcement, and the attitudes of the higher ups. 

Here is an article about it, if you would like to read more : https://aninjusticemag.com/the-gender-binary-is-a-tool-of-white-supremacy-db89d0bc9044
People hate what they can’t comprehend. They are just uneducated.
People are insecure and they’d rather push other ppl down than address their own issues. I care less abt the opinions of strangers than I do a family member but I’m working on that as well.
People don’t like what they can’t understand.
People just aren't willing to even attempt to understand. They see something that they've never experienced or been around before and they shut it out because it's easier than trying to actually understand. Also a *lot* of people just feel good getting angry about things, and a foreign concept like this is an easy target.
The worse is when transphobic right wingers work hard to take away the ability to transition and its somehow nonbinary people's fault. You know a lot of us transition too and if not are very sympathetic to people who need to.
Yeah... This Is Why I Try To Only Stick To Explicitly Supportive Places On The Internet, Although Even That Ain't The Easiest, As You Can't Exactly Tell Sometimes... 

Sidenote though, The first time I remember someone doing this to me it was honestly kinda funny (But still sad, Of course) because they were hardly even trying: I was on a Discord Server and had a role for They/Them Pronouns, But also one for ""Any Pronoun's Fine"" (Mainly just had the They/Them one because it was purple Lol.), And somebody was being a jerk and said something like I'd get mad if they called me anything except They/Them... Despite the fact I also had a role all but outright stating that I Wouldn't, And they logically would've had to see that too in order to check what the They/Them Role was...
I've been openly bi for years.

This is just ""pick one or the other"" crowd round 2

I've been prepared for these kinds of interactions by years of experience. I'm really not phased at all or surprised. 

My existence doesn't invalidate or hurt anyone but the insecurities of people who can't accept me do.
cus people dumb :]

but we're cool
I feel you so much... My CO wasn't long ago, that's why most people still misgender me, but I try to correct them. German is also very gendered and sometimes I have people who are like ""In your documents you still are AFAB, so I will gender you like that, cause your given name is female and I can't memory everything."" Pal, really? It's just cause in Germany it's so hard to get your docs and name changed 🙄

Edit: Typo
Because the majority of humans only allow for comprehension, not compassion. They convince themselves there is not enough time in a day to try and understand. In an absence of understanding comes hate.
I think most people are much too uncomfortable with confusion. That in itself is probably not that irrational, school and parents and friends socialize us into a mindset where mistakes are bad and ""self-confidence"" (meaning acting like you are sure of anything, regardless of your actual knowledge or skill) is rewarded. This trains people to be uncomfortable and afraid of loosing social status when the are unsure or confused, and to people who are used to binary gender, nbs are just really confusing. Unfortunatly that means they feel a need to lash out, to make the confusing and uncomfortable person go away. 

I'm sorry you have to deal with that. Remember that you are valid and there are lots of us! They wont stay confused forever.
Because they don't respect you.
Luckily I've only been misgendered a few times, but that's mainly cuz I never tell anyone that I'm enby

The main time I got misgendered was when my friend outed me on the bus in front of some homophobic redneck
Because people are stupid, they can easily be led towards hate, and some smarter people can use that stupid hate to get people to do stupid things.  

The fight for nonbinary people is almost no different than the fight for civil rights for minorities and the rights for homosexuals.  The fight shifted to something slightly newer and different.
Freedom is scary
[removed]
depends where you live..it's pretty laid back here..it's not easy to meet you though
I assume it has something to do with being jealous of us living our authentic selves
I view it as more of a personal bias cause by not being insecure/feeling out of place with how your view your own gender and gender expression. If your 100% ok with your own gender be agab, and mostly lived with standard gender roles/expressions, it makes sense something you dont personally feel and understand wouldnt make sense.   


Combine that with the sense of anonymity and ""meme"" culture a lot of people live by. Heck I have a few people my age (32) that literally havent grown up past the 4chan phase.  


Combine this with the overall ""Newness"" of accepting non cishet existences, and bipoc being accepted (more so then previously). All this leads me to just accept people gonna be people, the part i dont get onboard with when people want to be assholes....  


Look, i dont care if you hate me/GSRM, but dont stand in the way of people looking for their own happiness. the world sucks enough as is
Sadly it's because many people are afraid of changes and things they don't personally understand. 
The changes part of it is a bare minimum as over 99% of the time it has no direct effect on them other than them hearing that someone identifies as non-binary and even that shouldn't affect them as much as it does.
From the beginning of time, there's always been those who believe if they don't understand it then it gotta be wrong. They don't try to educate themselves or strive for themselves to be better and not hate. They decide to push the hate forward and blame the group of people for their hatred. 
Wish there was an easy fix but there's not. History taught us those who have hatred in their heart for people's existence will forever carry that hate. We can help teach the next Generation to Love Everyone and never allow Hate inside your Heart in Hope one day we can fully eradicate Hate from this World. 
Never Give Someone the Power to Change Who You Are. Love Yourself as You Are Loved!
AIDS killed so many queer people that now everybody thinks we just popped out of the ground sometime between 2003-2006 so everything LGBTQ people do, as a class, is seen as “dumb shit for kids”
Because people cant mind their own beeswax and have to come butting in to yell at someone who is different
I came out as enby in 2014. I’ve done a lot of work behind the scene to get X markers on Driver’s Licenses, Birth and Death Certificates and honestly it’s getting worse. I feel as if we can solidly lay blame at Netflix Comedy’s feet as well as The second wave feminists that teamed up with the Federalist society to write anti-trans policies (they love J K Rowling) and it has emboldened Centrists/Liberals to bash us at every chance.
I don't hate u.  I accept everybody just the way they are
Ive honestly just reversed back to just being she/her. Im too tired and I dont want to think about it anymore
Someone called me a little shit because I used singular they for someone I didn’t know the name, gender or pronouns of.

The weird thing is, I didn’t know them either

And I was buying clothes with a friend

Some 30 year old walked up to two minors half the 30 year olds age to call us little shits over the word “they”

Tldr: intolerance is stupid
I don’t understand it either people get so mad when we are like plz don’t gender and I’m like why do we have to be gendered I hope the world changes society is at fault and honestly it’s weird cuz before society became a thing gender wasn’t even I thing so it’s like come on
People hate what's different. And if you're different and proud of it, they hate it even more.
i think its because people overeact what we are

they see the lgbt talking and making a big fuss (not that its bad) and then it goes like

´´now they think their are a banana´´ and bla bla bla

its actually simple but they overeact with it
I can’t mention my gender in non-LGBTQ groups without someone asking about my genitals
What I see the most is the idea that the non binary identity and existence is purely due to “I reject gender roles for men/women” which implies women/men are reduced to gender roles/stereotypes. And then there’s people whose brains implode upon being exposed to the concept of they/them pronouns. Theres people equating being gender non comforting to being non binary, and they think that if gnc presentation is now labeled as non binary then that enforces the idea of women/men not being able to be gnc. I understand that ppl want to be gnc without being labeled as enby by society, because women/men can present however they want while still being that. So when ppl see “I don’t like presenting feminine” they’ll be like oh so ur saying women have to be feminine or else they’re non binary??At least that’s what I’ve seen personally. I just think a lot is a lack of understanding and sometimes our experiences are too complex to feel comfortable being put into a binary which is why a spectrum is preferable.
It hurts so much. I see people just brutally rip us to shreds verbally in so many places online. Especially in gay groups for men specifically. I sometimes just wish I was cis. I even feel uncomfortable when someone uses my preferred pronouns and feel ""safer"" when I'm misgendered. I don't know why I'm Non-binary, but I just wish people would stop choosing to be ignorant and hostile towards us.
Because people fear change and anything aside from their basic mentality.
Some of the nastiest experiences I’ve had were with people who came out years later. It’s happened with two different people now. 

Obviously that’s not the case with everybody who acts like this, but there are still *a lot* of enbys living in the closet well into adulthood. That kind of self rejection messes with a person. Not saying that makes the ugliness okay, but it does explain some of it.
Getting outside of the gender norms can make people realize how much they are chasing an invisible 'rule' that they often completely hate.
Yeah probably
They've been brainwashed since childhood to need it. Without the gender binary, how are you supposed to use stereotypes to understand the world? *Clutches pearls*
I'm sorry you had that experience, it's so disheartening when it comes from within the community.

The ftm sub seems to have loads of non-binary trans guys and trans mascs whenever I'm there, as well as binary trans guys, but there are assholes in every community and I'm sorry you came across them :(
I've interacted with on eof those people they were an asshole it was not very pleasent
Yeah, me neither.
>The first because they think that every non-binary person is a twenty something or teen aged person

Them: You *millenials*

Me: That... no longer means what you think it means.
Yes
‘biological sex’ is just the medicalized taxonomy of gender and to uphold the distinction between the two is so fucking transphobic lmao how does your shit have 38 upvotes?
I'm reading this book for class: Gender(s) by Katherine Stockton. 

What she finds is that men are so disallowed to be compassionate by other men, that they need to make jokes about things to cope. ""Hilarity"" is used to dismiss the feelings of others so they can keep ignoring *their own.* Which you can imagine isn't healthy for anyone. To stay masculine in the eyes of the group, they must be sheepish and passive (and feminine) about these issues, to play along with their jokes.

I think this is my new favourite book tbh. I've only read one chapter so far, but I'm developing a case for the people who reinforce gender the most: they understand it the least.
Yeah true
Two pillars of western maleness are Dominance and Aggression. Aggression is caused by a lack of dominance, like an animal trying to shake up the pecking order.

Edit: Added Western, because I don't believe in biological sex determinism either.
>just feminine

Oooh boy if my mom said that it would piss me off so much I'd probably pack a erect dildo 24/7.

But in actuality my mom always tried to block me from doing sports because she was afraid I was too masculine already. If she ever said such a thing I think it would be just as a burn and not because she believed it for real.
I don't know about that. If you bump up against more conservative people in mainstream spaces, there's quite a bit of disdain for (enbyphobia) "">!blue-haired they/them chicks!<"" and more commonly actual picking on (presumed) cis people that have she/her and he/him in their social media bios. There's pushback against ever declaring a pronoun ever, let alone a non-binary one.

Solidarity with people who use neopronouns. Most of the people who want to tear down some of us want to tear down all of us.
>People like to hate stuff to make them feel superior in a life they feel inferior in.

This! I think when you don't have a whole lot going on in your life it's easier to put people down than to build yourself up.
Yeah true
I’m sorry to hear that. I’m just glad the person was banned. Imagine being so insecure that you would go onto a safe space just to bully people, it’s pathetic that someone did that

Also thanks, I’m gonna try to start doing this
Yeah, the german language can be really frustrating being the gendered mess it is. I'm pretty lucky  because I don't mind pronouns, I use er/sie, because none of the neopronouns in german I know really fit. 
How do you handle that, if I may ask?

Changing name and gender-marker will be way easier, once the Selbstbestimmungsgesetz is active. Really looking forward to that. 💜
Yeah there is, I probably said the “hate” like 5 times
Same
Yeah. 

Some of the comments I've heard have me wondering if a lot of this stuff isn't just resentment from people who haven't figured out they aren't cis or who have and have repressed the shit out of it. 

Not all of by any means, some people are just bigots. 

But some of it has me wondering.
Yup
Yep. 

I feel its usually a ""this says a lot more about you than it does about me"" situations.

Although some people are just genuinely fucking ignorant, too.
I can understand binary trans people really loving it to an extent. But i don't think anyone actually wins in a 2 gender binary.   


And this doesn't even include the other stuff. 

  
Some people just don't have time to be a boy or a girl.
it's accurate if directed at me

a 39 year old enby with 2 kids
How do we Intersex folk fair in that statement? There are 40+ variations. Are we just written off, only to be brought out by folks in the GNC and Trans community? I’m Trans and was born Intersex.
Amazing - definitely looking that up!!
I don't consider those traits as specifically masculine, either among animals, where there are plenty of counter-examples, or humans, which vary pretty widely both individually and culturally.
easier in the moment, but it fucks you in the long run.  


The dark side is quicker, more seductive
It was a space specifically for survivors of child abuse and my ""mental illness"" was blamed on my abuser. Like seriously, it's literally the main rule to be kind and understanding
Yeah I'm rooting every day for the new law...  But cause our lobby isn't big enough, I don't think it will really be done next year. Like, most people are still like: ""DoN't ToUcH mY dIeSeL!1!1!1!111!"" if you ask about climate crisis and that's something that effects really every being in this planet.

I normally go by what I learned as the ""American addressing"", with you (Sie or Du) and first name. It's the easiest thing I know to speak mostly genderless.

If I talk/write about a group of people, I normally use generic masculine, but disclaim it in the beginning, that every person is meant and it's just really hard to gender everything in every possible kind of way, cause German is so gendered.

The most ideas I heard about making new genderless pronouns are mostly very... ""interesting"" to be nice 🙈😅 Like using ""ens"" (the middle part of Mensch = Human), but it's very fast very confusing. If every pronoun is ""ens"" nobody can tell if my granny is in your basement and someone else called the ambulance, cause everything would be ""ens"".

It reminds me a bit of the idea of relationship anarchy.
Yep. One was convinced that me being nonbinary was *actually* me struggling with internalized misogyny, so they decided that refusing to use my pronouns was ‘helping’ me realize I was being a bad feminist and taking up space in the trans community that I didn’t deserve. 

1000% projection of their own insecurities.

There’s definitely just straight up bigots, too.
God so true, I see so many people say “why are you calling him/her they? There’s only one of him/her, it isn’t proper English!” But what they don’t know is that “they” has been used as a singular since like 1375
Even some cis people are incredibly fucking weird about it. 

I just wish it was all optional.
Yeah, I'm an enby millenial. But I swear people got in the habit of talking about teenagers/college-age young adults as ""millenials"" and never got out of it.
Also a socially constructed category. The prefix 'inter' literally implies how it's defined by being 'in between' the socially constructed dimorphism's.
Yeah, it's important that if we're talking about the culturally gendered traits of ""dominance and aggression"" that we don't fall into the trap of biological determinism.

Certain cultural groups place an emphasis on men displaying these behaviours in order to keep their status. That doesn't make them male traits.
But man-people *do*. And they're the ones perpetuating it, even if the studies prove that biological determinism is often wrong.
It's like your bully also lives in my brain and knows my own insecurities.
Singular they is so old the first written instance of it uses a thorn instead of a ‘th’.
What's Especially Funny Is, If Memory Serves, The First Recorded Complaint Against Singular They Was In Like The 18th Century, Meaning It Was Used For Hundreds Of Years Before Anybody Started Complaining About It.
For realsies though...

I ended up with a friend whose bs when I tried to approach gender was the straw that broke the camel's back. Like refused to even admit that boobs are generally considered feminine. 

""I don't see boobs as feminine."" Fuck you, Kim. You lying douchebaguette. 

Blocked her ass and zero regrets.
OH yeah lots of cis people are. I meant i don't wanna take awake binary trans people joy of gender but i wish they wouldn't try and get me into that. 

that or just not be a part of people's IDs an paper works. I mean i live in a place where you can get an X marking but i am worried about what that could bring me
Cool, just asking, to learn more as I’m a Trans elder trying to learn from younger folk. Cheers fren!
I was writing to support OP, not going to argue with you about biological determinism and ""man-people"", especially in a subreddit for nonbinary folks.
Haha yeah, I think that’s part of what makes the hostile closet cases so much more brutal than run-of-the-mill bigots. They know how to hit where it hurts, because they’ve *also* spent tons of time quietly agonizing over their gender, and come to the conclusion that they don’t deserve to be happy.

If it makes you feel any better, the person who said this ID’s as genderfluid now.
While I see where you come from, boobs and moobs are just sacks of fat and breast tissue and don't /really/ indicate gender. Like a fat trans man getting top surgery would still leave some behind because a fat man would naturally have breast tissue of some sort. But I do agree, society sees boobs as feminine.
I feel that. 

I got my x but I thought long and hard about it and I still occasionally worry 'cos we got some fashy shitbags out here.
I think you're misunderstanding me. I agree with you. I'm talking about people, specifically men in this case, who hold on to their gender roles like it's a life-raft. Like it's their religion. And therefore, telling them that their traits are not biologically determined (the truth) is blasphemy. They tout cultural traits as biological.
just saying, hostile closet is a totally metal band name
Yeah I am open about being trans but sometimes I know it's not a safe space. 

Makes me wonder what my gender would be written down a on places I need to have a gender listed and that gender has to be the same as my ID. Like the student aid BC site
I’d buy their album.
I wish they'd make all this stuff easier for everyone. 

I hate everything being a freaking jumble.

Yeah. It's a pain. I've been lucky and have often had people help me with this stuff as well.

People just don't want to make things just stream lined and accessible.
Exactly. And its annoying."	xbce2n	NonBinary	516	0.98	2022-09-11 07:40:04
My partner (they/them) keeps getting misgendered as a guy, any tips for them to look more feminine/androgynous?		"makeup, it solve most issues.
I would say they should put a defined part in their hair so that less hair is towards their face. Also, they seem to have wavy hair? I would recommend only brushing your hair right before showering. Then, after getting out of the shower, squeeze dry your hair. And then dont comb it out, but instead put a little leave in conditioner on your palms and scrunch the ends up to define the curls and waves. Their hair would be so effortlessly adorable 😍
Haircare for curly hair, and parting their hair differently. Right now the way it falls unfortunately makes it look like the phase that a lot of guys have where they don't go to a hairdresser, but also don't want to do anything with their hair, or don't know how.

They have a very pretty face, and I think their hair could evolve into a really stunning feature - the colour is just gorgeous, and I'm rather sure there's a great wave pattern hidden under too much brushing or the wrong drying technique.

As soon as they start playing with it more, I think they'll find that it changes a lot about their presentation already.

Of course makeup and nails would do a lot to push their presentation into a more femme area, but as a person who just doesn't have the patience for makeup and isn't allowed to do their nails because I don't want to kill my patients with lacking hygiene (beware of nurses with done nails, they carry a high risk of infection!), I find hair changes my presentation the most.

I went the other direction and chopped it all off, but I did have long, wavy hair at a point, and there's a lot to be done with it.

Half up/ half down hairstyles become a lot cuter once you know how to manage your wave pattern, for example.
Their hair looks really great in the last photo. Maybe they can try styling their hair so it keeps it’s natural curl and isn’t too combed out / frizzy? They look very feminine as it is. Are they on hormones?
i'm AMAB and the only thing that helped me was accepting that people won't **always** see me like i see me.  
that was sort of sad, yes, but somehow more *freeing* than sad, y'know? now i just make the effort to feel good about **myself** instead of passing  
of course that won't work for everyone, but i hope it helps somehow for them to understand that they're valid just being themselves too! :)
Just enough makeup to be noticeable and/or one femme accessory, maybe a hair clip?
They look completely andro already.  They could try dressing more femme if they want?  Like in the first picture they have that little collar and sweater, that's cute.
Makeup and nails? Tbh they look femmtastic already imo
Your partner have a strong jawline which pretty much sets off people’s assumptions. Hard to get around that one. 

I know makeup has been suggested here but instead of a full face of makeup and eyeshadow, learning to contour just their cheekbones, jawline, and the bridge of their nose could soften the masculine lines and could help
Nail polish
Quick recommendation, this: https://www.atomicpolish.com/collections/best-sellers/products/carbon-matte with a topcoat of this: https://www.atomicpolish.com/collections/flakies/products/bromine-br might compliment their hair and disambiguate gender.  💛🤍💜🖤
I hope they don't feel the need to do these feminine things unless it actually makes them feel like themselves, <3
Things that are commonly associated with femininity.

Adherent clothes or feminine ones.

Longer hairs, or a different haircut (of course, if they want to).

If you wanna go extreme, makeup and nails too.
Just be their self because it’s enough
They look pretty femme to me already! I think some small changes, like hair clips,  light makeup, nail polish, or maybe a cardigan could help send the message to strangers. Also femme hairstyles like pigtails, space buns, etc go a long way! Their hair is gorgeous. Maybe even get some layers/bangs in the mix! Also high waisted pants, with a shirt tucked in accentuates the figure in a femme way.
It looks like their hair is grown out but not cut in a particular style. Hair can change the vibe and shape of a face a lot! So I would suggest searching for some nice haircuts (in the same length) and styling it. I think it would help a little but they already look great!
Hey just checking, did you get their permission to post their photo and ask this question on their behalf? Just seems like a real weird and invasive thing to be asking for another person.
They already look really androgynous especially in the first picture. I would actually suggest voice training > any change to their clothing. Unless you're wearing heavy makeup and/or a dress, a low voice will get you consistently gendered male regardless of clothing. When my voice dropped on T was the exact moment people suddenly started gendering me correctly.
Some tips:

- love the side part, but I’d make the sweep bangs less dramatic because it’s reading “emo boy” to me as much as it is “femme”
- agree about managing frizziness and hair looking better in the last photo 
- I hate that I’m saying this bc I sound like a sexist asshole but: smile more! I had this thought immediately (I’m afab and find that the more I smile the more feminine I look), but that last photo confirms it. They have a great smile!
- Some primer and foundation to smooth out tone and eliminate the facial hair shadow. Some contouring could help too if they want to learn those tricks
- If they’re open to makeup, eyeliner (top only) and lash curl/mascara or falsies will make their eyes pop and draw attention up as well as being makeup
- Clothing fit: the bagginess of the tops I think is cutting against them. When I dress femme and have a bigger top I adjust with very small/skinny bottoms (not men’s skinny jeans but jeggings or leggings or hotpants). 
- Lower necklines. Not a big scoop but just showing off the décolletage a bit and adding a necklace to draw attention to their collarbone
Try a hairstyle with a defined part perhaps? Try a middle or side part.. doesn’t matter! Have you tried straightening their hair? Or alternatively, maybe a wave wand?

If they want to try makeup, some light eye makeup like mascara or maybe some lip color/gloss could help and it can be easily removed if they were ever in a situation/around people that make them feel unsafe. 

I love their huge smile in the last photo. GORG.
1000% agree, it's the hair care. AMAB folks don't get taught about hair care, so a big way to make it clear that you're not just a long-haired dude but rather a girl-type person is brushing and styling your hair, using conditioner and styling products, and the cut. Take your partner to a really good, trans-friendly salon and get them a good stylist who can cut it in a femme way and show them how to style it day-to-day. Agree that they have a really beautiful face, girlish frame and gorgeous hair, and they're going to be absolutely stunning once they find their style.
Wear a pronoun pin
Cute hair clips that match their outfit would look great!
The first photo is so pretty.
Voice training maybe? (assuming they haven't done it already) Also they're really cute :)
They could paint their nails maybe? Also I love their Mandalorian shirt :D
Their hair is excellent. I would suggest very small breast forms or padding -- adding a little bit of bulk to the chest changes your silhouette and how you hold your shoulders. Androgeny can be the absence of gender but also the presence of many gender.
Maybe they shouldn’t focus on how others perceive them, but dress/present themselves how they feel most comfortable
Nails 💅🏽 would be a good shift to try but also maybe curling your hair with a defined part. Certainly makeup but with more pronouncing on contouring and eyes. I feel like the first pic looks very androgynous and is just missing a few things mentioned above. Truth be told, I, too, am constantly misgendered and I’m almost convinced it’s near impossible to float between both because of my voice alone lmao. It’s literally imo the only thing holding me back. I saw post in here earlier that made me feel more humbled in my thought that *anyone* can be nonbinary or androgynous and look gendered, but I do understand the want (like myself) to look and be unidentifiable lol. Someone put it plainly that Americans that aren’t Native Americans are going to have a larger time understanding there is more than two genders so it may also be based on what is taught versus what is know . Hopefully this all helps (sorry to ramble). Just know your aren’t alone in this feeling 💜
My first thought was a little bit of water like eyeliner + a tiny bit on skin near the inner and outer points of the eyes, just like cat eyes :]
Incorporate some extra jewelry maybe? There are clipon and magnetic if they don't want real/ can't afford piercings right now
Dang they already look very andro/femme! 💕 I agree with another comment I saw that maybe they can wear more feminine clothes? Other than that maybe some jewelry?
One of the main parts of gender presentation is clothing and accessories. All I could really recommend is they go shopping in the women's section
Get some nice layers cut in. Get some hair cream for curly hair and a diffuser hair dryer to give it a nice curl
In my opinion, they'd look a lot more feminine with their hair parted (more or less) down the middle. They could also experiment with ponytails, chignons and braids, and products to give it a bit more definition and get rid of the frizzyness

I would also try to dress a bit more feminine, wearing things that are a bit tighter (especially on the shoulders and sleeves) and leave the collarbones a bit more uncovered :)

Makeup would also definitely help but i hate it and never wear it myself, so i can't really help that much lol

This being said, they look super cool and i love their style :)
ponytails/ braiding that gorge hair they got there. Im thinking viking braids would look really cute on them. Also more colorful clothes, crop tops and skinny jeans
Before making any suggestions, my question is: do they actually want to change their appearance or self-expression? (And do they know you’re asking on their behalf and using their photo?) If they are expressing in a way that feels good and authentic to them, adopting additional aesthetics for external recognition might not feel so good in the long run.

It might be a case where they need to simply inform or correct people or wear a pronoun pin if they are happy with their appearance. It may also include a process of accepting that how they feel and look won’t always equate to others accurately guessing their correct pronouns. It’s not fair, but it’s how our society is right now.

Finally, a loving reminder that looking androgynous and being non-binary are not the same thing and should not be equated. Plenty of non-binary folks express in a more binary way and that doesn’t make them more or less non-binary.
False eyelashes really pop
bangs!
accessories, especially jewelry. dangly earrings, necklaces, bracelets, hair clips, etc.
wolf cut!!
Probably eyeliner and mascara will help, plus fixing the hair. Eyeliner and mascara are so ridiculously easy and fast if you’re not trying to be fancy.
I would second eyeliner :)
So for me, I struggle with getting gendered in a femme way. I like plants on my clothes. Flowers, trees, leaves. For some reason that seams to be femme to most people.

I agree playing with hair might be a fun option too! If you live in a fairy large city or progressive area I would try finding a trans/queer friendly barber! They often have great tips and help with affirming hair cuts!
It seems that you’re asking more in the sense of clothing/makeup/etc, but a pronouns button or pin could be helpful and affirming for them. If nothing else, it can be so much less daunting to correct someone misgendering you if you have a “prop” to help you communicate your correct pronouns.
I’ve seen cute pronoun earrings and necklaces too!
High waisted pants w an oversized top that is tucked in maybe ?
Honestly the first picture looks pretty andro to me. Their hair is a nice length, I agree with maybe more specific wavy hair care. But maybe some more accessories? Earrings (even magnetic ones), rings. Painted nails.
Hair. Book them an appointment with a stylist who is open and accepting and help them to learn to style it (if necessary). It'll make a lot of difference. Tbh at the moment it's a boy cut / blow dry (meant with ❤️ from someone who started the long hair thing in their early teens 30 odd years ago)
they could try dyeing their hair pink or purple! i’ve done it a few times and I always get more she and they from strangers when my hair is pink :)
They've got beautiful hair, styling/cutting it to be more intentional looking will go a long way. The carefree, long, messy look takes a long time to grow out and look intentional and not like someone who doesn't bother with haircuts.  Nail polish, jewelery, and leaning more into their fashion style in the first photo will help. My room mate had to wear very large pronoun pins for a while before they figured out their gender expression fully. They have nice brows, but getting them waxed/shaped makes a surprising difference.
Neater hairstyling, would they object to using some product? They have length but the shaggy presentation is a masc signal. Also maybe some thin matching foundation to just even out the skin tones and concealer under the eye.  the collar is cute but also pretty strongly gendered so it might be hard to balance out.
Their hair is fantastic! And a great way to express themselves and be recognized for it. 

To feminize hair, frustratingly, is basically to take extra special care of it. Looks like they could use intermittent deep conditioning. An olive oil or coconut oil hair mask once a month could go a long way. 

The could also try using argan oil. A tiny amount distributed along the lower third of the length of their hair will add shine and reduce frizz & flyaways. 

I think the first photo of them with the sweater look paired with a necklace is a particularly nice, androgynous look. So maybe try more accessorizing with jewelry. Or paint their nails! I can see a French nail going super well with that particular outfit ✨

Safety comes first！ If they feel safe in their area wearing jewelry or using accessories like a purse or fancy scarf, that could be a great way to express their feminine side and be recognized as a bit femme by others around them. 

Thanks for asking some advice from the community! Sending best wishes and support to your partner, and to you as well 💚💚💚
As much as WE know that clothes/appearance does not equal gender others still don’t I would suggest painting nails/getting acrylics, wearing more “feminine” colors (pink, purple, etc), make up, curling hair/getting a perm can help if hair is long, hair clips can also be an easy way to look feminine but not have to do much work hope this helped!
Not that I agree with the notions of masculinity and femininity that have led to them being misgendered, but usually shaping the eyebrows could help? Apart from that, they already look pretty androgynous and honestly, it just takes a little explaining sometimes to make others understand.
Earrings! :) also hair clips
Accessories
Change the hairstyle to a more steriotypically feminine one . Cut the bangs and keep the rest long maybe? And maybe some winged eyeliner.
A bob haircut, possibly colored hair, dangly jewelry (they look like silver would be a good complement), culottes, strappy sandales, an eyebrow pluck (no need to go overboard).
To look androgynous they could wear oversized clothes to make physical features less defined, and more ambiguous.
Wear a pronoun pin 
Androgynous dosen't equal non binary
They look pretty andro already. Have you maybe considered a pin/button with their pronouns?

Just be sure that they wouldn't be targetted for wearing it :(

I think nail polish would also look great but im hella bias :)
gift your partner a shirt with they/them imprinted on both back and frontside. or a cap
Find a more flattering sweater - not that this one us bad but something fitting  more fem might help
Ehhh it helps but it is not really. Most people will either see you as a man, gay man, or woman it just depends on which you want to chose.
Came here to say this.
They would like to go on hormones, unfortunately their family wouldn't approve.
(⁠╥⁠﹏⁠╥⁠)💛🌻🌿✨
They say thank you!
That’s an amazing polish color!
Also, even if they’re not comfortable with nail polish, trimming and filing can go a long way
consent is important people!!!
Yeah they let me do this
¿¿¿¿¿👀how do I do voice training👀?????
This x, 🖖
Sure, but primer and foundation can even out the tone to remove the five o clock shadow, and some “natural” ish makeup can help give color to lips and cheeks for a more feminine or androgynous look. Most randos are going to assume a binary gender unfortunately, so if they’d rather get “she” in the mix sometimes, makeup will probably help. 

Lovingly signed, a transmasc guy who likes makeup but hates how it removes my five o clock shadow
that's why I said,""most"" lol
I’d take them to an LGBT friendly hair salon and get them an explicitly feminine haircut. They have a lot of great length it just needs to be trimmed and styled professionally.

I would also encourage them to start learning to do their own makeup. It may seem really intimidating at first but all it takes is a little practice. That will make a big difference if they’re unable to get on hormones.

Oh also get their eyebrows threaded if they’re not doing so already.
>They say thank you!

You're welcome!
Thank you, Atomic Polish has some wonderful combinations.
I scrolled through the comments first to check if anyone else had asked already and was kinda surprised that no one had questioned it yet.
Assuming you're AMAB, you can use this guide (it's what I used): https://www.reddit.com/r/transvoice/comments/d3clhe/ls_voice_training_guide_level_1_for_mtf/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share
Thanks :) I have thick curly hair, if I brush it it goes exactly like the photo. I think a lot of people don't realise they have a natural beautiful curl pattern because of brushes and hair dryers. More moisture the better, this looks like thirsty hair. Avoid styling serums and oils when it's dry already. Use a thick moisturising cream when wet or a leave in conditioner, you can also wrap with a jersey cotton t shirt to enable extra deep moisturising and air dry :)
Fair enough 😂
Thank you bot

Also, OP you _are_ welcome!
I saw op said, that their partner was happy for the help, so I guess they did give consent after all.
thank you,thank you so much💛🌻🌿✨
Oh is naturally curly so I know that ""the struggle is real"" but they have been happily avoiding straighteners forever. ☺️"	12d4o3j	NonBinary	463	0.99	2023-04-06 01:20:56
MY TEACHER APOLOGIZED FOR MISGENDERING ME	"Today, in my third period science class, I asked a question and the teacher (an older male) said “Yes, ma’am”. I thought nothing of it cause I get misgendered all the time and forgot about it pretty quickly. 

Five periods later, I see the teacher standing outside my ninth period class. I say hi and he says “OP, can I pull you aside for a second?” 

Then he says, “Today during class, I said something and I’m not even sure if you heard it but I’d still like to apologize. I said ‘Yes, ma’am’ after you asked a question. I know you go by they/them pronouns and I’m sorry. I’m old but I’m learning.”

I nearly fucking cried during class. The fact that he remembered what my pronouns are when I only communicated them through writing them next to my name on homework assignments, noticed that calling me ma’am is misgendering me, took the time to find out what my ninth period class was, and apologized IN PERSON! Amazing. 10/10 teacher. I love him so much."	"I know this sounds like a weird suggestion, but as an education major I have to say it: if you're comfortable with it, email your compliments to the principal and his department head. Administrators love to see this kind of thing because it helps them advocate to their school board about different types of resources. An email like this could help that teacher get grant funding or the show that their is an interest in LGBTQ+ trainings and programs. And if it doesn't do either of those things, it also just looks really good on that teacher's record.

Some schools have students nominate a teacher of the month or something like that in order to find out which teachers are doing things right, and emailing is another way for them to find that out.

I know this is way longer than I probably needed, but when I was out in high-school, emails and contacting people in administration was always the way to get things done. While admin are busy people, they always appreciate seeing compliments of their staff rather than complaints. Then, if they see your name later for an issue, they'll be more apt to help.
What a mega win for you and your education system!!
This is awesome
Well done! I am a GSA advisor and presenting to the entire faculty today about LGBTQ student rights (Calif Ed Code) and that students will report when their rights are dismissed by teachers (or peers). We encourage all our GSA students to advocate with their name and pronouns and expression on day 1 in class. 99% of teachers respect it even if they don’t “get it”! I love positive stories like this. Thanks.
i had a similar experience w a TA a few days ago, i corrected him but he was super nice ab my pronouns and apologized for misgendering me. sometimes it rly is those few ppl who care who make a difference <3
My heart is absolutely melting, this is such a glimmer of hope and I love both you and your teacher
Thanks for the suggestion! I’ll save your comment and try to do this.
Wanted to flag this for you: do this if your school and district are LGBT Affirming.

You know your school and local politics better than we do— and if this is something your school has expressed as a value— go for it. But if you feel your community is less than supportive, maybe run the idea by a trusted mentor or adult in your life. The way that kind of letter will be received will vary and depending on who is in charge it could help or hinder the teacher"	q1iumg	NonBinary	458	1.0	2021-10-05 00:05:30
misgendered by my sister's teacher	"Im a young nonbinary and I go by They/Them just to give you some context 

My younger sister had to right a paragraph on who inspires you, and she wrote about me (I'm very honored) 
My sister had to write a rough draft and her teacher graded it and how the teacher graded it made me upset 
They replaced they with she and I feel kinda shit I might be overreacting but really after multiple time in the paragraph calling me they you'd think the teacher would get the hint!
So I'm stating in the final draft that I go by They/Them/Theirs just to make it clear 

*P.S sorry if the format is werid I'm on mobile"	"What a poorly educated teacher.
If the teacher attempts to mark the assignment wrong for using your correct pronouns, feel free to share the following resources with them:

Grammar rules for things like whether ""they"" is singular or plural are *descriptive*, meaning they describe how the words are used in common usage. They are not *prescriptive*, meaning they don't define how someone can use a word and if they don't follow the rule then they're ""englishing wrong."" Language is a collaborative experiment in passing information from one person to another, and every individual speaks their own unique dialect of their language. There is no single authority that can declare what is or is not ""proper grammar."" But, if you're interested in appeals to authority, here are a few that are widely considered the most prominent authorities on how to use English:

- [Merriam Webster Dictionary](https://www.merriam-webster.com/words-at-play/singular-nonbinary-they) states singular they has been in common grammatical use since the late 1300s and is accepted as correct English.
- [Oxford English Dictionary](https://public.oed.com/blog/a-brief-history-of-singular-they/) is more specific with a citation to 1375, and indicates it was likely in widespread use before it appeared in print. They also consider it to be correct English.
- [AP Style Book](https://www.apstylebook.com/blog_posts/7) explicitly states that using singular they for non-binary and gender diverse individuals is entirely acceptable and appropriate when that's how the person identifies.
- [APA Style Guide](https://apastyle.apa.org/blog/singular-they) says that writers *should* use singular they, not just that it's an option. It's the preferred way to refer to people whose gender is unknown or irrelevant, and for people for whom that is the proper pronoun.
- [MLA Style Guide](https://style.mla.org/using-singular-they/) says the same: ""he or she"" should be replaced with they, because it's grammatically acceptable and inclusive, and avoids implicit gender bias in the reader.
Honestly if you know the teachers name, you could email them politely and say “You decided that the pronouns I use every day are incorrect, please be informed that they/them are my correct pronouns.”

If your sister wrote sister: “I understand that you saw she wrote “sister” as my relationship and was trying to correct her on her grammar, while I appreciate that she knows what pronouns I use and she has used them correctly.”

If she did used sibling: “you also assumed that she was talking about a sister, I could have easily been her brother, please be mindful of this.”
Well that's ironic. I hope she can work in something along the lines of ""I'm inspired by my sibling to refer to them correctly despite pressure from authority figures.""
Sorry about this, I know it sucks to feel invalidated by an educator. I took a writing class once where I didn't know the gender of the author so I used they/them pronouns for him in my essay about his work and my professor took off points saying that he knows people use that when talking but it is not appropriate for an academic paper even though he knew those were the pronouns I use myself. To rebel in my quiet way, I just didn't use any pronouns in the rest of my papers which made the flow of the papers worse but he couldn't technically take any points off for ""grammatical errors.""
Anyway, I hope things can be worked out with your sister's teacher 👍
i will never forget my 10th grade english teacher who kept on insisting that ""they isn't grammatically correct and should be replace with he/she."" I thought that was dumb at the time but now I think it's even more insane.
i hope it was just a lack of knowledge typa grading mistake. if they're transphobic that's totally something else and completely unacceptable
So firstly, as a fellow they/them, I'm very sorry this happened to you. I know how bad that feels. Secondly, I do implore you to contact your sisters schools administration if the teacher grades your sister poorly for this or presses the issue. I had to do this earlier this year with my child's school and boy howdy, did that make my life easier and the teacher got a very firm conversation from the principal about respect and respecting pronouns. I hope this gets resolved peacefully, OP, but do know that I'm proud of you and your sister. 

Well done.
Why'd they choose to use she/her? Why did they assume you were a girl? If you're sister is supportive I'm assuming she wrote ""sibling"" and not ""sister."" Doesn't make much sense to me. 

Also, just correct the teacher. However, if they keep misgendering you with the rough draft, have your parents email the school about it (if they support you).
Ive had arguments with two different *college professors* over ""well using singular they isnt geammatically correct sorry i have no choice but to take off for it,"" its just this really specific academic brand of transphobia. As if language never changes? As if the nebulous, not-a-living-creature concept of grammatical rules is more important than living, breathing people? Ridiculous
Fuck that teacher they can fuck them self
Depending upon where you live and how effective you think this might be, have your parents contact the Dean of the English department and inform them of your family’s concerns regarding this teachers education due to: A) lack of current understanding of the english language, as mentioned by another person above, B) bigoted behavior
Tbh, mistakes are made and miscommunications are common. It seems like, unless they explicitly said to use she/her instead of they/them it was most likely just a misinterpretation. 

A lot of people don’t know how to use pronouns correctly (similar to how they don’t speak *proper English* like British English vs American English or slang) and use they/them to speak of someone who doesn’t actually go by those pronouns. 

I just described the teacher using they/them but I have no idea what pronouns they use. It’s not meant to be disrespectful just generic due to lack of information.

Is this teacher someone you’re going to be interacting with again in the future?
My science techer said “can anyone help *her*” and i feel the same way, but next Tuesday im going to correct her.
Apparently I’m in the minority here, but it seems the teacher is grading it based on grammar rules and not pronouns because she thinks your younger sister just is incorrectly using a plural instead of a singular and isn’t using malice. Especially if your younger sister is in grade school or even high school maybe, I’d figure it’s likely the teacher thinks it’s a grammar error. (Still can hurt that you’re misgendered obviously, but I wouldn’t assume malice)
As much as it sucks. It sounds like you are an awesome sibling to your sister and she loves you enough to see you as inspiring. Who gives a fuck what her teacher thinks, how your sister thinks about you is way more important. 🥰
Jane Austen will be mortified to find out how poor her grammar is. I hear she wants to be a writer. Delusional.
I'm sorry. 😞 The last time I recall being told they and them were plural only was about 30 years ago.
stab time :)
Thanks this helps alot
He or she is also very clunky on top of being exclusive
Or share this:

https://www.wikihow.com/Sue-a-School-District%3famp=1
this is brilliant!
Thats smart and Thanks I hope I can resolve this too!
The only class I've ever gotten negative marks for not writing the singular they as ""they*"" was in a queer media class and frankly I thought my nonbinary professor was being a tool for cisnormativity about it because I did the same thing in my racist screenwriting professors class in the same semester, same department, and he never noticed even though that class was graded mostly on grammar and formatting.
Yeah I hope so cuz I don't want this to be a bigger issue than it already is
Thanks fellow they/them you made my day and my sister's day better :>
My sister only used my pronouns and my name witch is feminine but at the same time what if I was a trans male with a feminine name that's why I hate that they assumed but I'll just correct them but sadly I cant do much since my parents don't support me
[deleted]
Your right I'm just saying that it kinda hurt even if the teacher didn't mean too
Of course I will correct the teacher and I hope that will be the end of it
Your right ima go play genshin with her right now
Singular they is so old our earliest example of it still uses a thorn instead of a th. Sisters teacher is flat wrong.
You are so welcome. I'm glad your day is better and I hope tomorrow is even greater!
That sucks :( I also have nonsupportive parents, I dont know what to tell you, sorry.
Of course. I understand perfectly how you feel, as my pronouns don’t match my social appearance and get mixed up often. 

I wouldn’t do anything drastic like telling the dean about supposed bigotry and getting the teacher fired. I’m of the mindset that one shouldn’t escalate situations unless absolutely necessary. 

Perhaps you should ask your sister to politely inform the teacher that you don’t use feminine pronouns, in case you happen to interact in the future or your sibling references you again?
Best of luck to ya! If it happens on the final then we’d have a problem but hopefully that fixes it :)
Wait, thorn? Not eth? I could've sworn thorn was exclusively unvoiced.. unless they used to have a /θ/..?
Dude it's fine I have my older sibling so I can probably figure something out Thanks for the advice
Absolutely I dont want to do anything drastic so my sister put in the paragraph that I go by They/Them
No, am i mucking up the name? Idk how to do the character on a phone, its the one that looks like a b and p mooshed together. I was sure it was thorn… though I guess its been years since I studied this stuff. William the Werewolf is the text I’m thinking of, if thats helpful.
English writings used wynn and thorn much longer than eth, for both sounds. Thorn was then replaced with the <th> digraph
Thanks for the help I will tell my sister to inform the teacher that I go by They/Them
That is indeed Thorn. I must be wrong.
Þ this one, right?
That makes sense! I forgot that English barely used Eth. Shame.

Hey y’all - Kat (they/them) - Any advice on taking up space? I’m constantly misgendered (casually, not intending harm) and want to stand up for myself. Any thought exercises you’ve done to get over feeling like an ✨inconvenience✨ to people?		"When I said something similar to my therapist, they said that it sounded like not standing up for myself is an inconvenience to me. Your comfort is not worth less than other people's comfort or convenience. Also, another thought, if I was pronouncing someone's name incorrectly or using their previous last name after a divorce/marriage, I would desperately want to be corrected.
“You don’t have to call me _____”
“I go by ______”
We are magic. We are a gift to this timeline. Your existence is a way to invite people out of the beige world of heteronormativity into genuine unbound joy. 

You have magic in you, learn how to tap into it. I like to have a moment of silence before I react. I let their words linger in the air to see how I feel about it. I don't always speak up either. Sometimes I know it will expend too much of my energy and it's not worth it. I can make that choice because my peace is important and I don't have to educate someone when I am having a hard time just showing up for myself.

When I do step out for me though I'm often met with a blessing from it. Even when the people I'm directly interacting with are not impacted by me, the people aware of the interaction can be. 

Believe you are a magical gift, say it to yourself often.
Can't say I've put too much thought into pronouns yet, but I wanted to say that you deserve to be recognized as who you are. Going through the difficulties inherent in educating our peers sets up the possibility of such better circumstances for those who come after us.
I think that it can actually be really helpful to think of it as helping them. most people don't want to misgender someone, and the longer they do it for the worse they feel after they find out. I wear a pin, and just gently say ""they"" after someone says she. it takes practice, so if you can't do it every time no sweat!!
Maybe trying to liken it in ur head to correcting a mispronunciation of your name? It's just a way of referring to u that everyone can feel good about getting right w a small nudge/correction. although it can feel like a big thing in the moment, I find acting calm about anything that might make ppl defensive helps keep things level. Love ur pants btw!
My biggest advice is to just. Advertise that you're nonbinary. A lot. Make jokes about it. Tell stories about it. Just slip it in to convos. Make it obvious when you're talking. Then, it is their conscious fault when they misgender you. I always try and make sure that I say it first, whether directly or indirectly.
Unfortunately, I’ve found it’s mostly a case of “practice makes perfect.” The more you do it, the more you feel like you can take up space.
Im sorry i don't have advice I'm currently in the process of coming out of the closet, but i just want to say, I love your hair! The color is amazing!
I have no advice, since my impostor syndrome makes standing up for myself really hard…… but I hope you’re able to get some good advice from others💜💜 sendings virtual hugs!
Honestly I find some self talk that works for me and I have a conversation with me. “You are much brighter and nicer and kinder when you show up in the world as yourself.” Im gentle and playful with it. I simply correct folks after a conversation, have my pronouns in my email signature and try to be authentic in my presentation as me. Take that space!! Beautiful pic btws!
I loved that sentiment from a tiktok about telling people your pronouns or a new name ""I am not making a request. I am letting you know""
Also my best friend told me: just tell them as casual as possible. If you think it's something unusual to tell somebody your pronouns, they're gonna notice and it's gonna feel weird and like something unusual for both of you. It helps when you go about it as naturally as you can.
im also currently struggling with this and ive been trying to say the pronoun that id actually use in that context

""blahblah she blah""  
""fae""

either that or after the (usually brief) convo i remind the person who misgendered me of my pronouns

i also try to remember how i feel when i dont speak up to convince myself that next time i have to say something

im not doing too well with it so maybe my methods are flawed, but thats what im trying to do
Manspread on the train.  It's a delicious power play.
I agree with the top commenter about making sure you prioritize your own comfort just as you do others’ comfort. Also, just wanted to chime in and say that I dig literally everything about your aesthetic! Those pants are killer and don’t get me started on your cut🔥
Hey! I’m Render!
I’ve been misgendered a lot, I live in a highly homophobic area of a state and I can honestly say the best way to get someone to call you by your pronouns is by constantly giving subtle reminders (such as maybe using your pronouns in a sentence with a friend), or even correcting them in a kind way, “hi! My name is ___! I go by ___” 

It works! Oh! And always try to surround yourself with people who use your pronouns, because if you do, other people will catch on and use those pronouns :)
I just reply ""Not a girl/miss/lady/etc."" and continue the conversion.
when someone is like “hey girl you’re so pretty” I’m like “thanks but just so you know, I’m not a girl and these are my pronouns “

also when someone repeatedly misgenders me I pretend I don’t hear them even though it hurts. 

and sometimes like with my mom, she’ll be like “oh well we all know you’re a girl, they/them is hard. That’s stupid” and so for the rest of my visit there I refer to her as he and they go ballistic 🤣
Omg your hair makes you look like scrap baby from five nights at Freddy’s please look it up
I don’t have much advice bc i’m struggling with the same thing too… but I just wanted to say your eyes are literally so stunning and the color of your hair really makes them stand out <3
I just say “my preferred pronouns are ___” or “my friends refer to me by ___”. It’s nice because my friends call me by my pronouns and most people find out my pronouns when they refer to me, but if they don’t it’s nice to break the ice when I’m not boymoding and someone defaults to she/her. They’ll get caught off guard by my friends using he/they and no one briefed them yet haha
You are the only one who can change yourself. Nobody else has the power to change you, and you don't have the power to change anyone else. Be confident in yourself and when people misgender you remember that is a them problem, not a you problem. You don't need to spend any energy trying to fix something you can't control.

Conversely, anyone else's efforts to change or control you are fruitless as well. Pity them for trying.
You are beautiful
Jumping off of that first part: what would you do if you saw your best friend letting themself be walked over because they didn't want to inconvenience anyone? Protect yourself like you would a loved one.
Wow. There’s a solid reframe! I think I may have internalised some martyr syndrome from my parents 🤦 it’s so true. Thank you!
This is the best sentiment. I feel the same way, but you put it so perfectly.
omg this this this
This comment felt like a warm hug. Thank you!
>gently say ""they"" after someone says she

even as a fellow enby, this would get on my nerves. I've had it happen before. I might instead suggest politely correcting someone \*after\* the conversation.
Thank you 🥰
Thank you. Gentle and playful is good advice 💖 also it’s true (the affirmation) - I’ll remember that.
I think this is part of the key! It’s not for other people - it’s for me. I like the framing of not making a request, just letting you know. It should be a natural process. Thank you ♥️♥️♥️
Thank you ☺️
This is great advice thank you!
“oh well then you’re a man” 🙄🙄 I hate when old cis men refuse to believe there’s more than just a man and woman.
Thank you 😊
Thank you! Yeah I have some trouble pushing back when people use the wrong pronouns consistently - but the reframing above of it being a tell not an ask makes this an easier thing for me I think.
I like this framing! Thank you ❤️
Thank you!
True - I think about this in terms of my siblings. A good reminder, thank you ✨
just something that works for me! usually it's best for me to correct them in the moment, cause you can't pull everyone and their mom aside when they misgender you. but if that works for then that's awesome!
If someone isn't going to respect my pronouns, I don't really care if a correction gets on their nerves
nah. I need to correct people on the spot so they don’t misgender me the entire conversation.
No problem! Good luck!!
This happened before I chose to use gender neutral pronouns, and it's part of the reason it took me so long to start using they/them for myself.

I was introduced to someone who used she/her, and was work friends with them for over a year. On day 1 of them using they/them pronouns, they were interjecting ""they"" every time someone accidentally said she.

I wasn't intentionally misgendering them but after a year of using she/her for this person on a daily basis, it happened maybe 5 times that day, and I wasn't the only one needing adjustment time. They would interrupt people and break trains of thought during presentations. By the end of the day, everyone was nearly ready to strangle them.

Interrupting people mid sentence is just plain annoying, regardless of why you're doing it. I personally wouldn't want to be known as the annoying enby.
Loool I’m sure you’re popular.
Judging by your comment history, you're a transphobic little slime. Find another community to troll.
Nah one of my best friends is trans, it’s just not the be all and end all of their personality. They’re cool. I’m not even trolling it’s just outside of a niche community that attitude will get you nowhere. I wish you well."	t60x7d	NonBinary	435	1.0	2022-03-03 20:30:00
Does anyone feel like they are faking being in non-binary because they aren’t/weren’t out and so people don’t know so they misgender you constantly so you feel fake?		"I feel this way as well. I heard this quote once from a YouTuber, “if you think your faking it, your probably not” dunno if this helps, I tried sorry
Imposter syndrome is a hell of a thing. 
When I'm misgendered I never correct them, because I get the thought  in my head "" are you they though?"" I'm so used to being called he that I've misgendered myself before, and that sets off a few days of self doubt. Just be you and do what makes you comfortable. You don't owe anyone to look or act a certain way.
Sometimes I question if im being myself ""enough"" because I get gendered a lot at work even though I've made it known that I'm nonbianry. Like I've gotten more comfortable with he/him pronouns because it just happens sooo much but i always wonder if thats actually me or me settling. It's a constant struggle to feel ""comfortable"" with where I'm at.
Totally. I work construction and look very masc, so while I'm at work I'm not really out per se. Most of my coworkers are cool about it but lots of the other trades we work with wouldn't be, and clients might not be as well, so I'm just out to a few coworkers. During pandemic I see my coworkers more than I see anyone else, so it's been hard to even see myself as NB sometimes, since I don't really present that way the majority of the last two years. I really need to get out more...
Y e s. You have no idea how validated this makes me feel
I'm constantly asking myself if I'm faking it cuz I still go by she/her but it's mostly to avoid nasty comments. And whenever I think about top surgery or taking T then I tell myself I'm trying to be a man but I don't feel like a man and it usually turns into a spiral of bad thoughts.
meeeee more in the way of correcting people can just put in a postiton i don’t feel like being in most of the time. i think im faking, and idk how social conscious the other person is. the only way like 50% of people i interact with daily know my pronouns is because i finally built up the courage to put it at the end of my email. it’s in my EMAIL SIGNATURE before it’s said out-loud just quickly in the moment no big deal. im hopeless
I misgender *myself* constantly, and I always immediately notice and feel bad and try to move past it, but now even the people were using my pronouns are starting to fall back into the wrong ones and I feel like I can't ask them to stop because I'd just be a hypocrite.
Yes 100% it's a struggle. Esp when you're not out so just enduring it all the time. :(
If it makes you feel better, it doesn’t change much when you come out. My wife never, literally, misgender me and a couple of my friends typically get it right. Other than that, even people who know I’m enby misgender me alllllll the time. And I’ve gotten to a point when I’m just too exhausted to correct people 10 times a day, every day. And like, I’m on hormones, I don’t look like my gender assigned at birth. If anything, I feel MORE trans because of this. The struggle I go through because I’m misgendered all the time feels like an innately trans thing to experience.
Let me give you insight from my personal experience. My friends knew since highschool, but gender wasn’t really a painful topic back then. 

Then, I got a job where titles of sir and ma’am were being used instead of first names and I got to hear it constantly for eight hours nearly every day of the week. My identity was suddenly being invalidated by strangers at a constant pace and my two friends who knew suddenly wasn’t enough for me to be comfortable in my own skin.

A year went by, I am now comfortably in a new job with people that knew my gender before I even entered the doors, and my parents know but they struggle to remember. The issue is I am still no longer ok, that year of mental torment took its toll and now I need to physically change in order to feel better, but I am too afraid to take that leap into unknown waters. 

If you feel uncomfortable with how you are being perceived, then that is a sign that you need to find the strength to keep yourself in check, because you cannot correct every single person in your life but you can try to make it hurt less by building yourself up.
I feel like that sometimes-
Being misgendered can only happen if you’re not the gender you’re being called. So if hearing the ‘wrong’ gender applied to you just feels squidgy, then it means that actually is the wrong gender for you. 

Faking it would be if you were 100% comfortable with the gender you were being called, but were still telling people they were wrong and it wasn’t your gender for whatever reason. So like if you aren’t out and someone called you your actual gender and you said ‘haha no I’m actually (your
agab)’, then you’d be faking it. (Legitimately, by the way. This is a valid fakery and not a scam at all).

Anyway, the point is, if you hear yourself gendered and think ‘nope’ that is in itself prop that you’re not faking it. 

Anyway.

Edit: comma to period and also ‘proof’
Being non-binary not in non-binary
Firstly. You are so amazing, you built up that courage that takes a lot. The fact you did it should make you proud. And agreed correcting people definitely puts you in an open ended spot and can be so uncomfortable. You are valid and you are amazimg, my messages are always open if you ever need to talk or rant about anything
No, because other people don't exist in my identity.
Today I had impostor syndrome. I was dressed in more feminine clothing which I liked but I didn’t like how my makeup turned out, and I wanted to wear something with pockets so I switched to a masculine outfit. Which I’m fine with either, but I kept getting misgendered as female even with masculine clothing on. The worst part of it all I’m amab and I have not been through any HRT or anything. This makes me really confused about my gender because idk how people perceive me. I think I might be intersex since I have feminine breasts. But it is confusing since I’m naturally androgynous with a femme leaning but I feel like I’m being gaslit into being a woman.
Yes, definitely. I constantly end up with imposter syndrome because I’ve spent so much of my life sitting just with this in my head instead of talking about it. I told my step dad this weekend and he reacted pretty badly and made me feel completely invalidated. My first internal response was regret for telling him because “what if you’re actually not and you’re making this ‘fuss’ for nothing?” When actually I know that when I came out to some friends and they reacted well and used my new name and pronouns I was so filled with euphoria that I knew this must be right, that I am barking up the right tree and I’m not just “putting it on”. 
It’s a hard thing to deal with all the time though, to constantly have to justify yourself to the world and also in your own head. I’m glad to see I’m not alone in this feeling so thank you for starting this thread. 🖤
Yes. I’m not out to any coworkers who I spend a ridiculous amount of time around. So it sucks when people constantly label me as she/her without any variation.
I'm an afab femby, so even people who know have a hard time reading me as what I am. Sometimes makes me feel like I'm silly for trying to be something other than a woman. 

I have to remind myself that the problem isn't that I'm not androgynous enough, it's that the way we recognise gender is flawed. I don't look like a woman, I look like a shape people call woman because they arbitrarily decided that my dress sense and hair length signal womanhood. It's like calling sharks dolphins because they're long and grey and have fins and we don't wanna come up with their own category.
Not exactly the same I suppose. I feel similarly because I never really changed my look much. Too scared. Feels like a loop. Misgendered because I’m not androgynous enough. Not being more femme/andro because I’m misgender constantly already.
I'm out and constantly wear my ""my pronouns are they/them/theirs"" pin and people still misgender me and make me feel like I'm faking it 🙃
Eventually I just had to realize the only person it’s truly important I come out to is myself. That’s what makes it real and valid. Because there will always be people, especially when you come out to them, who show you they don’t even believe people like you exist. So even though it’s hard and takes lots of work, it’s worth reminding yourself that you know you exist the way you are. You feel your non-binary self and how it resonates in the world. Other people’s perception of you is out of your control, and even if you choose to be as open and out as possible, there will still be people who choose to perceive you as the gender you were assigned at birth, no matter what you look like or say you identify as. But you know what your true identity is. Have confidence in that, because you deserve to do that for yourself. 💜
It’s easy to feel this way. Totally relate. Just remember: you don’t need to look a particular way to be nonbinary or any other gender!  People misgendering is only about them/societal norms they subscribe to consciously or unconsciously; it’s not about you.
I have known I am non-binary for 15 years now but I never told the majority of people and I know what you mean. 

I dress however I’m feeling, sometimes very masc, sometimes very fem, sometimes androgynous. So for that reason, I’ve been considering my pronouns as she/they/he, so technically it’s impossible to misgender me, so I never correct people, even though I really hate being called “ma’am.” Maybe the real truth is it just seems like too much work to be correcting people all the time so I tried to make myself be okay with whatever people want to say.

I’m a singer/piano player and love doing covers… but whenever I have to sing about being a man or a woman it just sounds *so* wrong, enough to make me laugh if I’m not careful! I just remind myself that for every song, I am playing a character/channeling the original artist.
I’m an older person. I’ve always looked like and tried to act like a cis gendered man. 

I’ve been burying this for years. And it comes and goes. Genderfluid maybe. 

Sometimes I feel like I’m just “playing dress up” 

Other times I feel like if I have to breathe one more breath as a “man” then I don’t want to. 

The times I think I’m faking it are some kind of hiding from a difficult truth for me.  What I’m pretending is that I’m NOT non-binary. 

Keep at it. You will find your way. 

And I will take that advice too.
Yes! I have a really good friend for years but he is a bit older so I coming out is not an option,he wouldn’t understand.And he always refers to me as a strong/beautiful woman. Im not gonna correct him cuz its still a compliment but I feel really bad about it,especially cuz there is no term for non-binary in my language,and we use the same pronouns for everyone. I can’t come out cuz I literally can’t nobody would get it. So I often feel like im just a girl,who is not girly,even tho I never felt like a woman.
This really helped thank you, we are strong! I hope you are okay! And know how valid you are!!
Is that one topic at a time ?
Thankyou so much for this!
Can I ask, how you like came out? Like made it known I guess. I’ve been struggling so much, also you’re completely valid! I’m proud of you
Screw what anyone else thinks. You are valid and you’re so damn important. I get comments like “you wear dresses so you must be female” or “your hair is long not shaven you’re defo a girl” how invalidating I feel sickens me. But we are stronger together, the non-binary community is so fucking strong, JUSY gotta embrace being us, we are important
This. When most of your social time is at work, and you don’t have enough (or any) social time outside of work with people you’re comfortable around and open with, it starts sometimes feeling like I’m just a non-binary actor playing a cis character. I feel like a break from reality. And I feel like it’s truly just because I can feel that people are projecting a cis man’s identity onto me with no reason or relevance. It almost feels like I don’t really always have the energy to reassert my identity and block their projections.
This made me cry, I’m so glad it makes you feel validated you deserve to feel so fucking validated because guess why? You’re valid, you are important and you should be proud of who you are, thank you for existing this world is so much better with you being in it, and this world is so much better for you being you, please keep being yourself I love you! And never forget how valid you are
Yeah, this. Me too.
Firstly. You are so amazing, you built up that courage that takes a lot. The fact you did it should make you proud. And agreed correcting people definitely puts you in an open ended spot and can be so uncomfortable. You are valid and you are amazimg, my messages are always open if you ever need to talk or rant about anything
Firstly, you will definitely not be a hypocrite, you have certain pronouns you go by. They should respect that. Even if they forget oh you go by this pronoun, yes it takes time to use correct pronouns. Also when you said misgenderinf yourself. It happens. You’re HUMAN, sometimes it’s hard because it’s hard being us. Some days it’s confusing and that’s OK. We are human, you are valid and I’m proud of you
Literally it sucks it makes me so sad I just want to be corrected gendered but I’m terrified of coming out, sending you love ❤️
Thank you so much for this x
You’re completely valid
Thank you so much! This has defo helped me
Yes, even though I’m trans, I’m glad to still help you out! We are strong, you are valid! I’m really struggling with my Identity but I got a new haircut and it gave me quite a bit of euphoria so I think I’m getting close
Fairly sure yeah
I think so yeah
No problem!
It honestly boiled down to my confidence in myself and my confidence in saying it. Be proud of yourself. Even if its something you feel like may change in the future. You have the right to be yourself in the moment. Obviously having a support system helps but sometimes that just takes time to develop.
Thanks! I know what you are saying is a truth, but at the same time, so much of gender \*is\* performance... Having thought about it after making the first comment, I resolved to dress the way I want to at home, for myself, more often. I think that will help a lot.   


This is an issue I've been feeling for a long time, but didn't really put it into words until now, and as often happens, putting it into words helped me think of something helpful! So thanks for asking the question.
This is exactly how I feel. The cishet normie persona I created to avoid conflict at work has taken over my life :)
dude you made my night ^__^ we’re all super cool and valid and hot and deserve to be gendered how we want to be. we’re on our way! and ditto my messages are always open too ♡ tysmm
You will get there in the end it’s hard, but it will get easier. Omg niceeee, I’m glad the haircut gave you quite a bit of euphoria. I’m always available if you ever need to talk or just rant about anything. We are stronger together as a community
Thank you so much for this this is honestly so incredibly helpful!
How did you actually come out though? Like announce to everyone you meet? Make a post on social media?
Thank you! I’m here for you if you ever need a shoulder to cry on as well!
Ofc! Also know that if you don't feel safe telling someone, don't force yourself to. Feeling safe is just as important as being visible as yourself. It's a funny thing to balance but will get easier as you grow with yourself.
So I started with my partner and closest friends. Then acquaintances. Then I made one big ol post on social media which was also visible to my parents. With my parents it was more so like a ""I know you see this"" and you can come to me when you are ready to either talk about it or just accept it and not say anything. I also am not living with my parents so that made confrontation less of an issue cause I had a way out if need be."	qzbc99	NonBinary	417	1.0	2021-11-22 02:57:48
"Two separate people told a new coworker ""they'll get mad if you misgender them"""	"At the store I currently work at I came out as nonbinary several months ago and since then I have had an issue with people misgendering me pretty much constantly. Most people at the store seem to be just a bunch of mistakes for it, which I can accept, but there is one person in particular,  who just happens to be one of my higher ups, that does it all the time and reacts negatively when I correct him, which has led to me get very visibly angry, for obvious reasons.

With that being said, we had one of our old shift leads recently come back from maternity leave. She left before I was out and now that she has come back some people filled her in that I was nonbinary, which I can appreciate. She also mentioned, however, that they said it as a warning that I'll get mad if she misgenders me, and I don't really know how to feel about that?

On the one hand, it is kind if true. Like if I were being called the wrong name, repeated misgenedering will begin to annoy me, but the fact that they warned her made me feel like they thought I was overreacting. I've been honestly overly gracious with people making mistakes here and the fact that I apparently have this reputation is both frustrating and saddening to hear

I don't know exactly what my goal was with this post but I guess I wanted to voice the frustration to like minded people and maybe get validation? Advice? In any case, thank you to all who read this far 💛

Update: I brought this up with my coworker and friend who I suspected told the rehire (but suspected had good intentions) and she said that she has actually been correcting people on my behalf and letting new people know, but was not saying that I would get mad, which us lovely to hear. 

My guess is that one person said I would get mad and the other did not, but the rehire conflated the two. Still frustrating to wade through, but a much better situation. Thank you all for the support 💛🖤💜"	"Your frustration is valid.

It's trans antagonism. 

They're refusing responsibility for misgendering you, but instead offering you up as the unreasonable angry person - suggesting you're at fault, not them. 

They're giving a new coworker a bad impression of you, rather than making them aware of your ID so they have the tools to ensure you feel accepted and can make sure not to hurt you...instead they get a warning you're an unreasonable unfriendly person (aka 'one of *those* unreasonable trans').

Take being nonbinary out of the equation, it's still a coworker giving new staff a bad impression. It's shit.
transphobic people do this all the time. they’ll say “you guys call everyone transphobic!!!” and “you’re so sensitive for getting mad over being misgendered!!!” and then they turn around and say something transphobic and/or misgender you. and there’s no way to win. because if you call them out, you’re “proving them right”, and if you don’t then you just have to deal. to be completely honest, i’d consider it manipulation at this point.
I've had people act weird and tell me ""your not allowed to me mad if I mess up your pronouns"" or ""don't get mad if I don't get it right at first"". Which I wouldn't.. it's a habit that takes time to adjust and change. But ""I'm not allowed to be upset"" ... no Im allowed to. And why do people think I'm going to blow up on them for it?

Maybe this is just specifically in the context that you got upset and let them know (which is justified) and people saw that and took it to the extreme.. but I also think there is just a stereotype that Non-bianary people (maybe trans people too?) Will get pissed off and throw a fit and sue everyone for it. Just not true, I feel like most people on here say they don't even correct people when they are misgendered (myself included).
It’s truly ridiculous how just existing as trans makes people see us as “difficult”. If a woman got a divorce and asked her coworkers to stop calling her “mrs”, she wouldn’t be labeled as nagging or have rumors going around that she’s too tightly wound. It’s just because we’re trans.

Me and my partner both have had to file actual harassment reports at our job because one coach outright said she was misgendering us because we “didn’t pass well enough”. Now all the other coaches are acting like they have to walk on eggshells around us. Literally just treat us with respect, and we wouldn’t have to take it to corporate.
Just wanted to say ""good on you"" for standing up for yourself, no matter how they feel about it. I know it's cold comfort, but I think it's awesome you correct them, and they can kick rocks if they have an issue with you, your identity, or your assertion of it. <3
You should answer with “Does that mean that if I use the wrong pronouns with you or call you with a different name your wouldn’t get mad and/or try to correct me?” And if they answer with a no, start doing it. And call them by a different name everyday.
""Ok, so offer the same basic respect I give to all humans, by calling them what they want to be called? I'll see what I can do""

If you feel the need to tell people someone will get upset if you call them the wrong name, you need to reevaluate your attitudes towards people in general. That shouldn't be surprising
Thank you 💛
Unfortunately whenever you're in a marginalized group, you either have to walk on eggshells with absolutely everyone or else they will forever call you annoying and accuse you of being triggered and overreacting about absolutely everything. Just know that even though you may not win in the small battles at your work, the greater struggle is progressing at a good pace because of individual people having the bravery to come out to those around them and facing all the bullshit. Just know you don't have to be perfect, you are not going to ruin the movement for trans and enby acceptance by getting upset at someone trying to make you upset
I hate that people like to generalize trans people as rash, annoying, irrational, and aggressive by using dumb phrasing like ""that blue-haired girl with the xie-xem pronouns"". Groups of people in general shouldn't be reduced to negative stereotypes and generalizations. The way society views trans people makes me super self-conscious and hesitant to correct people when they get my pronouns wrong. Due to their preconceptions I don't want to come off as standoffish. You have every right to correct people if they get your pronouns wrong. They need to learn to be more respectful to you and not assume the worst based on generalizations based off of your identity.
Not Sure If It's Just Me, But The Fact That They Said That Also Seems To Imply That Either A: They Think A Better Reason Is Needed To Not Misgender Someone Than Just It's Common Decency, Or B: They Think The Person They're Talking To Might Think That. It Shouldn't Matter If Someone Gets Mad When You Misgender Them Because You Shouldn't Misgender Them. I Mean I Guess It'd Be Fair If Say They Start Yelling At People Who Occasionally Do It On Accident, But It Far From Sounds Like That's The Case For You.
They are deliberately pushing your buttons and playing victim if you react sppropriately.
Thank you. If it was the person that I am guessing it is then I don't think they intend on being harmful but just in case I think I am going to ask them about it for clarification. I'd rather have that problem resolved before any more new people come in and damage is done
staff should in general not be putting my name in their mouth.  I will introduce myself -
>And why do people think I'm going to blow up on them for it?

Because that's how media portray us to make us look like unhinged, unreasonable assholes instead of human beings who just want to be treated with basic respect like everyone else.
I literally don't bother bc it's not worth my exhaustion if im not in a work environment. But it depends if the person/people are clearly hateful then nah use wtf I tell you to
>""don't get mad if I don't get it right at first""

I had a big falling out with someone for using this after I first showed anger at repeated misgendering. That made me even angrier, because it had been *six years*.

We're thankfully now reconciled - they've finally got it and stopped misgendering me.
Ironically one of my cis coworkers (who often misgenders me, albeit by mistake and apologizes but doesn't *really* fix the problem) was cisgendered today and was visibly upset by it. It was kind of funny and validating haha

Therapist consistently misgendering me?	"Basically the title.

I'm nonbinary, I've made it clear I use they/them pronouns. When they first called me to get my information, they asked for my pronouns. They know what my pronouns are, and they're established as an LGBT friendly therapist (which they certainly are! Aside from this. No issues about me being ace/aro or being in a queerplatonic relationship)

But they still call me she/her when talking to me in third person. 

I even had the courage to stop them once and remind them that I don't use she/her. In fact, anything non feminine is fine. They encouraged me for setting boundaries, and used they/them for about five minutes before slipping back into she/her.

When I talked about being nonbinary again, and that I go by they/them pronouns (summed up by ""I don't want to be a boy, but I hate being a girl"") they asked if I knew that they/them referred to multiple people. 

They're totally fine with my plan to get top surgery though. I'm just very confused and think they might not understand what being trans or nonbinary means, but I don't quite have the energy or nerve to keep correcting them after doing so already.

I'm wondering if other people have the same experience I guess? I suppose I can understand it would be very easy to forget around me, I try not to be feminine but my voice gives it away.

One of the reasons I'm seeing them is *because* of Gender dysphoria

I'm not sure if I should seek someone else out, or suck it up and bring it up again, or just let it slide."	"If this therapist isn't helping you the way you need, don't hesitate to drop them. Therapy is too expensive to not get what you deserve.
You should try and find someone else. You aren't asking for something big for them to respect your pronouns. I found a lot of folks were comfortable listing LGBT friendly, but really meant LGB. You shouldn't have to 'let it slide' when it comes to getting care about something that means a lot to you.   
Thinking of you.
Even if this person is otherwise kind and helpful, and on board to help you get top surgery, they may still have a lot of learning to do where pronouns are concerned, and you’re well within your rights to switch to someone further along in their understanding. If they’re a good therapist, they’ll understand that they aren’t a good fit for you and that you need someone who won’t misgender you, even accidentally.
""they/them referred to multiple people""

isn't that not entirely correct even if you don't consider people who use they/them as their pronouns anyway though?
I found a nonbinary therapist explicitly for this reason. Not to say a cis therapist is incapable of respecting pronouns (ive had good experiencs w cis therapists too), but it does sort of garuntee they'll have a better immediate understanding if they are also nonbinary/trans. I look up almost all of my providers on the WPATH directory search, which means they have a certification on transgender health standards of care.
Yikes that's frustrating. Like others have said, you're paying too much to be this therapist's learning experience. There are plenty of LGBT friendly therapists that actually include the T. I see one via telehealth and she's great. She makes mistakes occasionally, but in the three years I've been seeing her I can count them on one hand. Good luck! I hope you're able to find someone that you don't have to fight with to be recognized as who you are.
I found myself in the same boat as you. I had an LGBT friendly therapist and he kept misgendering me. Every time he did I corrected him and he apologized, but I had enough after the 5th time. It definitely made me feel alienated in my own therapy session and I felt I couldn't build a relationship with the therapist because of this. I stopped him point blank mid session and said that we were done. I told him why, outlined the importance of pronouns, grilled him about what trans education he had (which might have been overkill), and said bye. I shook his hand when I left and it was sweaty as hell. ""Good,"" I thought.

As others have said, find a different therapist. To have a good therapist you need to build a relationship on trust and respect - you can't have one without the other, and not using your pronouns is disrespectful.
Yup new therapist time 

Edit: i use they them and have 2 therapists both cis and neither has any problems using my pronouns
You deserve to have a therapist who affirms you. It doesn’t sound like this one can do that. You’ve brought it up enough times. If they acknowledged you for setting that boundary, they should also realize they’re crossing it. A therapist is supposed to create a safe relationship container focused on your needs. It would be very reasonable to leave this one for not meeting your needs.
I had something similar happen. Noted my pronouns in the paperwork. She misgendered me in the first session. I brought up my pronouns thinking she probably just didn't see them on the paperwork. She pauses for a moment and says ""ok"" then goes on a rant about how it's grammatically incorrect. I dropped her and started seeing a trans therapist after that with no issue.
I’m trying to think of any time a therapist has had to refer to me as if they were talking to someone else and… that has never happened.

I am trying to figure out if or why your therapist decides to talk as if they are not talking to you (unless you have therapy with someone else/they are actually talking to someone else).

That just seems like misgendering on purpose by adding an invisible third person to double it down, adding the false idea that they is just for plural just solidifies that.
mine does the same thing :/ feels like shit im sorry
I had a therapist who did the same thing my first session. It felt so degrading, I didn’t go back to that therapist again and told the clinic exactly why I wouldn’t be returning. That is not acceptable to misgender someone in therapy.
I understand how frustrating that is.

When i came out as nb, i had told my then therapist that a lot of my family basically rejected me and refused to use my name. I told her i cut them off because they were disrespectful to me.

She said maybe my name was an ""agree to disagree"" topic and basically that i shouldn't let it damage the relationship.

My experience is a little different but i get how the crossing of boundaries is upsetting.
Therapists are meant to be professionals. They aren't your friend or your irrirating relative who doesn't understand singular they, all the while casually and obliviously using it in daily life. Nevermind that any therapist worth their salt understands the harm invalidating a person's identity on a consistent basis can do. Misgendering is Trans Mental Healthcare 101. 

If your therapist can't even manage to use your pronouns correctly, what the hell are they being paid for? Did someone forget to tell them what the T in LGBT stands for?
>*…they asked if I knew that they/them referred to multiple people…*

Wow, mega cringe. [Maybe try asking them if they know that *you* is actually the plural form of *thou*? ](https://www.merriam-webster.com/words-at-play/why-did-we-stop-using-thou) Then make it extra spicy and request that she go ahead and defer to *thou/thee* for talking to you from now one, since that’s objective singular and she seems to get too confused using plurals.

Hope the article brings you a bit of cheer. Anyone who is bucking back at the use of “they” being objective singular in modern English really needs to just grow up. But if they want to have a battle on etymology and semantics then, let’s not let them down mm? ;) You got this OP.


edit:  Also yes, get a new therapist that is genderqueer friendly. :)

edit 2:  Some edits for clarity
It doesn’t sound like they are being maliciously disrespectful. 

It also sounds like they have more biases to work through in this area, than they seem to be aware of.

It is perfectly reasonable to place a boundary in this area. For example you could say something like the following:

“I am questioning whether this can be a safe enough space for me to continue therapy, while I continue to be misgendered. 

I find it _____ (triggering) and _______ (disrespectful). It feels like it’s getting in the way of my progress, or is actively harmful. 

I appreciate that you may already be doing your best. 

Do you have any thoughts on the subject? Do you feel like we may be able to find a solution that allows me to feel more safe? “
Ugh this is brutal. How to decide whether to stay with a therapist who is good in many ways bit dehumanizing in others? It's hard enough to find a good therapist as it is.

In a perfect world, I would say ditch them. Misgendering is not okay and they don't seem to care that they're hurting you. But in *this* world, it might be worth it to see who else you can find first?

It also sounds like they could use some education on pronouns and trans issues.
They/them can be used to refer to multiple people but has been used as gender neutral pronoun for centuries
This infuriating. If possible, you have to try to move onto someone else. This individual obviously needs more education, but that is *not your job right now*, especially since you are being directly affected by their conduct, THEY are the professional, and you need support that is directly related to your gender identity. If possible, please try to find another therapist. Sorry you have to go through this.
A therapist isn’t someone you should correct in these terms. If it’s not working then go for another one is my advise, that won’t ever help, if anything it makes for weird confused feelings
A bad therapist is worse than no therapist!!
I had a therapist just like this once, it turned out her not being able to understand or respect my gender identity was incompatible with healing. Its time to leave and get a new one.
You are not there to train your therapist. Please find a new one, dear.
You need a different therapist. It's very unprofessional of them to be uneducated about trans people at this point
Maybe mention to them that the singular form of they has been correct since 1375 :)

And maybe tell them that “you” was originally supposed to be plural, and that they should only use “thou” when talking to one person if they care so much about what’s “really” correct for singular vs plural pronouns
I’ve had to drop my psychiatrist for this very reason (though she also couldn’t seem to get on board with my name change, even though she only knew me as my dead name for literally ONE session). You deserve to be respected, especially by someone in the mental health field who should know better
If an LGBT friendly therapist asks you if you know they/them is for multiple people ESPECIALLY after establishing pronons, they are not LGBT friendly.

Im sorry for our experience, and I hope you can find a new therapist who doesnt contribute to the problem you are seeing them to help work through.
LGBT friendly my ass. How you gonna train in LGBT issues and not have heard people use ""they/them"" before. It's like, common knowledge
Woah I did not expect this to get the attention that it has! Thank you so much everyone, I'll definitely be bringing this up to my therapist. I hope this entire page can help and reinforce said help for anyone else who finds themself in this situation.
Confront them! Big time. ""You know I have this problem where people I'm relying on still misgender me. It really hurts, even though they're trying to be supporting me they call me she. Specifically you. How do I get you to stop?""

It's super forward and aggressive but you are paying this person to at LEAST not make it worse.
!new therapist time! (if possible, it can be hard with healthcare and finances) if you can’t get a new therapist, you may have to educate them by sending them some posts/articles about non-binary and gender queerness, but this is not your responsibility and it is on them to educate themselves to be a good therapist. this is also something you should suggest to them if you feel they may respond well and won’t remove you as a patient (again, healthcare)
I had a therapist who would do the same thing. I ended up going to a younger therapist who specialises in young adults, even though I’m in my 30’s. She took me on because she recognized that a lot of my issues intersected with her other patients.
It’s up to you to decide how important it is to you to be addressed correctly. My stance on it would be to keep pushing. Send them resources that educate them on nb ppl and grammatical correctness for they/them pronouns (for that second one the brainpop discussing pronouns should work if you have access to that) In the meantime, I wish you luck <3
Alrighty yep, it's time to move on.  
I explained how I hate being referred to as a girl and that it's getting worse- they said to be mindful of the people referring to me as a girl.   
Then called me lady and ma'am during the meeting. Also used the term   
transvestite.  
I think I'll be switching to a gender therapist even if it means I have   
to go completely virtual.
Oh that does put it into perspective. My therapy is covered thankfully, but it certainly hasn't been doing me any wonders. Thanks!
this is your answer right here. 
 
therapists are tending to peoples' needs, as anyone in healthcare is. if that service isn't giving you what you need, look elsewhere for assistance. 
 
your emotional & mental wellbeing is far too important to give someone your time if they aren't adding anything positive to your existence...& that goes for much more than just therapy, as well...
Thank you for the feedback! I've noticed Psychology Today (where I was looking for therapists) often has ""LGBT friendly"", ""lesbian"" and ""bisexual"" listed specifically, but never anything else. I imagine it's all the LGBT options possible they can put, so they just put them all.

I've had some reservations about my therapist now for other reasons anyways, so I'll start looking for someone else! Probably a specifically LGBT therapist. Thanks again!
Thanks for the advice! I'll try to be upfront next time that I need them to use my pronouns. I might consider switching anyways for other reasons, but if they can make a genuine effort to correct themselves that'd be a huge improvement. Or they'll switch back to she/her and that'll answer whether or not I should look for someone else anyways.
Yeah I tried to explain it this way, ""when you find a wallet, you say, 'oh someone dropped their wallet' but you don't mean multiple dropped it. You're referring to one person"" which led to confusion over using it only when you don't know someone's gender yet, which I countered with something along the lines of ""sort of, but it's not too hard to apply that to myself with practice."" 

I'm always confused by the multiple people argument. I guess people just don't really notice how often neutral pronouns are used since they don't have any reason to think about it!
Singular they has actually been in use for longer than singular you.
Singular pronouns, have been for the last 600 years. We all learn this in our first school years.
It is a bit weird, but sometimes they try to get into the shoes of the other person, like my family, or describe me in third person. I imagine it's to show that other people don't think of me as low as I might think (won't get into all that funky stuff haha, but it's an example) or to point out things I need to work on from a narrative standpoint, which I understand, it'd just be way more tolerable with the correct pronouns. 

(of course there's also statements like ""inside you there's this wonderful ***girl""***)

Though the therapist did respond once with referring to me as ""you"" then promptly going into third person with ""she/her"" after first being reminded about the pronoun thing, so... probably a good sign for me to start looking for someone else.
I hope you found a new therapist?
It's like... I get that the few people I've told are having trouble adjusting. Saying I'm disappointed or hurt when they call me a girl doesn't mean I'm disappointed *in* them. But hearing that I should be mindful of them when that's what I've been doing this whole time stings.
And make sure you let them know why if you're comfortable with that and they give you a leaving survey. There's an opportunity for them to grow from this and learn for next time.
You are hiring them for a service and you can fire them at any time! It doesn't have to be mean or punitive, but you can discontinue services any time you like. Therapy often involves a bit of shopping around before you get someone you can work with well. Good luck in your journey!
I can only speak from my own experience. But if you’re not leaving every therapy session feeling like you were finally able to get something off your mind, or relieved, or confident, or excited, or like you’ve established a plan forward, find a new therapist.
Maybe a trans friendly one would be best? That way you know they have a deeper understanding of nonbinary/trans stuff
It can be hard to find depending on where you live. But if you can find a practice that caters primarily (or even exclusively) to transgender people, that’s your safest bet.
Ya, the singular they has been used for a long time(can be traced back to 1375), and it is endorsed as part of APA style writing. 

Btw your example makes an image of multiple people dropping their wallet pop up in my head lmao.
I, an editor, am stating that they/them is not always indicative of the plural and it has been used consistently in its singular form since the 14th century.

You can also tell your therapist on my behalf that they (singular) are transphobic when they make the decision to use pronouns that you have stated you don’t use. Respect for clients is vital for a therapeutic relationship. Their ongoing decision to misgender you makes them an unsafe contact for any trans or non-binary person. 

IMO you should make certain that the LGBTIAQ network in your area is aware that this person is unable and unwilling to correctly use your pronouns, as it shows that they are definitely NOT an ally.
Your therapist wasted your time you were paying for correcting and questioning you on your own pronouns. Drop em.
ok now I'm picturing all the ""they is for multiple people"" arguments, but it's people complaining when singular you was starting to be a thing
Yeah. Not that's pretty intentional. Like, especially with saying theres a girl inside you when you aren't a girl, no matter how you present or sound, that's messed up and transphobic honestly. It seems super intentional when you add those details to it.
Unfortunately I have not. I don't have the finances to do so.

She also crossed boundaries a few times. I had mentioned in passing that I was bisexual. She asked if i wanted to talk about it. I said no. And then she proceeded to ask if it bothered me I'd never gotten to experience being with a woman (i realized after meeting my partner).

The experience with her made me a bit cross but 🤷🏽‍♀️. I've had some great therapists and hope to find another one day.
I should mention that even though I was going mostly for gender dysphoria, they said that they knew that there's a deeper root to the problem, that if people want to change the outside of themselves it's because they haven't addressed the inside first or something.

Yeah, thanks. The inside is the gender dysphoria. I'm depressed cause I'm a girl, not a girl cause I'm depressed.
It will never not bother me that people will complain about singular they but not bat an eye at using singular you.
Yeah, and I thought it was weird that they asked for OP's pronouns, but only expected he or she? Never seen anyone ask for pronouns when they weren't even willing to use they/them

The struggle of not wanting to misgender someone, while also trying not to out them 😅		"This has been a major problem for me with my family. I am not out publicly, so my family still uses male pronouns when talking about me to people I'm not out to yet. Which is hard when I overhear the conversation, but my mom has pointed out that they are trying not to out me. On the one hand, I am glad they are letting me have agency over how and when I come out to people, but on the other, I wish they would find a different way to refer to me without misgendering me. It feels like they are putting pressure on me to come out faster, in a way.

How to not get misgendered (not serious)	"A while back I was rollerblading down my street just for practice and I saw a family going for a walk nearby. This little toddler pointed at me as I got closer and excitedly went ""skates!"". I sped up as to stay out of their way and their parent just kind of offhandedly said ""Yeah, **they're** wearing rollerblades"" as I zoomed away. This is the first time I've been correctly gendered by a stranger and it felt amazing, but as I was skating on my way home, I realized something. 

They couldn't see what gender I was because I was going fairly fast.

So if I go fast all the time nobody will be able to tell what my gender is...

TLDR: If you rollerblade fast enough you can ascend gender."	"Gotta go fast
Sweet I was thinking about learning to skateboard so this’ll definitely be a plus
While I approve of this strategy in general, I deliberately call everyone they/them to my kid unless I definitively know otherwise. And the rest of the time I somewhat-awkwardly avoid all pronouns and gendered terms.
It reminds me of that time the Flash outran death until it stopped existing as a concept
Just gotta go fast enough to break through the gender barrier, akin to the sound one
Why roller derby is so enby friendly....
doesnt work with bikes, got misgendered
I got catcalled while learning to quad skate in a binder and masc clothes. This gave me a chuckle

I think I might be trans non binary but my girlfriend is a radfem: what can I do? ( trigger warning ⚠️ )	"Hello! I'm the same person who wrote about dysphoria and wanting to go back transitioning. 

My dysphoria came back after 2 years of being ""gone"" (and by """" I mean that I'm thinking some aspects of my condition didn't went away all this time). I have dysphoria since I was 14yo and received and formal diagnosis at 17. I wanted to transition really bad by undergoing top surgery and microdosing T.

I talked about my friends about this: dysphoria, being confused and thinking that I tried to suppress my symptoms and desire for transitioning. They were very welcoming and I felt safe! 

Well, not the same happened to my girlfriend. I'll be honest: she is a radfem and I used to think somethings like her in the past (maybe due to projection or something), but not anymore. I didn't say anything about transitioning itself, I tried at first talking about my dysphoria and she said it could be ""me wanting to fit beauty standards"" (even tho I do already do fit, I'm white and have a thin body, except for being masc), ""internalized misogyny"" (even tho I dont feel offended being called a woman and etc), that maybe ""dont think I can be a woman just for being masc"" and other things like that. I said to her that me knowing those things won't make my dysphoria go away and that is something much more deeper.

One day I posted on my twitter a drawing I made of myself happy with a flat chest from top surgery. She and a friend of hers got upset. My girlfriend tried to argue the same thing. She even said she thought she was trans to, but she realized it came from s.a.. I thought that speech was really heavy and dishonest. Isn't that similar to saying gay people are gay just because ""they were s.a.""?

And that's not all: she usually makes fun of trans people, specially non binary. From my perspective, I think she tries to justify the transgender experience with just her personal perceptions, based on her own ideology, also with ""scientific facts"" that are not even a consensus in the scientific community, which I warned her about, such as ""autogynephilia"" and etc. She makes attempts to put all trans people in the same box: trans men are just ""poor women with internalized misoginy"", trans women ""gay men who can't accept themselves"" and that enbies are ""not really trans"". I find it funny that she usually misgender trans people she thinks are ""not really trans"", but if she's talking about a trans person who are ""not queer""/conservative, she uses their preferred pronouns. I pointed this behavior of hers, but she got kinda silent lol. I find it very simplistic to condition a group of people to the same negative thing, given that they are diverse and have VERY complex experiences.

It's easy to mock a group of people when you don't pass what they go though. And I get mad because that's also mocking my past experience. Yes, I did the same in the past, probably to feel better about myself and hide my desire for transition, but I don't want to be that kind of person anymore. Is not good, for me and for others, to talk negative things about a group ALL THE TIME. I feel bad and embarrassed by that.

I don't know what to do. I'm really upset and I don't feel safe with her to talk about this. (I edited the post to put more information and correct some gramatical mistakes)."	"she sounds like an awful person and not an ally to you or the trans community. maybe I'm just tired from all the anti-trans legislation going on in my country but I would run away fast if I were you. a loved one is supposed to support you, not perpetuate hate towards you. don't let a transphobe tell you who you are.
>I don’t feel safe with her to talk about this.

All you need to focus on is leaving her. She will not change, she will not see it from your perspective, she will continue to spout untrue and harmful bullshit to refute your identity. You may have feelings about her but she does not care about you as a whole person. This is not someone you can trust or feel safe around, there’s no point in staying with them or trying to change her mind. Start getting your affairs in order if you live with her because things will not improve and you deserve to pursue transition if it will make you happy.
Even if you weren’t non-binary I would suggest breaking up with her because she is an asshole
I don't see how this can work out in any healthy way if she's relying on pseudoscientific arguments to defend deliberate cissexism, and you can't feel safe - much less seen or accepted - in your relationship. I'm sorry. Best wishes.
That is such an awful place to be; having to chose between your relationship and your gender identity. I'm sure she has a lot of wonderful attributes which weren't included in the post, which is why you got with her in the first place. But it does sound like you'll never be able to explore your gender identity, and those dysphoric feelings probably won't just go away on their own.  We all end up suppressing parts of ourselves in relationships (i.e. I love musicals and my partner hates them so I don't watch them around him), but gender identity is a really big part. If it's too big of a part, you'll likely end up resenting her or feeling unfulfilled in your self. I could tell you what I think you should do, based on my perceptive, but I don't know how it feels to be you. You're the only one who can determine if the dysphoria/desire to transition is something you can bottle up, and if she's worth it.  Best of luck my friend, whichever way you decide.
have some respect for yourself and break up with her!! life is too short to deal with radfems
Please leave her
You literally don't like your girlfriend. You admitted it. Breakup.
Leave her? Im sorry sounds like a no brainer to me. 

People that don't accept you for you are not worth keeping around.

You'll eventually find someone else more compatible, you'll hurt for a while but you'll be glad you did yourself a favour by choosing your life over a temporary person.

I don't want to sound like I'm dismissing your relationships but relationships aren't everything. If being with a person makes you miserable then you shouldn't be with them.
You are not safe with her to talk about this, because she is clearly not safe. She needs to be let go. She is not supporting you by mocking and downplaying your lived experience and knowledge of yourself.

It genuinely makes me suspicious that maybe she really has felt a lot of the same but has ""successfully"" packed it away with internalized transphobia of her own... 🤷 Many many people who can't accept that they might be trans (or gay, or nonbinary) will find defense mechanisms that include shooting down that minority as a way of distancing themself from it...

Even so. She sounds extremely toxic on this front, and that's not someone you should be with even if you weren't personally the affected minority.
Please realize that even if you do realize you are cis, you are dating a transphobe. Can you really live with the fact that you love and are romantically involved with a transphobic person at a time where trans violence is at an all time high and the lives of young trans children are at stake?
Break up with her
I'm sorry but your gf and her friend sound like terrible people. TERFS are bad people, full stop.

I would remove them from my life
just as she has the right to end your relationship if you transition, you have the right to protect yourself, your well-being, and your dignity by not allowing your fear of someone's reaction keep you from transitioning. you are worth far more than the respect you are receiving, and i strongly recommend you reevaluate what positive things this relationship is bringing to you when such an important part of your life is being dismissed, downplayed, and disrespected. transitioning can make us lose people in the process, but it also guides us to the people who love us most no matter what path we undergo. you deserve better than this relationship.
She sounds like, at best, a person with an awful lot of trauma to unpack from several sides and an identity to unpack as well, and at worst, a great big transphobe. Either way, you deserve better. Your partner should make you feel safe and accept you always. One day, she may learn and grow, but you do not have to be the testing ground for her to do so. You deserve better.
I also give this advice to all the bisexual people who are in straight relationships and feel like they can’t talk to their partner about it… DO NOT TOLERATE ANY KIND OF RELATIONSHIPS THAT DOESN’T RESPECT THE WHOLE YOU.
Your girlfriend is not a ""radical feminist"", she's not out burning bras, she's a **TE**RF, she's a shitty fucking transphobe.  The hell with her and her asshole friends.  Get yourself out of this relationship, she is not a good or healthy person for you to be with.
Only read the title. Your only option is to be direct, honest, and authentic. If she can't accept you, or isn't willing to try in some capacity, you have to decide whether or not she is worth the stress in your life moving forward. She is either with you or behind you. Your health and all comes first.
it sounds scary but you need to leave. I had a doctor who refused to give me HRT due to my past with SA and as soon as she said those words out loud I immediately decided to never go back again. ive been on T for nearly two years now.
if you do not feel safe with her now, you will not feel safe with her. this is not the person you want to spend your energy on. she will not help you grow.
**break up with her.** she is not a safe person to be around, and she’s not a good person in general. radfems are a hate group and you’d be best off getting far away from her.
I understand you're going through a lot and that you must care about your girlfriend. I have to be honest though, as someone who has been repeatedly told awful things by self proclaimed radfems, I cannot support them at all. Again, I understand she must have good qualities and that you care about her. I also hope that you find it in yourself one day to accept yourself and cut anybody who describes themselves as a radfem out of your life, because as long as she identities as one she will never accept you. She will try to tell you awful things about being trans and why you feel the way you do. You don't need that, especially when you're so early on in questioning. 

It is okay that you have this past because you are learning now. It's always okay to change our hearts and minds and be kinder. As long as she still identifies as a radfem, she is surrounding herself by some of the most hateful people. It doesn't take much googling to find cases of radfems and TERFS doing everything up to and including murdering trans women. 

Radfems and TERFS are genuinely dangerous people. I don't say that lightly. Again, I hope you find it in yourself to accept who you are and continue to learn and find people who aren't so hateful to be in your life.
She does not sound like she is very loving towards you.
If you don't want to be that kind of person anymore, why date that person? She's not going to change any time soon and it's not your job to make her a better person
get a new girlfriend
Sounds like a piece of shit

Find someone better
Just ask yourself if you want to be with someone you don’t feel safe to be yourself around. or do you deserve to be with someone who loves you for who you are and fully supports you in your journey of exploring your gender and identity. the answers to these questions will make it clear as to what you should do for yourself. 
whenever you’re ready, i’m sure you will find a way to be true to yourself and choose what you deserve.
Leave that rude ass transphobe
Dump her. She sounds absolutely horrible, and no person is worth staying with if they disrespect you for being who you want to be.
I would urge you to leave this relationship, if you can.  I was in a similarly terrible relationship before I started transitioning, and it held me back for years and caused so much misery that made it even harder to accept myself later.  These people almost never change, and even if her views somehow changed, it sounds like she's being emotionally abusive in ways that often are even more ingrained than bad viewpoints.
I highly recommend reading some essays by Dr. Devon Price, like *Irreversible Healing: What Testosterone has Done for Me* [here](https://devonprice.medium.com/irreversible-healing-what-testosterone-has-done-for-me-6e4b2f086823) or *My Dalliance with Detransition* [here](https://devonprice.medium.com/my-dalliance-with-detransition-97ac9a5126e6). He is pretty honest about his transition and difficulties before, during, after. He is also very adamant about not lying to ourselves, and figuring out ways to be more comfortable and satisfied as a result.
Y'know, from experience with that sad excuse for a community, a lot of ""radfems"" are actually trans, they're just too broke, too cowardly, and too oblivious to know it. 

Many of them have severe androphobia due to trauma and it leaks out into every aspect of their lives. 

For your own mental health, get out of that relationship. It's not worth the amount of work.
I also fell somewhat down the radfem pipeline before I accepted that I’m nonbinary- biological essentialism and black and white thinking feels simple and somewhat comforting but in truth the world is far far more complex than radfem ideology allows for. 

You should leave your girlfriend- she is actively hindering your journey of learning who you are. No one needs to know why you’ve broken up with her, people end relationships for all sorts of things. Most people will accept that you just didn’t feel romantically for her any more. 

The most important thing is that you are able to self reflect and develop without feeling scrutinised by someone who will judge your identity.
Even if you're not trans she's still a piece of shit and your relationship is conditional
Breakup with her, she’s clearly not a safe person for you and she may even cause you to slip back into your old ways, and the whole “being trans bc of SA” Is disgusting and is extremely transphobic. You should be allowed to transition and be whoever you want to be and she’s holding you back from that when she’s meant to support you. You should get away from you before she goes full TERF
Everyone saying you have to leave her clearly hasn’t been in any situation like this. Firstly, I’m so sorry you’re going through this. It’s so tough. I really, really hope things work out. 

Maybe seek out advice from friends- specifically mutual friends. You want advice and help without painting her as the villain and being told by everyone in your circle to split. These friends could have separate conversations with her (not about you, just the subject)

You could do some things to ‘ease’ her into it. Go to different community events, pride things, etc. Repost resources and things on your social media stories; things about accepting ALL LGBT+ people, things about trans rights, etc. 

At the end of the day though, it’s your decision. You get to choose how much time and energy you want to put into educating her. No matter what you do choose, I really do wish you the best of luck and peace of mind
Break up with her. Honestly. She will never accept you as you are, she won't even entertain the idea and would rather talk you out of it :/
You're feelings make a lot of sense. That feels like a direct conflict between your romantic relationship and your personal identity. Both integral things you don't want to have pitted against each other!

You could tell her all of this. If you think there's any hope of carrying on with the relationship, she would need to hear and understand all of that. I don't know her, so I don't know if that's likely.
this is going to sound harsh, but I wouldn’t recommend staying in a relationship with her. Even if you can get her to change her mind (which sounds extremely difficult at this point in time) it’ll take a lot of time and emotional energy. as someone who had a radfem best friend while i was 17 and finally accepting that i was trans (though i first verbally expressed maybe not being cis when i was 14), it’ll take a while to undo the damage that people like that have on you. and it truly held me back. I probably would’ve started t a lot sooner, considered top surgery a lot sooner, and changed my name a lot sooner if she hadn’t been against all those things for me. if someone’s actively mocking the trans community, they probably are gonna bring you a lot of strife to keep in your circle
The fact that your friends are supportive of you is a sign that there are people out there that will accept you for who you are. You deserve better than whatever the hell she's been giving you, and I would imagine you'd be better off without her transphobic views in your life. I don't see her changing anytime soon :(
(i didn't find out which pronouns you prefer so i am going with they / them, i hope that's okay)
when i read your post, i thought: good, this person understands exactly what is going on with their girlfriend. i think you already know what to do. you gave me a pretty good picture of your situation. she is not respecting or recognising how you feel, because of her own way of seeing things.
maybe really consider taking a break from each other. i bet that's what's on your mind too.
you can try that and see if you feel better when she is not around. maybe you find to your true self faster without her.
(Apologies for long comment)
as a nonbinary dyke who considers themselves somewhat radfem (trans affirming+believes that Women's Lib and Trans Lib go hand in hand) I think you might want to sit with the hard truth that your gf is unlikely to come around to your way of thinking anytime soon. From what you described, she is heavily peaked/indoctrinated into gender critical ideology, and it's likely she is surrounded by an online community that will provide her with built in ""explanations"" as to why you want to seek transition. If you stay together and go on T/get top surgery, best case scenario, she goes along with it while secretly pitying you/not taking it seriously. Worst case, she'll actively try to undermine your medical choices with the encouragement of her GC friends. In either scenario, your relationship will become incompatible with your happiness, If it already isnt. 

That being said, I have talked to quite a few ex TERFs/GCs who've managed to break out of the ideology, (it sounds like you were one of them) so it's not impossible for her to change. If you want to go that route, the best way to approach it is to introduce pro trans talking points through a radfem framework.  @aletheia327 on Twitter is an ex TERF but still radfem who writes often about why she was attracted to GC ideology until she realized it was reactionary, transphobic, and anti feminist. it might be easier for her to digest if she hears critique of her view from someone who doesn't inherently see trans rights through the lense of a queer people vs feminism culture war. I would also look into the work of Leslie Feinberg, a historical lesbian and transgender activist who considered zirself both transgender and a lesbian (by modern queer terminology would prob be described as a transmasc butch), which might help her understand the complexities and nuances of the trans experience.

Realistically, I don't know how much success that will reap, since it sounds like you've been trying and extending her a lot of patience to no avail. And I know it's devastating to realize you love someone who is slowly killing you inside. But ultimately, you know you've felt this way since you were 14. you know that no amount of ""unpacking internalized misogyny"" will make this go away, because you've already tried. And you deserve to surround yourself with people who make you feel safe and don't project their own gender related trauma onto you and dismiss you. And if she can't be that person for you, it might be time to let her go. 
Sending you all my love. I'm so sorry you're going through this, and I hope you come to the conclusion that's best for you and your health, not your girlfriend's comfort.
Radfeminism breeds terfs. She is not in your corner.
I understand being in a difficult relationship and being afraid to leave or feeling as though maybe things will work out or that you can get her to change but please, it’s not worth it. I ended a relationship with a bigoted partner two years ago after I couldn’t take pretending to be cis any longer. It was one of the hardest things I’ve ever done but things are so much better now that I have the room to grow and be myself. You deserve that!! Your current relationship is not worth the pain of suppressing who you are and it will destroy you to keep going the way things are
Make sure you have a support group like a friend or family that knows you're breaking things off and safely break up with her. Radfem's believe in very dangerous stuff, and i'd suggest going with your own judgement regarding how you break things off. Please stay safe
She sounds awful.
I would leave someone like that
Who you are has NOTHING to do with who you’re dating. Don’t compromise your identity for her. I did and regret it.
she doesn't sound like a healthy person to have a relationship with. you (and everyone!!) deserve to have relationships with people who respect you and make you feel safe. not the same but i have been in a situation where i felt like i couldn't tell my partner things because i was worried about the way they would react and it's not a good way to live. if you'd like some support feel free to message me if you think it would help you 💓
One is supposed to feel safe around a partner. If you don't it's not a person who deserves you
Personally I would break up with someone like this, whether or not I was ultimately trans. I don't date openly racist people either, even though they wouldn't be racist against *me* because I'm white. Staying with someone like this is a tacit endorsement of their beliefs imo. Dating her is a problem regardless of whether you ultimately decide you're trans, and excising this particular tumor should be done sooner rather than later. For both of your sakes, and especially because she's creating a really unhealthy environment to try to explore your gender identity in.
Break up with her. Seriously. If this is how she is now, it's likely not going to get better in the future. You deserve to be with someone you can be yourself with.
This entire post feels like a giant red flag. She's constantly dismissing your ideas immediately, mocking a group of people she knows nothing about, and I think the worst part is the quote ""I don't feel safe with her to talk about this."" A romantic partner should be someone who you feel comfortable sharing your struggles and questions with without any fear, who you feel safe to talk to. I'm not just going to say ""Leave her she's terrible"" or anything because I don't know what she's like outside of this issue, but this does feel like you either need to have a discussion about it, or break up with her.
Someone you're dating should be someone who supports you, someone who you feel safe around, someone who accepts all of you not just the parts they like, someone who you can trust. Please ask yourself if all, or any, of these apply to your girlfriend. And if they don't, ask yourself why she's your girlfriend.
I give you permission to break up with her 🖤🖤🖤
Honestly, if you can work up the courage to, then I'd tell her. Depending on her reaction (as in if it's seemingly neutral or better), then I'd probably give her some time to see if her general behaviour towards trans and nonbinary people changes. If it doesn't, then she fundamentally would not respect you as a person, only her idea of you, and that's not the foundations of a lasting positive relationship.
Tbh even if you were cisgender I’d tell you to break up with her.

She’s a toxic asshole with shitty views and you can do so much better. She won’t let you be who you want to be, and it’s not your job to “fix” her. Call it there, and end it. Don’t even be friends, she doesn’t deserve it, and you don’t deserve to have to put up with someone like her.
Run. Get as far away as you can. That is fucking terrifying. You deserve better, and I don't mean to sound dramatic or scare you, but people like her can be dangerous. ***Please*** be careful. The fact that you don't feel safe talking with her about this shows just how precarious your situation is. Listen to your instincts. Surround yourself with people who love and care about you and will protect you. I personally would view this as a domestic abuse-type situation, and the period of getting away from the abuser is always the most dangerous time.
If she can not grow to accept you, you've given her time to come around, and she hasn't and decided to invalidate yours and others' feelings -

Then leave. As a partner, even if she doesn't understand where you are coming from the least she could do is try but instead she has attacked you for an identity/label that made you feel safe and demonized your feelings and disrespected you and your community completely. I know it's disappointing, but it's the option that would likely make you happiest, even if you lose someone you love in the long run. It's definitely better than her suddenly leaving you because of your identity, though.
only read the title, but fucker her.
uh

yikes at her being transphobic

Why are you going out with a transphobe who makes you feel unsafe?
Hey, this take might be a little spicy, but I’m just going to be honest. depending on the flavor of radfem, in my experience they don’t usually make safe dating partners, at least not for people who aren’t cis women. I’m an amab nb with varied gender presentation and my ex was a radfem leaning woman who shamed me for my body and was pretty open about hating men and amab people in general. I understand she had a lot of trauma from men which led her to that point, but I honestly walked away from the relationship carrying my own trauma and shame because of the way she made me feel about my body and gender. She wasn’t explicitly transphobic like many other radfems but her ideas did lead her down the rabbit hole of browsing terf and misandrist subreddits and stuff like that, which was honestly really upsetting to me, but I find it can be incredibly hard to reason with people of that perspective. After I broke up with her I basically vowed to never put myself through anything like that again. I have compassion for radfems and recognize there are deep societal inequalities that lead them to their ideas. I hope they can change, but for me they have just been generally unsafe to be around and I can’t imagine this experience being all that much better as a trans man or masc presenting non-binary person. Please be careful and remember that people like this can have a huge impact on others’ mental health
Hey! I’m a radfem, but not all radfems are trans-exclusionary; your girlfriend is just a dick. if you can’t be yourself around her then there’s no point continuing in a relationship. it’s hard but you shouldn’t give up your own freedom for assimilating into a relationship that will hurt you.
I have no idea what your gender is; no one else can tell you that. But you should have a support network that wants you to be happy and that will support you no matter your gender. If someone thinks there is an automatic right or wrong outcome for you as you explore your gender, they aren't really supportive of you.
I'm so sorry your girlfriend has shown she's not a safe person to be open with
You can't change her mind for her, all you can do is decide whether or not you want to stay
Honestly, even putting aside your own identity here - there's an obvious conflict between your beliefs and hers. She's transphobic, you disagree, and arguing about it isn't working. She's making fun of you to her friends/publicly putting you down about a sensitive and personal struggle.

I don't see her as particularly different from (another common example unfortunately) a cishet guy with a bisexual girlfriend, who he doesn't see as ""really queer"" and makes homophobic remarks in front of / about, while dismissing her identity as ""just from SA"" or wanting to be ""not like the other girls"". Both would be shitty, bigoted behaviours, even if they \*weren't\* talking to someone who is a part of the group being derided. To do all that to someone you're supposed to love and support is just... cruel.

That you were out, changed your mind (and engaged in terf-y spaces), and are now in a state of questioning and wanting to come out again is understandable. It's rarely a straight line from realisation to actualisation. Going back in the closet because you thought you were wrong, or that something else would be easier, or because the world is scary and you *hoped* you were wrong... happens. Can't beat yourself up about that. Also not worth beating yourself up if you do land on being cis again. The question is what do you want to do now, and do you want to tolerate someone who is going to dictate how much of yourself you're 'allowed' to be.
break up with her. you'll not have support and your dysphoria, at some point, will become a joke to her.

u dont deserve someone who don't understand u on your changings. its sad, but she changes only if she wants and maybe she won't do it. and probably will make fun of you on your process. is not easy, but think in a long term.
My guy, you should just break up with her
break up with her cuz she’s an asshole.
I’m sorry but your girlfriend sounds like an absolute trash human. I mean no one is perfect but she seems to be deliberately interested in causing harm. 

I wish you all the best as you navigate all of this. I really reallllllly recommend considering leaving this person so you have the space you deserve and need in order to explore and experience your gender. I hope you have supportive people (or at least one person) you can turn to.
Dude you need to leave her regardless, she is a horrid person
This, for real. Anyone who tries to make you fit the mold of what they think you should be is not worth keeping in your life.
She is wonderful in many things! But I really am afraid: I'm not sure yet what I am going to do, if I'm cis or trans, who am I... but I can't erase my transgender experience. It was a big part of me, I can't erase me. I tried, but that's is disrespecting my own being. If just being ""political"" (like what many radfems like to say) and acknowledging misogyny would be enough, my body dysphoria wouldn't have been back and I wouldn't have been questioning myself and my beliefs. How I perceive myself was always different, since I was 14. It didn't changed, even if I tried to hide it. I'm afraid if I discover myself as trans non binary and be sure 100% I want to continue my transition, will she make fun of me? Will she say bad things just like she says about other trans people? Will she sees myself in a different way?

If I break up with her, my mother will sure want to know why I did it. I really CANNOT tell her about this. she will definitely be sad if I say Im thinking about going back to transition. I don't want to be judged. I really wouldn't know what to say if she asked ""why did you breakup with your girlfriend? Everything was going okay, wasn't it?"".
This is a nice take. Only OP can know what is most important here.
Worth noting, though, that even if you bottle it up, if it really is important it will come back out later!
Yes! I really think people who talk bad things about a group of people so much are probably a part of it, but they are denying themselves. For exemple, as a lesbian, I always have said ""lesbians"" who treat bisexual women badly and call them names 24/7 are probably bi and have internalized biphobia. I saw many ""lesbians"" like these that ended up coming out as bi with a boyfriend, what they ""feared the most"".

I wonder if that was also my case, but about transitioning
I guess flirted with some aspects of radfem thinking because of my projection and anger I felt at the time I came out as ""cis"" and also trying to distanciaste myself from the trans community due to that. Also maybe to get validation from my mom and the rest of the society. I remember my mom saying very clearly that she's ""glad that her daughter is a lesbian and not some trans man"". That was like a fuel to me for suppress my desire for transition and just act ""normal like every other women""

I'm glad I'm not alone. Now I see how lots of people of this ideology can be hurtful. My girlfriend really likes to say unpleasant things about transness. It doesn't feel good being surrounded by people who spend all of their time being a bigot, calling trans people this and enbies that. Even me, who aren't even sure about being non binary, is getting tired of that negativity.
No problem! I actually feel okay with any pronouns (and my name is Noah too!!)

Yes, I'm thinking about the possibility of breaking up, not gonna lie, but I always think a lot before making a decision. I'll probably make an appointment with my therapist only to talk about this situation. She's a good person in many things, but when it comes about dysphoria and all... I think there is really a possibility of me going back to transition because the idea of having a flat chest makes me euphoric and I don't think suppressing that feeling will make me feel better and stop my dysphoria. I don't want to be with someone that I'm afraid of being judged for exploring myself. 

But, at the same time, I'm afraid of what she and her friends are going to think of me? I don't know if she is going to see me in a different way and treat me like a joke just like she does with other trans people. Yes, I also was like this, but I don't want to anymore, I won't project myself in this community and talk negative things about them. That's not cool at all. And I don't want to be criticized for changing.
Thank you for your kind words! I'm going to look forward reading Leslie's work, because I'm both lesbian (I still identify as one after all, I don't see myself as a straight trans man) and gender non conforming. 

I'm really afraid of talking about this situation with my girlfriend. I'm almost sure she will ask me (again) not to go to a trans specialist because they will ""force transition down my throat"" or will say (again) that I'm like this ""maybe because I don't think I can be a woman because I'm butch"". I'm afraid that if I break up with her, but stay as friends, she will view me as ""one more butch woman who felt down the 'liberal trans ideology'"", maybe say that I'm ""not really trans"" because I choose the label non binary to describe my experience. I don't want pity from anyone nor feel judged. I just want to live my life like everyone else, in a body that I feel most represented, like how I see myself in my own mind.

Even before questioning gender critical thinking, I tried explaining to her why people with dysphoria choose to transition and I think is a valid way (precisely because I LITERALLY went through that) but she really did disagree and all. I always tried to give her a perspective of a dysphoric person, but she still have the same exact beliefs. 

I guess I still have to unpack more of my past trauma (fear of not being accepted, being excluded and judged) because I'm THAT afraid of what a person who I'm dating for only 4 MONTHS and her friends, who I never saw in my entire life, are going to think of me.
Well, she's not making fun of me, particularly. But if I say ""hey I'm feeling dysphoric, I'm thinking about buying binder tapes and maybe going to a trans specialist who can help me"" or ""I'm thinking about top surgery, I think I'll feel happy"" she will probably say again ""but that's wrong, that's mutilating your body"" ""oh it's all internalized misogyny"" ""don't go to a trans clinic, they will push transition down your throat"" ""maybe you think you can't be a woman because you're butch"" and more things like that. These words are not welcoming at all, and knowing it won't make my dysphoria disappear. Making me feel bad about it and suppressing these emotions won't help, definitely. She NEVER had experience with being trans as I did and she will NEVER know how it feels like.
That's what I'm afraid. What would stop her from saying ""oh [my name] went back being those queers"" or ""she thinks she's that non binary nonsense"" ""oh poor one, she was brainwashed by those liberal trans queers"" about me, just like she says about other people. I'll admit I was just like this, but I don't want anymore. I'm an adult, I've been in contact with both ""sides"" of the story, I can make decisions on my own.

There were this person who was formerly a radfem in my country, they really used to shame trans people and bisexual women, but know they are openly trans non binary. When my girlfriend told me this story, I said ""well maybe they're more happy that way, don't blame them"", but my girlfriend didn't have the same thought as me. I got where did she came from ""how did someone, who was very 'political', changed so much? Didn't they learn anything?"" but I knew that people naturally change their beliefs and the most important thing is that they're more happy right now. I thought that, even while falling down the radfem pipeline. I'm afraid my girlfriend just shame me just like in this situation.
You do not need to tell your mom why you broke up with your girlfriend. You can say something generic like “we have different values and I found myself struggling to relate to her” and if your mom presses you can say “I don’t feel like talking about this, it was a really painful thing because of how well we did get along”.
Maybe you don’t need to think of it as breaking up with her because if your identity. Maybe it can be breaking up with her because she’s intolerant, lacks empathy, and seems to spend her time conjuring up problems to have with marginalized communities. It wouldn’t be unusual for a white person to dump their white partner for being racist. The same can apply here. You don’t have to wait until you feel sure about your identity to cut an intolerant person out of your life. And the truth is, you’ll probably find it easier to understand yourself once you don’t have her in your ear anymore
>She is wonderful in many things!

Is she? Or do you just overlook things because you love her, or you think its normal, or you force yourself to change your feelings to align with that belief? One of the patterns I notice with intimate couples is that one person will come and tell a horrific story about their partner not at all being a good person and yet they'll still consistently say that their partner is wonderful and supportive and so awesome. Then the more people point things out, the more realization the poster has that maybe things aren't as great as they had convinced themself. Of course, not every person is 100% awful at all times, but there is often a long-term thread of disrespect, insensitivity, lack of support and so forth. People will do a lot of mental gymnastics to not have to deal with the truth about someone they love.

>I'm afraid if I discover myself as trans non binary and be sure 100% I want to continue my transition, will she make fun of me? Will she say bad things just like she says about other trans people? Will she sees myself in a different way?

Yes, friend, she will. She has already showed you that. I really recommend you find a good trans-informed therapist to help you through this. and to help you better understand the ways you are ignoring keeping yourself safe. You're allowing your girlfriend to mistreat you because of the internalized transphobia you're feeling. It can be helpful in some way, because that outside source of disagree means you make more space inside yourself to come to terms with your truth. However, outsourcing that hate may not serve you anymore once you do start to claim being transgender. I think, in part, you're worried about not only how your GF will treat you but how you will treat you, how your parents will treat you, how your other friends will treat you. If you start building an inclusive support system now, it will help you so much with trying to make better decisions for yourself. I think it'll help you feel less like you'll lose everything because you'll already have people holding you up.
As for what to tell your mother, I wouldn’t tell her about your gender questioning until you are comfortable to do so (although frankly I have to say I hope you’re prepared for the possibility your hopefully-future-ex might use that against you to try to earn points in the realm of public opinion, although I DO hope she is a better person than that).

I would simply tell her that you found there were beginning to be topics that you didn’t feel safe talking to her about. That whenever those topics came up, your partner would say really dismissive, hurtful, and cruel things, despite you expressing that you didn’t like the way she talked about those topics. 

The ability to communicate openly with your partner is SO important to the health of a relationship. If you said that you didn’t feel “safe” talking about ANY topic with your partner, that would be a massive red flag for me, and it would be time to seriously reevaluate your relationship. Since this particular topic is so tied into who you are, and since her viewpoint is so steeped in bigotry, I’m inclined to say you’re just better off without her. But at the VERY least, maybe you can look into couples’ therapy (obviously with a well-reviewed LGBTQ+ positive therapist), and I hope you are also looking into some individual therapy to help you sort out your feelings around this and give you some guidance in establishing healthy boundaries so that you have the safety you need to explore your own gender identity.

Whatever you choose to do, I wish you well, my friend. Getting to know yourself is a lifelong endeavor. We never stop growing and we will never FULLY know ourselves, and that goes for gender too imo. I hope you find the support you need, whether from her or somewhere else, to find joy in the very act of working to know yourself better through discovering your gender. Maybe you are trans. Maybe you’re cis and you just want a different body. Maybe you’re some flavor of non-binary. Maybe your understanding of who you are will change over time. Whatever you are, you’re valid. And not knowing is valid too. It’s okay to be a work in progress. We all are. :)
I'm curious about your previous trans experience. When you where younger, were you trans masc/man instead of trans nonbinary? It could make sense if you were leaning male but then pulled back because it didn't feel right. 
I always knew I wasn't a girl, but being a boy only felt a tad better. I'm so happy to have gone down my journey to understanding and accepting being trans nonbinary. I don't do hormones but I have had a few surgeries and I love my body now. 
It's ok to considering changing parts of yourself that make you dysphoric. Even if you never change any of your ""labels"", it's ok to pursue what will make your body feel more like a ""home"" you want to live in. Please try to break up with this toxic person and find a gender therapist.
(funny we're name buddies now ^^)

i see... i think you are doing it right. taking time to think and sharing your thoughts with other people and your therapist. that's really good 👍🏻

i'm sorry that you're afraid of their reaction... but i guess when you're not hanging out with them it won't bother you that much anymore... i think if you're having other people you can count on, you will be okay :)

i'm happy for you that you changed and feel better about it now ^^ it really feels like you're going to be fine ☺️
probably she will.
I'm not being arrogant or wishing u bad things.

I'm someone who passed through a similar situation, but, he didn't saw me in my transition (my ex, that I did want to marry and blablabla).
When I told him, the first time, I was bissexual (years after, understood me as pansexual), he thought it cool. But when we broke up the first time and after a long, we came back and he knew, cuz I told him, I dated 2 girls, he got out of his mind. He used to say that I was confused and felt really bad about me having an affair with 2 girls while we were away from each other.
when we came back, he used to be openly bifobic to me and transphobic to others. 
I know that one of his cousins is trans. And he always have been the type of guy who thinks this is a bullshit created to put ""great and sweet"" people in a confused path.

I told a little about me just to say u: people who are openly lgtbqphobic, specially transphobic, they will not accept u as who u are. and depending on how they were raised, it gets worse.
u can try, talk and see what happens. but, we are not talking about ""she likes potato's and I like strawberry"". we are talking about ur self being and yes, she can shame u. in front of many people. or use u as a token to show how benevolent and lovable she is.
my ex always embarrassed me towards my sexual orientation. and used to use me as token for a fat poor lgbtqia person he was envolved.

don't be afraid to go.
if u want to talk to her and see how she treats u... it's upon u. 

hope she don't do anything bad to u or disrespectful.

if u wanna talk, my dm is open!
Seriously, I rarely tell my parents all the details of my breakups.
When I was younger I came out as a trans man to my friends and family, but after some years I started to question if I was non binary transmasc (agender, to be more specific). In any case, all this time I transitioned socially, I legally changed my name and all (and I'm glad I did it because I absolutely hate my dead name). But I wanted specially to undergo top surgery. I was really planning on that, it was my dream of life, I even emailed a doctor from my city asking for information). But when I found out I exclusively like women (after thinking I was bi for a long time), I came out as a lesbian. At first, I did still stick with the label non binary. For me it wouldn't make sense to call myself a straight trans male, since I resonate a lot with being a lesbian. My mother was so happy, she said out loud that she was glad I ""wasn't trans anymore"" and ""I'm so happy you love your body now"". What I think happened to me was: I tried to suppress my desire for transition and my different perception of gender so I can be more accepted and just be ""normal"" like everyone else. It kinda worked, but now I'm feeling dysphoric again and having trouble with how I perceive me. All this time I didn't stop wishing I was like the transmasc folks who have done the surgery nor stopped seeing myself in characters while have more masculine physical features. Right now I see myself as idk nothing? I do would like to be like a more tall, full flat chested with a deeper voice, but at the same time I see nothing about myself.
I'm so sorry your family and partner have been so negative. I'm no contact with my family and it's the happiest I have ever been. I know that no contact isn't the best route for everyone, but I realized that the relationships with my family were unbalanced in what I got out of it compared to what they expected me to to put into it. Nobody should feel required to be in a relationship that causes harm.... sorry for the tangent! haha  
What I came here to say is actually this: I am so very proud of you. I don't know if you realize this but you have taken some pretty big steps recently to look at what you need for yourself and what you need from a partner. Whatever you decide to do, even if it's nothing, please know that someone out there has a lot of respect for how you're addressing some really challenging issues in life. I hope that doesn't come off as condescending, I'm just speaking from experience and my experience is that where you are right now isn't easy, but here you are looking for advice and support. I support you."	121w0mq	NonBinary	346	0.99	2023-03-25 19:15:08

My friend got mad and blatantly misgendered me	I feel bad, and I know I shouldn’t, but my friend, olivia, and I got into a fight and they purposefully and disrespectfully misgendered me. I tried to forget about it but it was not something I could shake. I have worked so hard to move away from that and seeing someone I trust like that say something like solely to insult me felt terrible. It is okay to quit being friends with this person over that?	"Yes. Being mad doesn't give someone a pass to be transphobic.
Yes it is completely okay to cut ties over that. It is completely reasonable to be upset and offended by someone showing that they clearly do not respect you.
That's a person literally using what they know about your vulnerabilities as a weapon to hurt you.
Absolutely. There is no excuse for misgendering someone on purpose in order to hurt them. That's straight up transphobia.
""Just because you're upset or irritated with me doesn't give you the right to so blatantly and *intentionally* disrespect me like that. That's not ok in the least.""

Tell them that at least and if they give a real apology and make amends, intending to never do it again, then keep them. If they double down, move on.
Yup. A true friend /ally will still use your pronouns when they’re angry at you.
It is never acceptable to purposely misgender someone, even it you are mad at them or don't like them.  Even if someone does something immoral or wrong, that doesn't justify disrespecting them as a person.  Example, we don't intentionally misgender trans people who are in prison, even if they did something wrong, they still deserve to be respected as a human being.

It is absolutely understandable to be upset about that and not want to be friends with someone who only respects your identity conditionally.
You do not misgender someone to punish a person. There is such a thing as too low, and that is it.
Accidentally misgendering someone is one thing but doing it purposefully as an insult is something entirely different. I'd put it on the level of using a racial slur.

Sometimes people do stuff out of character when they're angry but I'd probably say that's going too far.
Yep. Because what it comes down to is trust. You cannot trust them to be kind, and you cannot trust that they *actually* accept you. People who weaponize your vulnerabilities for their advantage are toxic people.
i'll go a little against the grain and say that the correct choice here is whatever is right for your comfort, and nobody can tell you that but yourself. if this instance is enough that you never want to interact with this person again, that's completely your right
i had this happen to me, my ex-friend was mad at me and kept using my deadname, even saying “it’s your name isn’t it”. cut em off, they are disrupting your happiness and who you truly are. put yourself first.
Yeah because they view your identity as something that they can use to hurt you and are willing to hurt you if you upset them
YES! It is a-okay to end a friendship over something like this.  No matter how much someone dislikes you or has a disagreement, it is not okay to misgender you or use your deadname.  There are people I absolutely loathe and I use their preferred name and pronouns because you don't have to like someone to give them basic respect.  This ""friend"" showed that they only respect you when y'all get along.
I'd cut ties over that. It's one thing to accidentally misgender someone when you're getting used to someones pronouns, but to intentionally do it to a ""friend"" just to hurt them, nah. They'd get the yeet if that happened to me.
That’s a shit and transphobic thing to do, gendering someone correctly should NOT be conditional. Without a sincere apology and change in behavior, I personally would not be willing to continue to be friends with someone who did that.
Imo it’s one of those things that shows that they either 

A) don’t respect your identity and the mask fell off

B) were trying to hurt you and went for the thing they knew would be painful, which is horribly mean

If they are a close friend, it’s worth discussing with them if you’d be comfortable with that, but remember that your comfort matters. You are allowed to ask why they did that, and not to be satisfied with generic things like “I wasn’t thinking” or “it just slipped out”. And if they apologise, you are allowed to take some time before forgiving them/not forgive them at all
I'm so sorry this happened and that they betrayed your trust and hurt you. It's perfectly okay to end the friendship
That person isn't your friend. Correct pronouns are neither conditional or to be earned. They are a basic human right. That person is fucked
Completely okay to cut ties. Weaponising your gender, knowing how difficult it is to accept and be non-binary, is very low.
Thats not your friend.
Yup! Snip snip that bitch!
Yes it is. They don't get to be transphobic just because theyre upset. That bias doesnt come and go based on a mood. If they attack you with it when they're angry, theyre still thinking it when they're not mad. Screw that.
My sister did that to me when she got mad but she called me by my dead name
ABSOLUTELY. Olivia cannot call themselves your friend and disrespect you at the same time. Every time Olivia becomes upset with you, are they going to misgender you? You deserve better than that. It is possible to be upset with someone and still respect their humanity. That’s, like, bare minimum.
I don’t tolerate misgendering people ever. Even if that person did the most terrible thing imaginable (doesn’t apply to you, but just in general). Like, I’ve had fellow enbies tell me they misgender people who did terrible things to them, which is totally understandable, but also, our gender/ lack thereof is NOT retractable. Purposefully misgendering someone for ANY reason just shows that you are still perpetuating cis norms and the myth of the gender binary. It really makes me mad. So yeah, cutting ties is justified I think
I had the same thing happen to me to the point where they referrred to me as ""whatever"" which may not seem big but we'd had multiple conversations about the respect they had for me, so to see it go out of the window over a small spat just showed me that they had negative feelings over it that they never expressed and were now showing how they really felt.. that's how I took it, anyway they're blocked now
When I came out to my soul sister of about 20 years, she said she didn't believe me and she wasn't going to be using my pronouns. I said, ""okay then I don't need to have you in my life. "" unfriended her on everything, and that was that. 

You deserve respect, and if it's not given, then they don't deserve your friendship 💖
[removed]
Who you are isn’t conditional. If you started calling this person by the opposite gender just because you’re mad at them, it wouldn’t make any sense. So being mad isn’t an excuse to misgender someone. And if this friend thinks it is, then there is no issue with breaking up the friendship. They are being transphobic, and think it’s okay because they’re upset. That is not okay. You can try to educate them, but if they don’t want to learn and grow from these mistakes, drop them. It’s not worth the pain, and there are plenty of other people out there who will respect you no matter what. You won’t be destroyed without this person in your life. Do what you feel is best for you and this friendship, but don’t feel bad if you decide to drop them as a friend. It is reasonable to be upset with them for misgendering you, and if they think it’s still okay after a chat with them, then they will probably do it again and aren’t a true ally or supporter of you.
Question here no disrespect but is there a difference among friends or others in an argument (not sure what the fight was about) from misgendering someone or calling them an a$$ hole or other derogatory word?  Meaning you got an a fight they call you names and it's over. While I am not supporting name calling hurtful speech is hurtful speech not sure  if one is more hurtful than the other?  Ex:( I am using terms here loosely for brevity) Say a MTF gets into a argument with a cis woman cis calls MTF a man, mtf calls cis a b@tch, again is one less or more hurtful than the other? To me no just move on, but would be interesting to here others perspective

Absolutely it’s okay to quit being their friend. That’s a really low thing to do and you deserve so much better than that— fight or no fight
of course people shouldnt misgender you for any reason and its perfectly fine to cut ties what they did was wrong
This happened to me this summer and I haven’t spoken to the ex-friend since, and I don’t want to. People’s respect of your or anyone’s gender should not come from how they feel about the person in the moment.

They used your vulnerability against you, something they know hurts you. A friend should never use your “weaknesses” as a weapon. 

It’s very similar to when person A opens up about their insecurities, say, with acne, and person B uses it as a weapon to get back at them. 

My answer: if they didn’t apologise, do not take them back. If they did, you need to evaluate whether you’re truly able to forgive them because, chances are you’ll probably never trust them the way you did before.
That's nasty of your friend. There's a difference between heat of the moment anger and vindictiveness. Your intuition will fill you in OP. Fwiw I'm sorry they did that to you.
Absolutely. Identity is not earned. If someone uses that as a weapon it is really fucked up and they don’t deserve your time.
It shows your friend is a transphobic pos. They only see trans people as their trans identities when they like them. Me and one of my ex friends had a fallen out. I hate him. I wish him the absolute worse. He’s a shitty person. He’s trans ftm. Doesn’t mean I’m going to go out of my way to use she/her for him. It doesn’t matter how mad you made your friend. Nothing can excuse that.
They’re not being a kind person so yes it’s absolutely okay to cut ties with someone for being intentionally cruel to you.
Definitely. Doesn't sound like they were much of a good friend to start off with.
Olivia sucks, dump them
It is a completely valid reason to stop being friends with them, being mad doesn’t give right to misgender somebody 👍
That isn't your friend anymore! Get toxic people out of your life exactly when they show you who they really are.
People should ALWAYS respect other peoples identities, no matter the circumstances. If she’s willing to misgender you on purpose because she’s upset, she doesn’t respect your humanity or who you are.
They need to APOLOGIZE. If it's a sincere, heartfelt apology accompanied by action then that's the best chance of them being your friend again. If they do anything but, then they're not a true friend and misgendering ain't cool.
[deleted]
Ugh thank you. It’s really disappointing and i felt paranoid because i’m finally becoming comfortable with my gender & with my family/friends so I wanted to make sure I wasn’t doing too much
This is the heart of it. Do you want to be friends with someone that would purposefully strike you where they know it would hurt the most because they’re upset with you? That’s really shitty behavior.
unfortunately i asked and they pretended it never happened
Very true
That is a really great point. I decided to take a step back for a while but might be worth considering. Thanks!
calling a trans woman a man is soo much more hurtful than calling a cis woman a b*tch. it all comes down to individuals feelings in the end, but petty insults are MUCH different than blatantly disrespecting and actively injuring someone based on their gender identity in that way. they are not the same, at all. petty insults are way different than transphobia, and i don’t even know how to describe how terrible it would feel if someone called me (a transfemme) a man. talk to almost any trans person and they will say the same thing.
“Your friend is using something you’re most vulnerable about just to hurt you? (Btw this is an abuse tactic if you didn’t know) Well *youre* the childish one for not staying friends with someone like that” do you know how stupid you sound?

> we need lgbtq in the 50s but now we need to remove it and all it’s labels 

Jesus Christ are you seriously this idiotic? That’s like saying “we need adjectives in the old days but now we need to remove them and all the descriptive words” like what? Also you are aware anti-lgbtq is STILL and deadly thing? Are we gong to ignore the over sexualization of wlw relationships? Are we going to ignore the lgbtq+ youth being beaten, abused, and kicked out at home for being lgbtq+? Are we going to ignore the fact that lgbtq+ people are still raped and SA’d as a form of “conversion”? What about the murders? Homophobia and transphobia isn’t a thing of the past. Stop acting like it is and stop trying to guilt lgbtq+ people into being tolerate of intolerant people you ignorant pos

Edit: Also your blatant transphobia towards the end proves my point about us still needing the movement
there’s not really a term for being “non-binary phobic”. so we fit into the larger trans category and this is considered transphobia
being trans just means not identifying with your AGAB, nonbinary falls under the trans umbrella, whether you've medically and socially transitioned or not
Yeah that’s true they tried to say oh it was about someone else but I guess deep down now I know their true feelings so you’re right. blocked!
Time to leave and look for some new friends🚪🏃💨🧍‍♀️
Wow that's even worse. Yeet!
yeah that comment made me real mad too then i was just super confused upon checking out their profile and discovering they're a 16 year old enby who uses he/they pronouns. their comment here seemed kinda out of place among their other comments & posts so i'm wondering if maybe they were hacked or something?? idk. odd :/
Enby is still under the trans umbrella tho so it’s still transphobia. If you’ve **trans**itioned away from your assigned-**gender**-at-birth  then you’re **transgender**
Exorsexism is the word
I Have Heard The Term ""Enbyphobic"" Thrown Around, But It's Definitely A Neologism, Not Really Used In Scholarly Circles.
There is the word ""enbyphobic"".  


But it is a subcategory of transphobia.
Objection, Your Honour, I Identify With My AGAB, But Am Still Trans, Because It's Not The Only Gender I Identify With.
Not sure about the context that would make it possible to be about someone else. It may or not be their true feelings about your gender though. When people lash out they choose words that are intended to be hurtful, and she knew that would be hurtful to you regardless of what she did or did not think. 

&#x200B;

This is still very fucked up and not ok in the slightest, and a real friend should not exploit sensitive personal information to intentionally hurt someone. I'm just saying that while things said in anger can reveal true feelings, sometimes they don't, because people are generally a hot mess. At this point it's up to you if you even *want* to try to repair this friendship. If you don't, then it's valid to cut ties and be done. If you do want to try to get past this, then you need to sit down and make it *very, very* clear that this hurt you, and how it hurt you. She needs to make amends, and you might need time to forgive. 

&#x200B;

I'm sorry this happened to you, and it sucks.
I’m hoping that was the case
Who cares if it's academic? It accurately describes a pretty specific ""subgenre"" of transphobia, therefore it works.  


Transphobia and enbyphobia aren't the same, ouibinary trans people don't get eternally the erroneous repetition of ""you must choose"" for example.
… babes you are aware that the other genders you identify with…aren’t your agab….so those count as transitioning from your agab….so what they said still applies…right?
I've Never Had That Happen To Me, But Honestly If Someone Told Me I Had To Choose To Be One Gender Or The Other, I Would Just Sing The Entirety Of ""Choices"" By The Hoosiers, Too Good An Opportunity To Pass Up.
I Mean.. They Said ""being trans just means not identifying with your AGAB"". Not ""Being trans means identifying with a gender that's not your AGAB"" (Which would probably be more accurate), But Simply ""Not identifying with your AGAB"", I feel like you'd have to use some pretty weird logic to interpret that in a way in which I, Who indetifies with my AGAB, Am included.
Respectfully, I’m nonbinary, but the only gender I feel any connection to is my AGAB. Like.. I’ll still call myself a girl, I just don’t identify as strongly as I would if I was cis. I don’t feel cis or trans, I’m just like.. nothing at all but a bit of girlhood in me too. I don’t feel a connection to any gender that *isn’t* my AGAB, so I don’t call myself trans because that doesn’t fit me at all. Not every nonbinary person has to identify as trans (but yes nonbinary is still under the trans umbrella, & if someone with the same AGAB & gender as me identifies as trans that’s okay & perfectly valid. I just.. trans isn’t a word that describes me)
Ig they should’ve said “not only…” to better fit. Also, just outta curiosity, why do randomly capitalize words in your comments?
I never once said every enby has to identify as trans. I’m saying non cis gender identities are under the tans umbrella? The person I replied to with my comment said themselves that they identify as trans but identify as multiple genders including their agab as a way to disprove the initial comment (which was that enby is under the trans umbrella, which you seem to agree with so I don’t see what your point is?) and my comment was saying that that what they initially said still applies. Nobodies saying that everyone who’s non-cis *has* to identify as trans, but non cis identities are under the trans umbrella (which, again, you said you agreed with that…so again what was your point?)
Isogender? [here's a link](https://lgbt-pride.fandom.com/wiki/Isogender)
Well, Usually I Capitalise All The Words Like This, But I Try To Avoid That For Long Paragraphs As It Makes Them A Good Bit Harder To Read, About Halfway Through Writing That Last Comment I Realised It Was Getting Kinda Long So I Stopped Capitalising Words, But Also Didn't Want To Go Back And Uncapitalise All The Ones I'd Already Written.
Omg my apologies I actually misread their comment & thought they *didn’t* identify as trans & you were telling them they had to. My bad!

In that case I do agree with you, I just don’t like the notion that a lot of people have that every nonbinary person *is* trans whether they identify that way or not bc of how far I feel from that identity (it seems like you don’t have that notion, I just thought you did when I originally commented)
>themselves that they identify as trans but identify as multiple genders including their agab as a way to disprove the initial comment (which was that enby is under the trans umbrella)

You Seem To Have Misunderstood, I Agree That Non-Binary Is Under The Trans Umbrella, I Was Simply Disputing The Definition Of Trans They Gave.
Ok it just hit me in not sure links are allowed. 🫠

I.guess I'll worry about that if I'm told later.
Thank you! I’m actually fine with just unlabelled/nonbinary but I will give this a look!! :))

Edit: I just read through & that actually describes me to a T haha! I’m gonna stay unlabelled but that’s really awesome! I’m gonna look up the flag now~
Thanks! I think I fit in that category. I also found metagender which I think has a similar defenition.
Why do you capitalize all the words then?
Ohh okay
I had the same reaction, honestly.

I still typically say ""nonbinary man"", which I guess is confusing coming from an AMAB. So I typically refer to this when people need more of an explanation.
Ah, Now That Is The Right Question. If There Is A Proper Reason Though, It Has Been Unfortunately Lost To Time. Long Ago I Started Doing It For Reasons Unknown, And Simply Continued Since Then, And Something About The Strange Manner In Which My Brain Is Wired Compels Me To Continue Doing It."	zq8pes	NonBinary	335	0.99	2022-12-20 00:28:24
IM GETTING TIRED OF PEOPLE MISGENDERING ME.	that's it. that's the post. i just wanted to say it out loud without people asking questions.	"Same. Like I find it really hard to ""come out"" to people. I came out to a few, hoped they'd use they/them pronouns, and that it'd spread, oposite happened. They used they/them pronouns for a week and then went back to my agab pronouns.
I’m sorry, that must be very frustrating :(
Going by All/Any has felt really good for me. I don't mind the ""he/him"" at all.

I do mind, ""Sir, boss, Mr. Myname, bro,"" and all the little digs. I got a fun moment when we all sat down to a meeting yesterday at work. I was one of the first to sit down and it just happened that all the men sat down on my side and all the women sat on the other side. Then someone goes, ""Lol boys over here, girls over there.""

I hate how much gender validation is just dripping down the walls for cis people everywhere they go, but never us.
literally i wear three massive they/them pins, even one on my bag, and people still use she/her with me like 🥲🥲 im here with you
Be an asshole about it. If people use the wrong pronouns, loudly interrupt them. If they won't pay the most basic amount of respect to you, don't give them that respect back.
Yeah! its something that binary trans people just dont fully understand about nonbinary people is that we have no ability to be stealth in any way. We either have to deal with being misgendered or come out to everyone we meet and risk getting hate or worse. Very jealous of binary trans people who can go stealth...
Hard same. My mom still genders me to her friends, because, she ""doesn't know how to bring up the subject"". It's not as hard as she makes it seem like it is. 😒 I just started covering everything I own in the nonbinary flag when I go out to hang out with my mom and hope people ask about it. They usually do. 🤷🏻 💛🩶💜🖤
I’ve been out for two years at work and no one uses my pronouns correctly. It’s crushing.
Same. It’s even worse when you have to go to the bathroom and everyone like peeping to see which one you go to. That was me today. And then the “huge” learning curve for family *and* friends. And then I have to sit here trying to identify what clothes will be the most “confusing” for others instead of being able to dress how I want to… you’re def not alone. Makes me mad and sad all at the same time. I figure by this point I need to be louder with getting pins, shirts, something lmao. I’m in the south and sometimes I’m not sure if I should be “ok” with misgendering for survival or angry to protest their outdated views. #Tired fr
Not gonna disagree with you. I'm getting really sick of the eye roll I get every time I ask - POLITELLY - to not be called this or that. Two days ago I walked into a store wearing a fucking dress, jewelry, heels and makeup, and still the salesperson kept calling me ""mister"". When I told her I was ok with masculine pronouns, but asked not to be masculinized (is that a word?) by adjectives (portuguese don't have a neutral pronoum), she and my mom exchanged this look that told me oh so clearly how ridiculous my request sounded to both of them. I try not to make a big deal when my mom misgender me or let slip my deadname, because she really is trying, but that look pissed me off. A few minutes later I was chatting about how my wife mocks my sudden obsession for all things in the color pink when she told me ""gone are the days when men couldn't wear pink"". I just lost it. I yelled: ""DON'T CALL ME A MAN""; right there, in the middle of the store, and she turned red. I don't think I'm asking for much.
Yeah same, so fucking exhausted.
Same, I swear if that person gets the courage to come out as trans at least try to not misgender them FOR FUCKS SAKE
Literally why I’m forcing my parents to go to my therapy session next week. It’s bad enough that I’m misgendered all the time at work (when I wear a pronoun pin and my name tag has my pronouns), but my mother in particular refuses to use my pronouns, let alone the name that I’ve wanted them to call me since I was 15. Not going to be a fun session and honestly, I’m really dreading it, but it has to be done.
I've been having a hard time with this one. Problem for me though is coming out. I've been playing with the idea of wearing a pin or the less as obvious idea of sewing enby pride color buttons onto my jacket collars.
I totally agree, I HATE it when people call me he/him. People think I'm a guy because usually I don't bother to shave and prefer to have short hair and go to the men's restroom. It takes a lot of effort to shave so I just don't do it as a preference. I also choose to go to the males restrooms because of convenience (they have urinals so I can go standing up). However, it DOES NOT GIVE YOU THE RIGHT TO KEEP MISGENDERING ME!!!! I AM FAE/FAER, GET IT RIGHT, it's not hard!!!!!
Mood.
ik you didn't ask for... ideas or something and maybe just want to rant about those people (which is perfectly fine), but maybe you could wear a pin with the enby flag or a pin with ""they/them"" on it? I didn't try this yet, so idk if it will work, but maybe i will when i'm comfy with outing me more.
but yeah maybe this helps
lots of love <3
It’s one thing if it’s people who are close to you (friends, family, acquaintances, coworkers) who are aware of your pronouns and identity. They need to show you respect and care. 

As for strangers, I’d just try to brush it off the best I can. Having to stop and explain my identity and pronouns to random people in public would be more anxiety inducing than anything. 

I also live in a very rural area, and the idea of giving some conservative dick more ammunition to use to be a dick to me just doesn’t sound very fun
Whenever some old customer tries to include in their apology ""oh I'm trying to be more with these times"" I point around our shop and tell them point blank ""genderqueer people are all throughout history, read something besides fiction and trending Fox news politics""
why can’t people just get it right? i’ve been out to my mom for roughly a month now and i heard they/them for the first time last night, and that’s probably cause my sister was there using they/them for me first. not to mention the countless times she’s called me a girl or daughter, which is worse than feminine pronouns
Use the anger. Become politician or doctor or influencer and be the change you want to see.   


If people use deadname don't answer. No matter what they want to say. Never answer. Ask people to tell you why they keep misgendering you. Tell them it can't keep going and ask them what you guys can do to make them stop it. And if possible get rid off worst of transphobes. They are not going to change.
I'm AFAB and sound feminine.  I also game.  I always make note of my gender (or lack thereof) and my pronouns.  I get misgendered all the time.

So I've taken to just repeating myself over and over and eventually they catch on.  ""She did...""  ""THEY""  ""Its hers""  ""THEIRS""  ""She just..""  ""THEY"".  It is automatic at this point.

Annoying, yes.  Get my point across?  Most of the time.  Will I still do it?  Absolutely.
I completely understand, my friend said they are nonbinary but then misgender me as a woman when I'm genderfluid...
I strangely enough have empathy towards conservatives/bigots. They had the potential to be raised as an alley and be embraced by a loving community but they’ve been conditioned by society
Just stop caring what people call you
Same 😔
It's extremely annoying when it happens, I'm constantly called a man and a woman but I don't technically identify as either but the thing I always keep in mind is that we're in a new time where people don't always know who is who and sometimes those people are assholes about it and don't care but for the most part I've run into people who just misgender and don't mean to or they're just trying to get used to it all. I know I still misgender people. Just remember it's a transitioning period for our society soon you won't have worry my friend.
Ughhh yes I feel you. I swear if one more person calls me “lady,” I’m going to lose my mind
SAME! It sucks!
On discord calls I literally put (they) on my handle

People still mess it up, like idk how I can make it any easier
Same. Like, my body strongly matches my agab and it frustrates me so much because I’m more than sure that I get misgendered because of it. But my country’s society has difficulties acknowledging non-binary people, maybe I shouldn’t be surprised.
And on top of that, my own mother keeps misgendering me (I came out to her) and at this point, I have no idea if she does it on purpose or what. Plus, she’s giving me internal transphobia. Life is beautiful.
I feeeeel this. Coming out at work, everyone basically seemed so supportive initially, but then just continued using my agab pronouns until I really reiterated multiple times over MONTHS that it was actually, y'know, important to respect the pronouns I asked to be called. It was such a mindfuck.
I feel ya
im so sorry that sounds terrible. why is it so tough for people to j respect others!?!?!?
IT IS. i go into a whole panicking questioning mode and i hate it sometimes i wanna yell it out loud. THANK YOU
""I hate how much gender validation is just dripping down the walls for cis people everywhere they go, but never us.""

Yeah, cis people really take it for granted. It's funny  when you intentionally misgender a cis person after they misgender you, and they get so offended. Like yeah, that's what it feels like everyday for some people.
I hate being gendered as a ""he"", but for sure when someone drops a ""sir"" at me i flip out.  You just don't do that to someone who looks like me (see my post pics for reference).  It's willing ignorant at that point.  I don't care of being shitty to customers who do this to me gives LGBTQ a bad look or whatever.  Were the ones dealing with hate crimes and honestly I have not felt like I owe the straight world shit ever since I found myself as a teen and could not come out ""safely"" until later
I started using this tactic at home whenever my wife or my mom let slip my deadname. I just yell ""WHO?????"". During an ""intimate"" moment my wife used my deadname. I stopped and very seriously asked ""Who the fuck is (deadname)???"" She thought it was funny. I did not.

At new years eve I sent a picture of myself to the family's chat group and wished to everyone to be able to live their truths in 2023. My mom told me I was ""asking for a fight"" and that sending the pic was too much. I was already out to everyone who mattered to me among relatives, so I felt that her reaction was ""too much"".
im so sorry that is so stupid tf. i hope things get better asap. 💘
Depending on the day, but ESPECIALLY when I look the way I do in all the pics I've uploaded here (which is like 99.9999999999% of the time, I rarely just go out presenting as my agab) I will actually save my money for the time being and just toss my would-have-been purchases back behind the sales counter and leave.  I'll go so far as to dispute debit charges and tell my bank the situation.  Then and only then have I ever noticed store employees or bartenders or whoever change how they act towards me.  I live in a somewhat conservative town where way too many people take Catholicism seriously and I realized one day if I'm not bitchy then people will not outwardly respect me.  I already am well aware that queerphobia and transphobia are rampant so I don't care what people think inwardly.  

If I appear in a business or restaurant wearing skirts, heels, makeup and otherwise outwardly feminine and someone calls me ""he"" or ""sir"" I'll do everything I can to make someone's day hell and then not tip.  Then never come back and make sure to actively seek out queer friendly places that offer the same services.

I know I will get downvoted by so many, but it's clear on the day to day basis that we're surrounded by a majority that do not respect who we are as humans.  At some point the levee breaks and I have to be a cunt just to not get some obnoxious neckbeard dork being actively bigoted and then going ""oh sorry I'm 'old school' "" or some other similarly lame excuse
not related to the event, the salesperson was an asshole to you and you did not overreact. 
But going back to Portuguese pronouns if you've never heard of it you could look up the elu system. For what I know it's not that common or functional, since there's no actual rule behind it, but it's something.
Coming out is legit scary sometimes. I love the idea of pins and buttons though! You deserve to be seen whatever you decide. <3
I wear one frequently and nobody even looks at it.
Yay, this is brilliant and what I encourage my child to do, and what I do if I hear people misgendering them. Fuck anyone who gets grumpy! Being corrected isn't half as bad as being misgendered.
Yeah, everyone has been conditioned by society though. It takes an effort to undo that conditioning and some people are unwilling to do so.
This is a lovely sentiment and I appreciate it, but here is the place to validate our friend who's been getting misgendered. (meant with so much love)

edit: haha just read the comments below, fair :)
Thanks I’m cured /s
exactly! ive heard people say things like ""all pronouns work anyway, ""they/them"" are j your preferred pronouns. how do i tell them that it actively reminds me that i am not me until this body doesn't look different.
Eh, since most people never started, I never really tasted the forbidden fruit.
PRECISELY. my sister (cis woman) recently got misgendered as a man because of the way she looks and she was so upset and frustrated the entire week. IMAGINE EVERYONE DOING THAT TO YOU ALL THE TIME.
AS YOU SHOULD.
Its chill if you don't care about your own pronouns but for others, its a big deal and it can feel like shit when people use the incorrect pronouns. Please respect that others may feel differently to you.
One day you can say the same when your mom sends a pic related to her being in a nursing home or having a health problem.  ""No one needs to see that shit, you're asking for too much"" *delete*
Oh god. I'm so sorry. 😔 I don't like to be too unkind and sorry for this if it's too harsh, but.... f*** that creul b**** and her selfish a$$hole attitude, it's her own f***in' problem she can't handle seeing you shine. 🤬🥰
I'm so sorry friend. That is the loveliest wish for others and yourself, and I'm so sad to hear your mum was hurtful. I agree that her reaction was too much, bc the only right response to that is positive. I can't be 100% sure, but I have a feeling that photo was excellent and you're looking damn fine. May you find better chosen family than that.
Yeah, I know elu, but it's a neologism and sounds kinda weird. So I usually stick to he/him but ask people to avoid calling me sir, mister, guy, man, etc. With adjectives, I use the sufix ""e"" and ""ie"" whenever possible, but don't mind when people just use the masculine ""o"". Mostly because of my mom, who is a portuguese teacher with a master in linguistics. So I won't argue with her when she tells me that, in portuguese, the masculine IS the neutral. But mostly because It really doesn't bother me. More recently I've been trying she/her to see how it feels before commit to anything, but I think the most confortable to me currently is ""ile/dile"", although I have to confess that I constantly fall back to he/him out of habit.
uff that's rough... maybe then start woth friends and family and tell them hey, this should help remember... or maybe you already did that too...

do you have any queer friends? or is there a queer meeting in your area? they should respect pronouns more. that at least could be a nice change
Yeah ur right. I was high when I wrote that lmao
Thank you all for the kind words, but that is just half the story, and she has been quite supportive. The thing is that she grew up as the black sheep, the screw up, the dumb one in my relatives eyes. She became a widow in her early 40s, raised three kids all by herself, was the first among her siblings to get a master degree and after my dad passed, she went back to college and majored on a different field, just because she could. But still her brothers and sisters make her feel like she is a stupid single mom who cannot do anything right since she doesn't have a man by her side to take care of her.

So, while her comments DID hurt me, and I identified myself with OP's struggle, I probably made it look worse than it is. The very next day I took a long walk with her and explained that whenever I put on a dress, or heels, or wear some makeup, I'm doing it so I can see in the mirror the person that I feel hiding inside of me, and that doing so is not an attempt to ask for attention or to tease anyone, in the same way that when she gets up in the morning and do the same things, there's no ulterior motive behind it all. Things got a lot better since this talk. She stopped giving me the stink eye when I go out in feminine garment, started buying me makeup more appropriate to my skin color and even started asking me to try some of her clothes before she gives them away, in the off chance I find something that fits me and my style (we both lost a lotta weigh recently and have been renewing our wardrobes).

So yeah, she is really supportive and have been a rock for me during some really bad stuff that happened to me recently. But she still struggle with my neutral name and pronoums, and sometimes her demeanor of it (like It's not really a real issue and I shouldn't be so hard on her when she uses my dead name or misgenders me) can still hurt a lot.

Fun story: two days ago she went to my auntie's birthday party. My auntie's  son in law is a cop, a mysoginist and a Bolsonaro supporter. At some point he started rambling about how difficult it is nowadays for a parent to raise their children, cause at any moment they might ""decide"" they are fags or that they should exchange genders. 

My mom got at home fuming and told me and my wife that she would never confront him about cause it happened in her sister's house and she would never disrespect her in any way, but she immediately stormed off and made everybody realize she was leaving because of him.

Baby steps, I guess... 😊
Thanks yeah I’ve been out for more than a year my friend and one of my siblings respects my pronouns but most other people don’t or forget frequently even if they mean well. My voice pitch throws them off a lot as does my body shape ugh. There really aren’t any queer gatherings in my area that I’ve got access to aside from the annual pride event, our lgbtq+ community here exists but I don’t have access to it or energy to pursue the types of activities it entail’s especially now that drag queens aren’t allowed in public anymore so pretty much night clubs are the option and I don’t do stuff like that because it’s exhausting and I can’t afford admission.

It’s not the end of the world it’s just incessant annoyance.
Fair enough lol
im so proud of you <33

This is, perhaps, the most non-binary thing I can wear, and my parents STILL misgender me.		"I’m so sorry you experience that! Maybe try explaining the significance of them misgendering you to them? To be more positive, I love your shirt!
Being nonbinary, anything you wear is the most non-binary thing you can wear! 

Jokes aside I hope they get it some day. You do you fam.
Sorry about the parentals, friend. Hopefully in time they understand, better. 🖤💜💛
I hope your parents start gendering you correctly (they/them) soon! All the best to you.

Love it!!! Hope your parents step it up 🥰 I’m encouraging my mom by sending her links to things like Wikipedia entries, so she can self-educate :-) Good luck!
Because your parents don’t know or give a shit about flags, friend. Sorry they’re doing that. Maybe be more direct and correct them every time it happens?
That shirt is awesome I want it
I appreciate this comment

It feels like somebody... IS MISGENDERING ME!		"this is exactly why I don't get pronouns. I'm not hearing people refer to me in third person often cause that's kind of- *the point*. Call me whatever the fuck you like (but yeah any/all pronouns give me happi), and I'll call you whatever the fuck you like.
I use she/they pronouns, but if someone were to call me he, I'd freak out ngl. Also sometimes I'm bothered when people call me a woman, I mean I am a woman, but I'm not only a woman. Which is why I'm weirdly ok with it sometimes and not others. Polygender Problems.
i’m confused by this because I hear people use pronouns to refer to me all the time. Like any time I’m around more than one person pronouns end up coming up because inevitably one of the other people will say something to the other about me. 
Also, I’m not cool with people misgendering me when I’m not around either.
There's also ""sir"" and ""ma'am"" which are used to the person being described. My girlfriend uses ""sam"" to refer to me instead because it's a combination of the 2 and it's funny.
For some folks, gender is a more rigid thing and they want to be identified correctly, for others, they don't really think about it and don't care how they're identified or referred to. Both are fine, and you can make it clear when you tell someone your pronouns.
huh. Honestly I might just not be around *people* a whole lot.
totally. I just wanted to explain to the commenter why people care about pronouns. Because most of us do get misgendered to our faces regularly. The sentiment “i don’t use your pronouns in front of you so why do you care about them” is something I’ve encountered a lot and it’s just…not actually how pronouns end up working out in the world lmao. I would encourage anyone who doesn’t understand to just take a day and count how many times someone uses a gendered pronoun to describe you right in front of you, it will be a lot more than you think.
fair enough. js that many of us, myself included, are misgendered in front of our faces multiple times a day. I don’t know that I’ve ever gone a day without being misgendered unless I didn’t leave my house."	pjrzg4	NonBinary	296	1.0	2021-09-07 17:43:13
This is my partner. He is super supportive, advocates for me and even corrects people when they misgender me knowing I’m too uncomfortable to correct them myself. He thinks my boy looks are cute and doesn’t pressure me to dress in any way that isn’t comfortable for me. Big ups to this babe❤️		"Supportive partners ftw!
Cute! So happy for the two of you 💕

they/themming everyone	"How did we go from ""you should use they/them if you don't know someone's actual pronouns to avoid misgendering people you don't know"" to

""Just call everyone they/them all the time no matter what even if you know they use he/him or she/her.""

No. Use people's actual pronouns.

You'd think it'd be mostly cis people doing this, and it probably is, but in my experience it's mostly other Nonbinary people and that's *baffling* to me. 

I just don't understand why you'd do this. You're degendering people out of what? Laziness? And it doesn't exactly feel like you see me as a Nonbinary person when you also call my cis male he/him partner they/them.

Edit: this sub sometimes. ""uh actually we *should* misgender people"" read the room babes.

Edit 2: if you think this isn't misgendering you are wrong, period. Do fucking better. If you try to defend doing this and it's not ""sorry sometimes I forget"" I'm just blocking you. You need to work on this and I'm not in the mood to debate transphobes today."	"I use they/them until I know another person's pronouns so I use it for literally any new person or person online until I know better. Honestly it's a way of challenging the assumption about which pronouns to use for me. So I use it a lot but tbh I don't think I'm in the wrong for doing so.
i have multiple friends that use she/they pronouns, and i’ve noticed that my AFAB friends mostly just get called she and my AMAB friends only get called they… people think it’s subtle but it’s not, and it’s infuriating
gotta be honest, my mother tongue doesnt have pronouns or in the most part any gendered grammar (doesn't stop us from having a rather transphobic culture ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯) so it kinda just feels better on my brain to keep everything neutral in English
Using they/them if you know someone uses a different set of pronouns really is just purposefully misgendering
Sometimes I forget people’s pronouns so I default to they/them
i feel like ive been going insane bc i rarely see people talk abt this!!! im a binary trans guy and was (read *was*) good friends with this person who was genderfluid and used all pronouns and then straight up refused to use anything but they/them pronouns for anyone but himself????? even after i talked to her abt it, and our coworkers abt it, and our manager, and everyone tried to tell me that i was being an asshole bc i was upset that they wouldnt respect my pronouns????????? left and i didnt talk to any of them again :/ the whole place sucked
Even for people with a stated pronoun preference that doesn't include ""they"", I often use ""they"" when someone's identity (as in, which specific person I am talking about) isn't relevant to the conversation. Like ""I have a teammate who knows more about this, I'll ask them."" I generally assume people are fine with being referred to this way even when their pronoun are, say, ""he/him"". (Assuming I do it with everyone in that context, and not just trans people.) I'd be surprised to find out that's not the case.

I also occasionally use ""they"" when someone's identity is relevant but their gender isn't relevant. Like saying ""my partner's out of town, they're visiting their parents"" to an acquaintance who doesn't know my partner. Not every acquaintance needs to know my partner's gender or their pronouns. I feel more hesitant about this, but I still tend to assume that someone with, say, ""he/him"" as their preferred pronouns is probably fine with this.

Personally, I wish more people did this more often.

This isn't laziness. It's trying to avoid putting gender into conversations where it doesn't need to come up.

I like ""they"" as a pronoun for myself largely *because* it matches this kind of usage. I like it *because* it makes it so that when someone talks about me, it's consistent with how they'd talk about someone whose gender they just aren't bringing up. When I ask people to use ""they/them"" for me, I'm not asking so that people habitually call out my nonbinariness, I'm asking so that they *don't* habitually call out a thing about my gender.
kind of related, there's a tiktok trend right now of people saying what pronouns they prefer, basically it's an audio of someone saying ""him? her? them."" and people react accordingly to each pronoun. for some reason a lot of people are getting hate for not preferring they/them... some people have even gone as far as making videos complaining about people being nbphobic bc they did a thumbs down when the audio said ""them""
Tbh idk if I've experienced this, but yeah. If you know someone's pronouns, use them. Otherwise I feel it's fine to default to they/them, or tbh even to make a guess based on presentation, as long as you're willing to correct it if you're wrong. I don't think any of those things are wrong.

Personally I default to they/them as much as possible, but as soon as I know someone's actual pronouns, I use them. It's not rocket science people.
i’ve noticed this too, and it’s so weird. like i fully support “use they/them for people you don’t know” but once you know someone’s pronouns, you need to use them. whether those pronouns are he or they or xe or anything else. it’s basic respect. purposefully using they/them when you know that isn’t what someone uses is just as much misgendering as using the wrong binary pronouns for someone.
i feel like a lot of people who use any/all pronouns just end up getting they/themmed only
90% of my friends use they/them so it became so natural I do it to others sometimes.
I had a roomate in college who would do the same thing to their cis female roomate, to purposefully remove her gender bc they were jealous of everything that she was, except for the fact that she was a cis woman, but they wouldn't do it to anyone else, and me and my other roomate both used they them pronouns, but they wouldn't care and would call us binary pronouns. All 3 of us hated it, each of us were getting out genders erased bc they wanted to call us whatever they wanted. They used they them pronouns too, and would constantly complain about other people misgendering them with it too.
So most cisgender people don't care, using they/them as a default is not a bad idea. You should learn if someone has pronouns they use to use them. But even my partner who is my biggest support sucks at pronouns. She misgenders me daily but I'm used to it.
I know someone that thinks all gnc people use they/them and it’s infuriating
Honestly I just fuck up sometimes because so many of my friends are they/thems that I am just so used to using those pronouns 😂 but I completely agree, it’s important to respect pronouns
I use they/them pronouns frequently, especially when unsure, and then use the known pronouns afterwards. People who continue to use they/them pronouns after finding out what the person’s actual pronouns are, especially intentionally, are misgendering that person.
I've noticed this too, and make me angry too. Thank you for saying it!
I know having specialized pronouns are important to people, but I personally don't understand it. I do try, but if I forget a random friend's partner's gender, I don't think that's a big deal. Correct me and I'll fix it. It's possible to mess up cis people's pronouns too ya know :p And the people I know we'll who I'm expected to remember their pronouns, don't mind correcting me when I do get it wrong
?? what teenaged tumblr ass bullshit is this? I've never heard anyone say that.
I think the issue here, and I've noticed this with my partner (nonbinary) and a bit with myself (ftm) is that we do it for anyone we don't know, and we have so many nonbinary friends who use they/them, that we just fuck up and use it out of habit. We've adjusted ourselves to using it in most situations that our brains default to it even when we know someone's pronouns. 

This isn't to say there aren't people out there who do it as a form of transphobia and misgendering. But I think simple forgetfulness and habit are another explanation for many folks.
I personally have only really seen it from transphobes trying to say they’re not transphobic because they use they/them pronouns on trans people (illogical but it’s transphobes so…). The only other time I’ve seen it is with gender abolitionists who want to get rid of all gender identities and pronouns that aren’t neutral, which makes me even more uncomfortable because those people are often non-binary themselves of some sort.
It's grammatically correct to address someone as they/them until the gender is known from my understanding. Authors often use this to avoid spoiling a person's gender as they're writing as well. Also it's the general term for a multitude anyhow so you aren't ""degendering"" people any more than they already are.
I knew some cis people like that :/ They seemed to think that using singular they for everyone, but especially any trans people, was just the more ""woke"" thing to do

I also knew a non-binary person who used they all the time, especially trans men and women, yet ALWAYS managed to misgender they/them non-binary people lmao

With both these people, it was so annoying but too awkward to mention lol

It's ridiculous the moon logic people go through to simultaneously say, they pronouns are gender neutral, yet also it's not misgendering to intentionally use them for people who use male and/or female pronouns. And yeah I relate so hard to what you say about it diminishing how gender-affirming it feels for they/them to be used for you. Like, I use they specifically because it's neutrality stands in contrast to male and female pronouns
While I Certainly Agree That You Should Use They/Them Until Someone Tells You Their Pronouns Are Something Else (Or You Learn Some Other Way), I'd Also Agree That It's Atleast A Bit Disrespectful (Or Could Be Seen As Such) To Continue Doing That After Learning Someone's Pronouns Are Something Else. I Mean Ofcourse Context Is Important, There May Be Sometimes Where It Just Feels More Natural To Use They/Them Even For People Who You Know Use Different Pronouns, But If You Just Always Do It It's At The Least Kinda Weird And At The Most Upright Rude.
They/them is a genderneutral pronoun. It can be used for anyone. It doesn't imply lack of gender it just implies that the gender is unspecified (could be M, F, or other). Just like the word ""person"" is genderneutral but it can be used for men and women and the word ""partner"" is genderneutral but it can be used for your boyfriend or girlfriend.
You should never assume someone’s pronouns until you know them. I think most people do this. Idk what non-binary people you know who are “only calling people by they/them even if you know their pronouns” but I feel like it’s a small minority of most of us. Genuinely I have never encountered this in ANY queer circle I’m in. Whoever you know who’s doing this- they have a very low-level, pieced-together understanding of pronouns. And honestly, I think some people who are new to gender queerness aren’t doing this to be dicks- I think they’re doing it under the guise of worrying they’ll misgender someone accidentally- even while knowing pronouns. Remembering pronouns in a world centered on cisness is hard. The point is- people are trying and working through things every day. Realizing you’re genderqueer is far from the end of gender deconstruction. I am light years away from who I was in this community a year ago. Just remember that.
if you use they/them for a he/him or a she/her person, you're misgendering them!
Does you cis partner actually care though? Most cis people I know say they use any/all or she/they, he/they pronouns. Obviously it is different for most trans people because our pronouns are reaffirming/being misgendered causes dysphoria. Many cis people don't have the same experience.
Did we go to that?
They/Them is NOT a third gender though. Non binary refers to those who don't fit within the binary genders. That means we are all out there in gender non conformity somewhere on the beautifully varied spectrum, and some choose to use they/them but there's plenty that use a wide variety of pronouns who identify as male/female/non binary or otherwise.

Saying 'using they/them is misgendering them' is just not true cause you aren't saying their gender is non binary... you are just using a gender neutral pronoun.

They/them != Non binary gender identity exclusively
[removed]
lmao
It is still misgendering, something they don't seem to realize. They/Them is only meant for if that's their pronouns or you don't know them yet.
An unpopular opinion I see - they/them from what I could find is gender neutral as is the referal ""person"", if someone dislikes how I refer to them I will stop yeah but its easier for me to call someone a person over a man/woman/enby or use they over he/she/neopronoun etc, just cause its a pronoun and not a different type of referral word doesn't mean its not all inclusive? (and to reiterate cause it always happens they/them is the same as any other gender neutral referral word I use usage wise - its all inclusive so I should only exclude those who say so as I do, it would be weird calling everyone in a group hi friend and then call this one person Dave cause singling out is kind of bad)
[removed]
They/ Them isn’t a third gender. Its a space where we can define what gender means to use. When I they/them someone as a default I extend that space to others. 

I do use peoples correct pronouns. I don’t go out of my way to they/them everyone all the time. But I do use it when talking about anyone at some point.  If it’s something that bothers you, you should set appropriate boundaries with those that do it. People often do it out of being unsure, not out of malice.
I'm incredibly forgetful of peoples Pronouns and end up using they/them
It's going to depend on the space... I default to just referring to people by only their name unless I know, but in some spaces I just presume based on appearance because that sometimes carries less negative repercussions than trying to be inclusive in a hostile space does.
Yeah, it seems like people often also default to they/them (even if the person uses different pronouns) just out of hatred for the person.
This phenomenon is baffling. I've experienced similar, but it's been straight/cis people IME, trying to show how ""good"" they are. 

I work in non-profits, they all fancy themselves progressive yet can't comprehend that ""respecting pronouns"" means using she/her; he/him when that's the pronoun! To add fuel to fire, I will still get she/her-ed at least once a day, which just leaves me scratching my head.
I call eveyone they/them when I first meet them until they tell me otherwise, because I don’t wanna assume anyones gender, but then if they do tell me it’s she/her or he/him I’ll change it to that.
Personally, I accidentally they/them everybody because I'm so used to trying to jump between pronouns with parents vs friends vs public. And almost no one questions an offhand they/them. I've had friends correct me because we're getting older and family is less involved in our lives. They understand I mean no disrespect and I am getting better. At least it's a lot easier to use the correct pronouns of people I don't know as well.
I've always used they/them when talking about someone prior to understanding why. I think it is military for me since on e-mails names often can be similar. I just adopted it. 

Honestly,  most times I (personally) don't care. I'm non conforming. So if you call me him in person, well...I look masculine.  Online I tend to be more feminine and sometimes get referred to as she. Doesn't bother me. I consider myself both so, I don't get upset if someone picks one when I am acting or present myself in a way that slides one way more than the other. 

In the case of women and men. That's very different if they are trans. This I can see completely as disrespectful.  But as non-binary and being on this sub, a lot of post I don't identify with because, although most are in the same boat, we all vary with our wants or needs. Might do everyone some good to remember the world is learning and the fact that NB is on surveys and options is a win.
Yeah it's misgendering if you use it specificly to not use the persons preferred pronounce, 
but sometimes my brain is going so fast that they/them is just something that roles of my tongue when I'm talking about, for example my friends, but I don't think they mind, and I would hope they would tell me if they would like me to stop, then i would try my best to always use that pronounce for them
I feel like this is a charged subject and it’s easy to make assumptions about why other people do what they do. You can only control what you do and you can only ever truly know why you do what you do, not others. Something to reflect on I think, because this will inevitably just always upset you, and it’s unlikely to stop
I am not sure I have the spoons for everyone’s comments on this… Doing it wrong on purpose is still being a jerk on purpose. 

As someone who is enby with a larger than “normal”number of trans and NB friends, it can be a tough spot. I often resort to using people’s preferred names in lieu of pronouns so I don’t out someone who doesn’t want to deal with unpleasant people or so I do not out some people with varying levels of outness. It works for me because I tend to speak in an unusual, playful with words and language way already. 

Regardless, I get irritated with purposeful misgendering. 

I think that it is worth considering that there may be a lot of folks, especially older peeps, that may be trans or nonbinary themselves and have a lot more struggle in reevaluating, or adjusting their identity while navigating peers or people elder still than them who can be quite abrasive or callous. 

I also think that sometimes, we compromise for our own safety or security, or we don’t want to have our day go to shit by trying to educate strangers. So we will just give people a pass they don’t deserve.

It’s not easy sometimes, and mistakes can or will happen. I just feel it is almost always really manageable to use people’s preferred pronouns, as it is about respect and not being a jerk myself.
same. i occasionally still use they/them on someone once i know their pronouns, but only if i forget or if they get thrown into the conversation in which i am using they/them for other people i’m talking about. i never intentionally do it, but i’ve noticed my (cis) bf does it now too
Exactly this - currently, English doesn’t have separate pronouns that can convey something like “unknown” vs “neutral/non-binary” imo (though neos may someday help), so I think they/them is currently taking both of those spots for the time being. I think this is fine, so long as you then change to using someone’s actual pronouns once you know them and don’t purposefully misgender them. (Also, for a lot of people, I think the two categories overlap, in that many may assume that they know your pronouns unless they see that you have an androgynous/neutral/gender-nonconforming presentation.)
~~I Often Do It When I First Meet People, But After A While If I Still Don't Know Their Pronouns I'll Sometimes Just Rephrase Sentences To Not Use Any Pronouns For Them Because I'm Kinda Embarrassed That I Don't Know And Don't Want To Show It, Lol.~~
This too.

There's some meme that's like ""how cis people view pronouns:""

She/they: she/her

They/them: she/they

He/they: they/them

He/him: he/theyamd it's SOO accurate. Obviously flipped for amab people
I use he/she/they and I only get called she (by people who don't know mostly) and they. No one calls me he or uses masculine terms on my and it's kinda annoying. I'm afab btw. This isn't too bad at least for me but I've seen it in action.
That's so valid. I'm mostly getting annoyed at native English speakers that have no reason to do this
It is! And these people act like they're just doing what they're supposed to do. I don't get it
I Suppose In A Way It Is Purposefully Misgendering, But I Wouldn't Say It's Necessarily Malicious. Inconsiderate? Definitely, But If You're Just Using Them Because You're Too Lazy To Remember Everyone's Pronouns Or Something, And So Use It For Everybody, I Wouldn't Immediately Interpret It As Hateful Or Anything, Unlike If Someone Continued Using Wrong Binary Pronouns For A Trans Person (Or For A Cis Person, For That Matter.).

That's Not To Say I Support It, Again It Seems Really Inconsiderate, Just Try'na Play Devil's Advocate.
Just sounds like a toxic person. Gender doesn't apply to assholes, we all have them.
It’s more private and anonymous when discussing about said person to strangers or people who don’t need to know all your business. I do that too.
Problem is it's not about gender being relevant or not. A lot of binary trans women or men get called they/them just to avoid calling them their preferred pronouns while not reverting to their old pronouns because then it would be even more obvious.

So a lot of us are squirmish around that. Using they/them for someone who doesn't use these pronouns and has a history of being misgendered can be extremely harmful, and for some people it's the same as if you deadnamed or used their old pronouns behind their backs.
What...? So It's Now NBphobic Not Even To Not Be NB, But To Not Prefer They/Them Pronouns? Like Even If You're A Non-Binary Person Who Doesn't Use Those, You're NBphobic Now, Sorry, I Don't Make The Rules. Lol What Kind Of Insane Logic (Or Misinterpretation, Tbh) Would You Have To Take To Think Like That?
I’ve also noticed people who go by all pronouns usually get he/himmed if they look masc, she/her’d if they look fem. It’s transparent
oof the conflation of nb and gnc is so annoying. literally a cis person can be gnc. not every butch lesbian uses they/them lol
Yeah, mistakes are understandable
I have very clearly stated these are people degendering people when they *know* they use different pronouns.
It's still misgendering if they're not the person's pronouns. It's called degendering. Some people are not gender neutral and you can't assume they are okay being referred to as such.
they/them isn’t a gender. 

people use they to refer to people all the time, without highlighting their gender.
He's not like. Mad, but he does care. And *I* care. And it's not just him that gets misgendered. These are people who will they/them every single person in a conversation even if none of them use those pronouns
You know cis people that use any/all?
No, I just made up a problem to complain about
I never said anything you're arguing against. If someone's pronouns are not they/them and you call them they/them. You're misgendering them because *you're using the incorrect pronouns.*

This is not hard.

Not everyone is gender neutral. So you can't assume they want to be referred to with gender neutral pronouns
Gender Abolitionists leave people alone challenge. Removing gender by misgendering people is always malicious. Not everyone wants to remove gender entirely.
That's your opinion about gender but you can't force that on others. I don't agree that gender is inherently oppressive. Most people do not want to be degendered. I don't use they/them to be degendered, I use it as a third, specifically gender-neutral option
Girl nobody asked
You can always ask though! I know some people find it rude cause they feel like the odd one out if you only ask them, but you can just ask nicely like "" hi, i got everyone pronouns but it seems I missed yours, and I don't want to misgender you. Could you tell me again?"" Or intruduce yourself with your pronouns and give them the opportunity to share theirs
I'm also afab and use he/she/they, i relate so much 😭😭😭 people rarely ever use he for me, it's so frustrating :(
> Problem is it's not about gender being relevant or not.

What you're trying to say isn't about that. What I'm trying to say *is* about that.

I still don't know, and I would like you to tell me: are you saying that the examples of using ""they"" that I gave in my comment are not fine? Does your ""If you think this isn't misgendering, you are wrong, period"" apply to those?

If the first example isn't fine, then what you're saying and what I'm saying literally clash; you're proscribing away my ability to use ""they"" talk about someone in a way that doesn't call out their gender. So you can't just ""it's not about that"" what I said away: apparently it's about that *too*. Please address it concretely head-on instead of saying ""that's not what it's about"".

If the first example is fine, then there's some nuance to navigating when it is and when it isn't appropriate to use ""they"" to refer to someone with, say, ""he/him"" as a pronoun preference. More nuance than ""if you think this isn't misgendering, you are wrong, period"" would suggest.
I’ve always been really curious if people who type like you are purposefully capitalizing the first letter of every word or you have your phone set to do it automatically??
Well that's just stupid. You use a person's pronouns if you know them.
Is it misgendering to call a man a person or to call my girlfriend my partner? Does it imply that they don't have a gender or did I simply leave out information about their gender that isn't relevant to the conversation?
imagine you're a trans woman, who uses she/her pronouns, and everyone calls you they/them. how's that gonna feel? i'll tell ya -  it's gonna feel like they don't see you as a real woman. it's gonna feel invalidating and uncomfortable.

if you know someone's pronouns, use them.
If you know a trans woman's pronouns are she/her and you call her they/them, you're definitely highlighting something and it's called transphobia
Hum. I would reach out directly to those people about it and maybe let them know it makes your partner uncomfortable to be called they/them? They might genuinely not know or think he cares.
Yep! I thought these people were being sarcastic but they weren't lol
[removed]
Honestly I'd Definitely Rather Not Introduce Myself With My Own Pronouns, Lol. While I Could Of Course Ask, I Feel Like After Knowing Someone For A Good While It Is Kinda Weird To Not Know Their Pronouns, So I'm Sure You Can See How It'd Feel Kinda Embarrassing To Ask, Even If They Likely Wouldn't Care. 

Usually I Just Pay Attention To What Other People Say And Assume That If Someone Else Uses A Pronoun For Them That They Hear, And They Don't Complain, It's Probably Fine, Factoring In Other Context, Works Well Enough, Although There Are Still Times When I'm Not Sure.

~~Besides It's Not Like It Sounds Weird If I Just Say A Sentence Without Referring To Someone By Any Pronouns Lol, I Have A Tendency To Phrase Things Weirdly Anyway.~~
I Mean I Manually Capitalise Every Word, But I'm Not Sure I'd Say It's ""Intentional"", I've Just Kinda Been In A Habit Of Doing It For Several Years Lol, So It Just Feels Natural. Although That May Not Be The Case For Everyone Else You've Seen Type Like This.
I'd your girlfriend okay being called partner? Is your girlfriend okay being called they/them? Then obviously you can do whatever you want 

I'm not debating this. If a trans woman tells you her pronouns are she/her, and you go around calling her they/them to people, you are obviously being transphobic. She does not want to be referred to in gender neutral ways. Think about this for more than half a second.
Same :) I know cis people who use they as well
You're lost
Yeah that's true haha
Appreciate you responding!! I’ve never been in a position to ask and I’ve been sooooo curious for so long lol - pretty metal you do it manually!
You're Welcome!

Wow, I'm Not Sure I've Ever Been Called Metal Before... Thanks Lol! (Unless You Just Meant Mental And Made A Typo, Which I Assume Is Very Much Possible.)
Cackled out loud at that lol and then immediately started stress sweating that I called you mental by accident! This has been a super enjoyable exchange for me - I appreciate you for this!!
I catch myself doing this sometimes.  I tend to do it in a business setting when writing as well as education for headings to make it easier to stand out when reading a guide.

just got called transphobic for misgendering a cookie, like 🍪	was just absolutely flamed by someone for not using they/them for a cookie, and was called transphobic. there was no indication this legitimate digital food item did or did not use specific pronouns. (just felt like sharing, found it funny) !! This is about CRK , was just sharing a funny experience, i have acknowledged the fact a lot of people use this excuse to be actually transphobic, please stop sending me rude and hateful DMs	"i call all inanimate objects “little guys” and if that is wrong i don’t want to be right
This is why we can’t have nice things. Lemme guess - they were cis right?
Shame on you. Cookies have every right to be gendered correctly. As a Brit who knows the difference between a cookie and a biscuit. The Oreo has been a debate of confusion for as long as it’s been around. 

It is by all means a biscuit much like the custard creme or the Bourbon biscuit it’s appearance is biscuit aligning however it has been labelled a cookie. 

There in lies the question. Was this Oreo ACAC (assigned cookie at creation) when in reality it has come out to live its best life as a trans-biscuit. 

Is the Oreo a cis cookie who’s aesthetic is just biscuit? Is the Oreo a biscuit being misgendered as a cookie despite every attempt to show it’s a biscuit inside the the box and wrapping? Is the Oreo!- gender fluid between cookie and biscuit?!

Alas! 😔 We shall never know for the Oreo is just that an Oreo. A voice we shall never hear over the writing on its box.
literally who cares lmao it's a cookie. a virtual one at that people like that are why we get shit for asking people to respect actual peoples pronouns
You might specify that this is about cookie run or whatever. I thought you were talking about like a physical cookie you were gonna eat or something. Because that would be another infinitely silly level of ""please go touch grass"" for the other person.
every time i hear about the cookie run community i wanna die just a little bit more
I think you *should* use the right pronouns for the cookies but if someone flamed you over a mistake or the fact you ironically said girlboss that's a lil bit much, shouldn't go *that* far-

If you aren't sure of the pronouns you can look them up on the cookie run kingdom wiki, it has their pronouns listed there (im assuming you're playing kingdom lmao) 

but I think you need to understand there's lots of annoying transphobes in the fandom who deliberately ignore the pronouns or make fun of it so I think that's why people get defensive abt this sort of thing- it's just SO annoying that people can't do the bare minimum and use they/them, this problem *ONLY* happens with the they/them cookies and it's so obviously a transphobic pattern-
A cookie has no gender 😂
my pronouns are sweet and delicious
Either this didn't happen or it was a 12 year old
That's re-god-damn-dumb, yo. And makes me disproportionately angry.

I try and ignore people like that because their woke-ass virtue-signaling makes a joke out of actual trans awarenese/trans people. 

But I wish I was just brave enough to call them out, because making a farce out of transness is ACTUALLY TRANSPHOBIC.

(But if I did I'd probably end up under a pile of accusations.)
[deleted]
cookie run is the worst fucking fandom. people draw fanart of the cookies with the original color palette of the official art and will still get accused of whitewashing because the fans try SO HARD to be the morally superior hero.
Yikes. Some people wanna be mad over the dumbest things. I called a bug “sweet little fella” and got yelled at for it that it was CLEARLY a female bug. Idk. Idk what kind of bug it even was tf?
digital? so you couldn't even eat the cookie and snap back ""what's their gender now?"" I call for revenge! you must be allowed to eat the sweets of your 'phobia' 

But seriously, it's a cookie. last time i checked they were food not alive to perceive gender. this is why when i bite off their heads they don't feel it.
bro wtf, why do you and I have similar experiences??  
I was told I was transphobic because I jokenly called my PC a ""she"" in front of one of my friend's aunts (a true Karen) during a Zoom call and she just yelled at me calling me transphobic with her logic being ""obviously PCs aren't for *GIRLS* they're a *BOY* thing so there for you should call your PC *HE*!"" While my pronouns were in my Zoom name clear as day since I was in classes earlier. And it was a joke. And I'm sure she only assumed my PC was for gaming and not editing
I get called racist all the time for not like Mexican food. It's a *kind of food*
ikr! i called the cookie a girl boss ironically and someone who (not kidding) needs to touch grass was like “their pronouns are they/them!!! you need to respect that you transphobe. we fight for diversity everyday and it’s not okay for you to cover that up!!!” like uhm child, i call everything and everyone a girlboss and bae (unless someone says not too lol)
I have a daughter, and I use whichever pronoun I can remember at the time.
i do the same thing lmaoooo
sure was
that’s the greatest thing i’ve seen all day
My uhhh new gender is ACAC
This is even funnier if you know something of British disputes over whether something we in the U.S. would call a cookie should be classified as a ""biscuit"" or a ""cake"". In the U.K. I believe the two have different packaging requirements and are taxed at different rates. Moisture and sugar content both affect classification. It's really pretty bonkers. I suspect the Oreo is probably dry and dense for a cake and high sugar, even if you separate the filling from the wafers, for a biscuit.
Is there an difference between McVities' aesthetic and Pim's core, do you think? And what are the gender and tax implications.

And if you were to purchase a box of each, and Oreos as well, then realized you urgently needed to pee and returned to the store, would any of these biscuit boxes need a doctor's note showing their gender dysphoria diagnosis to be taken into...um, which bathroom? Can you even take all major biscuits and cakes into the public rest room post-purchase in the UK any more?
lemme do that lol
Yes I was very confused as to why a cookie has pronouns.
agree, i love the game but some of the people… wow. if i see another r34 about pure vanilla having large “manly bits” i’m gonna end it
Wait i have never heard of cookie run, there’s a fandom with cookies that all have pronouns??? 🤯
oh yeah, i completely agree, i love the characters and i honestly believe a lot of the characters aren’t cis, and have actively posted edits and art of those characters. Also i’ve referred to the cookie as she before and nobody corrected me, and i SWEAR that ginger brave called them a she before in ep 9 (crepe cookie)
Wait so this is about a video game with cookies with actual pronouns? And there's literal transphobia in this world?

I'm just fucking done I don't know what to say
Asshole.
Ooooooh, I completely believe this happened.
I think what makes this less believable is they’re saying people are DMing them loads of hate. 

Like… what?
i was just sharing my funny experiences revolving a cookie who is apparently non-binary.
calling a cookie a girl boss is funny. part of deconstructing gender is realizing how silly it is, imo. would still call random objects little guys regardless but i actually think it’s a kind of good thing to have a playful and fluid attitude about gender bc it is all a construct. weird to be rigid about androgyny when androgyny is about being fluid lmao
sort of sounds like an actual transphobe making a “joke” out of they/them pronouns rather than someone actually becoming upset about a cookies pronouns tbh
I once had a boy (dont ask questions) that would offer anyone sincere encouragement by saying they are “strong independent women” and while I am averse to female titles I understood that it wasnt an attempt to supersede that but instead using that title more like summoning a mortal kombat character lol.
Some people take themselves entirely too seriously
What? I would think a cookie would most likely go by it/its pronouns so they weren’t even likely right. And it can absolutely still be a girl boss regardless of possible pronouns.
*The NY Black & White has entered the chat*

*Chocolate Whoopie Pie has entered the chat*
why didn’t i expect there to be r34 of cookies 🤦
Idk if you're joking or not but yeah there is ajsnfmdj

It's a mobile game, there's two main ones people play cookie run ovenbreak and cookie run kingdom. In both games you can collect cute lil cookie characters that you can use and play with- and yes, they do have pronouns lol
Didn't knew either and so thought it was about like, the internet pages cookies.
In any case, that's a total overreaction. They're honestly the kind of people who made me distance myself from any lgbt group (other than this one) :v. I find that insulting to actual issues.
yeah I think if people didn't correct you it's probably bc everyone gets confused over Crepe's pronouns, even the official Instagram couldn't handle it one time they called them a ""he"" and had to edit the post-

I also believe those cookies aren't cis ajsnfmdjdbsj i mean look at them- 

but yeah I wish people were less harsh when correcting people but at the same time I also understand the misgendering gets annoying 😭 

but yeah if you aren't sure you can always look up the wiki, the wiki always lists the pronouns correctly and if not that, the little bios in game *usually* mention the pronouns  too-
I'm gonna get a sparkly shirt that says girlboss and twerk on some cookies.
no no, there's no transphobia in the video game if that's what you're saying 😭 

but yes, the characters are ""cookies"" but they have human traits too like clothes and hair and personalities (you can google cookie run characters to see for yourself), and ofc
they do have pronouns- 

but people argue and there's discourse frequently abt this in the fandom. It's really dumb.
/s, of course <3
Yeah I'm 99% sure it's just a troll trying to make people look bad.
completely agreed! and no where are the cookies pronouns stated, so how was i supposed to know? did the cookie introduce itself to me? i’m going to be calling all the masculine cookies girl bosses now and then the feminine ones handsome just to fuel the fire
Yeah, I wouldn't be shocked. Back when I was active in the CR/CRK fandoms (I stopped because the devs are making NFTs and I'm not about that), there were a lot of people who would mock others for gently correcting people on a cookie's pronouns. I would not be at all surprised to learn that those people have taken to ""satirizing"" those corrections in this way, especially because I never personally encountered people immediately jumping to that level of aggression (most players who correct others on the cookies' pronouns seem to realize and understand that most people don't keep track of what pronouns every single one of the dozens of little cookie characters uses).
could you clarify? are you calling me the transphobe or the other person. because i personally use they/them, as well as he or she depending on if i feel masculine or feminine
 i said that pure vanilla was cute and oh my god i regret every word
Rule 34 applies to all existence...even virtual existence...
I swear im not joking! Thank you for explaining!! 

 i literally dont have any games on my phone just not my thing haha 🤣
yeah! that’s the thing i didn’t see any on crepes! maybe i’m blind but no idea
Wait so Op was rightfully called out for misgendering a character?
I read some more comments. 

Op isn’t even talking about a literal cookie. 

There’s a game called Cookie Run with cookie characters that wear clothes etc. 

They all have pronouns and it seems OP was called out for misgendering one of the characters. 

They just twisted their post to make it seem it’s a literally cookie.
dndndndd love that you know what it means for a cookie to be masculine v. feminine lmao
Not who you are responding to, but the other person would be the transphobe.

The suggestion is that the other person is getting unduly upset about the pronouns/gendered terms you used for a cookie in order to make fun of people who care about pronouns, especially those who use they/them pronouns. Specifically, the person is ""fake irate"" that you used gendered terms for a non-gendered object, so they are making fun of people, e.g. you, who in transphobe's mind are either he or she, for calling a they/them/it cookie a ""girlboss"".

You are not the asshole. Oops, wrong forum.
The other person
dear god 😟
Yeah they tend not to use the pronouns if it's they/them in the bios, it's a common thing idk if you've noticed- kinda frustrating at some points 

If they're being vague and ambiguous abt it you can suspect it's a they/them situation 

but yeah the wiki is always there and tbh there's a lot of they/them cookies, like more than you'd think (and I appreciate that)
It was a lil excessive and harsh I wouldn't say it was done in the right way but y'know 

the character DOES go by they/them it's just something good to know for the future at least
😭 it’s on a little mobile game, so it’s like Dark Choco Cookie 💀🥀 and ima call him a girl boss and then there’s pumpkin pie cookie! 🥧🧡🍂 and ima call her handsome af

Spending the week getting misgendered while visiting family but feeling masc as hell		"Sometimes, family just sucks. My dad came to visit me today and called me a girl IN MY OWN HOUSE ☹️
My first thought was “damn he’s hot,” so you’ve got the masc thing down! 😆 getting misgendered sucks, but finding your people who acknowledge you for who you are helps so very much
you got this dude 👍
Dayum boi
Ugh I’m sorry, that sucks having it happen in your own house where you should feel most yourself
Omg thank you!
Thx! 🖤
He said he's leaving early in the morning ""so I'll try not to wake you girls up when I go."" I just continued the conversation as if he was talking about my daughter and our female dog lol. I may not be good at confrontation and asserting myself, but I'm a pro at snark 😂"	e0979g	NonBinary	271	0.99	2019-11-22 23:18:21
Got misgendered by 7 different people in a group (and my mother) so I made some pronoun earrings to make myself feel better		"I LOVE these!
Love them!!! 😎❤️
I love those! I might have to make myself a pair!
[deleted]
You're valid as heck
I've had good luck wearing a they/them face mask in public... But not with my family because they are a** holes. Love the earrings!
Aww thank you 💕
Thank you 😁
Oh absolutely 😁 I love these so much already
Thanks! I'm happy to be who I am and no amount of misgendering will change that.
Thanks 💕
That sounds like a good idea. And I totally get the family thing- my family loves to be purposely obtuse. Hopefully these earrings will help get the point across 😁
I like the they one too heh"	o8mb9x	NonBinary	275	1.0	2021-06-27 00:15:50
Misgendered with dog	I don’t really expect anyone to read this or care very much, but holy shit am I getting tired of being called “mom” when walking my dog. Misgendering aside, this 1 year old, 60 + pound rottie lab is not the fruit of my loins. I did not birth him. I am not his mom or his dad thank you very fucking much	"Extremely relatable! Funnily enough my dog is always being misgendered too and people are so mortified when they discover they’ve been “she-ing” him… like I wish they would keep that same energy for trans people but ok.
I call myself “renny” to my dog as in paRENt. Just a thought.
I'm sorry that's happening, it sounds awful. :(
fucking SAME.   


When my sister and I moved in together she kept trying to ask me what a gender neutral word she could use was to refer to me essentially as my cat's mom and i very forcefully insisted ""he is my roommate. i am not his parent."" but she said that sounded ""too cold"" and yet somehow she settled on ""parental unit"" and that DIDN'T sound too cold? who knows. drove me absolutely bonkers though.
The mom/dad thing for pets really weirds me out. I know some people like it, and that’s fine, you do you, but it shouldn’t be assumed everyone uses these terms with their pets!
I call my dog my kid seeing as he’s the only one I’ll ever have 🤷🏻 Plus, he behaves waaaaaay better than any child I’ve ever met. 

However, I do empathize with the misgendering. It’s a constant thing for me as well and it gets hella old. Just know that you’re valid as you are. 👍🏼
I call my dog ""my baby"" or ""the child"" as a term of endearment and as a joke at my unwillingness to have kids... but being referred to specifically as her parent - especially gendered - I find extremely uncomfortable. I'm her best friend, or her caregiver.

In other binary gendered nonsense, nearly every time we meet someone new they'll refer to her as ""he"". She's got a gender neutral name, and I never bother to correct people cuz she's a dog, what's it matter to her? But if I happen to use she/her pronouns regarding her people absolutely fall all over themselves apologizing.... rubs me just as wrong that they care so deeply about it.
amen to that. my pup is annoying codependent roommate, not my kid.
Can’t relate re: the parentage, my cats firmly are my children and if anyone says otherwise I’m gonna start faking adoption certificates. Sorry about the misgendering though, it’s so fucking annoying. People need to stop judging and start politely asking.
Duuude, I hear you. I hate the whole ""mom/dad"" thing. Vet and doggie daycare does it to us. It drives me nuts. My dog is my buddy, not my child. Please just say ""dog's family/owner/people are here."" Anything but ""parent"". So much ick.
“Are you calling me a bitch?” 

“I’m not a dog, are you feeling okay?”

“Oh, have people started giving birth to dogs now? Man, 2023 be wildin’…” 

“Actually, this is a dog! He may look like a child but he’s actually in the canine family! Don’t worry, I just learned that myself not too long ago.”

“Yeah I was in labor for *hours* tryna push this puppy outta me!”

“Thanks… [porch/lawn/sidewalk/car/whatever the other person is doing] mom..?” 

“I’m actually just his owner, I’m not cute enough to have been his mother.”

*start barking at them viciously, bonus points if you can get your dog to join*
I get this same crap all. The. Time. It sucks and im sorry your dealing with it.
I got the same issue, albeit they call me “dad”. Do you know a gender-neutral term one can introduce? I haven’t found a good one yet. :/
Reply with 'His mom was a bitch. If you'd like me to be one, keep implying I'm a dog.'
Lol I love how you're like I did not give birth to this dog. I'm the cringy pet parent that calls my cats my babies. I raised both from the earliest I could and they act like kids sometimes lol. I'm just now having my first human child. I'm gender queer but no one acknowledges the They part. They see female and just go ""ah! Female!"" The forget the They in She/They. Sometimes I wonder why I even bother....I'm still kinda closeted but my pronouns are known. I don't tell people I'm gender queer in person but if it comes up I do try to mention my pronouns cuz that is what I'd prefer to be called. I wanted to go by they/them but when I brought this up I was told ""you're too feminine to want to be anything other that a woman"" which....I guess they are right. I've always wanted to have kids and just be a SAHM I don't really thing that has anything to do with how I feel about gender though. Growing up I had a lot of guy friends and I loved hanging out with my brother friends and they did ""boy stuff"". I like to wear guys clothes often and would take my dad's old shirts and anything that didn't fit my brother. (For awhile my brother and j were the same size and I'd often wear his clothes) but nah totally cis...😒.

Wow sorry guess I needed a gender rant today.
tbh i understand the frustration, but realistically we live in a cishet world & nobody is going to know you’re nonbinary - that is the point of being nonbinary. there is no look to it. you can still present “feminine” & be nb & it would be easy to be misgendered. its not that big of a deal in the grand scheme of things because thats just a stranger. now if it was a close friend or relative misgendering you & they know your identity, then that is different. but you cant really expect that not to happen. no disrespect
[deleted]
Dang .. they got your gender AND your species wrong too?! Lol but seriously, I like to give people the benefit of the doubt and assume they most of the time they are not trying to be offensive, they are just trying to connect in a way. Maybe more so connect to the dog than you lol. But I get it. It is frustrating when people make assumptions about your gender. But don’t let it spoil your mood. People are generally just dumb as hell, and don’t mean any harm. Just laugh it off.
Absolutely relatable. It's so annoying and frustrating. I used 'Mod' as I'm her moderator but like.... no one has to use gender to complement my dog.   


though I do call her my first born (not of my loins, but she is my first kid). Your comment about the parenting of dogs made me laugh though! It's true, and it's a weird ass thing people just... assume everyone does.
Too relatable!! I hate the whole concept/phenomenon of pet parents, it just doesn't feel right. Also people have such weird ideas about pets and gender. Its been far too many times people say my dog needs a new harness cuz it's purple and he's a boy. Like b*tch we dont care, were both colorblind!!
MOOD. I have a 95 pound rott and I am SO TIRED of people calling me his fucking mom. Transmasc, HRT two years. It's getting so old. 🥲
""unless you think I'm a dog, you've got our genders mixed up""
Oh my god that happened all the time with my SO’s dog. Everyone thought he was a girl. We’d get misgendered together
Years ago, I dated a guy who had a dachshund. We would walk the dog, and regularly people would say, ""Look at the size of that dog's penis!"" People are just weird.
I agree. Freaking hell. People are so heartless when it comes to other people
I fuckin love that honestly
That is so neat! :D
Thank you. It just really sucks. I’ll be having a perfectly gender day and have a nice interaction with a stranger and they’ll look at my dog and say “go with your mommy!” And it just kills me
Jackson Galaxy uses the term ""cat guardian"" to refer to people who live with and care for cats.
it’s super weird. i don’t think of my pets as my children at all. i take care of them, i love them, but calling them children feels weirdly disrespectful? like my oldest dog is 12 years old. that’s an old lady in dog years. she’s not a child. also, she’s been with me through really tough times. she’s more like my partner in crime or something. idk.
This happens to me as well, it cracks me up when people apologise so sincerely 😂 It’s like, the floofy one is a dog! Fluffy wouldn’t know gender if it gave him a biscuit. I’ve also had his dog physio comment “oh, are you sad today because your owner put you in a pink collar? How embarrassing”. I just laughed and fired back that we don’t feel obliged to gender norms in this house.
I’ve just heard of guardian!!! I like that one a lot
I like mod as I'm my pup's moderator.
No need to apologize! Safe space for venting right here
I don’t expect anyone to know I’m an enby, I just don’t want them to call me mom??? Also nobody knowing I’m non-binary is NOT my goal in being non-binary
I always get a bit of imposter syndrome when I see posts like this because I guess I just associate a lot of the gendered language we use every day with sex rather than gender.

Neopronouns completely baffle me and even they/them strikes me as unnecessary. Though at least I get where people are coming from with the latter.

But I can't imagine being called a mum or dad to a pet causing any grief.

I'm aware thats my problem, not OP's it's just bizarre sometimes how wildly our experiences differ. I thought I'd find like minded people here but I'm apparently really weird in my approach to gender even in enby spaces.
That’s not how anything works and is really awful of you to say, thanks :D
I go for “yeah we both get read as girls. He doesn’t mind”
Yes this is how I see it! We both get read as girls and he doesn’t let it get to him. It’s comforting to be in solidarity with him lol
Yay, that makes me happy I could help! Plus you are the first person to ever comment back to me! So thanks! You made my day!
Honestly, some people make no sense. I have no issue with people considering their dogs their children if that makes them happy, but it seems so weird to me to assume someone else does.
My go-to is “go with your pet human!”
Guardian is really really good!
Loving it! ”Guardian of the pup”. 😌
I love reddit sometimes. Some of the subs I'm in make me feel so valid 🥺
its normal for people to refer to themselves or other people as dog moms or dog dads, cat moms or cat dads. i can understand its cringy to hear when you’re nb but that person didnt know you would be uncomfortable & in the real world, people unfortunately use gendered terms like that. they meant it endearingly, as they were talking to your dog & referring to you. i dont know why you care so much, i guess thats what im trying to say
first off, i just wanna say your opinion is your opinion & i disagree but im not gonna argue or anything but state my opinion - pronouns do not equal gender or sex & OP’s post is not about their pronouns & we don’t know where their identity lies on the nb spectrum. 

second, everyone uses they/them when referring to someone whos gender they dont know when they are talking about them, so it’s no different for someone to make the choice to use those pronouns. i am not comfortable with she/her being used & i like they/them. however, im not gonna beat myself up if people don’t recognize my gender as genderless because they dont know me & the whole point of gender is that it is in your head, not determined by your sex or the clothes you wear. i am also not going to surround myself with anyone who not use my pronouns, ill say goodbye & go about my day. i know who i am at the end of the day & that is all that matters

third, OP didnt say it was causing grief but i didnt understand why they were so upset exactly which is why i asked politely

fourth, if you have opinions that neopronouns/they/them isnt valid, you’re not gonna be welcomed into nonbinary spaces realistically (not saying that is right)

imma level with you & say this : this sub has a lot of stupid shit on it in general & counteracts what nonbinary really means. im not surprised that im gonna be downvoted, even though im nonbinary myself. you’re not allowed to have any differing opinions. a lot of people in the lgbt community wont accept they/them pronouns, the nonbinary spectrum identities, etc & thats their problem. like i said, i wont surround myself with people that dont accept me for who i am

i cannot stand human beings as a misanthrope & do not want to be around them anyways. i have close friends online who respect me & my identity, as well as use my pronouns, & thats all i need
I just don’t feel like a parent. I’m 22
Exactly!!! Thank you for sharing your experience with me, makes me feel much less alone
You’re too kind! I hope you have a wonderful rest of your day
I think it’s a cute concept and I certainly don’t judge anyone who does, but it’s an odd thing to assume on top of gender
I care just enough to post a stupid rant on a supportive subreddit and that is literally all. I know it’s endearing I just personally find it odd. Mostly I hate that you’re inferring I’m not participating in the real world just cuz I’m venting online
Yo thanks, I respect this pov. I’m sorry for getting defensive in response to your other comment. I was really just looking for support, which is why I flaired the post as such, but i respect your opinion dude
Agreed. My mom sometimes does it, and I have no issue with it, I love seeing her petting and giving attention to my dog, but it's weird to think you would assume that or someone's gender about someone you don't know.
yeah i do understand that its weird how every single thing is gendered, a lot of dog owners do that. i dont mean that ur not in the real world im just saying that it doesnt rlly matter how androgynous someone looks, afabs are always going to be called by feminine terms because cis people have that black & white way of seeing people & atp i dont even care anymore even when it makes me feel uncomfy. as long as ur confident in ur identity thats all that really matters & hopefully u dont run into that situation again. there really is no way to “pass” as a nonbinary person so anywhere u go ppl will misgender u. ik u said ur not gonna hide being nonbinary & thats fine i wasnt saying to do that, but nobody really knows & will just assume. if we werent taught strict ways of gender identity, we wouldnt have this issue but we do & then thats when conformity becomes a problem
no problem at all haha! yeah its rlly weird how that person started saying stuff about pronouns ?? like i understand you’re not a parent & dog owners are really weird with their pet names to say the least (i used to own two dogs, but i wouldnt call myself a dog parent bc my mom mainly took care of them so they were really just my best companions) i was like woah slow down there 💀💀 cause who knows if you’re comfortable w she/her pronouns or who knows if youre comfortable with other feminine terms & you just dont like fertility or having children (which, god, i hate children) its def valid how you felt, i was just saying if u let misgendering bother u, its gonna make u insecure & unhappy. we know ourselves more than anyone else can & im assuming that that person most likely follows some truscum ideals if they are going to say that about pronouns, which pronouns are literally made up. its just cringe to me to police other people & “gatekeep” being trans, nonbinary, whatever. people are allowed to be called whatever they wanna called & if others don’t respect that then fuck em. i just like to ask questions & i can change my mind when needed. but i wasnt down for the whole “neopronouns & they them are silly!1!1!” like we know damn well that when we walk outside, we are perceived as either male or female or man or woman. thats why i dont even care anymore. like the lgbt discourse on this app is insane & i only been here almost 2 weeks. nobody can come to a middle ground, its always about “facts” like science cant explain every single thing theres literally no fuckin way to prove someones gender. & then this sub is insecure people being like “oh am i nonbinary if i dont look androgynous? how can i appear more nonbinary? oh my conservative family wont accept me!1!1!” if coming out is not safe, do not do it. everyones valid here regardless of how they look, how they feel, whatever labels they use. labels arent supposed to be strict. its just frustrating to me. & then the whole “oh if u dont wanna transition or u dont have severe dysphoria, ur not trans!1!1!1” when trans just means going from point a to point b & gender dysphoria is not even a mental condition or illness 💀 i went off on a tangent but its not safe to be out as LGBT right now anyways & theres all this talk about coming out like no, u never need to prove urself or anything, ur existence as a nonbinary person is acceptable. i would make this a post on this sub but i know im gonna get soooo much hate even though im just saying “hey, be yourself & youre enough” i mean hell, im bald with hella piercings & i dont understand how im called a “woman” but i guess i dont look like a man so society puts me in that box yk 🤷🏻"	11yu9ku	NonBinary	268	0.98	2023-03-22 19:45:15
Hey. Need some positivity today. First thing when I walk in to work I get misgendered by a manager. (He/Him)		"Sorry to hear that dude, it sucks they're so blind they can't see how awesome and worthy of respect you are 😡 Hope lots of gender euphoria is coming your way. I'm proud of you.
I'm sorry my friend. one more reason managers ain't shit. i hope your day gets better and you look very cool
Your outfit is so cool today!! I hope the rest of your Monday is magical 🥰💖
screw your manager!! i love your hair and your dope pins💕here’s hoping your day turns around friend
Sorry my guy, that stinks. I like your hair, reminds me of Adam lambert
I’m sorry that happened, sir. You certainly deserve better. If I could, I would give you the biggest bear hug. I shall instead deliver big Dad Hug energy your way.
Like everyone else, I, too, love everything happening in this photo. The bracelet, the pins, the shirt, the soulful eyes that display so much love, pain, softness, determination. You are seen and you are so loved, son.
Dude you look awesome and i love your pins. Managers are arses but that doesn't mean your any less valid!
You’re handsome as hell! I’m sorry your manager did that to you, I hope your day gets better ❤️
Sorry dude :/ you fresh as hell tho 🤘🏻💜
Looking great, and the bracelets are on point!!
Hey! Sorry to hear that. Seriously love your look. Some people just have zero tact. Keep on rocking those rings and pins!
Sorry to hear that, I'm sending you love and good vibes, friend :)
Hey buddy, keep kicking ass, wish you all the best. Love the pins, keep Carpe'n all those diems.
Hang in there man you are prefect just the way you are
Sorry to hear you were misgendered, however  I think you look an amazing person.  Just be happy with yourself, love yourself and be proud of yourself.  I'm a 58 year old male who enjoys people's individuality.  I just Googled how many genders there are ; 57!

See how it can be confusing for many.

Just be strong g and proud of who you are. Take care and sending you positive vibes and hugs 🤗❤
I’m sorry, hope the rest of your day is filled with positivity!
My man you looking fresh as hell
Hey man, I'm sorry that happened. While I am late, I just wanted to say that you are very handsome and screw the manager. Hope lots of euphoria and luck comes your way.
I’m sorry. Overwriting your gender with what they want you to be is one of the powers they want to have over you. Give ‘em a euphoric fuck-you, because with the way you look, euphoria is what you should be feeling.
Thank you so much!
Thank you so much! Most of them are cool, but it really hit me like a brick. Thank you!
Thank you so much friend!
Thank you so much! I hope you have a good day too!
Oh gosh! Gonna make me blush. Thank you so much!

"Do you get offended or triggered when cis people ask you ""what's your bio sex""?"	"I don't know but personally I don't like getting asked that question from strangers because I feel like they will start misgender me or they invalidate my gender identity. 

Thoughts?"	"I don't get offended, but I definitely make it clear that it's none of their business
""You're neither my doctor nor my type, so you'll never know""
""Why are you asking me about my genitals? What are you, some kind of pervert??""
Other than like a medical or legal situation, I get pissy because I can't think of a single reason to ask other than someone being inappropriately nosy. What does knowing my agab have to do with anything? It doesn't tell you what people refer to me by, how I act, how I feel, how I move through the world today. I really feel like if someone is insistent that I tell them my agab they just want to misgender me on some level.
Totally inappropriate for an adult to ask unless they’re giving you medical care but if a child asks me I feel flattered 😌
Typically they don't but in all honesty, since I realized *the cis absolutely do this to each other 100% of the time anyway*, I know it has nothing to do with me or any trans person actually being trans. These are people who take for granted that someone's genitals can be guessed by their presentation, and they only react poorly when what they've assumed has been countered, or they can't make an assumption. They get so weird about us specifically BECAUSE **they feel completely, wholly entitled to know what any given individual's genitals are in the first place.** They are just as perverse about each other and other cis people, literally every single child born, and binary trans people. So I don't take it personally anymore, LOL. However, since I physically resemble one binary gender, it's not  a problem I often get to encounter, since they just presume they already know. But the same entitlement complex is at the root of both behaviors.
It's never happened to me. I think my general plan is to respond by asking if we're going to be having sex.
I find it annoying bc it's none of their business. 99% of the time they're just being nosy and invasive at best, fetishizing and dangerous at worst. My body type makes it very clear that I'm AFAB but on the very rare occasion I make sure they end up uncomfortable. ""Why are you asking what my genitals look like? That makes you sound like a predator. Do I need to call security? Why do you think that's any of your business? You're not my type, so piss off and learn some manners."" Any variation of those.
No one has asked me, but if they did, I would definitely be offended. I would probably say something like, 'Oh, you want to know what's in my pants? Let's talk about what's in your pants first"" or ""It seems really weird how interested you are in my genitals.""

My dad's wife recently asked my sister if my spouse had ""fully transitioned"" and my sister said, ""I don't know what \[spouse's\] genitals look like because IT'S NONE OF MY BUSINESS.""
I get a bit grouchy, because that's unimportant information to anyone who isn't a doctor. People ask that if they plan to misgender.
Depends how they ask. If they just said that as quoted probably annoyed. But if they're genuinely just trying to learn and improve their understanding of the experience and shit like that then I don't mind talking about anything. Its pretty easy to tell the difference for me since it's still pretty obvious lol
Yes. That and questions about how I've medically transitioned.
It's just another gross way of asking about your genitals. I like to uno reverse that uncomfortable feeling onto them by asking ""Wow , do you ask everyone about their genitals?"" . 

The exception is if this is pertinent to health care related needs.
If someone's not trying to get IN MY PANTS they don't need to know what's there.
Unless they are my medical provider, someone asking fot legal reasons, or someone who is interested in a sexual situation then it isn't their business. I find it annoying and triggering
Besides my doctor and someone I’m actively having sex with, there is no reason for anyone to inquire about my birth sex. “Offended” isn’t the right word, but annoyed and exhausted maybe.
yes
idk ask them an inappropriate question about their genitals back like “cut or uncut?” or “hot dog bun or taco?”
> ‘are you afab or amab’ why? you tryna figure out what typa holes i got? you tryna bang??

— [chilewithcarnage](https://www.tumblr.com/chilewithcarnage/674111105346519040/are-you-afab-or-amab-why-you-tryna-figure-out)
""sorry love im taken"" used to be my reaponse
Personally, it would depend more on who and why, but nobody has ever asked me and I feel that I would actually be happy if they did as it would mean that they can't tell themselves.
""Yeah, but are you a boy or a girl? Like, originally?""

""Wouldn't you like to know, weatherboy?""
Why are they asking about private medical information? Is this show and tell? Do they have diabetes? What birth defects do they have? We're they born with a tail? Come on, tell me the gorey details if we're sharing. /s 🙄
whenever someone asks me what i was assigned at birth i save myself the headache and automatically assume they’re asking “so what are you *actually*?”
Yeah it's... Eh.

It feels like they do that so they can mentally know """"what I actually am"""" and praise themselves for the effort of still gendering me correctly despite that
Yes. It's invasive and creepy.
I don’t get triggered but it is a really creepy thing for people to ask, and I guarantee if I was cis they wouldn’t be asking pervy questions. You don’t need to know what’s in my pants. Period.
As an intersex person I love completely pwning people who ask that question
No because they think i am my bio sex no matter how many nonbinary badges flags and bracelets i have
Considering ""bio gender"" isn't a thing I get real annoyed. It's rude af and incredibly misinformed.
not sure of the right words but I usually troll them a bit
when they do this or even if they start asking what my ""real"" name is 

 I'm AFAB trans masc
but agender auDHD in the like alien way 

 anyway when they hear I'm trans tend to assume I'm a ""pre"" trans femme 

it's probably not great to ask them ""what do you think it is"" but I usually couple it with ""how old do you think I am"" 

cause I also get clocked for like 10 years younger 

and just train wrecking their expectations

but I'll also counter any snowflake bs with well I did join the military (not that means jack and or shit and I'll say queer people especially gender queer == braver than any US marine )

but it has happened where they start using she her etc when they find out or I've told that I'm trans masc 
I then usually will call them by a name that is on the side of the binary they are not but won't misgender
if you plan on having sex with me, then you get to ask.  i think that's part of consent, making sure that nobody has any expectations that might cause confusion or embarrassment.  and a hetero or homo preference is totally valid.  some people just aren't into what you're packing.

but outside of that or your doctor trying to figure out if there could be any potential side effects of a drug?  fuck off outta there.
Not so much offended as creeped out at people’s audacity to ask what sex parts you have. Especially because I used to get asked this a lot more in high school.. and it was mostly fully grown adults asking
Yup, 100%
It makes me wanna go haywire fr, like what is that info to them? 
Besides medical stuff only the doctors have to know, it's really not important in day to day life smh
The vast majority of cis people who do that later on use it to try an invalidate me so that's also maybe why I just get mad at this point
I hate it so much
I haven’t gotten this yet (I still very much present my agab 😒), but I could see myself being really really annoyed by it outside of a medical context.
i’ve reached a point that when i mention i’m trans people ask me “oh so which way are you transitioning?” which peak andro euphoria tbh, but frankly i live in a hard red state where a lot of people have never even talked to gay people let alone a trans person so although i get some…rude questions it’s never been intentionally so they’re trying their best to understand and that’s so much more than i expect where i live. the best thing is to redirect their questions and let them know they shouldn’t word it/ask/ whatever it may be in the way they did bc it’s offensive. i’m fine with explaining things in detail if it means the other person gains knowledge of trans stuff and a positive first experience with a trans person
If someone asks, I make it a point to tell people it's not their business. Aside from a medical professional who may need to know it for treatment options, it's nobody's business what's in my pants.
I look way too femme for people to ask sadly. I'd be thrilled and annoyed at the same time, like wow, you had to ask?? :O But also bugger off, I'm not gonna tell you
Triggered? No. Offended? That's complicated. Most people that are engaging for this line of questions are being disingenuous. Intentionally being cruel for the sake of cruelty. If we get to that point in the conversation it means I fucked up and let my guard down and wasn't paying attention to cut them off long before we got there.
Yes.
Never happened to me. I might actually feel some accomplishment if I got that inquiry to be honest..

However thinking about it on principal it’s obviously wrong and isn’t a normal or polite question to ask someone!
The only time I get offended is when being asked during surveys. You know, those things that \*should\* be anonymous for. Overall, unless my doctor, it is no one's business but my own.
It’s absolutely unnecessary unless it’s a medical provider. I definitely feel like they will disregard my chosen gender to label me by my sex if they ask this.
I don't get offended but I gess it could come of this way because usually when I got asked this it was in arguments with my old friends to try upset me or make me uncomfortable because they knew me before I knew I was enby and still look like AGAB
I wouldn’t go as far to say I get attended but it weird me out cause they have no business knowing. It’s not important.
I never had it happened but I can imagine I’d say “why?”. People either think I’m a guy or gal which makes me usually stare at them and not respond
Idk if offended is the right word but it definitely would make me super uncomfortable
To be asked that would imply there's a question, so I'm not gonna lie I think itd feel kinda euphoric.  Still none of their business tho, wouldn't let them know that 😂
I've never been asked this by an adult thanks to the place I live being pretty accepting, but I used to get asked by kids a lot bc I've always been androgynous. It definitely feels icky, but even though it sucks you can't really blame kids because sometimes they don't know any better, they're just curious. The best case with that is just to be honest, explain, and try to let it not get to you.
there’s just no reason for anyone to ever need to know that about me unless they’re my doctor or working with my doctor. and this hasn’t happened to me (that i remember tbf) but i wouldn’t say i’d be offended or triggered. i’d just be a pretty weirded out
Literally wildly bizarre that strangers would ever come up to you and ask you what genitals you have. If someone asks you politely if they can ask, and then asks due to potentially questioning their own gender/being LGBTQ, in a setting where that's been established as acceptable, that's... almost permissible, but even then, they're on thin ice.
In just about every context except one, yea, I'd probably be offended, at the very least really uncomfortable. The only time it wouldn't be is if we were having a genuine conversation about gender vs sex or something like that.
I assume it's either 1. 'but what are you really?' or 2. ignorant curiosity. Either way, none of their gd business. It really annoys me.
I don’t really know how I feel. It doesn’t really happen to me, cus it’s visually fairly obvious. Unless I’m in a full beat, and even then, I feel like there’s no hiding the AMAB origins.

I guess it happened once on Grindr. A guy asked “What ARE you?” And that sucked. But I always figured that was because of his shit delivery and subsequent transphobia.
Not offended! Not at all! It’s human behavior to be curious. Too bad this often isn’t a place of curiosity, but more so a way to mock or belittle. Have you explain yourself to them so they feel like the bigger person. Personally, I’m non-binary because I feel gender is a concept that should simply be abolished! It’s outdated and hardly does anyone any favors! So asking me what I was before realizing I was ENBY is simply pointless :] it’s like asking a person what they were before they were born, like all you are is a mere concept before then
Unless they're a medical person, they don't need to know. I'm not dating anyone, so a potential partner doesn't need to know. I get grossed out honestly.
No one’s ever asked me directly about mine, but someone did ask about my ex’. It caught me off guard & made my feel uneasy, but I didn’t get “offended” (you have every right to tho). I just told her “it doesn’t matter”. Im not 100% sure she kept pushing but it’s possible, in which case I just repeat what I said in a sterner voice. 

So personally I don’t really get offended/triggered at first, but if the person doesn’t respect my answer I’ll definitely start getting upset. I’ll also tend to get more hesitant around the person cause I don’t feel comfortable with ppl who could possibly be transphobic.
I personally don't get offended or triggered. I would rather get confused and/or a bit disappointed. like- why does it matter? why do you care? what difference will it make in how you look at me? or anything like that. It's just a weird and stupid question.
No not really I just say “ I’m your mum”
Depends on the circumstances 
If it's not meant in an offensive or disrespectful way then I'm fine with it
If the person isn't a sex partner or medical professional currently treating you they actually have no right to know the current or former state of your genitals.

Sex partner is negotiable. If it's me, surprise me.
Yes because frankly it’s none of their business in the first place and secondly it feels very invasive. Cisgender people ask that question like they automatically have the right to know what sex we were assigned to at birth. 

It’s similar to asking what our deadnames are. I don’t get that question a lot because my chosen name is gender-neutral, and everyone thinks that it is my birth name. But trust me, gender-neutral or not, I would not stick with my birth name regardless.

They almost feel entitled to knowing it, when that is something shouldn’t have to share with anyone.
I personally don’t care about gender like… at all. I prefer they/them pronouns and I see myself as agender but I’m fine with people seeing me as whatever so asking me that question is valid for me I guess
I'm not out/confusing-looking yet, but I don't think.I'll care much.

Maybe enough to be coy about it.

But ask again in a couple years...🤷
Neither, tbh. I very much look like a woman and don't mind being called one. I love women. I'm just not one.
I don't get offended/triggered but I always ask them why they want to know what genitals a minor has. If they keep asking I then start to call them a pervert and gross for wanting to know a minors genitals. lol.
What does this mean?
I mean it's very context dependent. Most of the time something like this happens to me it's either out of ignorance because they genuinely don't think a question like that could be seen as rude, or it's because they are interested in hooking up with me and want to know what genitals I have.

The former I will usually answer with something cheeky like ""why do you want to know what genitals I have"" which I feel like is a subtle way of making a point of how weird of a question it is. The latter I will just straight up say what genitals I have to get to the point.

I could see a scenario where someone is asking this in a derogatory way ""I don't believe you're non-binary so what gender are you really"", in which case yes that would definitely offend me and I wouldn't even bother to answer.
Idc
I mean to me if they are my doctor it's fine. It's more so that cis people have this weird thing where they need to know what your genitalia is, to see how to act around you as if they could become more with you. It's annoying when they base you based if they are sexually interested in you based on their own sexuality.
Completely depends, when we're talking about theater where I need to choose characters that look like me or someone like a doctor where they need to know what problems I can and can't have, I don't mind, but if it's someone who doesn't need to know, I do
Not personally. Although I’m non-binary I’m still connected to being AFAB and identify as such.
I haven't had this happen to me yet as I can't dress androgynous, but if I did I'd say ""Sorry I don't think I heard you quite right, are you asking me to describe my genitals?"".
My partner’s mom keeps asking what my chromosomes are and I’m like, “I don’t know, do you know yours?? You been tested??”
No, sometimes it gives me the opposite effect. I love to say, ""Wouldn't you like to know? :) ""
I’m actually fine with it, but with how I present I usually don’t have to since I’m a Demi-boy. It depends on how they ask and the context obviously. But generally no one really asks
Before non binary was a widely recognized thing.  I would get asked this all the time.  But people would more so say, I’m sorry, I dont mean to be rude. But are you a boy or a girl? It was uncomfortable then and it’s uncomfortable now, haha
I just get uncomfortably flirtatious with them
Kinda sad I don’t get asked that, because I look so much like what people expect with my AGAB, but, if it did happen, then I’d probably just correct the question, “You mean my *assigned gender at birth*.“

I also tend to not be offended, because I expect it to happen and because I don’t want to let others affect me like that, in any subject. Just seems healthier to ignore people when I can. The only time I was offended when it came to my gender, I was very sick, so I think that had to do with that; I don’t even remember exactly what was said, but had something to do with being a mother/parent.
No, but no one asks, they just assume...
“I’m sorry, I just feel weird disclosing my medical history to people I’m not close with.”
Never really happens at all.  I just get mad that people keep assuming I identify as a man
Yeah, that starts the ""worry train"" for me too... But it rarely happens, cuz I'm not appearing the way I want...
It's a gross question no matter who gets offended by it.  Unless there's attraction between you two and you're about to start talking about sex, they don't need to know at all
Cis people not be obsessed with trans people's genitals challenge.

Why would you ask anybody that?! It's just gross.
I don't really care what anyone calls me or what they think.

But I understand if those things bother you, and if they do bother you, I'd support you in asking them to be respectful.
Yes
ahh ppl dont ask me that bc im an afab femme presenting which kinda sucks cuz ppl instantly assume im a cis woman. it would be fun to confuse them:(
Not really, but I always reject to answer, telling them it doesn’t matter.
Offended or triggered is the wrong word, I get pissed off that a stranger thinks they are entitled to knowing what's in my pants. Generally, I don't share that with strangers, nor do they share it with me, and I believe that's a boundary that most people want to maintain (unless in specific settings and circumstances, eg. cruising, sexpositive parties or hookups) and indeed have a fundamental human right to uphold.
Strangers, yes. and creeped out. Like are they trying to imagine my anatomical structure or body parts? 

My friends, not really. They usually know because I can't bind constantly and I openly talk about periods and other ""girl"" topics. *still plan to once i transition cus just cus I plan to get rid of those processes doesn't mean i wont try to be helpful if others have it, and to reduce the taboo.* 

In high school ppl would just ask for my ""real name"" and either from awareness, the town I am in, or other things but most people don't as for my deadname. I do make jokes about it, and am open to telling people as long as I know them and they know me long enough to never think of using my deadname.
Not offended as such - just hit 'em with the ""none of your business 😎👉👉""
It used to happen to me so much growing up (years before I was an adult or out of the pantry) that my knee jerk response is to ask ""Are you my doctor??"" When they look confused or try to double down I can usually change the subject or walk away at that point.

Some folks are the worst. Triggered? Yeah, still fuckin yeah.
I get irritated. Not full-blown offended or triggered. I just think it’s a pointless invasive question.
ummm... not offended but uncomfortabke
Oooh imma have to start using this lmao
I do the same thing! Especially cause I'm a minor and its normally adults asking me that.
This. Little kids just want to learn and know things.
🤯 thanks so much for articulating this!
I hadn't thought of it that way before, thank you
And if they are it's a different kind of conversation.
Hot dog bun or taco 💀
Same
this is also my attitude 😂 otherwise i'd get too angry about the fact that someone thought it was totally fine & appropriate to ask another person what's in their pants! bc, really, that's what it boils down to.
Bro wtf with those surveys? They were was a survey asking for my gender when I succeed passing in my university and the only options were ""man/woman"" 💀.

Like first of why you need to know that???
Second of wtf I'm neither!!!!
exactly!
Ew. What in all hell
I'm afab and sometimes watch my friends kiddos. The youngest insists on using he/him pronouns with me and when we make video game avatars she always designs me as a boy. Not only do I find it really affirming in a sense, but it's just so fuckin cute dude.
When I realized, it was definitely a ""...well *fuck me*"" moment, and it has absolutely been weirdly validating since then. 

To me personally, it's at least a little reassuring that the cis are this kind of gross about literally everyone, and it just flies under the radar until they're confronted with a person they can't guess. They simply feel entitled to information about the genitals of any human they see in the first place. And they're, like, weirdly proud to participate in that entitlement, too? I've come across no small handful of bigots who are like ""OF COURSE I WANT YOU TO KNOW I HAVE A PENIS JUST BY LOOKING AT ME, NOTHING IS MORE IMPORTANT THAN BEING ABLE TO TELL, I'D SHOW YOU WHAT'S IN MY PANTS IN AN INSTANT TO PROVE IT!"" 

So as fucking bizarre and reductive as it is, it's oddly comforting that it's at least a form of scrutiny they subject *everyone* to, including themselves.
Yeah its gross and weird but happens quite often to me at least. lol"	12ktm0r	NonBinary	265	0.97	2023-04-13 15:51:37
Having a buzz cut has made me appear a lot more androgynous and I get misgendered much more frequently and it’s amazing		"Do you mean you get misgendered much less frequently or that people use your correct pronouns more frequently without knowing it, or do you use they/them so you’re getting misgendered more frequently from the opposite direction that you are normally misgendered? 
STOP BEING SO HOT
You really suit that hairstyle
Dang looking good! 
You look amazing!
I agree. I'm confused.. I'm wondering if they are just referring to not being gendered as their assigned birth gender? 
But also a lot of non-binary people get more misgendered when they look more androgynous because cis people then try to find clues to know their gender...
Mm no, don’t stop.... 
Thank you!!

Yeah, I agree. I was just taken back by this post"	90q5yb	NonBinary	263	0.99	2018-07-21 15:41:15
Out to Everyone but Parents	I'm an adult Human and I've been sober for just shy of ten months. I realized the full truth of my nonbinary-ness shortly after that, came out to my incredible and supportive husband shortly after that,  then came out to the majority of the people in my life shortly after that.  All positive experiences (I'm very very lucky in that regard and aware of the privilege that gives me).   I have been trying to figure out/come out to my parents and younger sister since shortly after that (they all live together).   Here's the thing - I know almost for sure they will be supportive.   However,  a combination of difficulties in their lives over the past few months continue to get in the way of my previous plans for coming out to them (I don't want it to be overshadowed honestly by their negative feelings regarding unrelated things) Paired with that, despite knowing they will want to be supportive, I'm scared by their general lack of info on the trans community (and also, my mind keeps replaying a lot of truly homophobic conflicting messaging that existed in my home when I was a child).  Knowing they have grown A LOT as people since then,  I'm still struggling to shake the internalized (gross) concept that I'm going to be telling them something upsetting (taking something away from them?).  But I see them on the daily and my own mental health can't take continuing to be misnamed/misgendered on the regular.   Would really appreciate some good vibes and queer positivity to help push me over spitting out the words ❤️❤️❤️	"I'm sorry but ""I'm an adult Human"" just made me think of like an alien or like a fairy or some shit trying to convince people that they're human, lmao
I 🐝 🍃 in you!!!!!!

You really have no idea how they will take it. I was like this last week. But you can focus on what you do have:

A commitment to sobriety

Supportive family

Community


That’s all gonna be here no matter how it goes. I just wanna share some personal experience.

Last week I worked so hard on an email to my parents coming out to them as trans. I stressed for days and nights and got no sleep. My parents raised me in an explicitly religious and homophobic setting, so I was sure that I would send them this email and permanently lose my parents. So I decided it would be the final email, and I would just come clean. I told them about my previous struggles with substance abuse and depression and accepting my transness. It went better than I could have ever imagined. My super conservative, religious dad is using my name, and is saying he’ll deal with his prejudices. I am just blown away. They were just upset that I had to go through so much to get here.

I’m not saying this will happen to everyone when they come out to their parents, but I will say if you just do it, positive or negative you can just get on with life, and you can be honest, which is so incredibly valuable.
i’m going through the same thing right now. i hope you’re okay and im here if you need someone.
I'm here for the fresh blue hair. And for sympathy and support. I'm not out officially either because it's no one else's business but mine and I don't care much about my pronouns. Stay strong, friend, and be as loud about it as you want.
You'll come out when you're ready. I accidentally came out to my sister this year without really realising because I have only just gotten comfortable with myself and I am 31 this year. I even recall her pausing and saying you're non binary!? I still haven't spoken to my mum!
Love the hair color!
Just popped in to say that your style is fire. Love the hair and the pants.
😂 While I do enjoy introducing my husband (Ala #WWDITS) as my ""Regular Human Husband"" , I suppose here I was mostly clarifying (albeit vaguely) that as an adult, even worst case scenario if my parents weren't supportive, it would only be psychologically damaging,  as opposed to potentially damaging to my personal safety/ security
I introduce myself in this way all the time.
Thank you so so much 💞💞💞💞🖖
All of this - thank you ❤️❤️
Thank you so much and you too ❤️🖖
Thank you so much!! (It's almost always this or green)
That is so kind - thank you so much!!
Yes! I love it!
Also ur super cool for being urself and doing all that selfwork 💛✨
That is so kind and appreciated (it's so difficult sometimes but I'm so glad I'm doing it 💞) Love your hair cut, too! 🔥
Thank you so much 🥺"	wdehw7	NonBinary	247	1.0	2022-08-01 10:56:12
I've been misgendered a LOT this week and I'm tired. Please validate me and call me they.		"They look great! They have a really nice eye colour, and their floral mask is so cute. I bet they have a lovely smile beneath the mask.

I know how they feel getting misgendered a lot. I wish I had better advice for them, but I find that spoken affirmation helps me personally feel better. Even something simple like ""my name is ___ and I am non-binary"" can be a helpful reminder for me. They could try that if they want, or they could try narrating their own life, even mundane things like ""They went into their kitchen, they put the kettle on and they got out their favourite mug"". 


How was that? I hope it was helpful to you. If nothing else, please remind yourself that you know who you are, and nothing that others do can ever change that fact.
They have such lovely glasses, and even lovelier eyes.
[deleted]
I love their hair! Its so fun and colorful. Theyre so valid
Their mask, I kind of love it for dysphoria protection, can I ask where it's from? (Is this insensitive or minimizing to ask?)

Also, do they have a... cauldron on their table?
I love their mask and they seem like a really chill bean. They deserve tons of validation and good vibes.
I love their piercings, and they don't deserve to be misgendered because they're valid just the way they are!
They're perfect just the way they are.
You look amazing.  I’m sorry you’ve been misgendered.
They have lovely eyes and deserve to be called the they choose to use
Look at them! Look how cute and awesome they are! 


I feel ya some of my bosses at my new job dont get it/ dont have a concept space for it and its tiring... some are getting better and it will get better for you too!
They have amazing hair!!

I'm really sorry they're dealing with this. People are... ugh.
They are looking cute! 💜🖤
They are beautiful. 
Who? 
The one reading this
Their mask is so lovely and floral 🥰 It has happy energy.

Misgendering sucks, I hope your week improves friend.
Love their hair, they just take good care of it. Their shirt looks really soft too, wonder where they got it?
mask squad!
Looking at this picture and I was like ""They have a really cool mask and I love their hair"".
How is anyone going to know you want to be called they?  I get it but you have to be real here.
Thank you, I really appreciate you ❤️ trying to tell myself it's for the greater good haha
Thank you ❤️
A happy accident, thank you ❤️
Thank you so much ❤️
You're fine! I got it from wish by searching ""dust masks"" and ""flu masks"" (not what I use them for but it still works!)

And yes, yes they do!
Thank you so much ❤️
Thank you! I did them myself (not recommended) 💕
Bless you, thank you ❤️
Thank you ❤️
Thank you ❤️
I'm sorry work is so exhausting for you ❤️
Thank you lovely ❤️
Thanks!! ❤️
Yeessss ❤️❤️❤️
I've been blindsided by a friend pulling this with ""she"" all week for someone on Facebook but this is the first ""They"" one I've seen and it warmed my heart.
Thank you ❤️
New Look on sale :) ❤️
Yeeaaaahhhh!!!
Thank you! ❤️
Because they were told, repeatedly, on multiple occasions. It's also public knowledge through the public accounts they contacted me through.
You are quite welcome 💜
No problem! Make sure to post again if you need more affirmation. 💜
This is random but I’m a huge Mickey Mouse fan and also AFAB. There’s these couple shirts (that are obnoxious because of their cishet nonsense). Anyway, I want this shirt that says “I’m her Mickey” and just wear it totally casually. People will be like, “who’s Mickey?” “The girl reading this ;)”

Haha sorry very random but hopefully it will make you chuckle
Cool!
Ok...I thought these were random people who didn't know you.
Nah, that doesn't annoy me really, I mean, look at me haha. I am aware haha."	cfk5qn	NonBinary	241	0.98	2019-07-20 09:55:20
My job sucks and I’m constantly misgendered by my customers. But at least I know I’m an NB hottie!		"Love those frames. nb hottie CONFIRMED.
You look really great. Your hair looks so awesome.
🤩🤩🤩
Have you looked into trans-supportive jobs?
I hate being misgendered its like 'boy?' 'no...' 'girl then?' 'no!' '????' 'fucking neither dipshit' its the worst when they just keep guessing instead of fucking asking like is it THAT hard
Oof. I feel it. My coworkers can be corrected 8 times in a shift and they'll still call me ""she"". That's what I get for being the only non genetic Male in shift I guess.....
>But at least I know I’m an NB hottie!

Oh yeah, you are :)
Ok, but those are like, THE coolest scholarly-looking glasses I've ever seen!!! They're so unique, and they look great on you!
Thank you! ☺️ I love a good deal and I got my frames for like $60! I have to tell everyone who compliments them.
Oh absolutely. But I live in Salt Lake and I’m a professional barista. So there aren’t a lot of options in my chosen field to begin with and it’s highly competitive in the barista world here. My spouse and I plan on moving to a more supportive city/state in about a year, but a year is a long ass time.
People in general are the worst! It’s really not hard to ask a simple question! I usually wear they/them pins to work, and I’ve NEVER been asked what they mean, and always end up with a “excuse me miss”. And then they get mad at me when I’m slightly salty back.
Thank you so much!
I’m sorry :( Starbucks has been great to me but I know that’s well below your pay grade. Maybe Reserve isn’t, though?
>a year is a long ass time

Time is cruel. A year goes by quick when you enjoy it, and painfully slow when you don't.
I had to google what Reserve was! It seems really cool though! I’m not sure if there’s one here in Utah, though. We have a fairly good third wave coffee scene, but it really only started in the last five years or so. Salt Lake, and Utah in general, just kinda sucks for both the LGBTQ+ scene and the coffee scene. Thank you so much for the recommendation though! I’m honestly not above working in a Starbucks, the ones in SLC just stink.
It’s a strange mixed bag. My life outside of work is fairly fulfilling and wildly supportive of me and I want nothing more to slow it down. It’s the second I step into work that 8 hours seems to turn into a week.
I think you’d do great at one :)
Isn't that how it usually goes? It's hard enough to get a job doing something you love, and it's harder still to end up doing it with the kind of people who can end up as your friends."	c2vxul	NonBinary	237	0.99	2019-06-20 13:19:53
Being non-binary is hard	My pronouns are they/them but I get misgendered almost every day by at least one of my friends who knows my preferred pronouns and I understand that I look and sound masculine because I'm AMAB but sometimes it feels like they're not even trying. I can only correct them so many times and then I start thinking that I'm the problem. I love when people use my preferred pronouns especially when so many people get it wrong, it feels like the ones who get it right actually care about me but sometimes I wonder if this even makes sense in the grand scheme of things. The idea of coming out to people always scares the shit out of me and it's even worse when I have to correct them and I'll pretty much be doing that for the rest of my life. Sometimes suffering in silence just seems easier.	"> I can only correct them so many times and then I start thinking that ~~I'm the problem~~ they're a toxic person because they know using the wrong pronouns for me actively harms me and they do it anyway.

Fixed that for you.
I 100% get how you feel. I keep getting misgendered by my mother in law and she stopped correcting herself and that got rough. I am fine if you correct yourself, but you know what bothers me that isn't necessarily their fault? I know they still see me as a man even if I'm not.

But you know what made me feel SO much better lately? I've been doing makeup and getting dressed up and now people might not default to he/him and question it! It really gave me a lot of euphoria just to have makeup on, and now I have a breast form and gaff and I'm going to go out with my wife as a woman and I feel like I can finally be me and be seen without people just seeing a cis man by default. We're going to go out to dinner as a cute lesbian couple and my wife is super supportive and even thinks I look hot dressed up. It feels so fucking good.

I don't know if you want to do the same, but I'd consider it. Misgendering hurts me the most because it's like, I know they're just trying to be polite but if they misgender me so much, it's just clear they see a man, and I don't want that to be the case anymore. Being more obviously trans does help that quite a lot. It's scary, but it helps.

Express however you want and you're still 100% valid NB, but that helped me.
The ones that are trying do genuinely care for you, but we are all humans and make mistakes, and that's ok! I misgender people often despite being she/they myself, so it's ok. We all grew up in heteronormativity and at least for me, I wasn't out and understanding of myself until I was 31y, so I have 30+ years of change, and that's ok! 

People will pick it up, just have patience and be proud you have people that try, cuz some people don't
I have a tip for you! If your friends are people you want to keep in your life but keep fucking up pronouns, I would explain this to them: 

""Please don't just use my pronouns when you're speaking to or about me. Try changing them *in your mind.* So now you're thinking ""oh, I'm going to pick up a coffee for THEM"" or ""I love THEM."" Not translating from ""he"" in your brain. It helps a lot, and it means so much to me!""

If they're only speaking it (and obviously failing) they need to work on their /interior narrative/ of you. It's how I've dealt with name and pronoun changes among my friends and family, and it works wonders (if they actually try)

My best to you, friend. I hope they work on it. You absolutely deserve it.
Nah. 

People pretend pronouns are hard so they don't have to do the work. 

Keep prioritizing yourself. The good ones will figure it out.
It gets better. It's worth stepping into the fullness of your experience. You are loved and there are and will be people who are willing to get it right for you. Just because it matters to you.
Suffering in silence, as you said, has been a recourse of mine for too many years now. I've found in the couple of days since I started posting here that I already feel a little better about myself, and I really hope it helps you as well. Our loved one's seeming lack of care can be devastating. Please remember there are people in the world who will always love and accept you for who you are, and finding them IRL can be difficult, but they're out there somewhere ready to love you. Best of luck to you and everyone else 💙🌈❤
I know how you feel 

I've posted in my class group chat about it twice and the only person who actually uses they/them is my Lecturer! (Of all people)
People who care only make that mistake a few times. If it continues to happen, they don't care or it's not an accident. 

I don't want to seem unfair, but sometimes coming out means losing a few people. It's not nice, but better than suffering in silence. I've used that strategy for over twenty years in order to keep other people comfortable and regret it.
Oh yeah. I get that feeling my sibling!

You are not the problem! Wanting to be addressed with respect is not being greedy, or attention-seeking, or pushy, or any of the other things you might have been accused of by others (or by yourself in your head, either). 

Balancing the satisfaction you get when people use the right pronouns (and if it applies, the right name) against the effort to correct people when they get it wrong can be a tough needle to thread. (Apologies to people who can’t handle mixed metaphors!) Its okay to make that call a different way each time, because sometimes the deciding factor will be how much mental energy you have to handle the potential reaction. There may well be times where for your own mental health it might be better to let it pass. 

This may sound controversial at first, but you are right when you talk about the “grand scheme of things”, and whether or not someone using the right pronouns for you really matters. There are issues that affect more people, in more immediate ways with greater potential consequences if not dealt with. But at the same time, this is an issue that you’re dealing with, and though I hope it’s not this intense for you, it potentially spikes frequently and regularly. 

Suffering in silence might work short-term, and in specific circumstances might be part of an overall strategy for handling this sort of stuff. But it would rarely if ever be a viable, permanent solution.
I have to constantly remind my parents who basically make zero effort. My mum (wrongly) argues that they/them is not grammatically correct yet when I ask her to Google it to see that it is, she refuses. It's so infuriating. Even if it was, grammar is just a bunch of rules we made up, and thus could be changed.

You're not the problem. You don't have preferred pronouns, they are your personal pronouns. You are not a 'he' and to refer to you as such is as insulting as if you called them womanly, or implied to a woman that she's manly. Gender obviously means a lot to people and they should respect your personal pronouns. It does take practice but as friends they owe it to you. Heck even strangers owe it to you out of politeness and cooperation. And it's still a small effort to make. Not like we're asking for the moon 🌙
I relate so much. I didn’t have any in-person friends (except one) who would gender me correctly until I moved back to my hometown and made friends with other trans people. I spent so much time and energy trying to get my cis friends back then to gender me correctly. So much patience and love and understanding poured into people who couldn’t reciprocate.

I didn’t realise how much it messed with my mental health until I had *some* people in my life who would gender me correctly. It made me feel invisible, invalid, and unworthy of being acknowledged. It’s NOT you. It’s them, as hurtful as that is :’( while I don’t think they’re doing it purposely, some cis people for whatever reason are not able make the effort to relate to your situation and needs. That’s not on you, and there’s no problem in you having those very valid needs.

Over time, you will befriend more and more people who gender you correctly; who don’t make a big deal about you changing your name; who celebrate every step you take in your gender journey. A person being able to gender you correctly will become a basic deciding factor for who you decide to spend time with. It will get better, and when you have these people, you will feel so much euphoria around simply being seen.

Your feelings are valid. Your exhaustion is valid. Your identity is important and fantastic. I see you. I’m sending you hugs. 💜
As a “masculine” amab enby I hear exactly where you’re coming from, solidarity to you friend. We are just as valid as everyone else even if it feels like we’re left in the dark.
I am also amab and constantly misgendered, it’s so exhausting and I’m so tired of having to correct everyone. I used to be worried that people would get annoyed that I keep correcting them but I’m starting to not give a shit loll. Like damn just get our pronouns right!!
I'm an enby with a very feminine voice and body shape. I've never been misgendered by my friends without them correcting themselves immediately. If a person is actually your friend, they will try and show they're trying.
You're not the problem. They are the problem for making you feel like you're the problem.
I really relate to you, and I hope this will get better with some time. I think it is really hard for people to change their habits and the pronouns they use for you, and myself i'm not sure how fast i could get used to using a new pronouns for a friend (even though in my head i'm like well i changed my pronouns and use they/them now so that wouldn't be so hard to change the pronouns i use for somebody else).  
The other thing that bothers me is that I kinda feel like other people still see me as my AGAB, whereas I want them to see me just as a human being.

Anyway, I send you all my love and support <3
Feel this big time, but you’re def not the problem <3
Absolutely understand this. Honestly, maybe you need better friends who understand how important this is to you. Most of my closest friends are trans now. 🤷🏻
I'll agree with you. It can be extremely difficult especially when you start using different pronouns that people aren't used to using when referring to you. I wear a pronoun pin and even though i haven't had anyone say anything about it yet, i feel better knowing that it's there to tell people so that way I don't have to struggle to tell them myself until I'm comfortable.
Well done for stepping out in the first place. Not all of us have the courage. But what you're doing makes it a little easier for the person after you, and for the person after them. And people like you are also taking a bit of the difficulty off me, as well.

If you wanted to be more insistent with friends, then that's something I'd not just admire but be in awe of.
I feel you 😔

Thankfully some of my friends got used to it after a while
😂😂😂 thank you ❤️
I think it’s also valid to draw boundaries. While we can give people chances to learn, there’s a point where we should also protect ourselves and our well-being 💜
Feel you 💜 we deserve to have boundaries and expectations. They’re not unreasonable even though cis people often paint them that way. We don’t have to have dramatic breakups with people who misgender us consistently— we can slowly, quietly step away from them. :)
Sounds like your mum is just using grammar as an excuse and she knows it. I hope she grows up a bit about it. 💕

You deserve better just like OP and all the rest of us.
Alot of people have been commenting about finding friends that gender them correctly and understand them on that level. I definitely need to look into that 😂😂😂. Thank you 💜
Thanks🥰 also I know exactly how you feel. Seeing any queer person able to express themselves fully always makes me admire them so much. They're my heroes 😭
🥲💜 unfortunately it takes time. I’m glad you found this subreddit. It helped me feel seen! I just wanted especially to emphasise that it’s not you, and there’s nothing wrong with how you feel ✨
A friend I’ve had since our early teens was frank with me from the start that she was gay, and that she came out to everybody early on because she wanted to be that precedent for others who found the coming out process as daunting as she did, or worse. Even as a kid she was determined that those who came after her would have it easier. Ever since she has been the most formidable ally to everyone she has known, everyone LGBT+ in need, and those who just want company. It’s that sort of thing innit? We’ve always lived far away, but I’m excited to next see her again and come out to her too."	sb0olo	NonBinary	233	1.0	2022-01-23 18:48:25
I have covid😓 but at least I won't get misgendered for two weeks while I'm out of work		"""I see this as absolute win!""

But seriously, hope you get well soon
ayeee I got covid too, good luck my friend :)
Work is where I'm misgendered most I hate it but I don't wanna correct cause I work with a bunch of antiscience anti intellectual kooks 😅 my days off are even more amazing cause there's no one around to invalidate me
Aye covid buddies!!!! I'm right there with you! Lol
Big mood. My partner and I had it a few weeks ago and felt much the same
Oh y’all still getting two weeks? Hope you feel better!
I'm jelly of your piercings
At least you looking stunning
Get well soon!! ☺️
P.S: This pic gives me gender envy 🙈
Loll and bless, thank you:)
Hope both of you have a speedy recovery!
I hope your symptoms aren't too overwhelming and I hope you have a swift recovery !
My job isn't following guidelines and just sends us out for 2 weeks and thank you!!
That's so sweet😊🧡😊🧡😊🧡
Bless thank you! And I understand completely, took my job a while to use my given name
Jealous of your job."	sfxn71	NonBinary	232	1.0	2022-01-30 01:46:22
why do places ask your pronouns if they don’t use them?	"I’m in college and most of the university services (specifically the counseling center) puts a big emphasis on pronouns. Because of this, I started telling them I use they/them exclusively (i technically use they/she but no one will correctly gender me if i allow she/her). Every counselor I’ve met with has she/her’ed me regardless and it’s annoying me! Today the counselor at least went back and corrected himself on the forms he was filling out for me, but I’m so confused why places even ask if they don’t really try. 

On top of that issue, I always get misgendered* throughout the day in my classes. I’m extremely uncomfortable when it comes to correcting people, so I don’t know what to do 😰 I don’t expect people to know my gender immediately, but damn y’all. Point of this rant, it sucks more to be misgendered when places specifically ask! 

* I guess it’s not technically misgendering since I still let people use she/her, but I really dislike being referred to as if I’m a girl."	"> why do places ask your pronouns if they don't use them?

It's virtue signalling.

> I guess it’s not technically misgendering

It absolutely is misgendering. You are entirely allowed to have different versions of yourself that you use in different social contexts. A random stranger on the street calling me ""babe"" is very different from my partner calling me ""babe"". If your pronouns are they/them in that context, and they aren't using they/them in that context, that is absolutely 100% misgendering. You deserve better.
I unfortunately deal with this a lot myself as well, in the college setting as well. I’m amab, she/they socially but just they/them at work. Pronouns clearly shown in email signatures and everywhere official I can list them. I even wear a they/them pin but still get he/him’s, not to mention I’m pretty femme presenting most days, but my voice is still too deep for people to say otherwise I guess. Thankfully my few very close colleagues are good about it but it sucks otherwise. You would hope, in a college setting, things would be different.
Hi! I'm nonbinary and happen to be a diversity consultant for small-medium businesses. I can help!

It's part of diversity strategies put into place by HR and/or diversity and inclusion departments. Loads of questionnaires or diversity roadmaps include asking for pronoun and other identifying info to help with diversity metrics and inclusion practices. However, the people receiving said paperwork may or may not be on board with such initiatives and ignore the pronouns.

There's a huge disconnect between front-end workers and corporate strategists. Unfortunately, unless complaints are filed, diversity officers would have no idea that the pronouns are being ignored. As far as they know, their company has great inclusion practices.
I went to a climbing gym that was “very inclusive” on my intake for it asked for pronouns (they/them) and the worker teaching my friend and myself KEPT calling us “ladies” and “girls” and “women” (she is she/her) but like if y’all pride yourselves on being inclusive and a safe space, maybe like take a second to learn someone’s pronouns?
It's virtue signaling. Like those people who claim to be up-to-date on the LGBTQIA+ community but still insist the ""A"" is for ally.
Updating policy to ask for pronouns is easy. Actually remembering and using them takes consistent individual efforts.

Most importantly, administration gets to pat itself in the back for enacting progressive policy whether it’s actually carried through or not. Thats the real priority here.
Seriously I was about to post similar question. Last year my job did this big inclusivity training, so I decided to put my pronouns (they/them) in my email signature as advised in the training.
It's nearly a year later and precisely 0 people gendered me correctly. I work from home and most of the communication is done via email so they see my signature multiple times a day. 😮‍💨
Either virtue signaling or one/a few people worked hard to get those changes implemented for forms etc, but no matter how much you change on paper you can’t force people to actually pay attention to it.
Asking easy, gets LGBTQ points. Maintaining giving a shit hard, no reward.
I feel that in my soul I got misgendered after filling out a form and filled in the nb option.
It's the same like most companies do with recycling. Do the literal minimum, don't follow true, but do have a place to point at for your inclusivity.

I would honestly try to bring this up with either your counselors or other general university staff. Just in a ""Hey, I noticed that you guys kind of often forget the pronouns, could you maybe try to remember them or not ask it at all so I know that I will be agab'ed)
If someone isn’t respecting your pronouns anonymously complain. They’ll probably start trying cuz they don’t wanna lose their job (though rn with the lack of teachers they might never)
Oh boy do I feel this frustration. I was recently asked to write a bio for myself at work and I did so using only they/them/theirs or my name in the text and added “they/them” to my email signature. The bio was sent for editing and the person who reviewed it (a manager, though not mine) changed one of the places where I’d used my name to “she.” I had to ask they correct it. 

And not a single thing has changed with how people refer to me, despite nearly all my work interactions taking place over email and people seeing my signature constantly. I was still addressed in an email as a “lady” by a cis person with “she/her” in her signature. Infuriating. 

I also feel deeply uncomfortable with correcting people and allow a variety of pronouns outside of work with friends and family and I feel like fraud for that sometimes. At work is where I experience the most aggressive gendering though so it feels like I really have to explicitly push back against it which is so uncomfortable.
I'm so glad someone said this.
I relate to every aspect of this. I'm also technically a she/they because I'm fine with old friends and such calling me she, but that's with people I know respect my gender. In situations like work where I've specifically told people they/them or they just assume ""she"" I get annoyed. Really it is misgendering because I haven't told them that's an OK word for me. They're not ""she/they-ing"" me like my friends, they're just seeing me as a woman.

Also I hate pronoun circles. ""Let's be inclusive by forcing everyone to out themselves in rooms full of strangers!"" smh
*virtue signaling* also I hate it too, I use they/them exclusively and very very few people respect that.
In my state, some state-funded businesses (mostly Non-profits) require pronouns be put in email signatures. For some places - it could be a legal mandate. For others, it really could be trying to look good on paper, but that place (your college in this case) doesn't provide training or have policies in place to express to the staff that someone's gender identity is important and should be respected
Sometimes it’s company policy but the people don’t care. It’s the same thing at my work. Legally and in the company policy I have the right to express myself and use my pronouns and students ESPECIALLY have this privilege. In reality I work at a public school in a small city in the Bible Belt and all my coworkers are LGBT-phobic. I could report them for harassment for myself cause there’s a whole deal of “it doesn’t have to target you” and whatever but I have no support and I’m not gonna test my luck. They kicked a boy out of our classroom for wearing eyeliner, screamed at him until he cried, and forced him to wash it off. This boy was not breaking any rules but my coworkers (teachers and paras) didn’t care they just didn’t like it.

On the flip side I recently changed salons and the new place has you put your pronouns on this “new customer” sheet and my stylist slipped and said “she” then immediately corrected herself with “they” and she never misgendered me after.
In most of those people's lives, you're not as important as you are to your friends, and they will forget your pronouns, especially if you present femme. The only way to improve this is to correct them, even if it makes you uncomfortable.
Only reason that comes to mind: a progressive face on the school, basically they get to say “we are inclusive”
Basically, that's me as an amab. I got to the point where i let people misgender me and where i introduce myself as a male to keep things simple.

I look like a non binary person anyway and my identity is something i feel like a personal experience where i want to be authentic with MYSELF.
Enforce it wherever you go.

It's pointless virtue signalling. I hate it.
I feel so seen by this post and the comments.
Buy a pin or Keychain something that can always be seen I bought a pronoun necklace, it hasn't arrived yet but I'll tell you how it works out
I was told my pronouns are bad in a gender clinic :)
Literally just this. Colleges want to look perfect from the outside, so they implement policies that look good, like asking your pronouns. Once that is done, though, they've checked their boxes and moved on. 

Once it comes to interacting with staff, some of these people have been working for the institution for longer than you've been alive. They don't give a damn about you or your pronouns. You're just going to shuffle in, stay for four years (less if you drop out), and shuffle out. They get your tuition dollars whether they treat you with respect or not.
The irony(?) is that it's a borderline zero-calory kind of virtue signalling, and yet some individuals treat it like they're passing a kidney stone.
What they/them pin do you wear on the daily, and where do you wear it if you don’t mind sharing? I’m trying to figure out how to navigate this in the wider world.
Yes. Our local health system has an option for nonbinary in their gender section in the online portal (no spot for pronouns, but still) & I'm 95% sure at least at my last doctor they didn't even glance at it. I know nonbinary doesn't necessarily mean a certain set of pronouns, but you'd think seeing that might give at least a clue to ask, or that I might not want to be referred to as my agab pronouns??
yes same! the she/her in my pronouns is primarily for my friends and family who i feel comfortable around. and i agree about pronoun circles! i’m oftentimes the only non-binary one in the room so it draws awkward attention towards me. i’m also in the south so it’s not always safe for me to be non-binary 🥲
So I wear a lanyard everyday with my work badge and I have the pin on the straps of the lanyard. It’s just a little green pin that says They Them Theirs.
Here's the one I have - [they/them pin](https://dissentpins.com/products/pronoun-pin?utm_source=www.google.com&utm_medium=referral&variant=32372811235408&sfdr_ptcid=15655_4_621386473&sfdr_hash=4a6e4244da22b9d30bda73858ff55b5d&gclid=CjwKCAiA9NGfBhBvEiwAq5vSy7k8X0KGJkSgmT_aAIFwr3jmMsEMegNW1_6VArCHstEeOyTanSiNexoCSnkQAvD_BwE)
Thank you for sharing!! This is the problem I’m running into. I don’t wear a lanyard so that’s not an option for me, so other than pinning it to my shirt everyday I don’t know how else to do this. It feels like sandpaper over my skin when I get misgendered but not sure what other options I have. Never have I so wished to live in the world Everina Maxwell created where it’s a galactic constant to be able to show gender preference (if one chooses) through displaying something as simple as a glass, flint, or wood ornament somewhere visible to others; and it’s instinct to look for the markers to know how to properly refer to people.
if you still wear a mask, you can get pronoun masks or pin a pronoun pin to it. or if you’ll remember, you can just pin one to your shirt every day. maybe look around on etsy to see if anyone sells them with those strong magnetic back so you aren’t poking holes in things?

edit: [here](https://www.etsy.com/listing/1070164231/) is a listing i found on etsy for magnetic name tags + pronouns (the shop has some other styles available too!)

edit 2: if you work in a more professional place, [here](https://www.etsy.com/listing/523921496/) is a super sleek and professional magnetic pronoun nametag!
I wear a they/them pin and I just pin it to my shirt when I go out! I’m still misgendered even though the pin is *right in their face* but I do have the occasional polite people.

I also got a custom pin made from etsy with a little hyena on it :)"	117o9bm	NonBinary	233	0.99	2023-02-20 23:35:57
Got my pronouns airbrushed on a hat during an event on my campus and now there's no excuse for misgendering me		"unless someone is a lot shorter than you and can't see the hat :p
My fiance met someone recently that had ""THEY/THEM"" knuckle tattoos, and I think it might be worth it to get knuckle tattoos now.
Some idiot will still probably go ""Oh, I see, (wrongpossessivepronoun) pronouns are they/them!"" x.x

Cool hat though! ❤
The cis will find a way
Okay badass move. Respect ✊🏻
Those glasses are dope.
Unfortunately, despite the fact that you look great, there are still horribly shitty people out there which, unfortunately, is somewhat of an excuse.

Being Nonbinary sucks. I deal with dysphoria, i'm misgendered all the time.... Nobody uses my correct pronouns.... I was feeling down, so I decided to draw myself in a way that I hope will be me in the future, what I aspire to be..... Free and Happy to be Me.

((also, i grew up in a shitty little mountain town where no one used my pronouns- i’m 25 now and everyone i’m friends with does 98% of the time (sometimes they forget but get right back to it after a reminder!) and so does most of my fam jam. that future you’re hoping for may not be as far off as you think 💛✨))
Hi misgendered all the time, I’m dad. (And I’m very proud of you)
Lovely!! Now that you've conceived the image of your future self, it is the first step to materializing it :) Wish you the best in your journey!

I’m really sorry to hear that you have to deal with dysphoria and misgendering. It really does suck. Also, great job on the artwork. I am actually kinda jealous.

Top surgery allowed me to no longer melt down after being misgendered- I feel good in my skin and just confused when people don’t see me		"You look so handsome!
absolutely feel this - congrats!

Im happy everything went well and you feel better. Looking good too hoelong oafter the surgery if you want to answer, no pressire or need just intressted
I never understood why top surgery always leave scars. Because I can't believe that it is Impossible to remove Booba without leaving scars
You look amazing!!
Thank you 🥰
Thank you ❤️❤️❤️❤️
Thank you!
I had my surgery 10 weeks ago I think? I am basically completely healed but my skin is still kind of settling- I had periareolar and the sutures can take a long time to dissolve. The suture they use to make the main closure (called the purse string suture) that went around my areolas made them have a kind of odd shape. They are finally flattening out tho. People who have other approaches ( most commonly double incision that runs the length of the breast across the persons chest) would have kinda different experiences.
Some peoples scars are really minimal, especially with scar care and if you are genetically lucky. Scaring is caused because when your body heals, different type of tissue bridges the pieces together than the original type so it looks different. Over time it can be replaced with tissue more similar to the original tissue, but this has a limit.

I had peri-areolar surgery so I only have scars around my areolas.
Thank you so much!!

My child keeps getting dead named by a teacher.	"My child (12 afab) came out as NonBinary this year and we (the parents) couldn't be more proud of them. We still mess up on pronouns but very rarely, and almost never use their old name. This goes for MOST of the extended family as well but, this isn't about them. The problem is that they have one teacher who deliberately dead names and misgenders them. They'll say things out loud when grading papers like, ""Chosen Name? I don't have a Chosen name in this class. I do have a Dead Name though."" Then the teacher makes them erase and write their dead name. My child is really upset about this and I need to know what kind of steps that we (the parents) can take when confronting the school about it. Because if I don't have a solid plan then I think I'll just get passionately angry and get nothing done. This is a Texas public school if that helps any. Also, this seems to be the only teacher to do this, they have friends and other teachers who are very understanding. 

Anyone have any advice?

Edit for grammar"	"As a teacher, I'm sorry they can't treat your child like a human. Check with your local district about school policies. Texas is so red, I wouldn't be surprised if there are no protections in place for trans kids. I'd recommend asking to be moved to a different class if possible. When you talk to the school, if trans kids *aren't* protected, don't even bring that up. Tell them that their deadname has a lot of trauma attached to it and hearing it brings them down. Mention that the teacher refuses to use the chosen name, thus making it difficult for the student to feel comfortable and welcome.
Your child should (covertly) record every interaction with this person, and maybe even ask them point blank why they are being so discourteous. Get their bigotry on record. Texas is a one-party state meaning only one party in the conversation has to know about/consent to the recording, and that can be the person doing the recording. Document everything.
Go through the process of getting your child’s legal name changed? If this is the name that’s gonna stick, make it official. Beyond that, maybe request a parent/teacher conference with this particular teacher and the school principal.
I used to work in the education environment and some people shouldn’t be teachers. Even if you can get the teacher to stop dead naming them, they’ll probably lash out if they get in the slightest bit of trouble. It’s best to see if there’s another teacher teaching the same class and transferring them to the class. Side note, thank you for supporting your kid. 🥺
Contact administration and let them know what's going on. If they don't want to help, make it clear that you'll escalate this issue to wherever it needs to go. Go to the local media if you have to. They may be interested in a hateful teacher who is way behind the times.

I would also tell your child that they have your permission to ignore any mention of their dead name, and to only answer to their chosen name. If it leads to a call home, double down and insist that you will not allow your child to be punished for being discriminated against.
I'd go to the school counselor. Though there may be nothing they can do seeing as it is Texas...
As a teacher, I'm so sorry your child has to deal with this. This is unprofessional and awful. Firstly, if you have not yet, communicate to the teacher. Explain how they are making your child feel and that you support and they should as well. If you want a reply, specify that you would like one.
If the teacher continues this after you complain, complain to the principal.
Be prepared to complain regularly. Be prepared to fight for your child. They need your support in ensuring their school is safe for them.
As a teacher (in a Texas public school even) this makes me so furious for your child. I would 100% send them an email asking them to explain why they cannot offer the slightest bit of respect for your student. 
If they argue back about ""well that's not their legal name"", ask if they've ever had a student go by a nickname and if they've respected that. I've got students that go by initials (ex using my name instead of C*** J, going by CJ), students that go by shortened versions of their names (Joe instead of Joseph, Sam instead of Samuel or Samantha), and students who just prefer a different name (one of my students goes by a name that's not anywhere else in their name). If the teacher respects any of those names, they can respect your child's name. 
If they continue being a bother, send another email with the principal and counselor CC'd on the email. If possible, ask about switching classes. 
This makes my blood boil and I am so sorry your family is having to deal with this. I wish more teachers were able to pull their heads out of their butts long enough to see they're harming those they're supposed to be helping.
[deleted]
Strong agree! And when you begin the conversation with the administration, mention how wonderful the other school personnel have been, and that it is just this one bad apple you need to confer about.
OP even if you decide not to record their bigotry definitely get a record/paper trail. (I am not an expert in this field after all I am a “younger” adult.)
when the school calls home to say ""Dead Name was given detention for ignoring their teacher"" you can respond with ""Dead Name? I don't have a Dead Name. I do have a Chosen Name though.""
If you want to protect trans kids, please never make a point about them changing their name too much for poor cisgendered people to possibly feel comfortable using. Ever. 

This teacher doesn’t need a fucking name tag. This teacher needs to be fired. There is a difference.
My point was that there are cisgendered educators who are making the effort and are walking on eggshells trying not to do harm. That’s obviously not the case here. My name tag idea was something that I personally would have done….had being non-binary and knowing that the name changing option existed when I was in middle school. You can disagree, but it’s me putting myself in this kids shoes 🤷‍♀️. Maybe I didn’t present it clearly enough, but it was early here"	qvg5jr	NonBinary	223	1.0	2021-11-16 19:40:08
Got “misgendered” at the grocery store	So I’m amab who hasn’t cut their hair in over a year so it’s getting somewhat long, like 9 or so inches. Anyways I went grocery shopping and while checking out I got called ma’am. As someone who is questioning a lot and probably somewhere around femme leaning non-binary it was the highlight of my day. Wasn’t even trying to look femme whatsoever but between the mask, the hat and my colorful canvas bags guess they thought I was a girl. Have no where else to share the small victory but here. Enjoy y’all’s day and keep being awesome	"I’m the same as you, AMAB NB with long hair, and while I would rather people didn’t misgender me at all, I do get a strange sense of euphoria when I’m misgendered as a woman.
Eeeeeeeyyyy, that's really cool! Very happy for you!
Sound like you got less misgendered than usual, at least! Progress 💞. I live in the south so I feel I will never escape being ma’amed, because it’s just “polite” to use sir and ma’am constantly.
haha I'm glad this is such a universal experience! I'm AFAB nonbinary, but DEFINITELY nonbinary, and instead of long fem hair after coming out I've been wearing short hair since (though I've always preferred it.) I also just happen to look way more masculine than I used to, it does feel nice when I'm assumed as a male. In some weird sense, it feels like it cancels out the invalidation of what I was born as?? lol
i relate to this.

a good while ago i was at the grocery store and got called a young girl. loved it.
I’m so happy for you 😊
Ahhhhhhh, Im so happy for you!
Wish I got this. Non-binary transwoman here and still get “Sir’d” at the grocery store check out. Even with a mask on. I haven’t changed my wardrobe yet so between that and a lack of boobs that’s likely why, BUT, I have been ma’am’d a few times. Such euphoria.
Ahhh, the weird happiness of ""at least they're not seeing me as my AGAB"" when they get it wrong 😂
Same. I can’t tell if that means I’m more on the femme side? or just it feels nice to not be gendered as a man? Idk
Yeah, same here too. I'm not a girl but if someone thinks I am that means they didn't think I was a guy
I mean I don’t mind being called ma’am, I quite like it but yeah I’m a fellow southern sibling and just sorta waiting until I move further north to put serious effort into transitioning
Hard same. If people are gonna get it wrong, ""ma'am"" or she/her are closer to being right than he/him is
I don’t know either. At the moment I’m using agender, as it fits me best, but I have wondered if maybe demigirl might be an option if I do move closer to the femme side of things."	p1bgtf	NonBinary	223	1.0	2021-08-09 21:54:41
Being non-binary working in a call center sucks... idk how many times a day I get called “ma’am” or receive misgendered emails (regardless of my signature having pronouns listed) or ones addressed to a group as “Hey Ladies” 🙄🤦🏻🤢		"I FEEL YOU. I don’t work in a call center, but I am most uncomfortable about my voice. At my new job location there are people who will address groups I’m in with “excuse me ladies” or “hey ladies” and it just makes me cringe to my core. 

Hang in there friend! As a side note- you glasses are super cool
bruh same it happens so often that it’s happening even in my lucid dreams now. at least there i have the courage to yell at them
I once got petty AF and after receiving a multitude of emails from someone at a partnering agency who, \*\*every time they emailed me\*\* got my name and/or title misspelled, missing, or wrong, included all of mine in large letters (I usually only include part of it as not all my certs, etc, are relevant), spelled out completely. 

I hope your day improves. <3
As dysphoric as I feel in person with any gender expression, voice is impossible to hide and very hard to change.
Idk what it is about it but being called ma'am is the worst of all for me🥴🤮
The 'Good evening/hello/a question for you ladies' bullshit is *ALL OVER* every single crafting group on Facebook. It's gotten so annoying I've considered starting my own damned group where one of the rules is you *absolutely don't do that*, but I ain't got the energy for that.

I can *usually* choke down someone saying 'maam' but 'lady' just makes my damn teeth itch.
You're rocking those round glasses!
[deleted]
I feel you here as well! I've been taken off calls and am in a different position now but there's a group of cis men that I work with who complain about being ma'am'd all the time and once created a group chat ""Ma'ams Of \*company name\*"" and then ranted about how horrible and awful it was having such feminine voices. It made me so uncomfortable I reported it to my boss and he took it down within an hour. They specifically excluded me from the group but included one cis female who had been 'sir'd once. Call centers are wild!
How can they know when they hear a females voice?
I appreciate you and hope your work situation gets better too!
Yeess!! I die a little more inside each time. Like I get you’re trying to be polite and all, but you could call me sir and I would be much happier. 

One person actually did say sir and then apologized and I was like no no, you’re just fine, thank you!
Ugh, yes! Even if I were a woman, lady just sounds offensive almost! I am not some “dainty little lady”
🥰 thank yoouu
Well I wish you luck if/when you do have the courage and safety to freely be yourself with them!
Damn, how messed up. Good for you for standing up and saying something though!
Don’t make assumptions based on the pitch of someone’s voice? 🤷🏻 Use gender neutral terms or just don’t say ma’am or sir in general; just answer the questions yes or no... I get people are trying to be polite by saying ma’am or sir but when you’re continually misgendering someone multiple times per call, it’s not okay.
Right? I am 195 pounds of anxiety-riddled brick shithouse, *sir*, not some extra from the set of a Jane Austen Netflix drama.
Im not saying whats right or wrong, im just saying people are not ""educated"" in that subject and its not assuming, its just black or white for most of them. Dont take it as personal insult, its just gonna take your energy for nothing. I think youre just gorgeous btw, however you see yourself. :)
They’re still making an assumption, whether they choose to be educated about trans/non-binary people or not. We exist and therefore the gender binary of strictly male and female cannot.
I appreciate you sharing your view point (and compliments) but I’m still unfortunately going to be upset every time I’m misgendered or ma’amed 🤷🏻 People should educate themselves on these issues just a tad, it’s really not that hard."	lsg5rv	NonBinary	210	1.0	2021-02-25 20:33:19
Dad being weird about pronouns	"I'm sure we've all heard the song and dance when you come out as nonbinary to someone and they are okay with it and are absolutely terrible about using gendered language. My father does it constantly where he will misgender me and I'll correct him and he'll apologize and then not change a single thing. First of all, I'm used to it but second of all, when people do this it really feels like they just don't care at all about respecting you as a person. Whatever, that's not the point. 

The other day my dad was on the phone and referred to me as his daughter (:/) and I asked him to call me his kid, or his child, or even something weird like offspring. His only response was asking me if instead he could call me his ""XX child."" I asked ""Why would you ever do that?"" and he said that it's important to clarify. What? Why do the people you are talking to need to know my genitals? It makes me feel like he's trying to find workarounds so he can still think of me as my AGAB. It really feels like ""Oh! Instead of misgendering you, I'll just be super specific about your sex!"" NO THAT'S NOT ANY BETTER! He just makes me feel really weird when he does stuff like that. He's also one of those people that is like ""They/Them is plural and not grammatically incorrect so I want to use different pronouns"" Literally cope. Literally seethe. I do not care father."	"My dad calls me daughterson. It's an interesting way to go about it, at least.

I hate the people who claim they/them is plural only. Did they not pass third grade grammar? And we really shouldn't have to look at constant misgendering and go ""this is normal.""
If it were me, I’d ask him why he feels the need to tell other people about my genitals and tell him it feels like he’s inappropriately sexualizing me. What reason would people have to know what’s in your pants if not for sexualization?
i just had this argument with my mom last night.

she said she would respect me as nonbinary if i respected her 'as a parent on this earth' okay

today im gonna propose 'X yr old'. My 20 yr old. My 30 yr old. My 49 y/o

if she doesnt go for this, im gonna give up and tolerate 'daughter' for now. Better than her saying 'my baby girl' i guess
Grammatically speaking, they is used as a singular all the time. For example, “I’m going to my friends show tonight.”
“Ooo what kind of music do they play?”

Serious kudos to you for your patience though, I’ve not even discussed pronouns with my parent for fear of this obstacle.
My dad is almost exactly like yours. He tried to compliment me the other day by saying, “you’re my wonderful daughter”, and I told him, “thank you, but I’m your child, not your daughter”. And he just  laughed it off??? My parents keep using female gendered terms towards me and also refuse to use they/them for the grammar reason. When I came out to them, I told them that I’m fine with all pronouns only because I know that people will make mistakes and that’s ok. I said my preference is they/them or he/him, but they’re exploiting the loophole to still only use she/her. I need to talk to both of them again because it feels like they’re trying to ignore the fact that I’m non-binary and continue life as usual. They claim to be progressive and accepting of me but it doesn’t feel like they actually do.
Set boundaries. He can talk to you the right way, or he can stop talking to you. I don’t know if you’re still living with him, but if you move out you can cut him off entirely until he learns to act right. 

If your still living with him, only go on outings/occasions with the rest of the family, ask “is dad going? If he is then I’ll stay home.” 

It’s a boundary, if he can’t respect that then he can’t respect you.

Or call him “the guy who came in my mom,” “my mom’s baby-daddy,” “Greg and he has erectile dysfunction,” etc.

In public.
I bet he uses singular they/them all the time without even realising
This will be my Dad 100%, and frankly I will never come out to the man because I literally do not care about him. I have so little energy these days, I'm not wasting a single precious drop of it.
… but he’s factually incorrect about they/them being only plural… in fact singular use of “they” was first recorded in like 1375… 

https://www.merriam-webster.com/words-at-play/singular-nonbinary-they

https://public.oed.com/blog/a-brief-history-of-singular-they/
My dad thought that nonbinary meant i was a trans man and told me “You’ve always been a girl, you never wanted to be a boy” and I was like “Yeah??? I know??” and had to explain the difference between Nonbinary and Trans to him, lol. Both parents know I’m enby and queer but neither one really acknowledges it :/
My dad also does this; I cut him slack because English is his third language and the others don’t use gendered pronouns at all but it do sting a bit…..
I came out as a NB for some people, like my sister or some friends. They were very good about it, and also they asked me about pronouns. I told them to use as they want to. I don't care if they will mix it or change during conversation or one day use she/her and another he/his or they (to be honest in Poland which I come from it's difficult to call someone they/them), but it is possible to not use pronouns at all which is the best option for me
That's a pretty obscure super power; being able to know someone's chromosomes by looking at them.  /s

To boil you down to genetics when referring to you is....wow.  That's a new level of gross.
It is odd considering when you don't know someone's gender you use they/them and you never hear these people questioning that.
I love ""daughterson""! I've been looking for a gender neutral term for my parents to use FOREVER. Child and kid both make it sound like I'm actually, you know, a child.
My mother who is a retired teacher made this argument, and when I pointed out the obvious stupidity, she just kinda shoved it off and pretended like it didn’t make any sense. I know she knows better.
It’s a unitary classification. Not sure it has any meaning about sexuality here. You’d not say the same if it was son rather than daughter
That's a good idea. People say things like, ""My six-year-old stuck a Lego up his nose today."" Why not, ""My twenty-seven-year-old just got a new job,""? 🙂
Just proposing in case you haven't tried but what about ""my \[adj\] \[name\]""? My little \[name\] said this, my baby \[name\] sth sth, my \[name\] did that too. Also it might be worth making it clear it's not about respecting you as nonbinary it's about respecting you period. Idk, good luck though :/
I may also just call him my “XY parent”
Yeah I didn’t come out to my dad either. My mom (they are not married) told him bc she thought he would be much more respectful than he is.
This is true. I sure wish he cared about that.
Don't you know? The proper grammar for unknown gender is using he/she and his/her for everything. /s

Online I use they/them for everyone unless I check their profile/flair. It's proper grammar to use they/them for unknown gender, why not extend it to known gender that uses they/them?
I’m not sure I understand what you mean.

Facial Recognition Software Regularly Misgenders Trans People. Human computer interfaces are almost never built with transgender people in mind, and continue to reinforce existing biases.		"I DON'T want machines to read my gender!!!
This phenomenon should remind us that (1) technology is not a neutral entity and that (2) demonstrates how carefully software engineers and computer scientists need to think about their initial conditions.
I feel like a potentially easier solution is to create more categories that the program can sort people into. ie. ""Male"", ""female"", and another label, anything the program can't ascertain with x degree of certainty goes into the third category and either doesn't get labeled or gets further attention? 
Welcome to Hell Future Gender Dystopia. No, we don't have flying cars.
I've noticed that if you have your gender read once while wearing makeup and once without, you'll get completely different readings. So, yeah, this would suggest the algorithm has some inherent biases built into it. Which is consistent with the cis binary gender data sets that it would likely have been trained on. 
Wow, it's almost like hormones do something and that there is a physical basis for people's and algorithm's perception of gender?

Edit: gender and sex because they correlate really, really, really highly in the general population.

Edit, edit: I get why this is being downvoted, but seriously people are you saying that there are no visual signifiers for gender expression? Cause that is asinine. If there were no visual or behavioral signifiers, trans people wouldn't feel god damn dysphoria since no one would misgender us in the first place.

Edit, edit, edit: There is legitimate productive conversation below this. Sorry for being deliberately antagonistic and caustic.
Well, the meaty ones in our heads do all the time using basically the same feature detectors.
Totally agree. Reminds me of the problematic training data used for FaceApp when it first came out. The ""Hot"" filter was trained mostly with images of white people and so when people of color used it, it would whiten their skin tone. Software itself replicates, intentionally or unintentionally, the values of the programmer. 
An even easier solution is not building intrusive corporate surveillance networks
I mean, there's... wide world of enbies and also binary trans folk who don't medically transition. For example, there's feminine trans men who may never tick any degree of uncertainty in a machine like that.

However even if it did have a magical 100% accurate gender-reading mechanism it'd be disgusting and wrong to use it. It's extraordinarily invasive in a ""why do we now live in a sci-fi horror movie"" sense.

Edit:phrasing
Ooooh cool idea! It'd be sweet to try creating a second ML algorithm trained on trans / GNC / androgynous people, then feed photos that land in that low confidence ""other"" category you described into the second ML model. With two models you would probably get way more genders correct than if you just trained one gender model on a bunch of trans people.
Can't have your self driving flying cars without the algorithms enabling the hell future :P
uhhhhhhhh algorithms aren't made from nothing. they hold the same biases that the people who create them have. 
I get why people are downvoting this comment, being identified by your physical features really does suck and I have felt that pain before, but I actually think talking about this is a key part of a productive discussion on why machine learning algorithms misgender people. I don't think this comment was about gender essentialism at all, just that the machine learning model literally only has the person's physical characteristics to work with because all it has is a picture. Humans aren't good at telling someone's gender from a picture either, even well meaning humans; that's why we tell people to ask folks' pronouns instead of assuming! The algorithms aren't able to ask the people in the pictures about their pronouns, so they HAVE to go off of physical characteristics. Accordingly, it's important to talk about physical characteristics of trans people in order to unpack why the model performs as it does.

So please think before you downvote this. It's making for valuable discussion.
Let me rephrase:

I DON'T WANT CORPORATE SURVEILLANCE TO POKE INTO MY GENDER.
I mean that is definitely my preference as well, but that unfortunately is not the world we live in. 
But it's for your safety. /s
That's a real thing. However given that we do live in a world that has these technologies and they're unlikely to go anywhere any time soon, I feel like we should make every effort to at least not have them make people uncomfortable in any additional ways. 
That's an excellent idea, I'm not a programmer in any way shape or form but it sounds like it would work to me  
Where would we get a trans training data set large enough?

**Edit**: Just did a search and there are people already doing [this sort of research](https://www.theverge.com/2017/8/22/16180080/transgender-youtubers-ai-facial-recognition-dataset). Though data collection method not cool. Lol, and I also have to say that the research hypothesis is so outlandish as to be absurd: 

“What kind of harm can a terrorist do if they understand that taking this hormone can increase their chances of crossing over into a border that’s protected by face recognition? That was the problem that I was really investigating.""

I also noticed that the trans [data set that Ricanek collected](https://www.faceaginggroup.com/hrt-transgender-dataset/) is no longer available.
This... Isn't how machine learning algorithms work. You don't manually program in cases and exception. You provide examples and implicit similarities and patterns are determined from the training data. There can be cases where the training examples are biased intentionally, but for the most part it takes a huge amount of effort to deal with edge cases and doing so degrades the performance of the technique on typical data.
Thanks. I find it's weird though that people seem to pretend that misgendering doesn't have a basis in physical appearance given the degree of effort we put into changing our appearance...
No, we’re downvoting that comment because it’s flippant. There may be some genuine thoughtful stuff following it and it may be a discussion worth having, but I don’t want to have a discussion with a person who’s that rude to start out with. 
>The algorithms aren't able to ask the people in the pictures about their pronouns

Why not?

Okay, slightly flippant response but I wanted to highlight that there's a tendency to overfocus on technological problems/solutions around stuff like this, and underfocus on social and regulatory problems/solutions. Some ideas:

* Legally require disclosure of and consent to specific ML classifications being performed on your data

* Legally require disclosure of the results of such classifications

* Legally require the ability for the person in question to manually override these results

These ideas flow directly from existing data protection principles - that you should be able to find out what data organisations hold about you, what they do with that data, and be able to remove data, or correct it if it is wrong. 


I DON'T WANT CORPORATE SURVEILLANCE ~~TO POKE INTO MY GENDER~~

I'm just saying it's inevitable that this will hurt people in this specific way. Pushing for the reform of a technology whose very concept is broken is just choosing a different group of people to hurt.
Neither am I, but I'm totally telling a non-binary ML programmer I know. If I could assemble the photo dataset (difficult and probably creepy) and remind myself how to use Tensor Flow I could probably figure it out!
what about instances where examples are biased unintentionally? 
You're both right. It all depends on the training data and the way it's labeled.

If I fed the algorithm only pictures of cis people, then it is set up with the same biases as most people. It would almost certainly misgender them, or at least pick the wrong one with have low confidence level (for folks new to ML, it's sort of like the algorithm is saying, ""this looks a bit more like a this than a that, but I'm not so sure""). 

If, however, I fed the algorithm a bunch of examples of correctly gendered trans people, the algorithm would improve. The more examples, the better it would get. The ML model that is misgendering people probably wasn't trained enough on trans people.

Something I wonder, if you train it on a bunch of trans people, would it get worse at correctly gendering cis people? :P Sounds along the lines of what you're saying about degrading performance on ""typical"" data.
Sorry, it is a tad. I am in the process of recovering from FFS I had last week and am a bruised, swollen mess that barely even looks human :( I shouldn't be deliberately antagonistic though, even when I'm feeling salty and believe it educates people on how ML actually works and the economic incentives behind it.
Fair enough, however the productive conversation in this comment is now hidden because of the downvoting, so now people are missing out on the valuable conversation that came before folks downvoted it. 
Well, sticking to the purpose of my comment, which was discussing how machine learning models work in the context of gender recognition, if you gave permission for your photos to be run through the facial recognition model and sent your pronoun along with it... There's no point in using a gender recognition ML model.

But I get that you wanted an opportunity to bring up privacy concerns, and found this sliver of my comment a convenient place. 
I don’t want corporations.
Hey, I can get behind that at least XD But you'll have to be willing to do shit like pay for email and Discord and stuff :P
You can bet that large corporations do this. Google almost definitely knows that I am trans (whether on not they state it explicitly, it lets them advertise better to me). The effect we are seeing here is simply the result of conflating phenotype at birth with gender since the vast majority of the population uses the terms interchangeably.  You'll only really see this effect in low cost, limited scope applications like ""Faceapp"" and shit. Entities like Google and Microsoft and Amazon will integrate their data from email, search history, google photos, facial recognition, changes over time, etc to get a much more nuanced view of who I am.
Data is always biased unintentionally. It is impossible to create a truely unbiased dataset when dealing with finite quantities of training examples. For the most part these techniques are picking up real physical differences between gender expressions/sexes that get us clocked IRL :/ Of course someone could maliciously add in examples of trans people for PURPOSEFUL misgendering, but it wouldn't even work if there weren't physical differences to pick up on :/ (and doing so would be a literal shit-ton of work)
I am willing to bet that feeding examples of trans people would improve trans performance and degrade cis performance. Since ~99% of people are cis, I'm willing to bet the marginal trans benefits would be greatly outweighed without a huge degree of work on the part of the programmers. 
Well, I put in some edits. Last one apologizes for being an antagonistic POS, so hopefully it might go to less than -5 XD
>Well, sticking to the purpose of my comment, which was discussing how machine learning models work in the context of gender recognition, if you gave permission for your photos to be run through the facial recognition model and sent your pronoun along with it... There's no point in using a gender recognition ML model.

True, but ultimately I'm envisaging this being done client-side with some sort of ""personal data policy"" standard which gets sent to each website you visit (kind of like a reverse cookie). Most people's would likely say ""just run any model you like and don't bother me with specifics"", some people would say ""no gender recognition models, and my gender is X"", still others would say ""do not store or deduce my gender unless I explicitly tell you to"". The model is still useful, for all the people who don't have an issue with it being run on their images.

>But I get that you wanted an opportunity to bring up privacy concerns, and found this sliver of my comment a convenient place.

Yeah - that's all it was - sorry if it was a little out of place.


I mean, yeah, that's the real end goal there.
could this be because the original data set included a variable for ""gender"" that ended up tying physical traits to ""genders"" reinforcing that these physical traits are ""inherent"" to these ""genders""? Does the dataset create an image of ""male"" or ""female"" based on said data and matches the face to whichever one matches it ""best""? 
I would love to see that even if it screws with its original purpose :) I wonder if it would do better if given labels of both the subject's gender and whether they are trans or not. 

Thinking about human learning around trans people, I think part of being a decent not-transphobic human being is recognizing that some trans people do appear* gender non conforming, or a ""mixture"" of genders, and that when trying to figure out someone's gender you should choose certain characteristics (like hairstyle and clothes) over others (like jawline or hip width). So, if the model wasn't trained with that PRO-trans bias in mind, then the performance one way or the other would hey screwy.

*What I mean is that we've all spent a lifetime seeing very very few examples of trans people, and so our own brains are heavily biased towards categorizing by what we know of the cis binary.
really and truly this is a bullshit software that should never exist and is pretty dystopian that it does, fuck it my gender is to fuck with it anyway
Aww :)
Thanks for explaining, and for being chill about the out-of-place-ness. Is an interesting idea!
Basically. It's that sex and gender correlate to a very, very, very high degree in the general population and the algorithms pick this up. Trans people (MtF in particular) tend to have facial features which are tied to their biological sex and are not changed without surgery or early application of hormones. 
Lurk on r/transpassing XD those people have gotten so hypercritical of facial features that they regularly misgender cis people. Their ability at clocking trans people has very defiantly come at the expense of identifying cis people :P
It's is literally a side effect of training feature detectors even on unlabled data. Even without labeled training data deep learning networks produce high level neurons that highly correlate with sex and gender in the same way that they produce neurons indicating that noses go between eyes...
yeah so it's in implicit bias that gender=sex that the programmers have that creates this misgendering in the dystopian software, right? 
Haha I actually have noticed myself misgendering cis people MUCH more often since coming out and finding my trans community. I'm like, are trans people EVERYWHERE or am I just a human-learning algorithm trained on a big ass dataset of trans people? (Answer? Yes) 
is that because of the biases in the people that initially created the deep learning network though?
No, it has almost nothing to to do with the programmers. It has to to with how the data is labeled. If there are actual physical correlations they aren't ""biases"" they are real effects in the data.

If you have, in an extreme case, 100 training examples with 50 male labels and 50 female labels and two of the pictures are mislabeled, it has a very similar effect on performance as having 50 male and 50 female with 2 trans people who don't regularly pass. Both cases will degrade the performance of the algorithm. Fixing it requires hugely intensive techniques to deal with mislabeled data and outliers.
XD exactly
I misgender cis people all the fucking time now because I am so hyper critical of my own features. I know what it is about me that signifies as male and when I see those signifiers in femme presenting people it just trips those same circuits.
No. It's because noses tend to go between eyes and chromosomal sex and tends to produce physical effects which correlate highly with gender identity. You can't simultaneously have a situation where people are capable of identifying gender visually and machines can't.
but it's in issue with labeling people their ""gender"" that the programmers implicitly put in the software as a variable that exposes said biases that they have. Why is there only a ""male"" and a ""female"" label in the software to begin with? 
Who says people can identify gender? we are at a place though where neither people nor machines can identify gender since gender is locked so much step and key with biological factors to those in the general population.
The only bias would be the labels. The programmer gives the ML model virtually no guidance as to what to ""care"" about. The beauty (and problem) with machine learning is that the programmer doesn't have to teach it any concepts or ideas, just give it examples and then the model figures out patterns for itself.
We can't with 100% accuracy but we are very, good at infering based on the way the person appears/is presenting. It's the same with ML algorithms. All I am saying is that it doesn't require deliberate malice on the part of the programmers and data collectors and that fixing it is a highly, highly intensive process. If it helps, don't think of the algorithms as identifying gender, think of them as identifying phenotype or assignment at birth and that we have a social issue where these two things are conflated :/
so because it creates a ""male"" tag the machine creates an aggragaate  ""ideal""""male"" that the face is contrasted against to said machine generated image
I was never claiming it was deliberate malice but uniditified ideology of the programmers that caused these issues. 
You're pretty close, you've got the right idea! Instead of just one ""ideal"" , it's many possible arrangements of different features of the image, and yes the new picture is contrasted against the many possibilities correlated with the label(s).

For example, many ""male""-labeled images might have thick eyebrows and angular jaws. Perhaps enough examples have these things where these relationships (expressed in pixels and lots of math!) are correlated in the model with the ""male"" label.  After enough training, if you gave the model a new, unlabeled picture of a person with an angular jaw and thin eyebrows, the model wouldn't necessarily just throw it out because it doesn't match the overall ideal; the relationships can be enough for the model to piece together into the most appropriate label given what the model has been trained on.

Of course, the model has no concept of ""eyebrows"" or ""jaws"", just patterns of spatial arrangement of pixels relative to other pixels. Our brains do that PLUS all kinds of conceptual categorizing, labeling, predictions, and interesting thoughts. Our minds are amazing!

Something I find really interesting is that you can't really see a picture of the ""ideal"" the model is using, because it's really a set of many possibilities expressed in pixels, including accounting for shadows, lighting, turned heads, partial occlusion, etc. needed to do machine vision. 
And I'm saying that people are conflating an algorithm that does a good job of identifying chromosomal/pheontypical sex with the purely social construct of gender and that the programmers are introducing no more implicit biases into the systems than exist in society at large.
\*Given that the activation are usually non linear, you generally don't have a single ideal, but an effectively infinite set of ""locally optimal male faces"" (determined by labeling and so probably referring to phenotype at birth instead of gender) where any per-pixel adjustment lowers the ""maleness"" activation.
which is because of their ideological assumptions
Thanks for making this more accurate!

""Locally"" = for a certain zone in the image? Specific to a single image?
Also what does ""not linear"" mean in this case?

I love learning more about ML!
Which are no more than that of the society that produces them. And once again, its not the programmers. It's the people labeling the data and commissioning the software (and to some extent having inappropriately defined categories and ambiguity in definitions/usage related to gender).

What the learning algorithms do is produce something which is highly effective at identifying phenotypes based on physical features and then people (not necessarially the programmers) misinterpreting/misidentifying what it is the program is doing. 

As an example of how these things often go, take the adage of the net developed to detect military camo in tree-cover. In this case, the data set was biased such that all the pictures with tanks were taken on sunny days and all the pictures without tanks were taken on cloudy days. So what people though was a great piece of software for detecting camouflage failed miserably in the field and really just detected blue sky. The fault lay not with the programmers, but with the people who collected and labeled the training data (cause in this case there was nearly 100% correlation between tanks and sky and seeing sky is easier than tanks so that is all that was learned).
Nah, so imagine that you are trying to visualize an ""optimal"" male face. Where do you start? Basically you start with a reference image (or noise) and adjust each pixel so that the ""maleness"" neuron is maximized (move each pixel in the direction that causes the ""maleness"" to increase the most). But the activation of the neurons in the inbetween layers aren't a linear combo of the neurons in the layer below.

Instead of x = a + b + c for example, you might have x = erf(a+b+c)-0.5 or x = max(0, a+b+c). Basically this means that there generally isn't a unique maximally ""male"" pixel configuration but many configurations where if you change something it lowers the activation. 

So local refers to the fact that any small change to the input will make the output less ""male"" and the fact that there may be a huge number of these maxima and that some might be better than others. The globally optimal configuration is the unique configuration which maximizes the ""maleness"" (and is also a local optima). Basically the difference between being at the top of Everest and the top of a 3 foot hill: every way you move takes you lower, but one of them is way closer to space :P


your ideology can usurp itself over a society's ideology but that is the general issue with the software
Thanks! I think I get it :)

They/Them - Really tired of constantly being misgendered not only by strangers, but by people I’m close too who are fully aware of my gender. Constantly fighting the feeling of not being valid as a non-binary person because so many people call me “dude”, “man”, and “he/him” al the time.		"I dont want to diminish what you're saying but calling someone dude or man is considered gender neutral by many. Have you told them how you feel about those terms?
While it's good that we here will generally support and understand each other, the hard truth about the general public is that our kind aren't really recognised as we should be, to them gender is a binary thing set by first impressions. Shallow as people are it's how it it out there, we're 'wierdos' to them, maybe things will change over time, hopefully.
You keep being you, the world needs it! 
I'm lucky that my friends are affirming, but it's a struggle literally anywhere outside my bubble. Family, work, strangers, letters/emails, ads...


Unfortunately for us, it's like we have to choose between being educators who are hurt and mentally exhausted from constantly vocalizing our needs, or just having them ignored.


I think we have to believe that as we get more representation, and become that representation, things will change for the better.

In the meantime, much love to you!
Sorry this be happening 😔
But just wanted to say you're valid and you're beautiful ☺️
you look amazing my friend. also you are valid. shitty people don't matter
They're clearly just jealous of your gorgeous nails!
Maybe just maybe bcz u look like a man? We live in a binary world what are you expecting?
Depends on how you use it though. ""That dude over there"" to me seems more gendered than ""hey, dude"" or ""that's cool, dude"". Same with man I guess?"	hqpvz2	NonBinary	171	0.99	2020-07-13 23:01:17

"(France) Politicians raging on national debate after one brand of dictionary decided to include one of the ""new"" gender neutral pronoun (iel/ielle)"	"I don't know if many non french speaker know that, but we don't actually have gender neutral pronouns, or options whatsoever in French language. Everything, down to every inanimate object or even any concept is gendered. Worse, adverbs and adjectives pronounciation changes depending on the gender of the nouns it's completing. Verbs are affected too.
Young groups of freshly diplomed language researchers came up with a few option as of gender neutral options, and a new way of ""inclusive writing"".
Our institution are all screaming bloody murder at our ""beautiful language"", deeming the new inclusive way unreadable, unteachable, and prophetising it's teaching in our elementary schools will be the reason for future failing in learning to read and to write correctly, pointing fingers at the community and accusing us of using their children as guinea pigs for ""our fantasies and whims"".
As elections are nearing, politicians are seizing the subjects to try and appeal to the majority, shutting down every budding NB friendly initiative in their wake.
And since trans right are as new as this kind of initiative, it's also thrown in the middle of it, everything is tangled and mixed up, every supposed ""expert"" invited on debate TV misgendering, misexplaining and doing a mess of all that has been constructed so far by my generation... It's so taxing.
Looks like all of my NB friends and myself will have to move to an English speaking country, after all. X)
Thanks for reading my rant, anyway, have a nice day.
I needed venting. Thanks."	"It's so frustrating, sorry this is happening. The whole ""this is ruining our language!"" is so infuriating, it's happening here in germany too. Language is always freaking evolving! It's not like you speak the same as people did 200 years ago! If changing a few words and adjusting word endings is everything it takes to make a bunch of people feel better, and you refuse to do it, then you're just being an asshole🙄 my sympathies, op. We can emigrate to New Zealand together
In German it is the same problem and in German politics too. But i guess it is just the same as with gay marriage, first there was outrage, than it got passed, and now it is pretty much accepted, in metropolitan areas at least. As someone who is studying history at uni, i like it to show these guardians of the language how much language evolved during the last two centuries, some double down in their ignorance, but some are caught off guard by it and start to think about it. 
So i guess there is a silver lining at the horizon🤷
French person here! Yep, language evolves, and honestly it's evolving in a pretty cool way - I'm all in for it!

(Also, let's not act like the way French is taught isn't already horribly confusing...)
[deleted]
Ah darn gosh. I saw the good news on a notification. But I'm not in France and not following the actuality due to depression (honestly can't take more than working and surviving) so I was not aware it became a shit show. I guess I should have known because we're always doing a shit show a everything right? No one wants to use iel for me which is actually painful :(
The fact that your language experts are looking for NB language is amazing.  I wish your politicians recognized your rights but this is just the beginning.  I imagine those language experts, hundreds of years from now, will be looked at as pioneers.  As will we all here in this subredditt for being the pioneers of a more inclusive society. Am I too much?  Lol
As usual, it doesn't affect them but they have to throw tantrums anyway.
France moment, but yeah, i hate the fact that as soon as i want to get any sort of feelsgood about my gender i have to switch to english. Good on Le petit Robert for just, adding it tho. and of course the pushback from lingual purists get pissy about it because they have to sacrifice like, 20 minutes of their time to get used to a new neutral pronoun. i have a deep disdain for the right wing leaning of France, especially considering the amount of revolutions that have been done in the past to rid the country of tyranny
I feel you. Denmark likes to pretend it's so inclusive, but the LGBT+ spokespeople of several groups and parties are outright ridiculing us when we ask them to consider making it optionable to get a gendered title on your voter registration.
I've always wondered what kind of sick fuck goes around sexing new things. I can imagine a bunch gross old dudes arguing that shagging a phone is gay because a phone is masculine, but putting their dick in the continent of australia is perfectly straight due it's feminine wiles.
Thank you for posting this; I studied French in High School and was wondering how my non-binary francophones were working their pronouns.  

It sucks how people are reacting but hopefully it will change.  Just keep being you, and keep being amazing :)
French mate here

Having a netral pronoun made me very happy, Yet I'm more tempered about the use of inclusive writing, I think that our language changing and ""Iel/Ielle"" is a good begining and a fucking good evolution but the inclusive seem so boring and not so practical that it would be bad for french. I think that NB community will found walk around and see some awsome solution; Iel is way better than ""il-elle"" when you read a text, yet they mean the same thing. (for those that never read inclusive writting it would look like ""Iel etait heureux-se de retrouvé-e son ami-e."")

Our main probleme is that french is way to heavily gendered. I mean even to our name we have to gender it (Recently learn that Morgan is neutral in english while in french it's Morgan for Boy and Morgane for women). this will be our mais obscacle, we will have to dis-gender the french language (I ain't a linguist and hell not a letter personne, so I'll just follow ppl that have greater idear)

And Yes, when I saw that Iel entered the dictionnary I wen't on twitter and god oh god was I disapointed, instead of ppl just being happy there was just a bunch of old politician just raging about a new pronoun that will never change there life, yet would do so much for other ppl. Maybe a first step to neutral genre ID card ?

&#x200B;

(I'm NB and I'm still using my old pronoun)
I feel like these French politicians would run screaming in terror if they ever saw Mi'kmaq.

There are no genders. There is only nekm. And you must figure out who's being talked about purely by context cues. Godspeed.

Jokes aside, this is such a trivial thing to get their britches up over. It's almost silly how blatant it is that they only care for election points, but it's going to have long-lasting impacts on the trans & nonbinary community in French-speaking places. That's scary.
same thing is happening on Brasil too! it is very disappointing but i hope it is normalized in the future
It's very frustrating to hear that ""kids won't be able to learn how to read"", ""they don't need to push their agenda on kids, they're not guinea pigs, they don't have to pay for this"", I just want to ask them on TV ""then what do we do ?"".
It's all label as ""fashionable"" here, like a trending coat or something, and that fricking infuriating. Add politics to the mix... 
We always say ""it's simple, just please try to use these pronouns"" so people don't feel like it's a big deal when someone comes out as NB or trans, but they're reacting as if we're demanding they all personnaly live as NB, it's ridiculous.
Dictionaries are adding 150+ new words of slang ever year here, sometimes even silly or very insulting slangs you only hear in rap music, most of it debilitating, and now that they can do something of public utility, they just feel offended, or that we will ""devalue the French language"". Our kids use more rap-issued slangs nowadays than words of 4 syllables, and we're pointing fingers at inclusivity.
I'm glad to see Germans are on the same boat as us. You're right, I hope in a few year it will be past us all.
Ouais!!!! Ça vaut toujours la peine mais tabarnac, quelle défie.
I completely agree with everything you said. It always the same in France : creating rights and opportunity for a minority to have the basic decency in their life and having everyone else that is not concerned screaming bloody murder as if we were imposing something on them. 
Of course it sounds silly for someone who can't imagine a situation where they would need to use it, but it brings so much comfort to those who need to!
>No one wants to use iel for me which is actually painful :(

C'est dommage, iel devrait avoir ses pronoms utilisés plus souvent - je suis sûr.e qu'iel rencontrera des gens qui respecteront ses pronoms!
I, personnaly, I'm not very comfortable with ""iel"", it still sounds so strange to me. 
Don't bother yourself with all of this if you don't have the energy for it, it's okay, think about yourself first.
Take Care
It is our youth that is out there making a good use of their diploma to address the issue! :)After years of being responsibilities about taking of our future, this is how our elder reacts...
Duuude you made me laugh so hard xD
 I never thought of it until Loïc Suberville started making TikToks about it (it's in English, you should definitely check it out if you don't know them)
It's not just that it's pointlessly gendered, it's also following no logic whatsoever as to how it's written ... 
Makes for great machist puns for our old humorists though, pointing at how ""all the things that are a pain in the ass have a feminine attribute"" (such as ""washing the dishes"",""a fine"", ""a calamity"", ""a catastrophe""...)
:')
That's the point : we're not xD
When we are fluent in English like my friends and myself, we resort to They/Them (my favourite pronouns so far), but that confines our binary identity within that space, and prevent us from spreading it out to our families or professional life.
Yes, thank you, I'm still hopeful ;)
I'm part Portuguese, I heard about in Portugal too.... Yes, let's hope better fays awaits us
You're right it's absolutely ridiculous and it's obvious the language isn't actually the issue. They just hate when people don't conform to their worldview.
Now that i am thinking about it anything else would have surprised me, we both have overcomplicated languages, close ties in culture, history and politics, both of our cultures were pretty heavily influenced by the catholic church and i guess the politicians we have are more or less from the same mold, so again there is much that France and Germany has in common, for the better or worst i guess🤷
Justement. Courage!
<3
Sounds weird to me too but it's a question of habits. I'm using it for myself and getting used to it progressively. I want it to get more spread because that's a first step towards non binary acceptance. Maybe there's better alternative to get there?
If there's a better alternative, it's definitely not ""ol"" or ""ul"" xD (yes, people are putting these forward too). 
""Iel"" sounds weird, but I'm willing to try it out of course, I'm already growing more accustomed to it ;) (and I just noticed that ""iel"" with a majuscule ""i"" is ridiculous ._. crap.)
Ah yeah no offense meant of course! I was thinking alternative to language altogether to get us recognised :o (Iel is like a lill' soldier with 2 spears ^^)

I (26MTF) accidentally misgendered my nonbinary partner -- how do I make sure it never happens again?	"Throwaway in case my partner somehow sees this. 

My lovely partner and I have been dating since October and it's been a dream. We are so great together in so many ways, we're nerdy and bookish and have the same sense of humor, etc. I have thought for at least a couple months ""I could spend my life with this person,"" and I think they feel the same way. They said they loved me (first time anyone has ever said that to me) a month ago and I cried-- now we say it all the time. 

This relationship is also the closest I've ever been to a nonbinary person, and I've always had some (impermissible, ofc) difficulties with using they/them. Like, I had two nonbinary friends (one is now a trans man) and I would get their pronouns right 95% of the time but the other 5% I'd screw up and correct myself and move on. I knew this going in but thought ""hey, it's different with X because I've always known them as nonbinary"" and for the first five months it was. but yesterday when they were having Easter brunch with my family, my family was screwing up their pronouns off and on, and I'd correct them. I guess that got into my head a little, because when we got back to my mom's house and they were in the other room, I told my mom ""Thank you so much for inviting her--shit, them."" I was fighting back tears in the car on the way to the train station because of what happened. They asked me what was wrong and I told them and apologized. They said they heard and were sad about it but they accepted my apology. 

I cried a lot. I told them they need to believe that I see them as nonbinary and not a woman, because if they have any doubts about that, they shouldn't be with me, and should be with someone who they can be absolutely certain sees and loves them for who they are. I know I'd never want to be with someone I thought there was any chance saw me as anything other than a woman. Now I'm worried I broke the glass and they'll never truly trust that I see them for who they are.

 I would like to hear from others about how you healed from this (or if you didn't, what caused it to create a rift). I also want to hear from cis partners how you got to be perfect with respect to your trans partner's pronouns, because that's the only thing acceptable to me going forward. I love them so much and I can t bear the thought of hurting them again."	"Misgendering could happen and it's not something that lead to the end of a solid relationship.

It's one thing to misgender every now and then out of a mistake. It could happen.

It's another thing to misgender out of the lack of respect, because you don't respect people perspectives, feeling and lifes.


We're humans and it's ok to make mistakes without malice. If there is love and you show them by your actions, day by day, a single mystake it's not the end of the world. 

My partner misgenders me every now and then, but i love her anyway and i don't see this as something she does like out of malice.
I think you're overdoing it. Slipping on pronouns happens. As you said, your family was having trouble, so it was in your head.

It's at least partly linguistic, I think, too. English doesn't have a universally accepted non-gendered third person pronoun, so if you don't grow up reading and hearing they/them used as a singular pronoun much, it's not as firmly in your vocabulary. It takes practice. You didn't deliberately misgender them, or habitually do so.

And, gently, don't make a grand dramatic show about your massive guilt. That's exhausting.
>I cried a lot. I told them they need to believe that I see them as nonbinary and not a woman, because if they have any doubts about that, they shouldn't be with me, and should be with someone who they can be absolutely certain sees and loves them for who they are.

This is making it about you, which makes them have to comfort you for your mistake. Just work on not doing it again and try not to make a huge deal out of things if you do. Practice in front of a mirror at home. Write letters to your partner using their pronouns
Honestly it sounds like you were just around people who couldn't get it right, which in turn makes it harder to comprehend for yourself. If there was a cat but everyone around kept calling them a dog, you'd probably at least once slip up and call the cat a dog. It's not about what you believe at that point- it's just the confusion of people around you not being able to get it. 

My ex once got my pronouns wrong after being around my family- but the response to my correction was ""I forgot"" and that was hurtful. Instead it's better to say something short like ""I got confused because people around us keep getting it wrong, I'm sorry. I will look into ways for myself to prevent slip-ups like this in the future.""


That's it. That's all you can say- anything more unprompted and it's overexplaining/overcompensating. You know that you didn't mean it, you made it clear in the simple apology, and you stated that you're going to work to be better, and so everything that needed to be communicated was already said from that simple two-line apology.

The other commenter was correct in saying that too much of an apology makes it no longer about the other person. It can be hard to admit, but if they accepted your apology right away [and even if they didn't immediately accept it but they acknowledged it], then anything more is centering it on you.

Here, to make it easier to understand what I mean by that an example:

-

I broke your favorite cup by accident. 

apology 1:
""I'm sorry, I know that cup meant a lot to you, and I was careless when handling it. Next time I will be more careful with your dishes.""

apology 2: 
""Sorry, but I think you should keep your dishes closer to the table.""

apology 3:
""Oh my gosh I am soooo sorry. That plate was your favorite and I broke it and I feel so bad for breaking it, please forgive me! I will never touch your plates again because I'm so clumsy and I can't be trusted anymore and I need to use plastic dishes for the rest of my life! I'm so sorry.""

-

Which one felt the most sincere? 

Most people would say apology 1. It's simple and straight to the point. Not long-winded, and it doesn't use ""but.""

Apology 1 offers a reason, an apology, and a way to move forward. That's what you need for apologies to sound sincere.

Can you see how apology 3 kinda feels like it's not about the plate or you anymore, but about how I feel bad about it? It sounds like you're starting to do this, which doesn't feel good.

Other than that, ways to prevent future confusion/misgendering would be, in this case, getting used to using a different word for certain things regardless of what people around you call it. Something like deciding to use the word ""image"" even when everyone calls it ""picture"" or ""pic"" is a way to just practice keeping the things you know to be true to be the things that will come out of your mouth.

Specifically with misgendering, you can work through things that you might internally be thinking incorrectly due to society/those around you. This might look like relating your partner to women [could be men, too, but I'm using women as an example] characters a lot of the time, even when other things are not present that remind you of them- like if you put them in the role of women characters in tv, movies, and books, even when they have nothing in common with the woman character.

And yes, misgendering hurts, but it hurts way more when you're intentionally misgendering. Unintentional, accidental misgendering is similar to using the word ""disintegrate"" when you meant ""disassociate"" because it is misspeaking, not believing that the incorrect word was right. I don't get upset if someone doesn't know the word ""disassociating"" and goes through this big ""wait no, disassembling, I mean disintegrating, no I mean that thing where you aren't in touch with your body- dissasocociating,"" but I might get upset if someone is telling me ""The word for that is disintegrating. You're wrong, it's disintegrating,"" even when they're told the right word.

All in all, misgendering happens to the best of us and we do it to ourselves/each other and it hurts, but the best way to move forward is finding ways to make it easier in the future and moving on swiftly. Hope this helps.
There's no such thing as perfect. That's literally not a thing. Your partner understands that I'm sure. And the sooner you do too the easier it will be for you. Like the more you focus on...omg I might misgender them, the more you're gonna misgender them, because it's gonna be constantly on your mind.
your biggest mistake was crying about this and making it about you. from a non-binary person- just correct yourself, apologize quickly, and move on.
So, similar situation here. Both my sibling and I are nonbinary. We're not out to the majority of the family yet, so we kind of ""code switch"" and use our agab pronouns when we're around family. We use the correct pronouns for each other any other time, and it honestly feels weird when we use our agab pronouns. However, the only time slip-ups seem to happen for us is right after a family event when both we and the people around us have been using incorrect pronouns. It is very likely possible that the people around you repeatedly saying ""she"" got into your head and accidentally caused you to slip. When this happens, we simply say ""sorry"" and then correct ourselves. This doesn't mean you don't see them as they are. It seems like it was environmental. No need to overly apologize, as that not only draws the attention to you, but it drags the whole situation out even longer.
Oh sweet child of summer. 


You will make the mistake again. And that's okay. 
When you use the wrong pronoun, if you realize in the moment. Stop, apologize, correct, move on. Dont make it a big thing. Just keep on pushing. 


If they want to talk about it let them lead the conversation. If they don't but you have big feelings. Find a binary gender person to talk about that with. 

And most importantly. Stop going for perfection. Strive for improvment.
My partner accidentally misgenders me sometimes too. I accidentally misgender them sometimes as well. We immediately correct ourselves and move on with the conversation. It happens. I don't honestly see this as a super big deal?
I can't speak for your partner, but it's probably not as big of a deal as you're making it. Unfortunately, non-binary folks get misgendered pretty often. It's almost never intentional or malicious and (at least in my case) it's relatively easy to tune out. Sometimes mistakes happen. My partner still misgenders me accidentally sometimes and I know she usually feels worse than I do about it. It's when someone starts making a big deal about it that it becomes uncomfortable.
Just apolgize and move on, it's more annoying when ppl constantly correct themselves to appear contrite. We can tell ur not doing it malicously and we know ppl screw up pornouns
Your feelings actually moved me. I guess all people are different and nonbinary people are different from each other too.  


>they need to believe that I see them as nonbinary and not a woman, because if they have any doubts about that, they shouldn't be with me, and should be with someone who they can be absolutely certain sees and loves them for who they are

Gosh I wish someone close to me said that when they got my pronouns wrong. Felt validating to read. 

I don't think your response was necessarily inappropriate. You are a trans person and know how much it hurts for other to not see who you are and not use the right pronouns. Your family was screwing with the pronouns, that will stress me out for sure (I'm neurodivergent and gatherings of people already stress me out. Also people not using my pronouns stresses me out and it hurts).

I understand you where emotional. I hope your partner understand too. I say believe what they said, that they accept your apology. Don't beat yourself.

Sometimes when I'm stressed and people keep using other pronouns I screw up my own pronouns (It doesn't happen often but when it does I hate it, cause what the hell I'm I doing missgendering myself?!?). I understand it was a mistake, your partner understands too.

It could be a nice opportunity to bond with your partner if you ask them what they think about how you acted in that situation and what could you do different if ever happens again. Maybe wait for your feelings to settle down first, so you can both focus on your partners feelings more this time :) I hope this helps!
People often misgender themselves by accident when exposed to environments where the pronouns get twisted up. I’d really think about why this hits me so intensely if I were you.

This isn’t to say misgendering is okay, but people have to be allowed to make mistakes without it being a one-hit KO for the relationship.
Yeh this really isn’t that big a deal. Its only when its regular that it’s a problem. 

Great example: before my egg cracked I also had some issue with getting the right pronouns with my partner. After about 2 months it was super easy. But, I have a fun speech disorder that makes it difficult to use words sometimes and my coping mechanism from childhood is to find the fastest words so I don’t stop a sentence dead. Mistakes will happen regularly because of it. It’s not a big deal unless it is made into one.

The bigger issue (and is also a solid “you problem” to solve) is honestly why are you hardcore flipping out like this. As a long term trauma survivor, this should be explored (preferably with professionals). You’ll probably learn more about yourself and maybe ease your partner’s mind as a side benefit.
when you two aren't around, repeat their pronouns in your head with a mental image of them  


it worked for me when I was starting to question things
This will always happen from time to time and will happen again in the future. Even people who have their correct pronouns 20yrs ago can slip and and misgender themselves. 

The human brain is a weird thing. 

The overwhelming advice I’ve read online is quickly apologize and correct yourself then move on. Making too big a deal out of it actually shines a spotlight on the issue and can make the other person more uncomfortable. 

I know you said it personally upsets you a lot when the wrong pronouns is used. But not everyone has that same reaction. You might be transferring your own feelings onto your partner. 

You do sound very sensitive like myself and it’s taken me a lot of time to figure out how differently other people operate and to try to not get worked up worrying about it. 

This might actually be more about soothing your own anxiety and relationship panic. If your partner has accepted your apology and has moved on there is no need to revisit.  Rehashing this it might actually make things worse. 

If you feel like you have an insecure psychological attachment style and are very sensitive (again this describes me 100%) it might actually be those false alarm bells going off in your head. And trying to resolve them with your partner may actually be unnecessary. It might actually just be your own internal feelings you need to soothe. 

If any of this rings a bell with you. Working on these things and your reaction will also make you a much better partner because it will help you feel more confident and loving. So you can focus on your partner more without having these whirlwind of emotions and constant fear or anxiety that someone might leave you if you do something wrong. 

I might have misunderstood your feelings and perspective so if I’m off base you can just ignore me.  And I apologize if I misunderstood you. A lot of what I wrote in the post describes me. I just saw in your comments a lot of similar things I’ve also experienced so I figured there may be some overlap between us. Hope some of this helps! 💜🌈. You’re doing ok!  Everything will be ok!
It seems to me like you worry more than I think is reasonable. It's a bit endearing that you're so dedicated to not hurt your partner, but most of all I think you should consider why you are still having such a strong reaction when your partner said they accepted your apology.

Because, listen, most of us enbies slip up every now and then as well, because gendered language is so deeply rooted in us and it's everywhere around us, and it's hard to break free of such concepts. We know it happens, and it hurts, but we also know that it doesn't automatically mean someone sees us as that gender. In the end, what truly matters is how a person reacts when they make a mistake. You did exactly what most enby people would consider the right thing to do, you corrected yourself, apologized, and now you're doing your best to make sure it doesn't happen again.

But you seem to have not accepted that your partner has accepted your apology? Do you not trust that they have truly forgiven you? And if so, why? Do you have some internalized transphobia that you're scared of facing? Do you have a history of rejection and you're just waiting for your partner to find any reason to break up with you? Has your partner been dishonest at some point and you haven't sorted it out properly?

I think you need to reflect upon why you're reacting like this, and then try to talk it out with your partner so they know what's going on.
We live in a society where everything and everyone is constantly divided into gender binary boxes - a society where its even viewed as impolite to many, to not treat them as female/male based on their gender expression. That’s very unfortunate for gnc/enby people, because “passing” as female/male will make people address/view you as such.

So I’m not surprised or upset with the person if I’m misgendered by them every once in a full moon (especially if they’re someone who genuinely tries to use they/them most of the time + correct others). Everyone messes up sometimes - especially when they’re around other people who misgender people consistently. 
That being said, such a strong reaction/emotional outburst would make me feel extremely uncomfortable. I’d never expect anyone to never mess up they/them pronouns - but I would be extremely upset by a reaction other than saying whoops/sorry, and just quickly correcting themselves when they notice. 

You might want to talk to your partner about what reaction they’d like you to have (like, should you just say sorry and move on). I don’t think any of you should expect it to never happen again. That’s in my opinion unrealistic (especially when you’re around people who misgender your partner), but of course it’s fair that it’s upsetting to you and your partner. :)
Probably not the first time being misgendered. You did your part and apologized. Seems like you genuinely are working on it. No worries. A real relationship will transcend a pronoun slip.
just say “i’m sorry” and move on. it wasn’t intentional.
you’re centering yourself in this, and this isn’t about you. your partner appreciates you always trying but you need to realize that crying and putting yourself makes them feel even more uncomfortable. 

listen, i misgender *myself* sometimes. it happens. you correct yourself, apologize, (with a short sorry) and move on.

(edited to remove “dude” from a sentence as i mistakenly read “FTM” instead of “MTF” originally)
Just continue correcting yourself when you get it wrong. And... dont make a huge deal of it next time. Your partner shouldnt be feeling the need to reassure *you* when you misgender them. 

Its honestly not as big a deal as you seem to think. 

People will absolutely default (even accidentally) to words used by others in the group. If everyone was misgendering them, its not a wild thought that youd use that pronoun too. Not an excuse, but its understandable. If you dont see them as a woman, thats all you need.
Sending love 💕. We need to have grace with each other. The world is already against us, let’s not do the same with our own community. Expecting perfection is unrealistic when we live in a racist capitalist transphobic heteropatriarchy. It is the air we breathe. 

We need to stop participating in the same kind of witch hunts that oppress us. Embrace radical forgiveness, for your own peace. 

Healing for me is coming to terms with everything life will throw at you, good or bad, and choosing to build the utopia we all want to live in. We need to stop thinking in absolutes and binaries—no one is all inherently all good or all bad. The capacity for love and evil exists in all of us and we are complicated humans, all too human. We are all people in process. Learn to forgive yourself and forgive others. Mistakes help people learn—if you forgive and focus not on whether someone is “good or bad” and instead focus on righting the specific wrong, you can help others act in better ways. We all need help and have had help, we are not islands born into absolute goodness. 
This is not to say that people shouldn’t take responsibility for messing up, just that when they do, what we can control is helping them not mess up again or making sure we don’t make the same choices. You aren’t a bad person for a momentary mistake. Learn to trust and rebuild trust and give yourself and others the space to do the same. Forgiveness is the way to end suffering. It is not simply absolving the evil and moving on, it means doing the work with others and recommitting them and you to be better. It is a commitment to our shared humanity and a commitment to bringing about our shared goodness. That is what is important. We have too little time in this world to be trapped in hate. Love deeply. love love love 💕💕
My wife has slipped up a couple times for me and I’ve gotten some language wrong for her. We apologize and move on. Brains are weird and get tired/stressed then make mistakes, it’s normal and ok to move on from. Love transcends bloopers!
Sometimes mistakes happen. If you set the bar at ""I must ABSOLUTELY NEVER mess up again"" then you *will inevitably fail,* and you'll feel like a colossal failure when you do.

Instead, understand that you are human and shit happens. When you mess up, immediately correct yourself and _move on_. Do not make it about how upset you are that you messed up, don't make them have to stop and comfort or reassure you. 

Just make the correction and move on like normal.
I've been with my bf for 2 years now. He has misgendered me a handful of times on accident. I still wanna spend the rest of our lives together. It sucks but just try harder. Just talk to them.
I don’t think it is realistic to come from such a place of severity. We have been taught to recognize “boy or girl” since infancy. Our brain wants to make those connections. Breaking the binary is working on changing that. I have occasionally misgendered afab friend who dress more feminine because my brain is filling in the blanks. My partner occasionally misgenders me. I occasionally misgender myself. I also occasionally call my pets by the others names, or make other silly mistakes. Today on the phone I meant to say “she was talking to her friend about you.” And instead I said “she was talking to you.”

We are humans trying to rewire our brains. Slip ups will happen. Just apologize and correct yourself, the. practice correcting yourself in private. Making it into a huge ordeal just piles onto an uncomfortable moment. Treat it like a “whoopsie! Silly brain!” And not a malicious attack on your partners identity. If it is an accident and you correct yourself, it’s fine.
I'm enby and my wife has very occasionally made this kind of mistake, and it in no way changed my mind about wanting to marry her.  It's not a big deal for me. I know she gets me and truly doesn't see me as a gender.  I know she corrects people endlessly on my behalf.  I know she gets me affirming gifts like clothes/accessories that don't match my AGAB, to cheer me up when I need it. As it happens she also has an enby godchild and I know how much thought she puts into their Christmas and birthday presents to make sure there is a range of differently gendered and non-gendered items.  Basically, I know from her actions towards me and towards other people that she takes my identity seriously and sees me as myself.  That is a big deal.

Full disclosure I also occasionally make this kind of mistake about myself.  Like I'll be saying what someone thought of me and I'll accidentally put the wrong pronoun into their mouth.  Life goes on.
I think if it happens rarely, the pain will pass and it will be forgiven. I've accidentally misgendered non-binary friends I've known for years and only as non-binary, and I'm non-binary and use they/them pronouns exclusively myself. We all slip up sometimes and making sure it happens as rarely as possible is the best we can do.

Remember that we all grew up in a society that, at the very best, ignores the existence of they/them pronouns as personal pronouns, with more and more places actively excluding them. even if you learn about they/them pronouns as personal pronouns when you're relatively young, you are still bombarded with the idea that he/him and she/her are the only ones that exist and it's really hard to completely unlearn that since it's everywhere. 

Maybe in a few days, once it's less fresh, ask them how they want you to handle slip ups when they happen, but really, don't be too hard on yourself and do whatever it is you usually do to show them you love them and value them
The whole freaking out and crying while over apologizing: don't do that. 100% made the situation insanely uncomfortable for them because you made a huge deal out of something that they probably wouldn't have put much more thought into had you just left it at ""I'm sorry.""

I understand there are circumstances that may have caused you to react that way, but you NEED to recognize it's not healthy for either of you and learn how to identify when you're starting to do something like this (if its a common occurrence) and learn what helps stop the reaction in it's tracks. I know it's easier said than done, but it's worth the effort. Over apologizing can be just as bad as not doing it at all, imo.

Edit: wanna clarify I don't mean for this to come off aggressively or rude at all btw, I'm just trying to be direct.
Chile I promise accidents happens — I’m nb and I’ve accidentally misgendered my friends and MYSELF and while rare, I just correct and apologize. You’re only human.
I mean I have misgendered cis people before. It just happens. Same as calling your teacher mum as a kid.
My stepfather misgendered my one year old baby earlier 😂 It can happen, people mix up words all the time. I think it’s better to quickly move on after apologizing and/or appreciating a correction, otherwise the groveling can feel like a burden to respond to.
It sounds like you misspoke, rather than misgendered in this situation. When people are talking quickly or if they are flustered, they sometimes say a word different they mean.

I would be very surprised if you don’t accidentally say a different pronoun than you mean for a cis person at least once a week. I know I do. But then I do what you probably should have done here, correct myself, move on, and basically forget about it. 

Other people have said this, but I think they are right. The thing you are doing that is probably hurting your partner the most is making a big thing of this.
I misgender and deadname \*myself\* sometimes.  I also get mixed up and call my cat by the name of my pet chickens and visa versa.  Words get jumbled up every now and then.  It happens.
I think maybe? In your shoes I’d conclude I’m mixing a lot of feels from other things into this.

Anxiety about not screwing up my first BIG relationship (and awww it was cute how you described it)

The embarrassment and stress of family loved ones accidentally or thoughtlessly misgendering my person that I brought into that family space, and who may not self advocate as strongly for themselves out of a desire to not create waves. 

And you are thinking that you want it all to go perfect cause you’re now thinking longer term potential with your partner, and part of that is how well family meshes with them.

I know that I take (sometimes excessive) ownership when my family has not done right by my spouse, and sometimes it can feel like their rudeness is on me too…

And then the final nail, it was on your mind so much that you accidentally did it too. 

And the guilt of that one word, plus the likely stress and anxiety of those unfortunate mis genders by your family, anxieties about not effing up, etc likely pulled it all into this bigger thing.

But in the end? Right now you’re putting so much more pressure on this one word than it deserves, and it’s not fair to you or your partner, specially since I am sure it’s not even the core of why you have such big feels. Maybe write out a letter to yourself, explore where these feelings may be coming from?

I hope this helps
I’m (he/they) also dating a nonbinary person (they/them) It’s perfectly okay to make mistakes as long as you correct them and move on. 

We don’t get to consciously choose every single word that comes out of our mouths. If we did, we wouldn’t misgender anyone.

Did you know that some nonbinary people will occasionally accidentally misgender themselves? That doesn’t make them any less nonbinary. It just proves how hard habits are to break and how common slips of the tongue are. 

I would try hesitating before you speak about your partner, taking an extra fraction of a second to double check which pronoun you’re about to use?

Remember how Buggs Bunny and Daffy Duck argue over whether it’s duck season or rabbit season? They go back and forth shouting “duck season!” and “Rabbit season!” so fast that Buggs is able to trick Daffy into saying “Duck Season!” That wouldn’t have worked if Daffy had been speaking more slowly, going over what he was about to say before he said it.

If it happens again, it’s not anything to beat yourself up over. That doesn’t do anything but draw more attention to the mistake. For your own sake and your partner’s, just apologize, then forgive yourself and move on. That’ll give them a chance to forget/bury it.

Best of luck with you and your partner!!
I mean, we’re all socialized into the same system that assumes a binary, and none of us is to blame for being raised and socialized in that system. I misgender myself periodically, because I used a particular set of pronouns for 38 years before having the understanding and self-connection to figure myself out. I think that it happens, because we’re human. My wife slips up from time to time, so do my kids, so doI. 

When somebody does, we correct ourselves and quickly move on. We don’t belabour the apology or let it bog us down either. Humans slip up. I know that my wife sees me, knows me, and doesn’t expect perfection from me. I similarly recognize the humanity in her and don’t expect perfection in her either.

We’re all navigating this language shift in a colonial culture that has worked very hard to suppress gender diversity for hundreds of years. We aren’t going to be perfect about it. Although impact matters more than intention, intention still matters, particularly with those you know, trust, and love.
If it happens correct yourself and move on. Slip ups happen and don't make you a bad person as long as you are genuinely putting effort in it (which it sounds like you do).
In regards to your question, I'm not sure if there is a 100% solution to NEVER messing up their pronouns again. You said for 5 months that you didn't mess up once, that's great!! As someone who has trans & queer friends who often mess up my pronouns (they/them) I understand that it can happen. I'm sure your partner will understand and forgive you. ALTHOUGH! I will say that if you dwell on this event and are absolutely terrified it'll happen again, I'm sure that anxiety will make slips happen more. Just try to forgive yourself for the mistake, as it sounds like your partner already has, and try to move on! Don't be too hard on yourself if it happens again, it'll likely disappear with more and more time :)
Been there. I am cis, my partner is nb, and once my phone autocompleted a verb to a feminine form when I addressed them. This felt like a betrayal since we have a strong, trusting connection and both are from a severely homophobic, anti-trans country. I imagined they would always have this thought at the back of their mind that I internally misgender them — but guess what, they don’t think that. As time goes by, your partner will gain more and more undeniable proof of how you truly see them. You can’t keep up a lie when you’re constantly around someone. If you’d thought of them as a woman, they would have seen tons of red flags by now. Plus, it’s only human to screw up. You grew up in a binary-centered culture, and sometimes you say things you don’t mean. Just focus on doing better and don’t beat yourself up over it.
This right here, this is basically what I say to people who apologise after a mistake, mistakes happen it's not easy vernacular to people growing up at the moment, my wife of 12 years does too occasionally. The problem is when people do it out of spite, and you can generally tell those ones -_-
Honestly, I don't think it's op ""making it"" about herself as much as her actually having issues within herself. I mean it could be just anxiety because she cares about the relationship, but there's definitely a reason why she is reacting so strongly.
Yeah I also feel bad because I was the one who caused the harm but I was far more upset than they were (at least externally). And they were reassuring me, etc.

I disagree that its not that big a deal though. Like I'm trans myself. I know it would be brutal if they called me a guy accidentally. Even if I knew they didn't mean it.
this is an incredible and thoughtful reply.
Also, just to add, it’s worth noting that being a enby/gnc afab/FTX there’s also this extra risk of your identity being invalidated. Or being viewed as woman-lite. There’s a lot of prejudice that way (for everyone, just in different ways). Like when an Amab person wears  a skirt or nail polish or eyeshadow, they’re pegged as queer/gnc - that’s really upsetting if you’re an amab person who just wants to express yourself as a cis man. On the other hand, it’s really difficult as an afab to be viewed as gnc, other than maybe shaving your head.
Yeah, there is a reason, I'm not arguing with that. But bc of her issues within herself, the situation has shifted to being about how SHE feels about it, which isn't the goal
I am also trans/nonbinary. My girlfriend has accidentally misgendered me before. She apologized and moved on and it's fine.

Yeah when you make it all about how bad you feel for making a mistake it can make the person you wronged feel much worse since they now have to comfort you
One thing that stuck with me was ""The apology doesn't need to be longer than the mistake""  


And truly, Philosophical analysis of guilt and shame lead us to the recognition that:  
""Feeling guilty about something is too console one's own wounded ego, so as to avoid doing something more tangible about it.

Your intention was not to dehumanize them. That you simply acknowledge, and endeavor to do better, is enough.   


Life is short. Intrusive thoughts like these bubble up. When they do, ask yourself ""have I put in place action or plans for action when it comes time?"" and if so, you've done what you can do. Let that intrusive thought float away. That is not internal dialogue, it's just anxiety. Anxiety, like being flawed, is a human experience. 🫶
Everyone is different, but not all nonbinary people experience misgendering as having the same “sting” as it does for binary trans people. This is because it’s so incredibly common and because they/them pronouns are unfamiliar to a lot of people. I don’t know about your partner, but if it seems like they didn’t take it as hard as you would, that could be the reason
I don't mean to sound harsh, but I think you are projecting here. As a binary trans person, misgendering probably stings a lot more - if someone were to call you a guy, it would be awful. As an enby who prefers they/them, I personally accept any/all because I'm both not really either gender, but also all of them, and if someone refers to me in a binary way, it's more like a small prick on the skin that goes away within seconds - not a big deal

also, trans people misgender too. I have misgendered other trans people by accident (always apologize sincerely) and I've even ""misgendered"" myself! It happens and it's not the end of the world

you don't have to answer this: have you had a lot of experience with people misgendering and/or deadnaming you? Because if yes, you may be projecting your own trauma onto your mistake. And no, bottling it up is not the answer - talk to your partner and explain why it made you feel the way it did. You don't want to make it about yourself, but also an explanation for the, honestly, over-the-top reaction may do good
Maybe I'm just different from a lot of people in this sub, but to me the situation doesn't shift just because she's talking about how she feels. Rather, when someone talks about how they are feeling when they have hurt me, that makes it easier for me to take them seriously, to understand the situation and how to help them understand how they can do better in the future.

Of course there's a limit, like if OP had accused her partner of making her feel bad by requesting that she uses they/them pronouns, or if she had said something like ""how do you think that makes me feel?"" so that it would be more about OP feeling hurt than OP's feelings regarding having hurt her partner. And I suppose there are situations that are somewhere in a grey area. But I don't think talking about how you feel automatically makes it about yourself.

But that's just my experience. If most people feel like you do, it's more likely that OP's partner is feeling similarly. OP may have to talk with her partner about her reaction at some point though, depending on what's going on, but then it will be a new conversation, and I suppose that's a good thing so they can talk about that separately and after the apology.
I feel like I owe them a big apology because what I did was so bad. Idk if I would be ok with someone misgendering me and just being like ""oh, sorry, wont happen again! What do you want from Starbucks?""
As u/TheDreamingKind pointed out with a wonderful example, a huge apology makes it about yourself and centers your feelings. Honestly I would feel worse about this big giant apology than a quick ""sorry, I slipped up""
but would you be okay with them sobbing a lot and suggesting you dump them because of it? would you be okay with having to comfort them when *you'd* be the one hurt? what would make this right for you, if someone you loved misgendered you (during a day when their family repeatedly misgendered you too!)?
Honestly I think you're holding everyone to too high a standard. You called mixing up the pronouns of two newer friends ""inexcusable."" People make mistakes. I've misgendered myself more than once. My mom has called my sister by the dogs name and me by my sister's. She doesn't think my sister is a dog and I'm my sister, she just made a small mistake.


 You're taking a small mistake you made (not even in front of your significant other) and turning it into a massive drama that revolves all around you and your feelings. You're saying ""I won't accept how the person I wronged wants to move forward because I would handle it this way."" Thats way more insensitive than a slip up. 


Also I don't speak for all trans people any more than you do but I've never met one in real life that didn't strongly prefer someone just say ""Oh, sorry, I meant they/he/she"" and move on.
From what I can see, you are talking about what you feel and what others feel, but have you asked your partner what they feel? If no, why not ask? Again, it doesn't need to be super dramatic, just ""I was wondering how you want me to handle it when I screw up and use the wrong pronouns. I feel really bad, but I also don't want to make you uncomfortable.""
I think taking a bit extra care to make sure you show them love in ways that you know they appreciate (and not bringing up your mistake) and value them for who they are will be much more appreciated than a huge apology. 

From my experience as someone who uses they/them pronouns, a big apology is exhausting and I really just want to see that person take care to not misgender me again and show me that they care about me
I know that’s how you feel, but you have to de-center how you feel for their sake. The most selfless thing you can do is this:

When your conscience screams at you to make a big apology, trust that your partner knows what’s best for themself even better than your own conscience does. Sometimes you have to ignore your intuition and conscience when the evidence speaks against it. Bury your feelings, move on, and talk to a therapist or trusted friend about them later.

Better yet, FORGIVE YOURSELF!!! it’ll mean you don’t have to bury anything. Tell yourself over and over “I’m okay. It was an honest mistake. I’m okay.” And hopefully you’ll eventually believe it after repeating it a bunch

However, it seems that nonbinary is actually treated as a third binary by most people in the queer community as well. So basically I ended up feeling like I don't belong anywhere both when it comes to cishets who will never respect who I am, and when it's in the queer community, where I get imposter syndrome.

I don't have anyone to tell me stuff like ""you're valid"", ""do what makes you the most comfortable and know that I will respect and understand who you are regardless""

And I think I'm coming close to my breaking point because I've been living like this for years and it hurts.

I don't want to change how I look just to please people who feel like nonbinary should be its own binary. I don't think I look good trying to look androgynous, i have tried when I was younger and it made me feel unattractive (not that androgynous people are unactractive, it's the opposite for me, but because of how I'm naturally built and my face, and my BDD i have a very complicated relationship with my body so I NEED to look good for myself and myself mostly)

So yeah, stuck in between. Rejected by society.

Cishet guys never wanting to be just friends and never acknowledging my pronouns. Sick of the disappointments. Cishet girls eventually noticing I'm acting ""odd"" because I'm not really one of them, also misgendering all the time. All this despite coming out to these people. But they have no idea or care for what I'm talking about when I come out to them.
Growing up all of my friends turned out to be lesbians. Only one of them ever respected my gender identity. So it's a queer people problem too. At least those around me.

""You don't need to fit in"" yeah, I do. Because the loneliness becomes unbarable and the depressive episodes are becoming darker. And I'm alone because I don't fit in anywhere and can't trust anybody to be my friend.

My gender identity is more complicated than just they/them pronouns, but it's more convinient to only ask people to respect that instead of explaining myself to them all the time, which is also a huge risk. And yet, yet these assholes can't even respect one simple thing such as pronouns and using neutral terminology with me. Fuck everyone.
I used to love people, now I'm sick of everyone.

Can't have friends, can't have a pleasing social life. Let alone partners. Or sexual encounters. Because I can't trust anybody.
Everything is just so sad and frustrating.
And when I go into details with therapists all they can do is say ""yeah, that's understandable"". So yeah. No solution. I'm stuck being ""the weird one that could easily have a normal life but chooses to seek attention by wanting to be different so badly"" (my parents and possibly most people I came out to)

EDIT: Thank you everyone for sharing with me your experiences and for taking the time to write such kind words. I feel easily overwhelmed by this issue lately and I definitely felt overwhelmed also by the kindness of you all and the simple interaction with other nonbinary people, who finally understand me. I will go through all your comments as soon as I feel like I can handle it. Thank you again, despite the anonymity provided by Reddit, I still felt the warmth of your words and I don't feel so alone anymore."	"nonbinary doesn't look like anything, you ARE valid, people just lack empathy and the ability to try and understand. YOU are a gorgeous nonbinary person and YOU are so so so valid.
As an amab masc presenting enby I feel this so hard
If you can handle some dark periods of time then everything will work out, when I came out as nb but started to social transition as a man (being very masculine and accepting he/him pronouns from strangers) yeah I lost like all my friends and certain people around me distanced themselves from me, but I found my people (they kinda found me) yeah most of them are younger kids that look up to me but I still love being a parental figure in their lives. I had only one friend that stayed with me through it all, you can have people you hang out with but they aren't your friends if they don't accept how things are. The real ones will stay, the the real ones will come. With confidence people will see it and let you truly be you. I have basically replaced everyone around me. And with my confidence and feel good attitude because I'm living my life and not worried about people, I have friends, I have acquaintances, I have school buddies, people look at me and think I got my shit together. It works out in the end, it just takes time, you will have a period of time when you have no friends, you have no one to turn to. You become a hermit. But in that time you become the most YOU. You find hobbies, you find your true personality, you find what makes you happy. Find you before finding other people.
I’m neither him nor her. A French composer once said, “music is the space between the notes.”
I feel the same
You don't need to look a certain way to be NB!!!!
I also find myself jealous towards more androgynous people sometimes. 
But I'm AMAB and present very masc. The only times people were confused about my gender was on the phone and because of my name which is gender neutral but socially leaning femme. 
What I'm trying to say is, you can look like you pass without a question of a doubt and still not fit in the gender binary, and like others said. You are valid and accepted here!!!
Sending all the love your way and I know you can endure the hard times, you have so far💛🤍💜🖤
I’m so sorry you feel this way. It is so painful socially, sexually, emotionally, intimately to present a way that is not expected as “THE LOOK” for enby folk, and be excluded, even shamed for it. Please know that, like you, we are out here, a whole spectrum of gender fluidity inside and out—many of us don’t fit “THE LOOK” for the same reasons you don’t. Gender, and it’s expression, is more than appearance. Recently, many have often felt like the non-binary identity is being pigeon holed as a third gender with its own celebrities leading the charge and building media hype and social expectations of what we should all look like—defying the vast and varied spectrum of what we ACTUALLY look like, and ignoring that gender is far, far more than just looks. It’s very shallow to assume otherwise. Please keep the faith.  It won’t be easy, but you will find those that will get you for who YOU are.
I wrestle with this daily and then throw my hands up at the patriarchy for putting me in this damn box where I'm only 'safe' when I'm still performing for them, whether that be sticking to my gender assigned at birth, or going full on in the opposite binary's displays of gender, or being androgynous enough to signal to people I'm non-binary based on looks alone.

Fuck their furrowed brows at how we show up, that's the conditioning leaving their bodies. It's okay to care what they think, that's how we stay safe in our society. I think what's more affirming for me is working on winning myself over for my choices and caring what I think about myself more.
honestly, were on a similar boat, for one part I really don't present as NB, but I also don't really feel very identified with the nb community since sometimes I like some aspects of both genders and I like to present as both, but if I say someting like that I automatically get boxed in ""gender fluid"" even if that doesn't really feel correct. 

labels are inventions of society since we need to identify with something as to feel we're not alone nor too much different. some people really take it to heart since they formed such a strong connection with the label as their identity that's they can't just think of another way. 

so, in reality you really shouldn't worry so much about not fitting in the mold. if that's the case maybe something else is the problem, like, we know that it's important for us that people recognize our identity. but my question is, why is it for you? is it just the validation or maybe something else? 

as por people and your identity, maybe you should try to run in different circles. since we have a tendency to rotate to people in witch we recognize certain patterns, and the people you decided to mix with, simply weren't so considerate, after all, everyone is different and you can't say you have meet all of the planet population
Have you tried seeking out a group of friends that is also nonbinary/queer? Cishet people are not going to understand you in the same way that other nonbinary people will.
You’re valid :)
I am also an enby passing as cis, but I look very good androgynous but I don’t dare to dress that way in public.
Non binary does not necessarily equal androgynous. Androgyny is in between. We are other than. That’s how I think of myself.
as others have said u don’t need to look a certain way, the way how i see it bc i have days where i prefer to look more “feminine” presenting or “masculine” presenting, i jus’ want ppl to see me as me, and if they don’t see me for how i’m comfortable expressing on any given day i usually don’t spend too much time w them. anyway u choose to look is valid and i promise u u’ll find a community that makes u feel safe, i’m always here if u wanna talk ♡
You are not alone. I have the same struggle with body image and the androgynous look just doesn't always suit me. It sucks cause I have to push a lot to get the correct pronouns used for myself and that makes people uncomfortable (but that's very much a them problem, as my therapist reminds me frequently).

Many hugs for you. We don't owe anyone androgyny. You're still valid no matter how you present ❤
Hey. Wear the clothes that make you feel good. Do it. I do. You don’t owe anyone an outfit, except yourself. You’re nonbinary? Neat. Anything you wear that makes you feel good is a valid nonbinary outfit. Because it is your outfit. 

Don’t change anything about yourself to please people who are not interested in who you are. You don’t owe anyone any way of being other than the one that’s truest to you. 

I really get what you’re saying about fitting in, and I think that what you are actually looking for is your community, the people who fit in with you as much as you fit in with them, rather than to actually fit in with people who have mental walls up that don’t allow them to see the awesomeness of *you*. I also get that ‘find your community’ isn’t on its face helpful advice, because ok, that’s nice, now tell me how and who. I’m saying it here more because I hope that it may help change your focus, because I think that being unable to be yourself surrounded by people who don’t get you is just as lonely as being alone, and I want you to know that you 100% deserve to be able to be you and seen and liked and loved. Unaccepting people don’t mean there’s something wrong with you, it is entirely a reflection of them.
So, I'm probably not the best for talking about this (I'm a 14 year old demiboy who doesn't have his shit together by any means and still isn't able to help himself), but here's what I think. 

Yeah, I'm part of the enby spectrum, as I don't completely identify with my AMAB, but I'm still masc-presenting and that makes me comfortable. I haven't tried looking androgynous though, but I'm pretty sure that, even if I don't completely feel like a man, I like how I look in the sense as of what gender I look like (I think I'm ugly and I'd want to change that, but that doesn't have anything to do with the gender thingy). You can be an enby and not be androgynous. Non-binary IS NOT a third binary, it is an umbrella term for ANYTHING that doesn't fit into the gender binary of men and women, and if there's anyone who says it's not like that, just say ""who asked?"" And move on. There's a lot of people who can relate, so just know that the people that will accompany you for all your live are there somewhere, and they're looking for you as much as you're doing with them. 


So, as a summary of what I just said: YOU. ARE. FRICKING. VALID. There's a lot of people like you out there, and they will be the ones to help you truly be yourself. You do have to accept what we're saying in this comment section; after all, I recognize that I have the problem with not applying the advice that I'm given and denying that it is even true, so I do not want to be like that, it is hurtful, and I don't want my enby pals to be hurt.
I understand what you mean...before I even knew I was nonbinary this was my understanding of it, a gender outside of male and female...only when I came to truly understand nonbinary as a spectrum did I understand that I myself was nonbinary too. For some enby people, it IS a third gender to them, and for some it is not, it exists outside the binary. So please know you're not alone in feeling this way. 💖 I often hear the same struggle in my head and gaslight myself into thinking I'm still cis and making this shit up. No, I am nonbinary and always will be. As are you 💛🤍💜🖤
I can relate. ""Passing"" as cis, and feeling like an imposter bc I can ""hide"" behind the appearance I'm mostly fine with, and my hetero appearing marriage. All I can think of is to try and find a friend group, even if that has to be online. No matter what you look like or your presentation, it's about how you feel about yourself that matters. I wish I had something better for you, just know that many other NB's feel like you do, at least we're suffering together.
i feel you and am in a similar boat from what i gather. almost all people assume i'm cis from what i look like, even if i tell them my pronoun, people don't use it, apart from the few close friends i have. even my therapist lowkey does not understand anything about gender, even after multiple explanations. the will is not there.

so this is probably a bad idea, but since cis people overwhelmingly are a lost cause, i decided to completely reject any opinion on the topic from them outright. they never had any authority or knowledge of me, my inner workings, so any attribution they try to pin on me is false from the get go. at least it's mentally freeing, but it does not magically make patriarchal gender norms vanish
Not sure if this will really help, but non-binary is an umbrella term. Under that falls agender (genderless), and androgyne (a state of gender between the two binaries), polygender (melting pot of gender expression). It seems like you’ve had trouble with people conflating these identities with non-binary. You don’t need to be in a state of androgyny/genderlessness to be non-binary. Non-binary is existing outside of the gender binary. There’s a ton of other identities in the non-binary umbrella (demi-girl/boy/non-binary, gender-fluid) which have people identifying with a certain gender expression. They are just as valid. But yeah, it’s silly Bc non-binary is to exist out of the binary so to create a box of rules that you need to satisfy just negates the point of being non-binary. No single non-binary person identifies the same, and that’s what is so cool. It’s unique to you. It doesn’t and shouldn’t look the same for everyone. You don’t need to identify with a certain micro label to be valid, just express yourself and your identity and be comfortable. That’s all you can do. <3
It sounds like you've had an unlucky draw as far as the people around you. Or maybe I've just been lucky. I'm a fem-presenting AFAB masc-aligned enby. Only once have I had an issue with someone I've come out to not respecting my identity. I live in an extremely conservative area and I cannot be out openly for my own safety. 

Most of my inner circle is trans and/or non-binary. That could be a factor. Are you able to find better social circles? I mean, even if you were a woman, having cishet guys who can't just be friends is an example of bad people around you, so clearly at least on that front this goes deeper than the transphobia issue?
I am a masc-presenting amab enby and doomed to be misgendered by everyone until the end of my days.
Another one of us here as well. You are valid, OP. You are valid, tisjustbrandon.
That is a lovely way of putting it. Going along the music analogy line, I’ve also heard that, to properly appreciate jazz music, you’re supposed to listen to where the notes AREN’T being played. Or something like that.

In other words: defy convention. Embrace individuality.
Anyhoo, hi, I’m nothanks, I’m thirty…six?, Canadian, a fab two gender, adhd, anxiety, two small children, actor and student on hiatus from both, i like playing with words and would like to someday do it for money. Books are my friends. Nice to meet you. Feel free to dm me if you ever need to vent or just wanna chat with a random internet friend.
I discovered how to maneuver between the notes when I first stepped onto an EDM dance floor. A queer friendly place where you fall in love, dance, befriend, sweat, and shed away the pain. I also discovered radical empathy.
It is amazing what music can do. And what affirming, friendly spaces can do too.
It’s been nearly eight years since I put everything in my rearview. I never fully assessed the damage that place had done to my self-esteem, my mental state and all the whatevers too. 

THAT place embraced authoritarian conformity. THOSE people took it upon themselves to mow down the first blade of grass that grew taller than the rest. 

I used to dance in my room listening to my dad’s vinyl album of Pearl Jam VS. 

I took a drive today
Time to emancipate
I guess it was the beatings... made me wise
But I'm not about to give thanks, or apologize
I couldn't breathe, holdin' me down
Hand on my face, pushed to the ground
Enmity gauged, united by fear
Forced to endure what I could not forgive...

I seem to look away
Wounds in the mirror waved
It wasn't my surface... most defiled
Head at your feet, fool to your crown
Fist on my plate, swallowed it down
Enmity gauged, united by fear
Tried to endure what I could not forgive

Saw things
Saw things
Saw things
Saw things
Clearer
Clearer
Once you, were in my...
Rearviewmirror...

I gather speed from you fucking with me
Once and for all I'm far away
I hardly believe, finally the shades...are raised...

Saw things so much clearer
(Once you, once you)

that skirt looks comfy and pretty

Yeah it’s taken quite a few years to overcome that but I’m slowly getting there!

Got misgendered all day 😔✌🏼 can someone pls tell me how masc people stand?? I was told I stand like a girl :((		"Really? I can't really tell your gender
You look masc to me, honestly. Dunno what to tell you. I'm sorry people around you aren't seeing the real you.
Hook your thumbs in your pockets, point your fingers towards your crotch and just stand
i mean you look hella masc in this pic but here's what i do: square your hips. your shoulders should be aligned with your hips , which should be aligned with your knees, which should be aligned with your ankles. try not to pop your hip or put your weight unevenly to one side. and when walking, try to focus on that alignment to prevent your hips from swaying.

as everyone else is saying, there's no one way to ""walk like a guy,"" but the above helps me with my own dysphoria.
Which person are you in the pic?
Dude, you look masc as any cis guy.
Bro wtf u look masc as hell here! I’m sorry people are being dumb >:(
You’re fine. People just say shit like that because they feel the need to defend themselves, which is super fucked up. I corrected a friend who has only ever known me as NB but continues to misgender me and she said “well when I look at you I see a woman”. And I was like .... do you even know how wrong that is to say...?
I don't get that. You look like a dude to me. How would someone even tell you aren't cis??
STOP YOU GUYS ARE SO NICE I LOVE YOU ALL ❤️❤️❤️
I'm amab, back in high school some people thought I was gay because of, no shit, *the way I walked.* Apparently having a skip in your step once in a while is feminine which means gay obviously right? Ignorant people will find any way they can to discriminate. It's wild.

Although I am bi, so I guess they were accidentally right in this case haha. I didn't know that in HS though.

In all my 28 years, I have never identified masculine or feminine ways of walking or standing, or...well, or anything else, but that's probably because I'm agender and don't see that stuff at all lol.

Anyway keep being awesome! <3
People get really confused and call me sir a lot. You could try popping your chest out more and widening your stance. Your hands look kind of dainty so if you like to put your hands in your pockets that might work better
I think this was a joke question and everyone actually telling them there is a way to ""stand masculine"" is harmful to us all.
u already look masculine as fuck with this stance though??? wtf?????

the Dude Stance^tm consists of:

* shoulders back slightly

* legs (thighs, knees, calves, feet) shoulder-width apart

* hands in pockets w/ thumbs out ^( (thumbs out optional)^)
""I was told I stand like a girl :(("" **WHAT DOES THAT EVEN *MEAN* THOUGH???**
your vibes are absolutely immaculate!!! the fits are on point you don't stand like a girl dw
I typically try to stand up straight, chin up a little, and one hand grasping the other wrist either in front of me or behind me. It’s also the type of energy you put out, masc is more confident and out there I noticed.
Thank u !!
I’m the one holding the phone :)
This was a genuine question... I’m sorry if this was offensive that wasn’t my intention I just wanted to appear more “masculine”
IKR!! LIKE DAMN WE GENDERIZING HOW WE STAND NOW???
Well, shit, those people have to be blind bc you look pretty masc! You've got a wide stance, your shoulders look good, its almost how I would stand. 

I see you as a pretty masc. person, so I dont know if I'm much help☠️
Okay thought it was for real meant as a joke. I get wanting to look more masculine. Just wish as non binary people we were redefining what it means to be masculine and feminine and not awelcoming cis measures of ourselves"	iyzk1e	NonBinary	144	0.99	2020-09-24 15:39:56
Tempted to just give up and be a woman	I get misgendered every day. At work, by family, by everyone. Our world is becoming more hostile towards trans people every day. Sometimes I want to just shove my feelings down, suck it up, and be a woman.	"This is why im not really out irl except to certain people. Dysphoria sucks too much for me to completely ignore it and also keep my mental sanity, but the threat of how the wrong person would react once they “find me out” is just not worth it to me rn. If asked, i wont deny my identity and ill give my preferred pronouns, and I still present myself in a way that’s comfortable but most people will assume im my agab and ill happily let them to avoid trouble.            
Being misgendered by people who dont know any better doesnt bother me when the alternative is a probably negative social interaction lol
This is a totally valid response to the feelings that you are feeling. Ultimately these things are your choice, but I think you must consider before you make it if this is truly what you want. It could be that it is your environment that is affecting the way that you feel or another external factor which might be possible for you to change? However remote.

Ultimately your decision is your decision but I would advise you not to make it on the basis of rage because doing that will only lead to further unhappiness, speaking from experience, not necessarily about the type of person but about the making decisions based in rage, never good.
I've been through this. I went back in the closet but it wasn't good there. Now I'm out in safe places but I don't introduce myself with pronouns, I'll take any because I realised other people's words don't make me who I am, I'm the only one who does that and I'll do what i like. It's hard and exhausting to be a frontrunner in social change and it doesn't negate your identity if you don't always have the energy to fight all the time. You are you and you know who you are.
I feel this pain about how the world is just so hostile against trans people. My friends gender me correctly and my spouse does too for the most part. 

My work, not so much but they try. It's really funny to read my year end reviews where my boss swaps from ""she/her"" to ""they/them"". 

For how the world it, it's totally valid to protect yourself. I don't think any one of us would fault another person for feeling unsafe and going right back in that closet. You do what you need for your mental health and physical safety. You will always be who you are, even if you go by something else. Never forget that. 

I'm old so IDGAF anymore and let them come at me. I'm also in a depressive state so don't follow my lead.
Yeah it's hard. I've come to the conclusion (for me) that at my age I give a fuck about any gender and rather be just the simple me. Someone calls me male? female? fish? I don't care. I am me. Let the world be fucking crazy and keep yourself sane. 

You are not alone.

But yeah, society is cruel.
I feel that too, it sucks so much and you’re not alone there. Hopefully things will get better for you and I, wishing you luck ❤️
I feel that as well. I look more feminine now and present more feminine but I am not a woman. I get tired of correcting people every time they say she or he.
I think about this sometimes, but then I remember that I'm going to be miserable either way so I might as well be miserable and be true to myself while making it easier (hopefully) for other people like me to exist in the future
The more I accepted that I don’t need to be seen and understood by people I’m not close to, the calmer my resolve and the simpler my life became. Dealing with social dysphoria as a sensitive trans person was hell for most of my existence tbh. Accepting the reality that people’s world views are often very simple and not accepting of difference is such a load off the old mind and body, friend. I hope you’re able to find peace and serenity to truly embody yourself. You deserve it.
I am sorry that you feel that way.

The media makes the world look so dark for us. Just remember that the media amplify hate for clicks.

In real life, every day is getting better for me. I keep meeting more trans people and finding more allies. I hope that you find other trans people and allies in your life.
Our world is not becoming more hostile towards trans people every day though.

Conservatives and TERFs didn't have to pass laws to go after LGBTQ+ people when the culture was there with them. It's because love and respect are winning that they are trying to mandate hate.  


Your feelings are valid, your pain is real, but there is more reason to hope than you may feel like there is.
Honestly, if you do that your feelings wont go away. It's hard to hear sometimes, but shoving it down doesnt make it go away and you will still feel the dysphoria and all the bad feelings about it. Your choice at the end of the day is how you deal with those feelings, do you want to take action and correct people, or maybe come out and just let whoever refuses refuse, or maybe you want to pretend it's not happening. Sometimes addressing it makes it easier to deal with as some people change their behaviors, whereas just saying your a woman could feel even worse because you will be constantly called one no matter what.

At the end of the day how you handle your discomfort is your business. I know it sucks to be in an unsupportive environment and constantly called the wrong things. But it is always on you how you want to handle it. I hope it gets better for you.
We still have to worry about those church people
You can't force yourself to be a gender just like gay ppl can't force themselves to be straight. I totally feel you, fr fr. But no matter what anyone else says you are who you are. I've only experienced pain trying to pretend to be someone I'm not. I'm sorry your feelings are hurt, you have the whole nb community on your side and we stick together. I love you. I wish you well. 😘😘😘
I share this feeling sometimes, which is why it’s important to find community where you’re gendered correctly and loved and accepted. Are there any non-binary online support groups you could look into? Many are free or sliding scale!
To start with, you ARE enby and you can't give that up. What you can give up is presenting to the world as enby and asking people to use your pronouns.  It is very painful to have everyone around you misgender you and fighting that on all fronts takes a HUGE amount of energy. 

You don't mention how long you've been out. It may be that those around you need (a lot) more time to get used to you being enby. Is this fair? Of couse not. But it is human. We humans are incredibly habitual creatures and don't like change. We only embrace change when the change benefits us. When it benefits another AND challenges our worldview, we fight it. With time, many people do eventually change their viewpoint. But I'm talking about months and probably years, here. 

You ARE allowed to step back from the fight. If you are concerned about not standing up and fighting to change society's views, then remember it is not all on you. You are not the only one. Activists, of all kinds, have to step away at times. In fact, professional guides to activism advocate stepping away for a year or two, even more, to avoid burnout. You fight when you can. When you are exhausted, you rest.

You say that everyone around you continues to misgender you. That cuts deep. I wonder if deep down you think/feel that refusal is ""your fault"" in some way? Well, it isn't. Not remotely. Some years ago, part of my family rejected me when I was grieving the loss of my father. I was so hurt and angry for years. I couldn't understand what was wrong with me that they didn't love me. Then, slowly, I realized it wasn't about me, but them. It is their limitation - they can't be any other way. So now I know who they are. I know they'd be there for me in some situations but not others.

If you do decide to step back, please do not feel bad about doing so. You have a right to protect yourself. Where you are now is not the rest of your life. You WILL at some point change jobs. You WILL meet other people. You will contribute to the non-binary community. Change is slow but inevitable.
Let me ask you this, what is a woman? What does 'being a woman' look like to you?
No don't give up as a Trans Fem your important as a non binary or Transmasc brother
Ayooo suck it up and be yourself whoever and whatever that is! And if whoever and whatever doesn't like that? Cut em out. 💖🦊Be you boo boo love and acceptance aren't guaranteed everywhere, but they are guaranteed everywhere you'll be happy.
This is such a completely valid way to feel. I have felt super similar, especially with the climate for trans friends. Please hear me when I say that your existence and who you are is no one's decision but yours. You get to be who you are. I know it's so hard when you have such little support, but there are so many individuals who fully support you and fully understand what you're going through. Who you are is absolutely beautiful. You have every right to live as loudly and joyfully as you can. Because being trans/nonbinary/however you identify :) so fucking amazing. You got this.
I have lots of positive faith in our future, though. I think things will be very different in a decade or so, but will just be very rough getting there. Most anti-trans people, at least in most developed/industrialized countries, will be dead in 20 years, and it will make the world a better place. The younger stragglers will be pressured to shut up and closet their beliefs once the rest of their louder minority and the lawmaking grifters that cater to them finally die. I just think they’re gonna want to go out with a final bang, and thats part of why things are as bad as they’ve become. They hate that younger people are gaining political power simply by growing up and having other beliefs and they want to attack it sooooo bad, and so thats what they are doing, but its a response to changing attitudes, so the hope is high.
This. So much this. I’m out everywhere. The more self confidence I have about who I am the less it matters what other people think or say. The people who love me support me and use correct name and pronouns or correct themselves. The rest don’t deserve my energy or time.

One of my best friends turned out to be transphobic	"As the title says, one of my best friends, which I've known for 12 years, turned out to be a major transphobic asshole.

A few days ago, another dear friend of mine came out as NB to our friend group, and while most of them was supporting, even if a bit confused, he remained silent about it.

Yesterday, while we were out without my other friend, he kept mocking them, misgendering them and deadnaming them, constantly saying that ""he just can't respect it""

I was planning to come out to them, but that hurt me a lot and made me change my mind since I'm still in the closet, and I've known him since we were 9"	"This person is not a friend. A real one wouldn’t be a jackass about something this important.
I'm sorry that one of the close people in your life turned out to be like this. Its always so hard to believe.
Wow, that’s gotta hurt 😔 what’s worse is he probably never saw the real you. Friends like that are very “surface-level only” kinds of connections, not worth keeping imo
I would come out anyways and show solidarity to your NB friend, and drop the asshole that's dragging your group down. It's hard to lose childhood friends, but it happens a lot as we grow older. Better friends will come along, and old ones may grow and come back better people. But there is no point in pandering to assholes just because you've known them a long time. If you never expected that friend to be like that, tell them you're disappointed. Maybe they'll grow up a bit.
To misquote The Specials:

If you have a transphobe friend

Now is the time, now is the time

For that friendship to end.
This person is not a friend, and doesn't deserve to be one. Lots of support to both you and your enby friend tho!
yeah drop him like a hot potato
Yea you have to break off the friendship, for your own sanity
I'm sorry, that is so disappointing and painful. Hugs. 🖤💜🤍💛
If you want someone to vent to I am here, it has happened to me so many times so stay strong! ( ;
You know, everyone in this thread is really quick to tell you to cut them off. But if you are really friends, don't you love them enough to at least try? Maybe something else is going on? Maybe they are also struggling with this, and that's why they're rejecting it? Or maybe they are struggling with a different kind of identity issue, like being gay, and they're hiding it and resent when someone else can be open? Maybe they are rejecting it because they feel like they're going to get left behind? If enough people in the friend group are not ""mainstream"", will you all gang up on the one ""mainstream"" person? I'm just saying, it doesn't mean that your friend is a bigot. Sometimes people are acting out their own fears, and really all they want is to be accepted too. If you really love them, I would suggest that you really try and ask them what's going on with them too that would make them feel anti- {truth/freedom/etc} - if you can figure out why they are rejecting something that doesn't really even affect them, then maybe you will come closer as friends and can help them avoid living a life of bigoted actions!
That's true, when I was in denial especially as a young teen I practically feared anything gay because of how my parents and the news talked about it.

I remember parroting a lot of what my parents said and ghosting a poor online chatroom friend when they introduced themselves (i feel absolutely awful about this now). I really dropped the parroting when my bf came out to me and shocked me with the news that both she and her parents were bi lol. But it took a long long time for me to come to terms with the hate I gave myself.

It's not an excuse for the behavior but it is a reason.

 If they can be reasoned with I say give them a chance. This will take time. Make sure to correct them with logic and examples. If they can't be reasonable I'd say get some distance. They're not ready and you and your other friend don't deserve to carry their nonsense.
No. Transphobia is neither the victim's fault nor their responsibility.
I'm not sure where you're coming from. I don't think I said that it was their fault, nor did I say it was their responsibility. Doesn't treating every person like a person mean treating every person like a person?"	q3902u	NonBinary	147	1.0	2021-10-07 13:23:19
"dad says it ""hurts"" him to call me by my correct pronouns"	"(I use ae/aer btw)

How do you even respond to that? How am I supposed to communicate that my feelings are more important than his in matters of MY identity? That my gender has nothing to do with him? I've told him most of this already but he's a very sensitive person, and insists that calling me ae or aer instead of my dead pronouns would hurt him deeply and compromise his values. It's so frustrating to have to fight him on this all the time (I don't have the resources to move out yet).

The thing is, he's AWARE that misgendering hurts and that continuing to misgender me will cost him our relationship. And he's broken into tears before, begging me not to cut him off because of this. He says he cares sO mUcH about his family, when he actively refuses to treat me with the basic respect he gives my cis family members.

I've suggested him calling me by they/them instead, apparently has the same effect. I've suggested him just not gendering me at all (using name only), but he's refused that too.

No matter what I say, he doesn't seem to hear me.

Sorry for length, but I need to get this off my chest.

Edit: Thank you all for the support and advice. It means a lot. You're wonderful, have a great day/night :)"	"Damn, sorry about your situation. 

It sounds like you realise he needs to respect you or he'll lose you, you're being realistic and maintaining your self-respect. All you can do now is wait to see if he'll set himself straight...and don't tolerate him knowingly misgendering in the mean time, you're already being gentle enough with him.
this part is really getting to me,  the way you said ""he cares so much about his family""  does he phrase it like that? does he ever say that he ""cares so much"" about YOU? or does he only care about the idea of looking like a supportive dad to outsiders. this really isn't on you, you have offered compromises. multiple in fact. but he has this irrational attachment to your dead pronouns and I don't want to accuse... but he might be hung up on you just being his child, not his son/daughter because there are specific rules and gender norms between dad and daughter/son that many people think cannot be interchangeable, let alone taking the gender binary out of the question entirely. you could prod him with more questions about why it hurts him and try to get to the root of it. but honestly, do exactly what you need to do to protect yourself and your mental/physical well-being. if that means cutting him off,,, I have a strong suspicion he'll care more about the social appearance, if he misses you and is still unwilling to acknowledge your gender and use your pronouns, it's a version of you that does not exist.
He is trying to manipulate you.

Edit: Added a verb
If someone repeatedly breaks boundaries they are not a healthy person in your life, I'm sorry op I understand what it's like. It sounds like he's gaslighting you
Sounds like he sees you as a possession more than a person. Like you're ""his"" family. Some dads be like that. They see family as something they were promised, or something they worked hard to get, the way that one might work for a good house or car and be rewarded for one's efforts with success, with a picture-perfect storybook to boast to friends about. It's a common side effect of the patriarchy or whatever. And pulling tears here isn't that far from a toddler's behaviour crying when someone wants to take away their toy dolls.

Live your own best life. His hurt is not your responsibility! But supporting you was his. He's the one who's broken the social contract here, not you.
They/them is a pronoun that works for any person of any gender. ""Who just blew through that red light?!? THEY must have been on THEIR phone!"" It's a catch-all. Everything else is someone requesting more specific pronouns, including people who prefer he/him or she/her over the ambiguous case. There is no reason to value he/him and she/her over ze/zir or ae/aer or Fae/faer. They're all the same value, the only thing is this culture brainwashes people into binary thinking and look where that gets us lmao.

If your parent refuses to understand this basic English concept in order to uphold their dumbass beliefs and continuously guilt trips you about having the feelings you do, I suggest retaliation. She probably won't like you misgendering her on a daily basis. But if preferred pronouns aren't respected in that house, then don't respect em. She can go cry by herself some more. Sometimes people are so self centric and have so little empathy that you have to show them how their actions hurt you for them to understand :/
That's not very nice of him... Here, sending positive vibes

He's manipulating you like crazy, oh no you hurt me you hurt me, I'm a victim. Reverse the victim emotional abuse and he's likely not aware he's doing it, but likely believes it'll mean he gets his way.

Tell him it logically follows that if it hurts you to be misgendered and it hurts him to gender you appropriately, then he'd rather you feel more pain and lose you than suffer a little bit himself using a different pronoun.

And that's fucked up to rather your kid hurt and lose the kid than suffer a little yourself and being a shitty unsupportive parent. You deserve better, and you can tell him until he's ready to suffer using a different word he doesn't deserve to be in your life.

My best to you ❤️
If it compromises his values so much to treat you with respect and prioritize your feelings on your identity that he refuses, then clearly having you in his life isn’t his priority. I know he doesn’t listen but goddamn I want to shake this man. Tell him caring doesn’t mean shit if he won’t *act* like it. If he cared, he’d respect. And if he says no, he really does care, well he’s given you no reason to believe him. He cares about a [assigned gender], not you.

You don’t have to say all that to him if you’re not comfortable, I’m just seething just reading this.
sounds like he's manipulating you op.
Yeah I feel you. I’m currently no contact with my parents for similar reasons. My mom thought I wasn’t being considerate of how difficult this all was for her, in spite of me offering many resources, offering kind reminders, all my siblings using my name and pronouns. 

This is such a sucky situation. Hang in there OP!
That is a pertically difficult diphthong (sliding vowel) Tell him his mouth muscles will strengthen.
compromises his values, huh? what are his values - to be an uncaring shithead? parents will really tell us they care, but not enough to conpromise their bullshit values... idk about your dad, but my mum can't even tell me what those values are, just that respecting my identity goes against them.
Sucks to be him I guess

While I am def biased coz I haven’t spoken to my father in almost a decade, I’m still gonna say it:

Fuck him. If your father is incapable of doing what’s right by you and is still trying to emotionally manipulate you to not disown him, then he is pretty clear about what is actually important to him.

Its not up to you to fix him, its up to him. And letting him stay in your life while he still doesn’t change is just giving him the excuse to not change.

Maybe never speaking to him for years will get him to change, maybe not. But in the end, you will not be the person being hurt by his actions, he will.
Hey my dad is being a piece of shit to me right now too and I'm in the same boat. Both our dads are normies apparently. Blugh. I'm sorry.
How do you even pronounce ae/ aer.I’m NB too but I can’t wrap my head around how to actually sound that out .…
I am sorry to hear that. And that I just complete disrespectful of your father
Sorry that’s just disgusting and bullshit excuses 😤😤 i’m so sorry you have to put up with that OP :((
If your dad can’t figure out how to use any of the options you’ve offered to use pronouns which you’re comfortable with, it’s clear he doesn’t really support/care about you. Keep that in mind with what info you share with him and other support you ask for.

Unrelated: this is the first I’ve heard of ae/aer pronouns-can anyone help me with pronunciation? Does it sound like “eye” and “air” like my brain tells me? Google will tell me how to use them but I’ve yet to see how to pronounce them
Thank you. It's nice to hear that I'm not being too pushy with this.
100% agreed. I would say an escalation is warranted if that is safe.
Yep, he phrases it like that. And every time I bring up the subject, he talks about how much he cares about me as well, but he seems hung up on the person he wants me to be, not the person I am. He won't give me a straight answer about why it hurts him, other than ""because you're a \[dead pronoun\].""  Thanks for the suggestions and the support, I appreciate it.
aww thanks :)
I just pronounce them like ay (as in play)/air, though I know for some there's a subtly different pronunciation for aer-- like in between air and ayer, I think?
I just pronounce them like ay (as in play)/air, though I know for some there's a subtly different pronunciation for aer-- like in between air and ayer, I think?
honestly, if you are able to, bail. thats just guilt tripping you, and if he wont respect you enough to see who you are, then you need to respect yourself by removing a tumor.
that really sucks, dude. it's clear he doesn't care about you, but either his image as a perfect father or his idea of you as a perfect child.
That’s cool! I’ve learned something new today.
That’s a really shallow way of looking at things. “He doesn’t care about you”. It’s not helpful and probably not true.
ok i was potentially too harsh there lol, but like. however much he cares, he doesn't care as much about OPs feelings as about his 'values' or his 'perfect child'.

then again, maybe he really doesn't see how much harm it's causing OP. either way, the dad sucks."	vhqv2i	NonBinary	145	0.97	2022-06-21 23:36:53
I'm jealous of binary trans people	"I have no idea if this is a bad thing to say, and if it is, I apologize. But as I've started to come out, I've realized that I am jealous of binary trans people.

As an enby, I have to disclose my transness to every single person I meet if I want my pronouns to be used. I can't ever ""pass."" I'm constantly having to correct people about what pronouns or gendered terms they use for me, and I will never be able to escape that. 

I'm not saying being a binary trans person is easy, I know it's not. But I can't help wishing that there was a way that I could just have my correct pronouns used and not be misgendered every time I meet or happen to cross paths with a stranger. 

Does anyone else feel this way? Is it ok to feel this way? Yet again, I am so so sorry if this is offensive in any way."	"Yeah, absolutely. It would be great if there was a way to communicate my pronouns to strangers without verbally coming out to them, and it would be great if nonbinary genders were taken as seriously as cis people's genders are.

But I know that ultimately even the socially entrenched concept of ""passing as a gender"" harms gender nonconforming people, as it enforces *their* misgendering. So it's frustrating to look at part of the privilege cis people have and be simultaneously jealous and also resentful of the social structure that gives them benefits at the cost of others.
As someone who enjoys presenting masculinely regardless of my current gender experience, and who uses both they and he pronouns, I present as binary in public for this reason. 

Safety, less defending of my gender, less misgendering. 

It still makes me sad that my whole will never be recognized properly and it can be particularly hard on days my gender experience is significantly more nonbinary. 

Basically, all this to say yes. I get it.
FWIW... I'm a binary trans person and do not find it offensive in any way. It is perfectly valid feeling. There really is no perfect answer for everyone. Nearly everything has both good and bad aspects. There are times I look at non-binary trans people and get jealous of some of the better parts. We just need to accept the good with the bad and work to make the good gooder and bad less bader.
One small suggestion that might help is to get a pronoun pin with your preference. It might help a bit. Good luck!
Same, I’m so jealous of binary trans people.
Yeah. I'm about as neutral as they come but no one will even know to use they/them with me unless I out myself, and i never know when it's truly safe to do so. People might be chill with the idea of binary trans people but not on board with nonbinary. It's a struggle.
I agree. There is no way I can every be androgynous enough, wear enough pronoun pins, have enough of a medical transition or surgery or anything to “pass” because it doesn’t exist due to the perception of a binary. I used to try really hard to pass but as I have felt more affirmed in my life and in my self it’s been easier not to.
In fairness, I don’t pass and I end up in a similar situation. So I can empathize. It sucks.
100% understandable. I'm nonbinary, and, there are -many- struggles to being trans, regardless of your gender. But Binary genders at the very least exist in a society that, generally, expects and assumes binary folks. 

They of course still have plenty of trans struggles that we all share, but they don't need to explain their gender. (obv there's exceptions to this. Things like folks who present differently then their gender by choice or otherwise, gender nonconforming folks, etc, but just, talking about being a binary trans person vs a nonbinary trans person. So many folks see life entirely through the lens of the binary that if youre not in it its a lot to unpack)

It doesn't invalidate the struggles of others, we all have our unique ones. In this case one of ours is just, ""Society expects a binary""
I can feel that.

I was born in Turkey. Turkish is genderless, there is only the word “o” for third-person singular and “onlar” for third-person plural.

So, if you say something like “he/she/it did that”, you would say “o yapti”. Only if you wanted to specifically mention that “o” was a man, you would say “o adam yapti” or “o kadin yapti” (the latter for woman). No other word ever is gendered in Turkish. There are no articles, nothing like in roman, germanic, or anglo-languages.

Now imagine coming from that language into a country such as Germany with a language that is absolutely, 100% the opposite: everything is gendered; you can’t even say “Doctor” or “Driver” or any other profession without gender (Arzt/Ärztin & Fahrer/Fahrerin, respectively).

In Turkish, I can be 100% me, because, being Enby and Turkish being an “Enby-Language”, there  is no need to explain anything. Try that in German.

I’m a Software Engineer, so in German I would need to write EITHER “Software-Entwickler” OR “Software-Entwicklerin”. Technically, the first one is supposed to also be gender-neutral, but it is always immediately seen male.. 

F*** my life for coming from a completely genderless language to the only 100% gendered language on this planet :-)

Edit: just to clarify: I’m not really complaining, I find my experience with the two languages actually extremely funny…
> Is it ok to feel this way?

It's okay to feel however you feel. Your feelings are yours.

How you act on your feelings and to some degree how you talk about them is when it's possible to get into ""not okay"" territory. And yeah, jealousy is a good one to be careful with in that respect.

For what it's worth, my impression is that you are doing a fine job of talking about your feelings without hurting anybody.

> Does anyone else feel this way?

For me... sort of.

I think I don't really want to be affirmatively recognized as ""a non-binary person"" based on how I look. The version of ""passing"" that I want out of stranger interactions is for people to look at me, fail to draw any concrete conclusions about ""my gender"" at all, and then just treat me like a human being rather than picking one of ""the two (or three, or however many) human being subcategories"". While I don't think I'll ever be able to go through the world and have that be the norm, I think it's pretty realistic that it'll happen once in a while in friendlier environments.
we’re forging a new future for ourselves and our fellow non binary. short term oddity for a long term normality
that’s at least the way i look at it
I could have written this myself. Thank you.
I feel this enormously. I’m nonbinary transmasc. I have some days where I feel more like a guy and some where I feel more agender but I’m always somewhere between the two. I like to describe my gender as “none gender with left masc” (for those familiar with internet relic none pizza with left beef), and sometimes “guy adjacent”. While I am in the process of medically transitioning and it makes me happy to see the changes testosterone brings, I still get misgendered by people (both strangers and people I have known a long time) and it sucks to out myself to everyone to avoid feeling like shit getting misgendered all day every day. Not only that, but living in a relatively conservative area of my state means most people don’t even KNOW what non-binary means unless I do the emotional labor of explaining the umbrella, its terms, and my experience, let alone how gender differs from presentation and pronouns differ from both of those. And even then lots of people don’t understand. It’s easier to tell people I’m a trans guy and deal with misgendering sometimes, but even then I feel like I’m lying to myself and others. The other part of me knows I don’t owe anyone anything, and if I have to tell half-truths or keep quiet to save my sanity then there is nothing stopping me. I am slightly envious of people who can just “pick” a gender and that I am stuck in a bit of a societal limbo. Dealing with hate is exhausting, but fuck so are micro aggressions and erasure.
I feel this, too, but luckily for me pronouns don't bother me so much, even if I do prefer they/them. Ma'am is the only one that really makes my skin crawl. Is there a way to make ""sam"" a thing? :p

 I like to look at this from the other side too. I feel like there is way less pressure to pass, so I can express myself more freely. I have been considering a pronoun pin though.
I definitely relate. It's especially tough when your gender identity doesn't really line up with your presentation in a binary way. Like, I'm AFAB but identify as sort of neutral-demiboy. My pronouns are he/they, I prefer male gendered terms. But I also am pretty femme in general- I like to wear makeup and colored hair and jewelry. So my chances of getting properly gendered by a stranger at this point in my life is pretty much non-existent lol.
I've legit prayed to be binary my friend - then it would at least feel straightforward what to do with my dysphoria, wouldnt have to deal with this constant need to balance the weird conflicting duality shit, I would be more respected by cis and LGBT, and I wouldn't have to worry about tweaking the narrative if I ever get the chance to ask a doctor about hormones.
Also imma say it right now, dysphoria level =/= measure of binary. Some binary people say they are driven more by euphoria than dysphoria, and plenty of nb people deal with dyphoria just as bad as the binary trans person. Everyone's different.
Yeah I definitely feel this. The closest I can get, I think, is to present in a way such that people who are familiar with nonbinary people will read me as nonbinary. But even that is really hard! Without pronoun pins it's happened, like, maybe twice in six-ish years of varying levels of being openly nonbinary.

It's not binary trans people's fault that I have to give a Gender 101 class to every goddamn cis person I meet -- but there are definitely days I wish I could just go ""I'm a girl, I don't need to teach you what a girl is"" yanno?
I'm enby but use she/her, and I feel you. Pronoun pins don't work in most environments, and not many people use neutral pronouns for people they know in their life.

I will use they/them for anyone I suspect to be non binary, but not every non binary person is androgynous, and not every non binary person uses they/them. 

I suppose we'll just have to wait until being trans/GNC is normalised so that people don't feel ashamed of being trans.
My experience with this is that for strangers ill never see again i dont even bother to correct them but when its with ppl i have to fo with on a regular basis i definitely correct them anf yeah i agree that it can get hella annoying especially when someone just dosent realise what harm their doing when misgendering me time and time again. But my way of thinking about fhis may just be because german, my mother tounge, dosent have any good gender neutral pronouns.
I can relate,  but extend those type of thoughts to cis people too. I don’t feel jealous so much as confused and disappointed . I seek to be as gender neutral as possible as that is me. I have to use my AG pronouns or adopt the other because of my work. I am irritated by that. Also my therapist and psychiatrist don’t seem to think any of this is worth discussing. I am afraid if I bring it up I’ll get yet another diagnosis handed to my ass and medicated for it. 😡 so mostly do she/they and folks be like what’s that and are you sure you’re enby? But hate my body for it’s feminine shape. Dispise
I feel this. My presentation is decidedly fem and I use they/she pronouns, so I don't really have a problem with strangers misgendering me per se. But even so I find it a bit weird and frustrating that only people I know use they/them for me. Noticing the pattern makes it obvious that although people use the right language they are still seeing me as something other than what I am.
I’m exactly the same. If anyone irl (or even in parts of the internet that aren’t specific to non-binary people) asks, I’m just a guy. If the person I’m talking to seems to be accepting, then I might tell them I’m a trans guy. I don’t tell people the truth about what I am because it’s safer that way. It’s actually kind of sad that we have to do this, thinking about it, but unfortunately that’s how it has to be for now.
While I do agree that this can be a good idea, it only really works if you spend your time around accepting and open-minded people. Otherwise it might actually put you in a worse, potentially even dangerous situation. A lot of people will take one look at a pronoun pin and see it as an invitation for harassment."	tpjlxb	NonBinary	139	0.98	2022-03-27 13:09:14
the nonbinary urge to put pronoun pins on my work uniform (though I’ve still only been misgendered since)		"It's disappointing, but I got misgendered *less* when I *stopped* wearing a pronoun pin at work. People just suck.
are you an emt?
I started to consider wearing a pronoun pin in my class outfit ‘cause I receive a lot of misgender :(
We would love to see more of you you look beautiful
that is very disappointing :/
yes!
I’m sorry about that. it might help? I’m trying to figure out my best route since I’m not *technically* out to my colleagues— I have no problem telling people my pronouns but I don’t regularly work with the same people so it kinda becomes a lot to do every time you know?
Aahh that’s rad! I just graduated EMT academy and now I am studying for the NREMT (I’ve scheduled it for the end of April).
Ouh, I see :( in my case I’m with the same coworkers each week, but none of them takes care about my neutral pronouns because they don’t accept to use any inclusive formula in Spanish (instead of él-ella/he-she, elle/they) or Catalan (instead of ell-ella/he-she, elli/they), and it’s frustrating. I’m not at this point on my life, but maybe tattooing my pronouns in my face could work to be treated as who am I 😅
I’m in the same boat. I just wear the pins and only actually come out to people I know I will work with a bunch (which is few people).
awesome! congrats on graduating. the NREMT is a bear but if you prep right you’ll be okay. don’t be disappointed or ashamed if you have to take it more than once— many people do. I love EMS & field work and hope that you will too!
yeah, fingers crossed people will catch on. I worked with a nurse for 12 hours recently who I watched look directly at my pin, read it, then proceed to go out of her way to address me in the second person as ‘she’ TO MY FACE for the entirety of the shift, and I KNOW she saw it because she acknowledged it. she was making it very clear that she wanted me to know that she not only didn’t give a shit, but wanted to make it a whole thing. 

I’m never going to choose to work another shift with her if I can help it. I just don’t have space in my life for that noise anymore. I still have some hope for my other coworkers, but that was the first day I had the pin, and damn if it wasn’t knife to the back (well, face, more like).
Can I ask what prep tools you used? I paid for a subscription to a test question bank (emt-national-training.com)

Did you study much from your textbook?
Oof that is completely awful. Yeah I still get misgendered a bunch, thankfully I have been pretty lucky that no one has been that cruel to me. Even people I do the whole song and dance to come out to at work have a very hard time using my pronouns. I think medicine is just surprisingly stuck in the past with stuff like this :/

I wish you lots of good energy though! We are worth being recognize and respected ❤️
I found practice test questions to be the most helpful for me. of course make sure you’ve read your book and done your schoolwork— if you don’t have the baseline understanding, ranges, assessment, etc. then you won’t get very far— but the NREMT tests in such a specific way that there isn’t much like the simulators/practice questions. once you have your baseline, just practice the questions. I split a subscription to medic tests with a classmate and found it very helpful. 

I would suggest when you do the questions, study them in this order:
1. read the question, and before looking at the options, come up with your own answer/line of thought 
2. read the options and pick the best one (you may change your mind once presented with the options, and that’s okay)
3. before submitting it, justify why the other answers are either wrong or less right. the NREMT gets you sometimes by giving you all right answers and you have to pick the *most* right. 
4. go back and review the results
this will help you review and have a comprehensive understanding of the material.  if you’re able to come up with the right answer before even seeing the options, you’re going to set yourself up as a competent test-taker. you take the guesswork out of picking the answer and you hold yourself more accountable for the material. 

even just employing this line of questioning is going to make you both a good test-taker AND a good EMT. the NREMT doesn’t necessarily directly prepare you for being a good EMT in a practical sense, but this line of thought will help you so much in the field. when you get the call, before you even see the patient, you’re brainstorming with your partners. you’re thinking of what is happening, what the options are, and most importantly, what can go wrong. it will serve you and your patients!"	teeqjj	NonBinary	140	1.0	2022-03-15 02:42:08
"I Finally Understand ""Any Pronouns"""	"I've come to a realization regarding what I want from other people in regard to respecting my identity. My preferred pronouns are they/them, but I've begun to understand people who use ""any pronouns"" which I never questioned but also never understood. However, being friends with people who respect and accept me as being non-binary has shown me that even people who try make a lot of mistakes. Weirdly, it doesn't feel nearly as bad to be accidentally misgendered by people who I know accept and support my identity. As long as they're trying and use neutral language most of the time, I don't mind an occasional mix-up. The key thing I've realized is that I just want to be seen as non-binary rather than my AGAB. I would be fine with ""any pronouns"" from people who I know are supportive, but I don't want to give people a free pass to not make an effort."	"I go by any pronouns because none of them feel right, i think I have an issue with people referring to me in general lol
I use any. I’m genderfluid and I feel most like a many-faceted genderful being, all genders at once all the time. I contain multitudes and all that. My ideal would be that people switch between them, I think that’s fun, but I have found that tends to TERRIFY my cis allies lol… instead people seem to pick one and exclusively use that which I guess is the next best thing.
I use my agab pronouns, and honestly i would be okay with whatever pronouns. it’s a personal choice just because in my own head, the pronouns someone else calls me doesn’t change how I feel about my own gender presentation. i stress that this is my own journey im talking about, and everyone’s mileage will certainly vary
I use any. I want to be seen as both and i prefer that people just use their first assumption of me.
I use they/them pronouns, but I suppose I would love to not care to the degree that any pronouns would be good. Because I don't like to give gender legitimacy or give language that power over me. But I do care. But I tend to just let strangers assume whatever they assume.
the conversations in the comments is why I put they/ them instead of any/all. I'd rather people use they/them exclusively than she/her (my agab), even though it would be nice to get the occasional he/him. I'm genderfluid and genuinely don't mind which pronouns people use, I just don't want to be referred to as she/her ALL the time!
This is the only reason I say ""any pronouns except she/her"". I know if I gave that option a lot of people would opt for that without a second thought. If someone is genuinely supportive about my gender experience, then them saying she occasionally (not always, just sometimes mixed in with other pronouns) would not bother me. I typically say ""he/they"", in spaces with more gender diversity I say ""he/they/it"" or ""any pronouns except she"". I've also offered to be people's learning curve to get the hang of neopronouns or it/its or they/them pronouns for their other friends or such. Because I don't mind these pronouns and if they slip up when talking about me I'm not hurt by it. They use me to practice using these ""unusual"" pronouns, they get used to it faster and are better able to adjust for their friend, who actually *does* feel hurt by slip ups. So yeah. I would use any pronouns too but as everything stands right now, I know that if people had the option to use she/her they would never use anything else so I say ""anything except she/her""
Yeah, I use they/them but I'm leaning a twinge towards not caring? But not enough to actively say 'hey yeah you can use any pronouns for me'.
I've gotten to the point that I know who I am and that's enough for me.
I use “any pronouns” on the surface because people are gonna people and I don’t have the energy to care. What others perceive is what they perceive. I know what I am and when I actually meet people who I care to get to know more (or Im gonna be around them regularly) then I tell them I strongly prefer they/them. 

Although, after medically transitioning (haven’t been able to start) Id like to be exclusively they/she in the future when Im more femme leaning androgynous presentation wise. I know presentation/expression isn’t necessary for identity, but for me it’s important in my journey that the identity I have in mind matches my presentation/expression and vice versa.
I used to use any pronouns, recently I've only been using he/him and she/her because 1- the neutral pronouns in my native language don't really make me feel anything besides maybe start a fight between a cadually transphobic person in the vicinity and I don't feel.it fits my gender identity and 2- the neutral pronoun in english it's just so normal to me I don't.even realize people are using it so I don't feel like it's worth mentioning

Overall it's just about comfort, I have non binary friends who use all because they like all and want to be called by all. I don't mind they/them pronouns in English and I like it, but I would rather you call me either he/him or she/her in my native language
This is so relatable, I’d be fine hearing he/him occasionally if it didn’t just mean any and all strangers would just default to only using them
I use any pronouns but prefer they/them and neopronouns since it's most accurate to how I perceive myself. However she/her honors my connection to womanhood, he/him honors my desires of medically transitioning and transmasculinity. I dunno sometimes I feel inclined towards certain pronouns but at the end of the day I'm some flavor of nonbinary and any pronouns honor that.
I believe its not always like that, yes there are many people that think like you, my gf is one of them, but I have seen lots of cis people who say ""any pronoums"" just cause they really dont care or have no preference. What I never understood about those cis people is that they usually only refer to themselves in their agab pronoum, and dont really use the others, in those cases I think it doesnt make any sense to say it.
As someone who is gender-fluid (less so as I start to pass as a girl more and more consistently although I’ll always have a deeply boyish side) I go by any pronouns because sometimes I intentionally pass as a girl and sometimes Im intentionally presenting in boy mode and I’m comfortable doing both. At some point I think my pronouns will switch to exclusively she/her once I’m deep into my transition and (hopefully) stealth, but for now I’m comfortable with anything because I’m pretty in control of what gender people see me as.
I go by any/all because they all feel right to me at different times but I'm not going to expect whoever I'm speaking with to know if I'm feeling more femme, masc, or anywhere in between or separate when I don't even know myself half the time. As long as people are being respectful, I'm genuinely good with whatever.
I use he/they but I think the only reason I dislike she pronouns is because I know that the people who use it for me are perceiving me as a cis woman and that makes me feel dysphoric. If I knew I wasn’t being seen that way, I think I’d be an any pronouns person.
To me, ""any pronouns"" means ""I sincerely don't care how you perceive me and any pronouns work for me"".
In theory I'm fine with any pronouns, because it's like referring to me by just one letter of my name - incomplete, but not fundamentally unapplicable? Like, call me anything but late for dinner. 

But at the same time I really loathe people defaulting to pronouns based on my perceived gender and I hate having my AGAB's pronouns used for me because it inevitably feels like they're just calling me what they think they see. 

In a vacuum of zero transphobia and nobody being shitty/weird about my gender, my genitals, my pronouns, or my chosen name: any pronouns. 

In reality: they/them or ji/jer (xi/xer?) are the ones that don't put my ears back.
Tbh the right people won't slip up and will be able to see you as who you are.
I use any pronouns because I know that the people who care about me see me as me and for everyone else in the world I don’t want to share that part of me. I never have to correct people on my pronouns  because you can’t get them wrong.
I don’t think I’d ever be okay with any pronouns. Being referred to as they/them or my agab pronouns are typically fine with me. After reading some comments, I can understand why those who feel very fluid with their gender may be okay with any pronouns.
Q: How would you like for me to refer to you?

A: Don’t.
Time to start using no pronouns!/half-joking

Although I use any pronouns, no pronouns has a special place in my heart, lol.
Then you can go by no pronouns
yeah like just don't talk about me, idk. everything is uncomfortable and I hate it
I felt this in my soul
Hey, I feel the same way! I wish people would switch it up, but I also feel like that's too much to ask. 

Also, being amab (for me) makes it difficult when 90% of people refer to me with he/him. Having a whole vulnerable conversation around how I tell if people respect my identity and that I'd like other pronouns even though I'm any/all is just... exhausting. Plus, it doesn't change their behavior half the time :/
Exactly this! I really do feel like all pronouns fit me but I wish everyone mixed and matched them all the time ahaha, that would be my perfect world. At least my partner does, that'll be good enough for now
Yes I feel this! I used to not care about pronouns and all anyone used was she/her and I realized how sad that made me. So now nobody gets to use those for me.
Okay but that was me before my egg fully cracked. I was ambivalent towards my gender. I said stuff like ""any pronouns are fine"" even though I still basically identified as cis female. I just hadn't sat down and really thought about it. I used she/her pronouns as a default out of sheer habit, if nothing else. 

I'm not saying this is true for all cis people who say they're fine with ""any pronouns"" but it definitely could be the case for some. If you're ambivalent, and haven't really sat down and asked yourself questions, you just default to what you're used to.
Same!
*I* slip up sometimes based on how others talk about me. I have friends/a partner who are >95% accurate with my pronouns and even they make mistakes. It is impossible to expect perfection with gender neutral pronouns and language given the current contextual factors of society.
And that’s the coolest fucking thing. If you want to have every pronoun, you can. And if you don’t… then don’t. 
We are free, no longer constrained by the incredibly dull binary system.
I'm not genderfluid, but I'm all too familiar with the devastation of people refusing to view you as anything other than a ""man"" with all of the harmful stereotypes that such entails. It's exhausting and incredibly disrespectful.
Right?? I feel like I can't be **me**, I'm always the son or the older brother. Like even if my body perfectly represented my gender identity, people still wouldn't recognize **me**
There are people who will recognize and value you for you, it's just unfortunately difficult to find them. It is worth it to keep trying though. I have some great people in my life who help keep me from feeling worthless or unaccepted as who I am. You deserve the same.

Fellow nonbinary siblings, how do you handle misgendering in a customer service setting?	I work at a bistro where I'm often at the cash register. I'm amab, and hear sir/brother/other term for a man constantly. I do wear a pronoun pin, but i don't think anybody bothers to read it. I'd be lying if I said it didn't get annoying and tiresome to hear it all the time, but I never bother to explain my pronouns (mostly out of fear that I'll get some ignorant and hateful response).  For other nonbinary folk who are misgendered by customers, do you ever correct them, especially if you'll be interacting with them more? Or do you let it slide?	"honestly i just let it slide unless it's like a coworker doing it, or a customer that i tend to get along with otherwise and talk to often. it's just not worth the hassle most of the time.
I don’t work in customer service but I do work with the general public. It’s annoying for sure, but being misgendered by people who don’t know me just doesn’t get to me anymore. Im at the point where I’m like, “cool, that’s none of my business.” Lol. 
I don’t bother to correct random people or strangers I cross paths with. My best advice is to put tons of effort and energy into fostering self-love and internal validation. It’s hard work, but when you feel secure in yourself and in your identity, you come to realize that the way strangers perceive you doesn’t have anything to do with you! You’ll need that external validation less and less. I don’t mean to diminish the issue - I know those gendered terms will always sting. Especially on a bad day. Especially hearing them multiple times. But you’ll just exhaust yourself trying to correct strangers all day. Of course, it’s different for people who KNOW you and are in your life…it’s important that we feel seen and known by the people we love. But strangers??? Not worth the energy and effort trying to get something from them if you can learn how to give it to yourself instead.
Maybe an unpopular opinion but at work with customers who may or may not tip me based on our interactions is not the hill I want to die on when it comes to pronouns. I’d rather take their tip money and commit gay crimes with it than risk the consequences of a negative customer experience.
Waiters introduce their name at the start of the meal every time and most diners would never remember it if asked. Even when they wear name tags. It’s the curse of the uniform that makes you invisible, try not to take it too personally.
This is me, and I offer this as like…positive advice, not an admonishment, I do get the annoyance, AND I get the importance of visibility, but….


I don’t give a fuck what strangers who I will see once in my life think of me or know about my gender identity. They don’t matter to me. 

I want their money, maybe a tip if it’s that kinda work, they can think I’m male, female or nothing, it doesn’t matter. They’re vapour. 

For my own happiness, I’ve learned not to care about that. The people who matter, know. 

Plus, I’d rather not deal with the shitty people who will make it A Thing and create stress at my work place.


Again, I will not, absolutely will not, raise my blood pressure pressure for people I will probably never see again. 

I am not Enby for them. My identity is mine. The people I need to know, know, they respect that, randoms on the street can eat grass because I won’t even remember their faces in 5 minutes, I’m busy.
Just curious, what does your pin say? EDIT: didn't mean that to sound weird, just like to know ideas.
Honestly there’s not much you can do about it. Not everyone sees or cares about pronoun pins unfortunately. If it’s a situation where you’re introducing yourself you can add your pronouns but if it’s just a passing interaction you just have to ignore it. If it makes you feel any better, even before I started transitioning and was still living as a woman presenting very femininely I was misgendered for a man several times. What other people perceive has more to do with them than it does you and what people call you doesn’t change your identity and how you feel.
I just…let it happen. It’s always jarring and always awkward for me, but…idk I guess the hassle and potential escalation is just simply not worth it.
i don’t correct anyone. it used to cause a lot of dysphoria and fucked with my mental health but i started to realize how little people’s perception of me has to actually do with me. and i got tired of explaining lol. i genuinely despise talking about my gender now it’s the least interesting part about me
Well it might be different for me I'm fairly androgynous so I get misgenderd as he or she fairly  often.
Customers kind of suck. I work the register at my job and have my pronouns on my name tag, but alas I’m misgendered all day long. As long as you’re coworkers are nice about it that’s what matters(luckily I have a few enby siblings at work who get it)
I don't work in customer service, but I came out to my friends about 2 months ago, and they are CoNstInTlY misgendering me. Most of them time, I'll pretend to cough, hoping they'll look over at me and realize that they've misgendered me, but lets be honest, that never works. I do have one friend who's ALWAYS correcting them and calling them out and that just feels amazing. So, pro tip: try to have one friend/coworker who will always butt in and say: ""Hey, their pronouns are actually \*insert pronouns here\*, not \*wrong pronouns\*. Thank you so much for your understanding!"" if you're comfortable with that. Stay safe, you're always valid, try to drink some water if you haven't already, and I love you my fellow enby siblings. <3333
I talk on the phone all day and hear ""yes sir, no sir"" all fricking day. I tune it out with the knowledge of who I really am, and the enlightenment that comes from being non-binary. Our world is festering in the traditions of the patriarch and people don't even think twice about gendering others based on the visual or audible symbols that have been forced on them. I focus on ME doing the right thing and choosing the right path because that's what I have the ability to control.
Im afab enby and work as a bookseller. ALL my coworkers know I’m enby and are super great as we have several other trans employees - in fact a majority of the employees are lgbt+ in some way. We all have pronouns on our name tags (cis and trans employees alike). 

However, I still get misgendered by customers and I recognize it’s not from a place of maliciousness so I usually let it go. If it’s a regular who I see often I’ll let them know a few times after I’ve seen them and so far I haven’t had any issues. The only real time I’ll correct people is if they’re rude to me because you don’t get to be rude AND misgender me.
sometimes i think there are assholes who *do* see the pronoun pins and deliberately use incorrect gendered terms when they wouldn't have usually
Not a customer service provider, but as a customer I often get ""ma'am"" from the employees and it grates on my nerves.  I don't give a fuck about pronouns but overly gendered addresses like that bother me.  I usually just let it slide because I know they're TRYING to be polite, and I just don't want to try and give sexuality and gender 101 every time I'm trying to get a cup of coffee or something to eat lol.  Especially as it's often people who clearly don't speak English as a first language, so that makes it even harder.  I only bother saying something or trying to explain my gender to people I interact with regularly on a fairly close basis (and even then it depends), or in specifically queer spaces.  Every once in a while I might say something like ""please don't call me ma'am"" and then carry on with my order or whatever lol no further explanation given.
I take deep breaths for the remainder of the convo and keep it moving
Personally I don’t always have this issue because I’m Afab and identify as she/they. Although when someone calls me something really feminine i get uncomfortable. I never really say anything but my attitude changes. I had a trans coworker as well once who would laugh it off and quickly say not a dude with finger guns. No one seemed to ever say much. And if they did harass us they were asked to never come back and refused to be served.
Give it to them straight ""Hi, my name is x my pronouns are x. How can i help you today?"" So they can make an informed decision to be a decent person or an asshole

That being said i agree that it mostly isnt worth the hassle. It is not your job to educate the masses. If you have a pronoun pin, you are already doing more than enough. That tip is when you feel down and feel inspired to lift yourself up. Get the higher ground! I feel like being misgendered hurts so much because we feel like we haven't expressed ourself correctly. We are misunderstood. So expressing yourself correctly to the next customer can help with that.
I've made the decision only to correct those I frequently interact with

I did bar work for quite a while, but I'm lucky to live in s country where we rarely use honorifics like sir/mam

It sucks, but idk a solution for you :(
I work in a super market and start just before the shop closes, so I do from time to time yes. I have a boss that's amazing and just tells me to correct them when they do and if that doesn't work to ignore them, by no stretch of the imagination am I saying ignore them but maybe ask you're boss and see what they say?
I honestly had to come to terms with the fact that customers are usually gonna gender me. No matter what gender they assume, it's gonna be wrong. It sucks but customers are just *like that*. That's a big part of why I started hrt honestly. At least now when I get gendered, it's usually the one that doesn't make me want to rip my skin off
I'm trying vocal practice so pitch my voice higher but I dont think it's working T~T
I let it slide - even back when I didn't ""pass"" (I've transitioned to more or less ""male"" and don't mind the sir/brother/etc., but when I used to get ""miss/ma'am"" etc. it was different).  It sucks but I just never wanted to incite anger, bigotry, etc. from people.  The main thing is making sure your coworkers all respect your pronouns/gendered terms/etc.  Having some coworkers do the right thing  increases chances that customers will too.  Back when I worked at parks & rec there was one coworker who often did rounds cleaning bathrooms with me and would go out of his way to call me ""they"" - like someone would ask a question and he would point to me and say ""they can show you!"" or something.  Feels really nice to have someone who has your back like that.  Not everyone is lucky enough to have super supportive coworkers but if you can find someone like that, they'll be worth their weight in gold.
This may help
https://hunterthelion.medium.com/you-could-never-misgender-me-d5e9687d8523
I've personally just come to accept whatever the other person says. Some say ""sir"" others ""miss"". Either way I just get on with the task and don't let it bother me.

My kids call me both Mom *and* Dad and I just respond to both. I don't try to make a correction. But maybe I'm more gender fluid than a pure enby.
Honestly, you're gonna have to let it slide, or you'll end up with some entitled customer flipping their lid and screaming hateful shit at you.
Here’s the way I feel about it - I am non binary and female presenting, and even tho I feel androgynous AF and have been using they/them socially and professionally for almost two years…the reality is that unless I tell somebody my pronouns, they’re gonna assume she. 

At first this made me super sad, but now I’ve sort of thought about my pronouns as a secret I share with some people. 

I’m a corporate leadership trainer, and say my pronouns when I introduce myself. 
Then, if the chance comes up, I see some people struggle (trying) some people experience muscle memory and say she and then get mortified (trying) some people avoid using pronouns at all and call me by my name (trying) and then some people avoid me or simply don’t try at all (they either don’t get it or are dicks, and I don’t have to let them have power over me. Now I know who they are) 

I have conducted trainings where I forgot to say my pronouns, and I got she’d, and I practice grace and try to remember that if I didn’t share the secret with them, it’s not an expectation I can hold. 

That’s just my own thoughts around it - might not be the right way but it has helped me feel less fucked up when I’m she’d all over the place.
Ignore the customers, unless it's a regular. Correct the co-workers, if spoons are available to do so. Wear a pronoun pin, and feel free to write off anyone who ignores it. That's about all I got.
I wear a pin as well and am always misgendered by patrons. I don’t worry about it. I agree that it gets annoying by the end of the day, but it is what is. My coworkers get it right and apologize if they slip up, so that’s what matters to me.
I just let it slide unless I know I’m going to be interacting with them repeatedly. Hell, I forget people’s names all the time and have definitely misgendered cis people because I’m in the “flow” of work
I let it slide for customers. I correct coworkers.
I just plain ignore it until they stop using a gendered term at all. I won't answer to ma'am or sir at all. Just 'excuse me' is 100% sufficient. 


Especially when it's the doorchaser. I just spent an absurd amount of money on your garbage, walmart, I'm not about to respond to someone haranguing me over my receipt who is also calling for a woman/man. I'm not a man or woman. Therefore, they must be speaking to someone else if they are saying sir or ma'am. It's as simple as that.
I know this doesnt apply to amab, but hoping some afabs might find this useful. When a customer says “excuse me Miss…” my brain will finish “Miss…ter” or when customers say “thank you Ma’am” i pretend they said “man”
It just helps lift the burden of gender correctness off me a little bit. I know its hard constantly getting misgendered but i just remind myself I’m an NPC to them.
Unfortunately, when it comes to customers you kind of have to let it slide. I know it sucks! Especially when you're getting misgendered 100x a day but it's usually not worth the battle. While some folks are probably totally onboard with calling you the correct pronouns, correcting certain people will just be an invitation to unnecessary confrontation.
If it's the first time I let it slide but a regular customer I make mention I have preferred pronouns. However there's some people who don't care so pick your battles
So, in my native language there is no such things as a gender neutral pronoun, so I mostly let it slide. In English speaking contexts I am a bit more active to remind people, but as I understand it,  a nonbinary gender is a concept sometimes hard to grab for people, so I am not very keen of confrontation because of that. (It's not possible to change people's minds, confrontation will just alienate us further)
I mean I let it slide , yeah it does get to me but like you're never gonna see them fuckers again ,like I kinda believe pronouns are a personal thing that is introduced when you're meeting someone. But these people don't care about your existence as a human being they just have to interact with you to pay for their meal
[deleted]
Yeah, this too. I'd probably be correcting 15 customers a day!! Luckily my coworkers and management are all super respectful, so that definitely evens things out
same here. i’ll correct a coworker. but i don’t correct customers. i don’t want to deal with the awkwardness or put myself in a dangerous situation
This answer is phenom
I absolutely adore your answer. Self love and acceptance is definitely a long fought journey, and definitely more sustainable than trying to take on the words of every passerby. Thankyou so much for this insight.
Gay crimes are the best crimes, muahahaha! And definitely spot on about the tip money, especially where my fellow employees rely on how I do on the register to get good tips at my place of work.
Gay crimes is the hill I want to die on!
It says they/them 😊😊
same, and tbh personally I couldnt care less. We are making stuff more complicated, so it cannot be expected that everybody just knows. Especially if it is based internal feelings.
You're not wrong. I absolutely got more of the pointed misgendering-based-on-perceived-AGAB when I was wearing a they/them pin. People who'd never spoken to me before were suddenly tripping over themselves to use gendered terms at me, with smug smirks on their faces. It's fucking surreal how quickly grown adults will turn into sneering playground brats if they think it's time to bully someone.
Yeah, this happened when I added my pronouns to my work email signature.
the customers aren’t there to be about OP, and OP already knows that. i would even hazard to say EVERYONE who’s ever worked in any form of customer service does?

but there’s still a chance, line or no line, that they’re reading their pin. i say this because i used to wear a pronoun pin while working a customer service job and, even on busy days, people (however annoyed they were to see it) would ask me about it or comment on it. very, VERY few people actually used the information on it, and that’s their issue. but, between the people getting upset and people telling me what a great ally i was 🫠, people were absolutely reading the pin.

i guess this is to say, don’t discourage OP. them wearing a pin doesn’t mean they think customer service is “all about them” or whatever, it’s a quick way to communicate important information - and whether people actually read or RESPECT that important information is on the people themselves, and says more about the customers than the pin or OP.
if anything this is just a more potent argument that the average entitled customer shouldn't notice an employee's gender at ALL, which would actually be amazing
Gay Crime Hill!
Thanks, what's your preference for an alternative to sir/ma'am/miss? I hate all of those but I also hated when people would read my name for some reason--it always sounded creepy!
in person, not getting mistaken for female cause I'm 5'4"" and curvy is pretty hopeless (my asthma won't let me bind, but it wouldn't solve the hips and height anyway). but in text, my chosen name is sufficiently ambiguous that they don't know which to use to intentionally misgender me, hah! or they guess NOT my assigned gender, since I purposely picked a name that's like 80/20 male/female instead of a 50/50 one... even though I'm definitely not a guy, it hurts less to be misgendered that direction, because it isn't what I'm used to getting, and counteracts the too-femme body. And it at least forces people to recalculate their assumptions between the name and the body.

and if I made someone actually notice their gender assumptions and think about them for a split second, that's a bit of a win in itself, right? I'm in ur head, queering ur brainz!


and of course, there's not actually any truly non gendered option for the Sir/Ma'am/Miss issue. I always hated ma'am/miss even when I still thought I was female, because it forces them to guess age/marital status, too - there's no Ms. equivalent either. So those words are just terrible all around! We really need to come up with a better solution....
The gender neutral alternative is Mixter, which is abbreviated as Mx.
For Mr. etc yes, but not so much for Sir/Ma'am/Miss.
Mixter is the non-binary alternative to Sir etc.
It's really not though.

For starters, many people who don't know anyone who uses Mx. have never heard it said, even though they might have seen it in writing. Even for those who are familiar with it or use it, some instead say ""mix"" (by analogy with ""Ms.""/""miz"")... which is my own preference as well. Both because I just feel more comfortable with it personally, and because I strongly suspect the Miss/Mrs/Ms. distinction means people are more likely to ask for clarification if they can't figure out which someone said, instead of assuming it was ""Mr."".

And at least in my area, addressing someone as ""mister"" (without last name) is more akin to ""buster"" than ""sir"", and ""missus"" isn't used at all.... ""mistress"", of course, suggesting something else entirely. So using ""mixter"" wouldn't come across as polite or friendly, either. Worse, people would again likely hear it as ""mister"", and take it as downright rude, making it a terrible default choice. Maybe in some places it works... but not here.
Did you mean Mx. or Mix or Mx? WHich are not short for mixter, LOL.
My understanding is that Mx. is short for Mixter. Which came first I'm not really sure, but I've seen other people suggest that is the proper alternative to Sir, Ma'am etc."	12e47ba	NonBinary	137	0.99	2023-04-07 00:56:18

Struggles being nonbianary but feminine.	"Um, I'm bad at phrasing things so bare with me please.

After a lot of experimentation, and research, I know for a fact that I'm just non-bianary, and only comfortable with they/them pronouns.

However I know I look/dress in a more traditionally feminine nature, which obviously can cause a lotta misgendering.

While this itself isn't a problem, since I already know that nobody will automatically know my pronouns, but its afterwards when people look at me weird, or just downright refuse to use them and just refer to me as she/her.

I've explained it, but a lot of people I'm friends, and even are part of the lgbt themselves just don't really either """"believe"""" me, or just don't yse them altogether.

How I dress doesn't define my gender.
How long my hair is doesn't define my gender.

I like skirts, because I like how they look.
I like Ponytails, because I like how they look.


I just sometimes feel like these are the people who are supposed to know what this stuff feels like, yet most of the people who use my prefered pronouns are other trans people, so idk anymore. I'm grateful to have close friends who do respect my identity, but I just feel a bit betrayed (if thats the right word?) on people who I've explained it to a few times, Idk though, maybe I'm just being dramatic.

Thank you if you read this far, I just had to get this off my chest.


Edit:
I highly doubt anyone will see this old post again, but after a weird day, I was just looking back on all the positivity and support yall commented and just- MY HEART!!!-

Thank you so much for literally everything! <333
<Insert that meme of kermit holding a phone with heart emojis, lol>


And after a lot of time, communication, and a hell of a lotta thinking, I followed yall's advise and thought how my real friends are the ones that are understanding, and actually respect me too.

And while it sucks to have lost wuite a few people I used to really like, its better to nip the bud now, before it just grows into something more toxic.


And to retrack my statement earlier, a lot of people im close with (some became closer since cutting off others) are indeed cis, and have no hesitation or problems using my prefered name and pronouns!!!


While I know a good chunk of people aint gonna try to understand me, or want to, ah well, I've still got a miniture army of weirdos I hang out with :)))))"	"Oh, it broke my heart. People who I thought cared for me in actuality didn’t care for me that much. And it hurt so bad. I lost people I thought I wouldn’t because despite begging them to get my pronouns right, they refused to stating it was too hard or too confusing.

It’s awful and I’m sorry you have to experience it.
Always remember: You don't owe anyone androgyny. If other people don't like it, they can go home and cry about it.
I get this too. I'm agendered AFAB, but I present as feminine because I like dresses. Generally I don't expect people to know or use my preferred pronouns, so I'm always pleasantly surprised when I make/have a friend who respects them. But I'm older, so maybe it's just that these things don't bother me so much anymore. Respect given is respect earned, misgendering mistakes happen, and no one can ruffle your feathers without your consent.

I see you, you glorious person. You got this.
I don't really have advice but am in the same boat. I commend you for being brave enough to tell people your pronouns, I generally haven't been and am only out with family and even then only my fiancés family because mine isn't as accepting. 
I try to surround myself with that part of the family that is accepting and it helps my mental health a lot. Just be around the people who get you it's worth it.
i’m gonna say it, it feels like the only ones who respect  pronouns despite a certain presentation are trans people. i mean my own friend group didn’t want to call me a different name, my female best friend is bisexual and didn’t want too. my male best friend, who is cishet, kept saying how he thought it was just a phase because i dress feminine. i’ve explained it all to them and they got it eventually and have now stopped doing that, but still it feels like the only people who don’t question are other trans folk
I feel you, I don't dress feminine but still get misgendered a lot since I'm short/large chested. All I can say is that my friends who care about me respect my pronouns. All I had to say is that it mattered a lot to me and they did it. Sometimes they make mistakes but they correct and apologize, in one case a friend kept messing up and all my friends at the same time corrected them. They later reached out to apologize, they were having a bad brain day and felt awful.   


What I'm trying to say is, the people who care about you should do what makes you happy and when they mess up they should apologize. Your pronouns being respected is the bare minimum. Them not believing you is bullshit, they aren't the gender police. Like I know you can't make them respect your pronouns but I certainly would start questioning if someone really respected and cared about me if they kept disrespecting me that way and would be very hurt. I'm sorry your friends act that way, it's one thing if it's a stranger or an acquaintance but these are your FRIENDS. You aren't questioning their identity, they should reciprocate.
Gender =/= gender presentation.
I feel for you, I am afab and present feminine about 50% of the time (rest is jeans and hoodies) and I am too heavy to hide my boobs and hips anyway. It's frustrating. And folks not taking being nonbinary serious if you don't present way x or y... they suck. I am sorry you were hurt by those suckers.
I can relate to this. So very much. As an AFAB femme presenting NB, I feel like an imposter saying I am a part of the lgbtqia+ community. I am in a heteronormative presenting relationship (cis-gendered male husband) and it’s hard for me because I know I am also pan-sexual (I wouldn’t care what is or anyone’s gender or sexuality is, I understand that now that I am comfortable with myself I do not have the ability to explore that side of me). 

It’s seems like while at work, I can have my pronouns, and perhaps people respect them they don’t understand. I get misgendered because I like makeup sometimes (I worked really hard to become good at it and amass a decent collection dangit)! And it sucks. 

But I know who I am and how I feel inside. I know that there is a fluid nature and if asked I will explain but otherwise I don’t owe that to anyone.

It’s weird and my empathy extends to you. You aren’t alone and I wish people understood and respected that how we identify internally is how we wish to be identified externally, regardless of their expectations and judgments. I hope things improve for you and for all of us in this position as well
Any friends who dont respect you arent actually friends. 

I'm so sorry the people arouns you are making things so difficult. You're nonbinary as hell in those skirts n ponytails though! Those people just dont know how to not shove people in boxes based off of their idea of How x Type of Person Looks. 

Im really glad youre so secure in who you are and aren't letting their nonsense change hoe you view yourself!
I feel you. I have big boobs, wide hips, ass, and long hair. My voice is in the higher register. 

Hair is not gendered. Body features are not gendered. Clothing is not gendered. Make-up is not gendered. Anyone can look any way and be any gender. I’m non-binary but unless I try to hide my body, alter my voice, and cut my hair, some people will aways see me as a “woman.” I don’t experience my features as gendered, my body is just my body. 

I can’t make other people see me for who I am inside, but I can try. After a good reasonable effort, and someone still doesn’t get it, it’s okay to leave them behind or be upset if they are close to you. You get to decide who you are, not them. You don’t owe it to anyone to change how you like to dress or do your hair just so if fits into THEIR idea of what non-binary is supposed to look like. Fuck that. It’s transphobic as fuck.
Some people are cunts, unfortunately.
I feel that! Some days I’m wearing a dress which to most people is considered “feminine” some days I have the aesthetic of a plant loving vintage boy, but I always remember my gender and everyone’s gender is NOT how we look, it’s how we feel about ourselves and how we personally identify. Gender cannot be seen, it can be expressed, but that is not a definitive way to visually identify someone’s gender. The gender you tell others and the pronouns you use are to be taken at face value without question. No one ever has the right to try to poke holes in who you know you are! Be you and be queer. It’s easier said then done to say f them, but those who question you aren’t worth your time and energy. Keep those who respect your identity close and those who don’t at more of a distance. You deserve to be seen as who you are! Which is a lovely non binary person. Keep on keeping on :)
absolutely gross you experience this, but i get it :(. i was out about being NB years before deciding to take hrt, and if i’m being completely transparent, the social aspect was legitimately a part of it. and hrt did make a difference in how people treated me. i almost wish i could turn it on and off now (the changes i’ve got), to be able to tell who would be respectful even if i didn’t fit their standards of being “trans enough”. 

fuck anyone who claims to support us but then treats people who aren’t on hrt or who dress non-conformingly as “lesser” trans people. they are not allies, and honestly now that i am on hrt one of my favorite things to do is shut other people down on that real quick (when they’re trying to be all “well they don’t do enough” or “don’t you think they’re *different* than your case though?”)

sorry for the tired rant, but hope it makes sense. tldr fuck those people, and i’m sorry you have to put up with all their bs. you’re not being dramatic, you’re having a human reaction to everyone around you being dicks
This post was honestly kinda comforting for me to read today. I’m AFAB and present differently day to day on the entire spectrum of gender presentations.

Today I presented feminine…very feminine. I got dressed this morning and spent time putting a nice braid in my hair, wearing a sweater I really like, putting cute leg warmers under my boots…before I left the house I felt really cute.

But the second I got into public, I suddenly started imagining myself through everyone else’s eyes, and all I saw was a girl.

Queue dysphoria wooo!
I completely relate. I'm actually wearing a skirt right now. I'm non-binary and use they/them but most people just don't understand since I look so feminine. My hair is on the longer side and I dress in skirts and other traditionally feminine clothes. Some people refuse to use my pronouns all together. I understand slip ups but straight up refusal is different. I assume you've already tried this but maybe respond a bit more intense. I don't quite know how else to deal with it since it's a reoccurring problem for me as well. I hope people learn to respect you and your pronouns.
You’re not being dramatic, people are blatantly disrespecting you and that’s not cool and transphobic. I’m AFAB (demiboy) and I get so frustrated when people who know my pronouns refuse to correct themselves or tell me it’s not a big deal because it IS. I give folks leeway because I use all pronouns except she/her but when they deliberately use those pronouns, it’s just disrespectful.
I'm a masc NB and I get the same issues, for me it's not so much how I look on the outside but how I feel on the inside but, some don't understand that...
I totally understand your situation. I'm in a very similar spot. It's such a disheartening thing to think that if you do what makes you happy, the world will see you as female. 😔
I know how this feels dear! I'm a bigenderflux nonbinary trans woman and while I appreciate being gendered female when I feel that way, its tough when I feel more nonbinary and others don't understand my preferred pronouns and gender shifts :(
People usually equate gender presentation and gender identity... so i'd usually assume that they got that mixed up and start from there  


So for me, i'd show them a pic of the genderbread person, and then explain how my gender identity is different from my gender presentation, and use analogies that they understand like, when a man puts on a dress, he is still a man in a dress, so you are still a nonbinary person in a dress. and also I'd tell them that the perception of gender change so in other times or culture dresses and long hair wouldnt be considered feminine, like how ancient china everyone wears robes and have long hair  


if they still don't agree well... it's probably down to whether they respect you or truly care about you or not  


hope that helps!
Same. 

I discovered that you have a ""feminine face"" then I will change the pronoun that I've been using all along with you! 

:/ Don't be that person.
>they refused to stating it was too hard or too confusing

Honestly this is such a ridiculous excuse, it's just code for they don't care to try.
Agreed from my experience!!!
I respectfully disagree. I know a LOT of non trans people who would never in a million years question someone’s preferred pronouns. I hope more of these people come your way in the near future.
I've also just have people say I have a lot of sisters and I'm only used to saying she since you're basically a girl. I was definitely upset but I told them it's ok to mess up. They then said they would just call me she/her. Youre definitely not being dramatic btw."	yr3xau	NonBinary	132	0.97	2022-11-10 03:20:14

Wrong promouns	"I FUCKING hate it when someone uses the wrong pronouns and you correct them and they get all guilt trippy and sorry for themselves like ""I'm sorry, but I'm trying. It's just so hard to get used to."" Like I don't fucking care if it's hard. Just say sorry and keep talking. I was out to brunch and my mom brings up my friend who is a trans woman who uses she/her pronouns. My mom referred to her as ""themselves"" and I corrected her. She just signed and looked at me   exasperated and told me it's ok for me to correct her on my pronouns(they/them) but I shouldn't correct her on others. Which is super fucked up. I'm not gonna let you misgender my friend. Also it's been over a year since I started using they/them pronouns and they still fuck up all the time. It makes me so angry and I'm honestly exhausted."	"rip the title
I’ve kinda given up with my own parents as the amount of “effort” given is the equivilent of a bandaid on a dead body, not enough and too late.

When my friend changed names and pronouns between 8th and 9th grade I snapped at them because they met him ONCE because he came to the house to hang out and they didn’t seem to realize that not being able to change how you view someone after maybe like 2 minutes worth of interaction at most is straight up insane. 

They stopped the “before he was” bs after that real quick too… I just don’t have the spine to do it for my own sake as I’m only just starting my journey and they can’t seem to break the habits…
I get it.  I have chosen not to change my pronouns because it would be confusing and difficult for my family at this stage (I’m NB in my 40s), but I have friends who are trans and have changed their pronouns to be their authentic selves. As a teacher, I have had quite a few kids who are out to me as trans or NB, although many don’t disclose their status as trans to their classmates. I talk to them, their parents, their friends. 

IMO, it sucks to be misgendered by anyone, but especially by people you love. I get frustrated with parents who don’t even try to get it right. Many try but struggle with it - it isn’t an excuse to not try, but it is difficult to retrain your brain. 
 
Heck, one of my closest friends has always known and identified as male, had many friends in the trans community and he gets it wrong sometimes - especially when talking about the past or referring to someone he doesn’t interact with often. 

When I was in college, I actively studied gender studies including transgender and Non-binary wasn’t even a thing. There wasn’t much reading, and what did exist was very niche. We’ve changed in our understanding and terminology but it is not a switch that gets flipped and everyone gets it. 

The good news is that the world is changing and we are seeing gender and sexuality as being more fluid. That should mean that people try harder to get it right and have more experience with seeing and hearing it so our brains will adapt faster. 

You are absolutely justified in being hurt and angry, but keep in mind that progress has been made and is being made.
Something I saw on this sub (or maybe another trans one I don't remember 😅) was that if they could learn your name in nine months before you were born, then you should give them no more than nine months to use the excuse of ""I'm trying, it's hard, you've always been my little [insert binary gender here]"" 

Granted this doesn't work in all cases, but still stand by it.
I get you, every time my mom messes up my brothers boyfriends pronouns I try and correct her and she gets upset with me about it, like mom it’s kinda reflex, I see the boy less than you do I think, almost certainly talk about him less, the more you complain about pronouns not making sense and bemoaning that he didn’t tell you he identified as male when you met him the longer it’ll take to stick. She also continuously misgenders some of my old friends because their pronouns and names have changed since the events of the story but she insists on calling them by what they went by at the time even when it has less than nothing to do with the story. And at this point I don’t even try to correct her on it because “well that was their name at the time” so I just try really hard to use the right terms in my additions to the conversation and hope she doesn’t decide I’m correcting her cause I don’t want to have to deal with it.
I always say

Well when Mary got married and her last name changes you had no issues with that so why me?
I'm feeling this too lately OP. Wish I knew what to say to make you feel better. My mom also basically refuses to use my pronouns even though I've been out for several months to her now. She makes one or two extremely performative and self-congratulatory attempts every couple days and then proceeds to misgender me to my face, behind my back and to other people. Constantly. She sees herself as an extremely open-minded person but honestly sometimes it feels HARDER to try to talk to her about it because she just keeps saying ""but I support you!"" as if that changes anything. Sure you ""support me"" but what does that mean when you seem to be completely incapable of doing anything even mildly inconvenient or out of your way in the service of that support?

Sorry, turned into a bit of a rant of my own but its so much...
I live with a family member with dementia and have been struggling with this for over 3 years. 

I love her dearly but holy fucking he'll doss it get exasperating and invalidating. I feel you.
this is a little too relatable and i'm sorry you have to go through this. sounds exhausting. personally my mom only tried with my pronouns for a week and it'd go down like ""and this is my daughter. or wait- would you be my child lol?"" or ""yeah and she- or they? them? anyway she-"" so yea i get it.
Idk why you're getting downvoted, you're dealing with something extremely difficult and you're frustration is valid. You aren't saying your family member is bad or dumb or anything, you're not even implying it's in their control. It just is what it is and it's absolutely okay to be frustrated/exasperated.

 Maybe people just don't understand how huge of an impact dementia can have on both the person who has it and everyone in their life, especially the people caring for them. I haven't ever personally cared for someone with dementia. I just have some minor training on how to recognize the early signs and we covered what caring for someone with dementia can be like. 

I just didn't want you to be made to feel guilty or like you're bad for having totally understandable feelings.  Too often people who are caring for others, especially family caregivers, are shamed for totally normal feelings and are expected to be all joy and sunshine all the time, like you're unaffected, which isn't fair or realistic.
Yeah I see my grandmother with early stage dementia a lot. Somehow she's better with my name than my dad (because it's a small difference and a name she was already very familiar with) but I know she just doesn't have the mental capacity to learn to use different pronouns anymore. I've chosen not to ask her to change what language she uses for me but it does hurt to hear her call me her granddaughter. Sending you lots of sympathy, dementia sucks for everyone involved.
Thank you for this. As it's reddit I don't even look at downvotes but it's nice to hear from someone eho gets the emotional toll this kind of degenerative disease takes on everyone involved. 

As you stated I am in now way negging grandma. She raised me when mom was spun out and I am eternally grateful. In no way am I bashing her lack of mental faculties or holding a grudge, I was just voicing the (valid) feelings of sadness and pain that come with watching someone you love dearly slowly fade away.
Thank you, right back at you. Keep that compassion and understanding. It stings but it's so healthy to know when to just throw the hands up and roll with life as it is."	vg3osy	NonBinary	134	0.98	2022-06-19 20:19:20
"""I'm not going home for Christmas, but at least I won't be misgendered"" How naïve of me to think"		"It's almost worse that I'm AMAB and thought I was a girl for a few years. So it's not even blanket transphobia, she just won't accept I'm agender

Ooof that sucks :/ I hope it your family stops misgendering you!
I find these low key passive agressive, I know finding ones with names is hard but just referring to people by your relationship is weird in most cases
I'm sorry that your had to deal with this. Know that there are other people in the world who accept you for who you are. You're valid and you're absolutely allowed to explore your gender AND change your mind as you grow and learn about yourself. You are valid no matter what. Be safe, know people care about you.

Finally went to the barber again. Did they misgender me? Yes! Do I care? No! Because they don’t know better and I decided I can’t be upset because people will not perceive me as nonbinary and it’s not worth it. Anyway, how do I look? (Not gender-wise of course).		"Stunning!
If you live in a reasonably safe area, I highly recommend going on to your local area facebook group / subreddit / nextdoor and asking for recommendations for LGBT-friendly barbers/salons. I found one that way and I'm SO happy with them. They don't price differently based on gender and they are always careful about pronouns and such.
Sounds very machure of you :) I can understand for some people it is hard to ignore sertant thoughts or comments especially when they take it personally. To ignore it is a skill which you have or earn and or improve. 

You look nice btw, like your glasses 😊
Excellent haircut, they did a good job on the fade as well.  Love the glasses.

If you are in Toronto you should go to LES Studio they are a queer hair spot and they do non gendered pricing.  They only care about how long your hair is, not your genitals.
Gorgeous :)
Sorry to hear about the misgendering. Glad you got the cut you wanted anyway. That is a slick fade, friend.
To answer your question: You look fantastic! 

I've been trying to find a way to not be upset about people misgendering me for a while. Do you have any tips on how to do that?
My new bestie rocks! So happy for future chat!
So sorry to hear you got misgendered. Your hair looks really cute! 

I have been using this men's barber shop for ages but lately I've been thinking of finding a new place, one that doesn't consider it to be just for men. I hate their website because it's just man this and man that and don't feel included in any of that.
You look great!! That style really suits you, also I like your glasses!
I like your tattoo, at least the small part that is visible
Thanks :)
Thank you very much 

Unfortunately I am nowhere near Toronto, but in Germany 😅 I did get to pay a mens cut, because that’s what I gut, right?
Thanks
Yeah I’m baffled every time. Last time fade was a STRAIGHT line. I have a photo where it looked like the pic was cropped lol
Thank you


Sorry not really. I just came to the conclusion it’s not healthy to always be upset because people just don’t know nonbinary and I do have a lot of “very female” features after all
MERRY! *goes in for a hug*
Thank you. 

I went to a place that serves men and women.
Thanks :)
Haha thank you. What can be seen is the wing of a swallow, and yes, I wanted it purple and green for some personal reasons. 

Here’s (almost) the whole thing 

https://ibb.co/jVgjMfW
You're welcome
I could see why they would call that a ""men's"" cut but I get a buzz cut and I pay the same as an AMAB would at my place.  Plus I love the humans at my shop
oh wow, that's an epic tattoo! how long did that one take?
Yeah even the price list is very binary, to say the least 
But they we’re very respectful. I was offered a coffee and the guy who cut my hair would pause every now and then and even pass me my mug so I can have a sip without spilling the stubbles all over my shoes. It was very sweet. 
When I got up from the chair I had some stubbles on my lower back and he asked if he wants me to remove them. A good amount of consent always shows a good place.
Not sure, it’s been a while. I had 3 sessions for it, I think it accumulates so about 10 hours. It was a trainee, though. And i was his first chest piece 😄
Does sound like an awesome place.  Well if you are in Toronto and need a haircut check my peeps out!
dude did a good job :)
Im afraid I will never set foot on a plane in my life, although I would really love to go there
Definitely :) I love it to pieces. 

Again thank you!

Thank you ! A gift from my parter!! I need to name them.
Wow ! That’s fascinating. I am more ignorant than I realize. I honestly thought they were synonymous. Could you enlighten me?
I didn't do the original comment, but as I understand it agender means that you don't have a gender at all. Agender is a more specific identity under the non-binary umbrella. And non-binary is very general, just any gender (or lack of for agender folks) that isn't strictly binary.
Nonbinary is sort of an umbrella term for people who don’t identify with the binary genders, and that includes agender people, who don’t identify with any gender
Ah I see, yes I believe I am agender then. I really like the enby phrase tho lol.

So freaking tired of being misgendered. Send love and coping advice.		"Hey, i have/get the same problem everyday. So long as you know yourself and know how you identify. Being you is the most bravest thing.
If you can maybe wear a badge with your pronouns on?
Stay strong
I mean this in a good way, but you look very androgynous! You are goal tbh! 

And being misgendered sucks SO much, I feel you. Sending you good vibes!!
you are incredible and strong!! 💙 i completely understand how you feel; i get misgendered 24/7, and i wish i had sage advice to give you on how to cope but i really don’t as i’m not even sure how to handle it myself 😭 but you are so valid! much much love to you. you are the one who knows you the most and that is what matters the most! (ps. i was drawn to your photo because we have the exact same hair color, haha 💙)
It helps me to try to extend compassion to those people who are misgendering me; I know they probably are not trying to hurt me. Nowadays I usually say something like “Actually I prefer to be called they.” When they make some (FUCKING) comment about how that’s hard, I like to tell them that I also think Language is hard and that I think they seem smart and will get the hang of it in no time (instead aggressively rolling my eyes).
You look amazing, I am also misgendered alot, but I usually tell them I'm non-binary, then I tell myself not to worry about it and think up another subject to brainstorm about

It sucks but question are these just randoms? If so my suggestion is to get over it and move on.  A stranger will have NO idea what your pronouns are or care.
Thanks for your words of encouragement. And yeah, I wear a pin with my pronouns, but people mostly disregard it.
Thank you!!
I put this up here but I'll tell it to you directly, but I get misgendered all too often and I usually tell them I'm non-binary, then I tell myself not to worry about it and think up another subject to brainstorm about
Thank you!! Solidarity helps a ton. And yay hair twins!
Lol
Thanks!!
Thank you <3
You look good by the way
No, unfortunately it’s people I work with who I’ve told/wear my pronoun pins. Randoms don’t bother me as much.
I would just point to the pin when people misgender you."	cglywp	NonBinary	110	0.99	2019-07-23 01:18:11
Intentionally getting misgendered at work	"So I made sure EVERYONE knows I’m non-binary. I wear my pronouns on my name tag. We also have a slack channel which is basically like reddit for work where we have 4 different group chats and all the staff are in it. I have my pronouns clearly in my display name and I have a profile pic in there so ppl know who to use the right pronouns with. I’ve been correcting people to use they/them and we all know each other pretty well by now. 

It’s just this one person that’s driving me insane. 

I’m pretty masc presenting, so much that other people often mistake me for being a cis boy. I recently sent out a mass message to tell coworkers to stop referring to me with feminine terms bc they slip sometimes. This one person has since gone out of their way to call me every feminine gendered name in the book, like ‘miss, ma’am, girly, queen’ after telling me ‘thank you, hello, good morning,’ or ‘goodbye’. They never did this before I sent out the message so I’m sure it’s intentional. 

We have to interact for work reasons but I do not respond to this persons gendered comments anymore, ask how they are, or even bother to say hello. We have even talked in the slack app for work reasons where my pronouns are obviously visible when messaging each other. I mean..you can’t miss it because it’s literally in my display name that’s in bold. They are blatantly disrespecting me but playing innocent. 

Like, they’ll cheerfully ask me how I am or tell me thank you but always make sure to include a ‘missy’ or other fem term in there even when it’s not necessary at all. 

And today they had the audacity to ask me softly, “are you okay?” the moment I avoided their smile when walking down the hallway as we both walked into work. Like obviously tf not…u are taking apart my sanity like everyday and know what you’re doing 😑

UPDATE ‼️‼️ Thank you for the support, I feel so validated!! i was definitely going to mention it to my supervisor before reporting to HR. I was honestly scared to because I live in AZ which is hella conservative and scary to exist in as an LGBTQ+ person. However, today this person seemed to have caught on or was told by one of my coworkers to use the right pronouns—which is what I’m assuming because I have about 5 people who always use my correct pronouns and they will correct other people for me like mid conversation when someone slips up so I don’t even have to do it myself. Again, for work related reasons I had to interact with the person misgendering me and instead of ‘hey miss’ or ‘hey girl’ it was ‘hey buddy’ and ‘hey friend’ which still feels passive aggressive but at least they aren’t misgendering me. My work place is dominantly woman so this person would always refer to me in a group of my coworkers as ‘ladies’ but now they are using ‘hey friends’ instead. It’s also a seasonal summer job so I didn’t know if putting up a fight would be worth it, how long it would take and if it would be solved in under two months, and guessed it would just be easier taking the harassment and sticking it out because there were so many reasons to just take it. I came on here to rant and didn’t think it was a big deal, but everyone here has made me realize I need to stick up for myself, recognize harassment, and speak up because I definitely have not which is why it keeps happening and why it kept happening for so long."	"Please go to HR, or your supervisor. Someone needs to have a conversation with this person. If the behavior doesn't stop, go again. This is harassment, it's not okay.  Write down as many instances of this happening that you can remember and continue to document when it is happening. You are experiencing a hostile workplace and that is not okay
Report em to HR!
This is incredibly disgusting, and yes...report them to HR because that's incredibly disrespectful of them. I can maybe understand forgetting once in awhile, but dang..that is definitely not what they are doing. 
Actually, you kinda made me think of a good way to come out about my pronouns to my co-workers. I'm lucky that I am remote so I don't see them often, but it's kinda annoying that I keep having to hear or see fem terms when they address me. They don't know yet so it's not like it's on purpose, but it's difficult to put yourself out there for the whole office and you were pretty brave doing that.
Everyone here is saying to contact HR: in an ideal world in which HR was just a process specifically focused on justice, that would be good advice. The reality is that HR is a part of the company you work for, and it is absolutely beholden to the culture of your workplace, on top of being people themselves, and subject to the same variation that you find in any other part of humanity.  


They \*may\* be very accommodating. They may just give the other employee a ""tut, tut"". They may also hold this against you. All of these are absolutely possible.  


Your union rep is probably a better bet, and is also likely to have info on your HR department's tendencies.
Agreed. Report them to HR. If you feel like you can, talk to your supervisor about it as well; get someone who can advocate for you on your side.
Hey, this is federally harassment! Report to HR, the next time it happens report it to the EEOC and you can contact a labor lawyer if you'd like to sue the company
That is so messed up... For a while after I transitioned a lot of people did this. Report their asses to HR
Go to hr. If hr fails to make them stop or take appropriate action, go above hr. I’m honestly at the point where I’m not afraid to threaten to sue companies (at least in the us you can sue due to being a protected group) if I go back to work and someone says even one word to me.
Go to HR. Start writing down every incident and the times you correct them. Practice a line like “I do not appreciate being referred to with feminine terms like that. Please stop.” Otherwise you could just ignore anything they say if they deadname/misgender you. Obviously all of this should only be done if you feel it is safe to do soZ
Um reach out to HR. This is considered creating a hostile work environment and might also fall under sexual harassment or discrimination. Your rights are protected particularly if you live in the US because Biden signed an executive order that the Civil Rights act also protects trans and gender non-conforming people. Also, this would be inappropriate even if you were a cis woman.
What everyone else said, HR, and a union rep if you have one. That said...I'd also like to see how long they last if you start deliberately misgendering them back and act just at clueless if they call you on it.
i’d say report them to HR, depending on what state/country you’re in. where i live i would never but in a state like colorado or california i absolutely would.
I don't know where you live, what kind of office you work at and how the interpersonal relations are at your job. You don't have to tell, but these things do factor in what you can do. If you live in a progressive state/country and have a good relationship with your boss/HR, this could be solved fairly simply. Otherwise..

People here said that you should go to HR. If you trust they'll take your side, they can help you a lot. However, if they don't, retaliation is a realistic option. If the bigot is buddies with your boss, HR isn't going to do anything. If HR doesn't handle the situation adequately, the bigot might just get more angry at you. If HR thinks you're more hassle than it's worth, they might try to force you out. HR is not some kind of justice machine.

Don't let that discourage you, though. They hired you. They value you to at least some degree. There are also some ways to frame things to help you make them take your side. HR is there to protect the company's interests, so make use of that. Something like ""bigot misgendered me in front of a client which harms our brand and made it more difficult to work with our client."" Some of the terms bigot used are - aside from being transphobic - also just plainly misogynistic. So, something like ""bigot addressed me as 'girly' which is infantilising and unprofessional, and I'm afraid they'll address female colleges in a similar way."" You can come up with more detailed lines that better match your situation yourself. If you're afraid the bigot is too valuable to the company, you could even suggest that bigot is promoted to a different department. This isn't justice, but it will help you.

Speaking of justice, some people advised talking with your union. If you have one, this is never a bad idea. However, unions aren't really made to resolve conflicts between coworkers. I don't think you're looking to talk with a mediator. It's something they might offer, but I don't think it'll solve the problem. Again, framing might help you here: ""my company is creating an environment that is hostile to trans workers."" That might spur them into action, which could force your boss/HR to take action. However, a union's power comes from collective bargaining. I'm very pro union, but the reality is that they're only as progressive as it's members. If they don't back you up and if you're company senses that your union is bluffing, they could easily ignore it. Worse, since there probably aren't many trans people working for your company, they'll likely know it was you who set the union on them. And then retaliation is a realistic possibility. If you live in Canada, this probably wouldn't happen. If you live in Florida...

It's also just fine to suck it up. This sub is a good place to vent. Most of us (including me) have focussed on giving advice, but we also completely sympathise with you. We've been there. Hell, shitty coworkers is probably an experience that is relatable to everyone. You're valid and you're coworker is a bigot; that's a basic truth you can depend on!
Do you have a trusted person who can assist you when you report them to HR? Like someone who can vouch for you, someone who has heard these comments, someone who wouldn’t sound like they were ganging up on anybody? Like a manager maybe? I had a situation with an employee of mine where an employee was doing something similar, and HR wouldn’t really do much with just her word. I had her request another report when it happened again, and I filed one as well with my own side of the story (I was her manager). Sometimes it just takes enough paperwork for HR to get someone out. They want to do something about it, but they have to protect the company so they need a paper trail. If they have valid reports from supervisors or about other issues, it makes it easier to take action. So communicate with the people you trust, if anyone else is having problems with this person they should report things right after they happen. HR cannot do very much if you wait a long time, so get the “evidence” filed quickly. And for real if there are any supervisors or tenured employees with really good track records who can file witness reports have them do that for each instance as well. HR will probably give out a few warnings so be ready for an uphill battle but you’re going to learn a lot about workplace advocacy if you do everything “by the book” and you’ll be able to help people (and maybe yourself again) in the future

Edit: when I say “they want to do something about it” I mean they don’t want employees fighting or whatever. Idk what their stance is your rights etc but regardless of their morals if you have enough people filing reports and causing a stink about one person (without anything being fake/dramatic and pointing back to you), then they’re just going to want that person gone to get it over with. It could be about anything really. Just be professional and do things how they need you to do them — if you get on their level you will probably get your stuff fixed but if you just get mad at the HR system it wont be. It’s an awful bureaucratic system but it’s what you have to work with
Aroace non-binary speaking, arson.
I’d be curious what policies your workplace has, are you protected by anything the explicitly have? (DEI policy, etc). Also depending on where you are, what rights you’re protected by. In Canada it was added to the human rights code in 2017 that you cannot discriminate against someone for their gender identity or gender expression…! Tough situation either way. As much as I can I try to chalk it up to a laughable societal problem and nothing to actually do with me. I am who I say I am no matter what others think… but that doesn’t always hold strong either. Sending all the they/them love and solidarity!
I've seen a few comments cautioning against going to HR due to either that HR is there to protect the company or that you won't get the response that you want, so I wish to clarify a few things 
1. Harassment is illegal and your HR needs to respond or you have the right to sue the company. Gender aside, using terms like ""missy"" and ""girly"" is sexual harassment and that is a big deal. 
2. If you don't get the response you need from HR, file a complaint with the EEOC
3. You can always choose to rant on reddit and cope with the pressure and not say anything. I think that's completely fair. Many times it's hard to fight for justice. Understanding that, I would still encourage you to fight for your right to work in a safe environment free from harassment and discrimination.
I actually came across this really awesome trans/non-binary group of yogis and whenever they do a Instagram live they say ""I'm such and such and my pronouns are this/that"" so I've started doing that in meetings at work, in addition to having my pronouns on Slack and my in my email signature. We also have an LGBT Slack channel at work so that is super helpful.
This 100% Im in Florida and straight up don't trust my union for anything trans related, I'm in this on my own. 

Been through some crap before and the other people just got a little ""pat pat it's okay"" multiple times. 
Mine in particular doesn't care.
That’s because people are too afraid to hold the HR departments accountable. We are afraid to make noise and make threats and get lawyers involved. There are protected classes that legally have to be protected. If your HR isn’t helping, definitely contact EEOC. Edit it to add: if in the US
Hr exists to protect the company. It depends on where you live and the climate around trans stuff whether they will help. If word getting out that they are intentionally turning a blind eye would damage the companys reputation, hr is very likely to help. 

Especially if you have any kind of inclusion & no harassment  policy.
Most people don't work for a union.
It could get them into trouble though, ive seen other trans folk try this and it ended up the trans person in trouble for treating the cis co worker as their opposite birth gender. 
The trans person was over looked / misgendering pushed aside since they did the same to another person.
I think the problem is that a lot of people ""suck it up"" but it only gets worse and eventually they quit their jobs, which isn't good for them. If you file a complaint with HR and end up getting fired, you can sue them for retaliation, it also makes it a lot easier to get unemployment in most states which you can't get if you quit. We've kind of been brainwashed into ""don't rock the boat"", but not rocking the boat is exactly how these people and businesses continue to get away with this, all while putting up a rainbow flag for Pride every June.
Thank you!

I'll have to see how things are once I go back, we are losing a lot of staff members so hopefully the new people will be a bit better. 
(School teacher aide)
This ^^^^
For sure, but only if this is a job you can afford to lose/hate.
Very true.
I don't disagree, but not everyone can go without a paycheck and insurance for a month or two. If there is a local support group, that could very helpful for OP.
Yes that’s true. That’s important to have in mind. Just because I would absolutely be fine with “loosing” a job over that, doesn’t mean that’s the case for everyone.
If someone ends up quitting their job over harassment it can take a lot longer than the couple of weeks it takes to get unemployment to find another job and have to go through a 90 day+ waiting period for insurance."	vu0jmb	NonBinary	110	1.0	2022-07-08 03:05:46
Just need to vent about gendered body parts	"I’ve been feeling frustrated lately because I’ve come to the realisation that I don’t want top surgery. I like my breasts, they don’t give me any dysphoria, they’re excellent pillows for people to lie on and look killer in a bra.

What I hate about them is how other people see them and decide that the presence of breasts means they have to misgender me. I hate that a flat chest is seen as “neutral” or “androgynous” because I don’t fucking want surgery but I desperately want to stop being misgendered because my chest looks a certain way. I bind occasionally but it’s not comfortable and I’m far from flat chested so they’re super noticeable when I don’t bind.

Anyone else deal with this sort of thing? Have you been able to make peace with it?"	"Totally feel you. I have the man body, as a result of testosterone puberty. I am big and muscly, and I don't particularly hate it. But, it is very masculine. I am too big and too broad shouldered and strong-jawed to be gender neutral. I don't want to do any ffs or hormone replacement for *myself* but I am very aware that everyone is always going to see a dude.

Not exactly the same thing, but I think a similar feeling.
I know even after top surgery I won’t “pass”. I can bind and wear something and be completely flat and sometimes I’ll pass as a guy but like in the places I go there is no “passing” as non-binary (tbh there really shouldn’t be, because like all enbies have such varied presentations, but still) most people just decide “man or woman” and don’t consider anything else. I think it is definitely something to be mad about. Like how closed minded the world is and how we have to try so hard just to be seen in a vaguely authentic way and be given respect. But these are things I am working through with my therapist and as time goes on I’m accepting it more. I don’t think I’ll ever be done being angry about it, but I think that’s justified. I just don’t want to be angry all the time.
I think people are slowly starting to gender body parts less. Especially in the queer community. It definitely helps to surround yourself with people who do see body parts without gender associated. But it will definitely be a while before the rest of society catches on sadly.
You're not alone!  Same! (My boobs I love to use as convenient stash spot for whatever don't fit in my pockets- who needs a wallet haha) 

The only self-consciousness I feel stems from how my ""hourglass"" is viewed by society and others, but personally I like my shape- it just SUCKS that it is automatically seen as feminine.   SO frustrating.    Some days I do feel pretty down about it and also think about top surgery too BUT then comes the internal conflict of ""but I love my boobs, WHY let others take them from me??"" 

Those days when I'm getting dressed I just try to remind myself that it's not a problem with me, it's a problem with others and just hope that society keeps progressing in the right direction when it comes to gender.  I dress myself as if suiting up for war- and I'm the big titty Joan of Arc whose gonna step out onto these streets and correct everyone on who they THINK I am by just representing and being ME.
Yes, absolutely. It brought me to identify with myself as Genderqueer rather than Nonbinary, so as to better represent my true self rather than   trying to occupy some space within other people’s ideals. I am nothing like what society projects onto me. I love my vagina, and I also love my imaginary penis. I won’t have surgery and I am happiest just knowing that I know my self, free from the projected expectations of others.
Yes !!

I like my curvy body.

I hate how society genders it and how it's perceived, but personally I like it.
same!! I dont want to be seen as a woman just because I'm curvy af but at the same time I don't dislike having said curves

honestly I don't think my body has ever looked like 'me' persay but im not dysphoric about it and i appreciate it like a customizable work of art so thats good enough i guess lol
I feel this!! I like my breasts, and sometimes I like to wear a really tight sports bra if I want a more androgynous look that day. But it does suck when pple immediately put a gender on you bc of it. For me I keep reminding myself that even if I was a cis woman the expectations of what I “should be” would be a situation. And I feel it’s diff obv being a non-binary person myself, but pple are going to come to conclusions about who we are all the time. I try to remind myself of who I am, and that it’s my body, my identity. No one can take my truth away from me. Hope things get better <3
I feel constant pressure to bind and such because I worry I'd oversexualise or upset other enby people for existing. 

I'm fine with how my chest is, it's just I don't like how 'cis girl' it makes me look, though that's probably my fault as I like doing things that are considered feminine
Yessss, no I haven't yet tho
Right now I’m suffering from being gendered male, but when my breasts grow larger I’m gonna have the opposite problem... le sigh
well i feel pretty much exactly the same. most of the time i'm fine with my breasts and i think sometimes i would actually like wearing clothes where they are more 'noticeable' but i don't want people to assume i'm a 'girly girl' or whatever. basically i just feel you a lot but unfortunately i have no advise other than try to ignore the ones that make you feel bad :/
sending a hug to you ༼ つ ◕‿◕ ༽つ
you're not alone! my breasts are quite small, so it can be easy for me to appear more flat in different clothing, but i have wide hips & that always gives me away. for a while i thought i needed to hide my figure in order to feel euphoria, despite not ever feeling dysphoria in the first place. felt i always needed a binder & loose clothes. now though? i've come to absolutely adore my body & all it does for me. small tits never make me feel less feminine when that's where i am, and they definitely won't stop me from feeling masc either. i'm so glad to hear that you're accepting yourself! we are here for enbies of ALL bodies
obviously being trans* comes with the weight of knowing that society has gendered soooo many things. i haven't made peace with it, because i still get anxious even being in the passenger's seat without a binder on when my partner is ordering food. i envy anyone who can eventually get to find peace with this but know that its really all in your own head. i imagine it's like skydiving right? its scary each time but after the first one, it becomes a little easier or more familiar.
I see the problem and kinda understand but don't at the same time. It's normal that people will misgender someone if they see that this person has breasts. Other people aren't mind readers, if you don't want them to misgender you then perhaps wear some pronoun stickers. I'm not some petite person and will never be due to my bone structure, I am curvy and have big breasts and not even pixie cut and dressing masculine got anyone to say ""sir"" or something. It's just something you have to accept when going out.
i am like you but the opposite! i’m super short even compared to other afabs, and all my features are extremely rounded, squishy, and soft. so while i don’t mind looking feminine, (in fact some days i wake up feeling super fem) i wish i could have a more androgynous look so that i could even slightly pass as male/nb some days
i can relate to that a lot and i really like your approach of your body being 'a customizable work of art', idk it just makes it sound so beautiful. also it makes me feel as if my body is a canvas that i can do whatever i want with and create an artwork with piercings, tattoos, hair colours etc. (\*´ω｀*)
glad you like it! honestly I think humans are really beautiful and it's really cool that we can customize our bodies like we can. personally i think it would be a shame for me to waste that
yeah i think that too! also i think people 'designing' their own bodies makes them look so beautiful because they look so confident and powerful. i hate that other people try to police how i look and what i do with my body because in a way it takes that confidence away from me. anyway people are beautiful haha
totally agreed!"	np3eg5	NonBinary	112	0.98	2021-05-31 13:27:33
I love masks because people don’t know HOW to misgender me.		"I absolutely love masks, no one can figure it out

Cake day posttttttttt. Just left a major (toxic) relationship; Just turned into a 30yo; just moved back to rural Wisconsin (with my parents); Just keep getting wronged named and misgendered. Lease my cat gets it. Came here for the cake and validation. Y'all keep me going, thanks.		"YOU KEEP GOING MY FRIEND!!
Happy cake day, stay brave out there and take care of yourself please! I tiptoe through the rural parts kind of hoping they're content to misgender me. I'm glad you got out of the toxic relationship and I wish you more irl validation soon! <3
Happy cake day! Keep your head up, things will get better. Much love fellow WI dweller 💜
Congratulations on leaving that awful relationship. Happy to see you here with your adorable kitty!
Sending good vibes from Illinois! Proud of you for getting out of the bad relationship. You did right by yourself and things will get better ❤️
Wow congrats on all the big changes! Glad you’re here
I am going through similar stage myself....just set objectives for myself because I know I deserve better and I am using the anger/hurt as fuel...don't forget to see yourself and to tell yourself that you love you!
Thank you all for the kind words <3 we love to see it <3
Congratulations on getting out of a toxic relationship. Good luck with your parents...

“home for winter break and my family won’t stop misgendering me” lewkz (ft. the bikes they store in my room now)		"Constant mood. 

I live with my family. My brother today sat at the dinner table for about two minutes and went on about the amount of men/women in the house.

Which means I was automatically looped in with women, of course.
That's really rough friend ❤
ugh mood!! ❤️ my brother greeted me with a sign saying “LIBRALS ARE BAD because they are dumb” and then proceeded to go on about how there are only two genders....don’t know whether to give him a sociology or spelling lesson first "	a84nry	NonBinary	106	0.99	2018-12-21 00:49:57
the catch 22 of being trans	"""i dont want to come out to you"" and ""i don't want you to misgender me"""	"Me, who decides that it’s better for people to unknowingly misgender me than to do it on purpose.
Or knowing people as trans and them asking ""what's your birth name though?"".

I refuse to tell people. That's so intrusive
You forgot the third option of coming out to someone and then having them misgender you because they don't get it, yet.
But for real, how do you come out to new people safely? Like if I met a new friend hiking and I don't want to get murdered but I also don't want to waste time making friends with people who won't respect my identity.
Catch 22 indeed...
My solution is to just come out to everyone. I still get misgendered, especially by boomers, but people close to me often use my pronouns!
Oof
Yah, big mood
this is facts
Why would they want to know too?? Idk there’s a part of me that’s like please don’t fucking tell me or I’ll associate that info in my head even if I don’t mean to
I switched names at work (no problems for the most part, and turnover is p high anyway) and I had a coworker who was telling new employees my dead name with me standing right there and then trying to lie to me about it. 
He's since stopped that, thankfully, and now the only people who use my dead name are my family. Some of my cousins would switch if I asked, but I haven't bc I don't necessarily need the drama that would bring to my life. 
(And I'm waiting for one of my aunts or uncles to bring it up at work--I see them often enough that I'm surprised that it's only happened once. Both of my parents are very aware I use my name at work and school and literally everywhere without them; they just like to pretend I don't.)
Like who cares if that's not what youre called. Like they want a piece of information to hold over you
Or the fourth option of coming out to someone and having them misgender you because they're trying to start a fight or get a reaction out of you
not really the same thing, but semi-relevant: i was talking to someone on a mental health hotline about my friend and his boyfriend and the lady immediately changed it to ""girlfriend"" :[ heteronormativity is stupid
You could tell them your preferred pronouns.  Their reaction to that statement will tell you a lot.  And they too may be trans, or questioning, and if you create that space for them to be open, it can be where they opt to provide their pronouns as well.  It's a simple statement, but with how divisive it has become, it'll be a quick give away.  I would just not do it in the middle of a hike.  Preferably at the start before leaving public line of sight.
i don't know :[ i usually just don't tell them until i know them well enough to know they're safe
im glad that works for you! unfortunately for me personally in the past ive watched some vile transphobic shit happen to some of my friends so i'm not fully comfortable being out- tho my friends are fantastic with my pronouns :)
This one though!!!!
Much agreed: you have to stay safe. Not all was plain sailing for me. I was no-contact with the toxic half of my family, but got back into contact after an uncle passed, only to be on the receiving end of horrific transphobic abuse. At least my decision to be no-contact feels well and truly validated!"	zgy8h7	NonBinary	107	0.99	2022-12-09 14:06:38
"I feel like I'm not ""allowed"" to be non binary because I'm not white. Any help?"	"I feel like ever since I realized I was non binary about 8 months ago I felt like I wasn't ""allowed"" to identify as non binary because I wasn't white (I'm Asian). You know, like I just CAN'T be non binary unless I was white. For some reason I always felt that as an Asian person (Chinese to be specific), I had to honor my culture's traditional values about gender. I noticed I would constantly misgender myself in my head but not when I was speaking. I mean I know I'm non binary but part of me hates myself for it because I'm not white. Even when I see people post selfies here I rarely see non-white people, let alone Asian people which I feel has been very isolating for me. I've always told myself that if I was white, I would be much more likely to truly feel valid.

Now I feel like I'm conflicted. On one hand I want to honor my heritage and culture, on the other hand I want to accept myself as non binary. Does anybody have any advice for me?"	"There are nonbinary people of all races and backgrounds, the overrepresentation of white people here does not reflect reality - much like how the underrepresentation of other races in media doesn't.

Still, as a white person I don't have the lived experience to talk about how your race and cultural heritage might influence your identity. I *think* you shouldn't feel compelled to follow all traditions you inherited, but I understand one's culture is also a big part of who they are.

Hopefully, your fellow queer asians will offer you advice more pertinent to your situation than mine.

In Asia, just like in America and in the Pacific, there were and are cultural non-binary genders (often transfeminine) that were purposefully supressed by colonization and imperialism. Transgender identities have always existed and will always exist, even when hidden under layers of taboo and trauma.

The image of non-binariness as a white people's club is a reversion of history, a mirage that must be dispersed.
I don't know if you like fantasy at all, but if you do then you might be interested in Neon Yang's books, assuming you haven't already read them. They're a nonbinary, Singaporean author whose work touches on gender themes in an Asian inspired fantasy setting. I really enjoyed their Tensorate series. I can't recall if there are any explicitly nonbinary characters in them, but they certainly exist in the setting's background, and at least one of the two main characters is trans.

Fictional representation might not be quite as fulfilling as real representation, but it's a start, right?
Follow your heart and express your true self. There are no values external to you that are worth sacrificing your own sense of self to. If you're non-binary, you're non-binary, regardless of the color of your skin.

As for the selfies, be the change you want to see in the world. I love how diverse the gender representation here is, but I'd love to see more racial/ethnic diversity as well. You are welcome here. :)
Hello! I’m half Asian and I follow a few Asian non-binary people on Instagram who are pretty cool and inspirational :) If you’re interested I can pass along their profiles! It’s important for us to see people who look like us living their lives and thriving!
I know nothing about Chinese culture, so I’m not able to respond to that significant part of your concern.
That being said, I was having a conversation 2 days ago with my partner about the extreme lack of Asian representation in basically all aspects of life.
The only thing I can think to compare to your cultural concern regarding your gender identity is, for me, religious beliefs. They, of course, cannot be equated because ones heritage is inborn and cannot be changed unlike religion. The similarity is that both culture (regardless of ethnicity) has its own set of customs and traditions. Religion also has set customs and traditions.
Something being traditional does not make it right, nor does it mean that it is the only way of being.

I am ecstatic to see a person of Chinese descent who is non-binary! Feeling valid is a struggle, especially if you have been made to believe that there is no space for something other than “this or that”.
I wish you all the best in discovering how to validate yourself as the whole, genuine being that you are. ❤️
Here's a top tip: most white non-binary people are not honouring their culture's traditional values about gender either. We make a lot of people angry just by existing. It's okay for you to do the same :)
Full disclosure, I am white (southern european, specifically, if that helps), and i think you're absolutely correct to state publicly that NB representation, especially online, has a serious problem wrt diversity. 

At the same time, I hope that it is possible for you to find some of the examples of NBPOC (because they are here and they are wonderful). I know there are subreddits for Black LGBT/queer individuals, but I haven't heard of similar for East Asian communities. (Though i could recommend you some folks maybe to follow on insta if you wanted to DM me.)

The cultural aspect is much harder and something you need to find your own path for, of course. I've struggled with how to address being NB/transmasc/butch in the highly gendered spaces of my southern european heritage, and the gendering of language in my mother's language, but I dont have a one-size-fits-all approach there. 

I know some people who have felt better able to honor their culture by incorporating gender-affirming aspects of traditional clothing as a way of honoring their heritage and their gender expression at the same time. 

I also remember a conversation with a close friend of mine where they expressed their frustration that a lot of the self-presentation markers associated with ""queerness"" in white or even Black american circles (for them: dyed hair, facial piercings, and the like) were perceived as just being ""fashionable"" or ""cool"" or even ""cute"" as a result of their East Asian heritage. So know that you're not alone in navigating these complex, intersecting identities. 

I hope people come forward with better and more suitable personal experiences, but I also hope we can be welcoming and supportive as a community to allow you to work through these things here with us. 

Sending love and support to you ✨
I heard X-gender is a term used in Japan for nombinary Japanese people (and Japanese x-gender people have their own version of the enby flag that has the original pattern, but within an x.)
I’m a non-binary lesbian and I’m Chinese. You are allowed to be non binary. Our culture goes so much deeper than dating and gender traditions and just because you are non binary doesn’t mean you are not a part of our culture anymore. I’m still trying to learn more about lgbt history in China but it goes so much deeper than just cis het relationships. It’s alright if you are struggling with your identity in your head, I do it too sometimes. But just remember to trust your own experiences and understanding of yourself. I do think it’s important to talk about the lack of diversity in non binary spaces but poc non binary folks are out there!!! You’ll be fine:)
You are valid just as you are, just because the visuals are hyper saturated by skinny white people doesn't mean there aren't just as many nonbinary people within every racial group. 

Also it's worth noting that I have literally never heard of a inherently white culture that actually has a concept of people with a third gender, instead white people tend to be the christio-centric invaders who through force make people of different cultures they've colonised go from having a healthy, even to the degree of reverence attitude of trans people in their various forms but that has been scrubbed out.

In short, you have the same right to live your truth as anyone else, you get to decide how that synergises with your heritage and belief systems.

I'm proud of you. You've got this. I believe in you.
I’m not Asian, but I really feel you hard. I’ve honestly never really paid mind to lack of black representation until I started questioning. 

It seems to me you care more about your heritage than I do, so I don’t have much advice. For me, the idea that I’m not a “real” part of my heritage doesn’t bother me. 

I believe it’s very possible to honor heritage without following all its rules. Even people committed to it do so.
Hey! Nonbinary white person here! Just wanted to say that I, too, misgender myself all the time in my head, even now coming up on two years of using they/them pronouns publicly. Never aloud, but in my brain? All the freaking time. Just wanted you to know that, whether or not it is directly tied to your concerns about your heritage, you aren't alone in that habit!! <3
Hey, 

I'm here just to let you know you're not alone, I'm also POC enby from a culture with very traditional values regarding gender (I'm of North African descent).
Get a therapist.
What you just said really just made me feel a lot better! After all just because I'm Chinese doesn't mean I have to follow every single tradition dating back to thousands of years ago right?
Glad to see another fellow Chinese enby around here!
1. Not everyone can afford a therapist

2. Just because you go to the therapist does not mean you can't seek help elsewhere.

3. People form communities around a shared identity to help one another in matters related to that identity.
Exactly! There is an unfortunate tendency even in more ""progressive"" circles of holding PoC to tighter standards than white people.

I've even seem people snarking at muslim girls for covering their heads but not their legs, as if dropping one tradition meant they should drop them all, while white feminist christians are never called hypocrites for example (nor should they be, but you get the point)
While I understand that nonbinary spaces are generally very white, it's also important to note that it's not like this is our ancient tradition, either, and there is so much pushback against nonbinary people in white culture. Subreddits like this actually exist because we need to create our own spaces to not feel isolated and alone. And so I hope you feel welcome, and in at some point in the future, adequately represented.
I agree, but the issues presented here are deep & I believe deeper than community support can help."	m6nivy	NonBinary	109	1.0	2021-03-17 00:22:25

Yesterday a kid asked me if I wear a bikini or shorts when I go to the beach and I’ve been feeling dysphoric since	"I work with kids ranging from k-12 and have been pretty open about explaining my pronouns and correcting them when I get misgendered.  For the most part they’re cool about it, but there’s one that stresses me out lol

He’s a kid, he’s curious.  He’s trying with my pronouns and is mostly fine when I correct him (I let it slide now and again cuz I don’t wanna overwhelm them or anything).  But like I said, he’s curious and hasn’t met someone like me before, so he’s asking questions.

I don’t wanna just dismiss his questions because I want to help him understand, but it’s exhausting at times.  He asked yesterday if I’d wear shorts or a bikini when I go to the beach.  And this questioned bugged me, heck it’s still bugging me hence this post lol

“I don’t go to the beach”
“But if you did what would you wear?”
“Jeans and a hoodie, like I’m wearing now”
“What about for when you go in the water?”
“I don’t go in the water”
“Why???”
“I don’t like the water”
“But you live in California!  You were born on an island!”  Funny enough me not liking water seemed the hardest for him to grasp lol 

I don’t like my body, never did like having to wear lady swimwear.  I don’t like feeling exposed.  I’m a baggy hoodie kinda person.  A don’t-perceive-me kind of person.  The thought of me in a bikini stresses me out.  The idea of someone suggesting it, or even the mere thought of them thinking it fills me with dread.  I’ve been feeling self conscious ever since.

On another note, same kid asked me “if you were in the military, would they use sir or ma’am?” Told him I neither, just whatever my rank is.  He started asking more hypotheticals.  Wanting to be done talking about it, I told him “well, I never plan on joining the military, so that’s not a problem”.  THAT blew his mind and I had to explain why the military isn’t for me which was exhausting in another way lol

Anywhoo, I’m just tired.  Tired of explaining my gender, my preference and my existence.  Tired of being misgendered and correcting people.  Heck, just tired of being perceived in general.  I go to work in a few hours, I hope he doesn’t ask those questions again.

Just needed to get that all off my chest.  I’m feeling a little better now at least.

If you have suggestions on how to answer kids when they have a question you don’t know how to answer or don’t wanna answer, please let me know.  Thanks ✌️"	"I'm not a teacher but I've worked with kids in educational settings and I feel you on how their well meaning questions and lack of appropriate boundaries can be exhausting :)

Perhaps treating it as a teaching moment around healthy boundary setting could be a way to approach this?

Like maybe say something like 'I understand your curiosity and it's always okay to ask, but that information is personal I'm not comfortable discussing it with you' and then gently but firmly repeat if they don't respect your wishes?

It's a normal part of childhood development to need to learn to appropriately respond to 'no' from folks and it's probably good that they learn that some information is considered intimate or some questions intrusive. You demonstrating that for them should be helpful to them in the long run
Lol back at Summer camp I would just mess with them. They think its funny when you make obvious lies like ""Im actually 49 years old"" and then fight you about it like No you arent! If u really want them to stop bugging you about it just make up crazy lies. Like you grow fins or scales if you go in water. It entertains them and theyll stop bugging you. Doesnt work on EVERY kid though. I think their curiousity is fun though.
His curiosity is healthy, but it's not rude of you to ask him to stop if it's making you uncomfortable. That's another lesson he should learn, that harassing someone with too many questions isn't cool either. I definitely feel you on avoiding the public eye, I have social anxiety myself. More than a few people in my surrounding area and I start feeling self conscious as hell
Make a sad face and say that you don't get to because nobody's invented the right clothes for it yet. Watch him try to turn a diving helmet into enby bathing suit bottoms for you. 

It's draining and takes a lot, even with well-meaning questions. It wouldn't be wrong to take advice from other posters and gently but firmly cut him off once it gets to be too much. And if the whys get too intense, be honest but gently so: ""I don't do some things because it HURTS. And like any hurt, it distracts you from trying to have fun while you're in pain. The beach isn't a fun place for me to swim. It's a painful place where people stare at me and try to see me as only a boy or a girl. Avoiding things that hurt is pretty smart, right? That's why it's so important to me, and why it's important for you to be kind to others even if you don't understand what's important to them.""

Others are also correct. Blatantly ridiculous lies are an excellent option with kids. ""I wear an entire diving bell, and I have to paint myself fluorescent yellow first to confuse the fish. Oh, or red if it's salt water.""
He sounds like a super inquisitive kid, and I am glad you are answering his questions. I'm sorry it is so exhausting for you, though! 

I feel like he will most likely burn out on the subject and move on, on his own. Hopefully sooner rather than later, for your sake. It sounds like he's at that age where you just get a zillion questions and ""why?s"" no matter what subject, lol. Perhaps today he'll already be focused on another new subject. 

Maybe if you can find out something else he is very interested in (ie if he esp likes art, history, a specific movie or show etc), and try to redirect him towards that and/or use examples of it to help him accept new explanations. (Ie, Batman goes swimming in his Batsuit w shorts over it in the old 60s show, maybe youre hiding your secret identity). (Kind of a goofy example but hopefully you get my point lol)

I havent been swimming in years but this year I plan to get me some trunks, a swim binder, and get out in the sun with SPF 9000+ on in all my hairy legged glory. 

I also hated feminine swimwear like, the moment I hit puberty. 

Hope today is better and includes way less tiring questions. 

Thank you for existing. 💖
""you know, these are a lot of great questions! But, I don't think I can answer all of them just yet for you. I'll tell ya this, each day you can ask me 3 questions about myself, that way I can give you the best answers I can!""

Kids love learning, if you make it a fun game and something they are openly able to do *within reason* then they'll absolutely be happy with whatever you answer them as.

Or you can answer as a joke, which frustrates them and they'll eventually just stop asking.

""What do you wear to the beach?""

""Oh full green suit, gotta blend in with the environment when I'm green screened in.""

""What would you be called in the military?""

""Chef, someone's gotta make them their sloppy joes!""
When people start in on the sir/ma'am thing, I like telling them to use 'mistrum' abbreviated as 'Mm.' or 'Mist.' 
It's a gender neutral version of mister/mistress from the Latin root 'magister', so it fits in well where a sir/ma'am usually goes most of the time in my experience. 

But of course you're well within your right to set a boundary and just tell him you're not feeling up for 20 Questions right now about any topic. It's good to learn to just respect people
No advice, just popping in to say that you’re freaking awesome for taking the time to be so attentive to this kids questions even when it’s exhausting. This is part of how kids will learn that gender isn’t what they think it is. You rock!
It's worth considering the strong desire to learn more, might be a desire to understand themselves.  I think many lgbt kids get obsessed with the first person they see that they feel like.  Could be simple curiosity as well though.  I'm sorry it gets to be too much.
Kids are curious j get the same at the preschool I work in they’re just being interested. I usually just try
Move the conversation when it’s getting too deep or give them an answer which will make sense for their age. Try not get too frustrated or upset by it they’re curious and trying to figure out the world it’s quite positive that he’s asking questions. But it is ok to be like I don’t wanna talk about this rn can we do something else
Say you wear a wetsuit and go surfing lol
It’s great that the kids are curious, but totally understand where you’re coming from. No suggestions on how to answer questions, but related to swim suits, “crop top” style bikini top (or just a sports bra) with trunks has become my go-to swimwear and it makes me feel so happy
I think your response should sort of be tailored to what this kids’ deal is. How old is he? Does he have any other behavioral issues in class? Is he just inquisitive or is this a pattern of trying to push buttons? 

Just from what you’ve written it sounds like this is a kid who knows asking you about gender gets under your skin and is less interested in the answers than in making you uncomfortable and drawing you into a lengthy discussion. (If you’re sure it’s just genuine curiosity, disregard the next paragraph) 

I doubt it’s malicious, it’s just that some kids really like to test boundaries and if they know they can make the person in charge squirm a bit they are going to say exactly the thing that gets a reaction. Essentially you’ve had a reaction to all his questions about gender so you’ve rewarded him with your reaction and now he’s gonna keep asking about it. My technique with a kid like this would be to give quick, simple answers and move on. “Do you wear a bikini or shorts?” “Whichever I feel like wearing, but usually I don’t swim. How are you doing with your book report?” Or “In the military would you be a sir or a ma’am?” “I haven’t really thought about it. Ok, time to get in line for recess.” If he keeps asking you can say, “I’ve answered a lot of your questions about this, and I’m worried thinking about it is distracting you from xyz activities so let’s not discuss it right now.” 

If you think he is genuinely curious, I might offer: “now isn’t a great time for these questions but I know you’re really interested. Let’s sit down at X time and you can ask me all your questions and I’ll answer as best I can, when it’s not disruptive to the class activity.”
“I would wear whatever I felt like at the time if it’s board shorts and a I’ve protective shirt then that’s fine if it’s a bikini and bathing suit cover then fine if it’s just whatever old pair of clothes I can find then it’s fine”
Seems to me like you handled the situation quite well. Even though a kid is a kid, it’s always acceptable to just say you don’t want to answer, or you’re not sure, or whatever, and then just change the subject. Regarding swimwear (if you’re ever interested), there are a number of gender neutral uni-suits available. I’ve got one from tomboyx, but I’ve heard nice things about beefcake too.
Kids are curious and have been fed a binarist narrative and live in a very overtly binary context where this is reinforced daily (more so than adults, since they receive direct instruction bc they’re kids. And you just opened up a WORLD of possibility for this child. Get out of your own head for a minute and consider whether you may be talking to a (future) non-binary/trans/gender nonconforming kid who doesn’t even realize that the reason he’s asking so many questions is because seeing this possibility for the first time is touching something deep within him. If you look at it this way, how would you respond?
Tell him that questions like that are inappropriate.
First off I second everything the other posters have said about setting boundaries: Super hard, but super worth it for everyone (I'm sure that kid doesn't want you upset either). 

Hopefully this might help satisfy their curiosity before your boundaries are reached though: I've worked in a few primary (US: elementary) schools with kids under 10, and I found that telling them there's another option generally works. I understand that in your beach example saying ""I wear something else"" would prompt more questions, but in the army one maybe this kid would understand something like ""Some people don't like sir *or* ma'am, but there doesn't need to be another word because you can call them by rank"" might work.

*Might*. This kid sounds super inquisitive though. I've been there and I want to reassure you that thinking ""shut up kid"" is absolutely fine and nothing to be ashamed of, just as long as you don't actually say it.
Shorts and a swim top like those ones with long sleeves would be a good swim outfit I think
Say your are trans make or trans female
.you know thee nothing that non binary
This! Kids should be taught immediately that consent matters in EVERY context. Obviously it takes kids some time to understand what can and cannot be said ""no"" to, but teaching them now is the best way to go.

And if you're willing to answer the questions but just need some time to think, or need a break from the questions, you can explain that to them too. It may take some time, but eventually they'll learn ""not right now"" and ""no"" are important sentences to pay attention to and respect.
Great point great point.  Practicing setting and communicating my boundaries is good for me as well
THIS. Kids love lies ***if*** they are unbelievable enough to be obviously lies. Something like ""If you don't go to bed right now I'll turn into a big green monster and gobble you up!"" told with the same grin you give them each time you exaggerate or mildly wind them up will usually be met by a laugh and them going to bed. ""Go to bed because it's time for bed"" will often be met by a child wanting to know *why* is it time for bed?
These responses are amazing.  I'm autistic, and if people had explained stuff this way to me when I was a kid, I would have been much better equipped to be a good friend to my peers.
Haha thanks, and you’re probably right, I think he’ll be focused on some new topic today.  (And if not, I’ll definitely work on changing topics lol)

Just hearing other people weigh in and have similar experiences especially with swimwear is always reassuring.
It's true.  If this kid turns out to be nonbinary, they will probably be more ready to accept themselves because of having had you in their life.
Don't want to assume OP's opinion but in their situation I would rather not have to go down the ""Why is it inappropriate?"" questioning route that would immediately follow. From the way OP talked about the kid I would guess that at this point of their development ""I don't want to answer that question"" and ""I don't want to tell you why"" seem like more constructive responses. Once the child understands that not wanting to answer some questions is a thing then you can move on to ""That's inappropriate"" (i.e: ""That's one of the things people don't like being asked"").
Also, when I was around kids more often, I would often get used to saying ""I don't know"" and ""I haven't really thought about it.""  ""Neither"" and ""Both"" can also help when you state them very matter-of-factly.
So hard to do, but so worth it.
I myself am autistic and honestly explaining stuff to kids is way easier than people want to think.
And saying “I don’t know” teaches them softly that authority figures aren’t infallible, which is a lesson best learned as soon and as gently as possible."	ud82cr	NonBinary	99	0.99	2022-04-27 16:48:42
What do you do when you’re called “maam” or “sir” by a cashier or stranger?	"I’m AFAB but I really don’t know what to do when strangers do this. Do I just let them even though it’s a small interaction? I’m really, really shy about telling anyone my pronouns so I’m often misgendered a lot by my coworkers and strangers… I know you can be NB regardless of appearance of but I’m so afraid of being judged because I don’t look fully androgynous- I still dress feminine and I *love* wearing skirts.

Thanks in the meantime! 🖤"	"Grit my teeth and move on

I only feel it's worth me correcting if I have more of a relationship with a person
Unfortunately we have to wait for society to stop gendering everyone they see. It’s definitely not worth our energy or time to correct every stranger or customer service person we meet.
I realized that I can't get upset unless it's personal, when cashiers are saying it they don't mean it personally they're actually trying to be respectful. So I don't put my energy towards those interactions.
But recently I got a They Them pin to wear and see if that helps at all to reduce the ma'aming that I get.
I know the vast majority of comments say they don't correct people, but I try to gently correct them while responding to their comment.

Example: ""how's it going, ma'am?""

Respond with: ""not too bad, not a ma'am though.""
I genuinely think *most* people run on autopilot good intentions or not, and it’s like a  “how’s your day going” without them actually wanting to know lol. I don’t take those *personal*. They’re not *trying* to offend me and I got better things to do than educate everyone I meet. 

That said, I switch pronouns on them if they refuse to on me. See how they like it.
I do nothing, I feel okay called either sir or ma'am. 
And in my native language there isn't any polite gender neutral term that I can expect from strangers.
I wear a pronoun pin pretty much any time I leave the house but I usually don't bother correcting random cashiers when I'm out or customers at work. If they can't read, I can't help them
Nothing, I’m legit never gonna see them again and they would forget seconds after me telling them. If they’re not in my circle, who cares tbh
For cashiers/quick interactions, I don’t bother. Thinking of intent, I know they’re just doing their job, and they are doing it to be respectful, it’s just not the word I want. 

If it was a place I frequented, and always talked to the same person, I might mention something, like if there’s a small coffee shop you visit every couple days with the same barista/cashier. Even then, only if we are chatty.

I save my energy for people who should know, and have been told, who know me more personally: family, friends, coworkers. It’s still scary, but that’s where it’s worth it
Hey, skirts can fit on either of the binary sides regardless at least I think so
Calling me ma'am, i feel old but respected. 
Calling me sir, i feel funny, but i also don't care enough to correct a stranger. 

But i have gotten stares in the women's bathroom, which i have gotten some what used to. 

But i had one customer who actually had the audacity to argue with me what i was wearing was a pair of men jeans.

Like yes i do have short hair, but i was born female. So-called women's jeans fit me better.  So i wear them. 
What a ridiculous thing to comment and argue about. 

Too bad it was my first real job, working as a cashier, at a relatively traditional asian supermarket. So 🤷🏻‍♂️
I just complain to my coworkers and try to move on bc this happens every day when I work. I’m obviously queer looking, and every old out of touch man wants to be like “thank you YOUNG LADY” with the emphasis (which feels like a personal dig) so I don’t give them the response they want lmfao. It’s so hard to let it roll off after a while, can’t wait til I start looking more androgynous
This is why I call everyone ""champion"" while working. Ungendered, sometimes starts fabulous conversations, complimentary. Also I think it works well with my accent :]
feel dysphoric
I misgender them right back. ""you're welcome sir/ma'am/brother/sister""
I prefer sir so I’d probably correct someone if they called me ma’am
if i were going to say anything, i would probably encourage the cashier to not use gendered terms. sometimes people don't care, sometimes they just need education, and sometimes they are trying to be inclusive and just slip up. i didn't realize how much sir and ma'am were baked into my customer service mask until i returned to work this fall. kicked myself every time i used it because there's so much assumption involved, and i wouldn't want anyone to assume when i'm the customer! so... yeah. give them the benefit of the doubt, educate them if you feel it's worth your effort, and move on.
For me personally, I take it in stride, since it's on par with how I use pronouns for myself. Any pronouns will do, so long as you aren't trying to be an asshole.   
   
Granted, I'm agender and gender apathetic, so keep that in mind.
I correct everyone every time. I’m always very polite and smiley about it. Half the time they ignore me, but half the time they do actually stop and think, and I hope that they start to be more cautious with people after me.
This happened at Cafe Nero in Edinburgh Waverley. I just said quietly ""I'm sorry but I'm non binary"", the server apologised and gave me the coffee for free. That was a surprise, but really lovely.

Isn't always like that but I'm blessed / cursed with not being able to stay quiet (partly my autism) so at least people know they shouldn't assume.
I work on the phone and I get gendered all day. It’s not the most annoying part of my job so I just deal with it.
I’m numb too it so I just don’t hear it anymore
I get that interactions like that can be annoying or irksome, even though they are brief. I'd say that personally, I let it go; I can't bring myself to using my energy for something that small. I think other people's ideas about wearing pronoun pins are really good if you absolute feel the need to correct people, which I completely understand btw. 

As a former cashier and server, I also have to think about the fact that I've had people get upset for me not being formal enough (not using ma'am or sir with them.) idk what kind of experience that person deals with at their job, and I'd rather not make things more complicated for them.
I understand the disappointment, but I remember that when I first came to Canada (and my English was really bad), I saw a person dropping their phone from the pocket and just moving one. I picked it up, and I was trying to attract their attention by saying ""excuse me! You dropped your phone!"" multiple times, but the person paid attention to me only when I called them maam.
How could I address a person without gendering them in situations like this? I'm asking sincerely, without any malicious intent.
Nothing. If it’s not an interpersonal relationship or someone I’ll be interacting with often, it’s more of a drain on me to correct them. Plus I don’t feel safe outing myself to strangers in most situations.
I don't try to correct them even though I don't like being called ""sir"". I don't think it's worth the effort.
Either just feel dysphoric and not take it personally because they're strangers OR if I can't deal with any more negative vibes, just correct them with a smile and bubbly attitude like, ""oh, I'm not a ma'am/sir 😆"" and bounce before they can process that.
That feeling when in your mother tongue this ""maaam"" is literally ""girl"" 😤
i (internally) roll my eyes and remind myself that the snap judgements of strangers have no bearing on my identity. this, of course, is easier said than done, but sometime i just wanna buy my ice cream and leave without further interaction o
I just grunt with enough volume so they hear.
I honestly don't understand how hard it is to say just ""have a good one"" or ""how're you doing"" or hell even when referring to someone you don't know, saying ""they need this"" but maybe as a transfem person I know how it feels to be misgendered so I avoid it, but it cannot be that hard honestly.
We don’t get ‘ma’am’ or ‘sir’ so much here, but when someone says ‘ladies’ I gaily correct them ‘Not a lady!’ And maybe ‘not a lady - they’re a they!’ or ‘not a lady, I’m neither guy or girl’. People often look confused, or do a short laugh (I think from confusion). I say it loudly and confidently and like they’ve been a bit silly and that they’ve definitely got it wrong.
I‘m over a year on testosterone now and even when Im presenting masc people perceive me as a woman all of the time :D Im happy that with time [and hormones] my anger passed and I got my tolerance back lol. now Im more chill with it and kinda got to a point where I like the idea of „inviting in“ [in relationships that are important in some way] and that I dont need every stranger to know. I mean most of the times I said something it was just also weird and Im never seing these people again and I dont think they „get it“ in a way I would like them to. they will just have some other label and I dont now whether it is better than just being misgendered. but I also feel bad sometimes bc I think that this a very priviledged position and I should say something all of the time bc of visibility but I figured my wellbeing is more importsnt. So I would say you do you. try it out. look what feels less bad haha
I am also AFAB non-binary and get called this a lot at my retail job, most people just don’t notice my pronoun pin or don’t know what term to use. My biggest tip is don’t concern yourself with those people. Like honestly, unless this is someone you see frequently, don’t bother correcting them. I don’t correct customers who refer to me as “ma’am” because I will never have another interaction with them again outside of me assisting them in that moment and because where I live you address people that way as a sign of respect so it bothers me less. Trust me, in that little >1min interaction, nobody is judging you, and if they do, it doesn’t matter because you don’t know them and they don’t know you.

Pick your battles. I correct my coworkers, my friends, and other people that I do see regularly and have some kind of relationship with. But what strangers do or think in most situations doesn’t matter :)
I really don’t care.
i feel yucky but unless i’m gonna see them again i let it slide bc effort
I just thank them and be on my merry way, unfortunately in the customer service industry you have to be as POLITE as possible with customers and they don't exactly have non-binary training for cashiers. We have to wait a little longer for that if they even do that kind of training at all.
If I'm in my best zen mindset I just think that since I am not a specific gender then maybe all titles could apply to me.
But most days, I just sigh to myself and try to forget about it.
Well if they call me ma’am when I have a full beard I just stare at them awkwardly. If they call me sir I do the same thing.
Smile awkwardly and die inside
I feel like a simple ""you can't always assume"" followed by no farther explanation is good

&#x200B;

edit: accidentally put ""can"" instead of ""can't""
Roll my eyes and move on. I dress exclusively masc, so I just assume that people are blind when they ""Miss"" me.
I know what you mean, even when I’m presenting more masc people still call me a woman. I get maamed to death. I hate it I want it to stop but I won’t make a cashier feel bad about it because they are only in my life for a moment. I grit my teeth and take a deep breath as I leave. Now if I could get my neighbors to stop calling me “girl” or “ladies” that would be nice.

Also it is important to note that many places have company policy requiring their staff to use this type of language to interact with patrons, it sucks but it’s part of their job.
No one’s ever called me this, I feel like I look too.. young for people to instinctively call me ma’am. Not physically, when I was 10 someone thought I was 18, but the way I *present* myself is very young looking. I think I’d feel uncomfortable, I’m not used to being addressed like that.
I usually just take whatever they say, unless it’s obviously malicious or they should know better (for example, the gender clinic should damn well have known better than to “Ma’am” me, although I was of course polite when correcting.)

Ngl, even though I’m non-binary I get a bit of euphoria from being called Sir, so I’m not going to reject that one.
just me but  
ma’am: maximum uncanny mr incredible  
sir: maximum canny mr incredible

politely correct them if they get it wrong
where a they them pin and point to it when it happens. may inspire them to read or something.
i just let it go bc i’m not interested in being attacked or harassed and also because they would literally have no way of knowing any better
I don’t care. 90% of them only know m/f. And the others can’t tell… How should they know yesterday i was pangender and today it shifted to agender?
I would only correct them if I knew I were going to interact with them on a regular basis.
I just go along with it honestly if I'll never see them again no reason to correct them especially in small town Texas
This is offensive even to cis-women yo be called ma’am

It is a formal way to referred to a married women which has its roots from back in the day when women were owned. 

So yeah if I have the energy I ask them not to refer to me as ma’am. Because I’m not married and I’m not a women. And let them know it’s a sexist term that a lot of people don’t appreciate.
I stopped caring.  If I'm a boy then I'm a femboy, whatever.   I just decided one day to not let pronouns have any effect on my happiness and it worked somehow.
If you ain't gonna see them again what's the use?
Even presenting as masc I don't let people call me sir.  If it's not a place I frequent I'll let it slide, but not where I'm a regular.  Sometimes new hires will say sir and I'm just like Nope none of that, other times I'll say ""I'm no ser"" quoting The Hound jokingly.  One way or another I make it clear it makes me uncomfortable.
I don't care how the world perceives me. I do things to make myself feel more comfortable in my own skin, but I don't see how that's anyone else's problem.

Being called sir or ma'am is a friendly sign of respect and I take it as such.

My gender identity is the least important thing about me.
I’m a cashier in a small city. I just try to avoid gendered language at all while talking to someone.

(e.g. “How are you doing today?” “Did you find everything you were looking for?” “Have a great day!”) 

literally an entire interaction can be done without a single gendered pronoun. idk why cashiers give themselves more work by guess people’s genders
Internally gag and smile… I’ve been called sir maybe twice and it was when I didn’t speak. I wish I could still get a sir once I open my mouth ://

I wear pins everywhere to try and look a little 💅 so people don’t automatically call me ma’am, but it happens *a lot* at work+especially when I wear makeup. Thankfully I have enough patience to know that dismantling the binary reality much of the world lives in is basically impossible for the average Joe, so I kinda just have to deal with it and if it’s someone I have to see frequently misgender me I just let ‘em know. My coworkers are pretty good about it it but some of them are oblivious or just didn’t get the memo with my pins and conversations with other people. 99% of the time old guys that call me ma’am, or over the phone. Can’t really do anything about that without sounding like an ass unfortunately. 


JESUS THIS IS LONG 
Okay every time I try to justify why it isn’t “appropriate” to correct someone when they misgender me, I think about it like if someone were to call me the wrong name, or mistake me for a server (I work in a restaurant). They don’t know me, they don’t know how my reality works, I can’t expect them to know everything. If someone asks me to do something a server would do, I’d say “sorry, I’m not a server but-”, and if someone were to call me a girl, I’d be like “sorry, I’m actually not a girl but-“ 

The thing with the sir/ma’am is that it’s second nature and they usually just do it to be polite. They aren’t trying to assert anything. So it’s just…agh. Y’know.
It's tricky that there isn't a standard acceptable non-gendered honorific. 

I usually let it go because I can (I'm not going to trivialise your feelings). My favourite is when I confuse them with my presentation, and they call me Sir/Madam/Sir or Madam/Sir/Madam in one awkward breath. Most people are taught that using Madam or Sir is the way to be polite.
I just move on. I get called both, so it confuses me how people can interpret me differently,  but it also satisfies me to a degree that it's mixed.
Be glad you're not me, I'm fine with sir or they/them but get called ""ma'am"" on the phone unless I go out of my way to make a big manly spectacle which I no longer have patience for. Exhausting!
me too tbh
true but when I worked retail I never gendered anyone. just went with a “how are you?” and “have a nice day!”. It still irks me I have to get called “maam” by every cashier I meet. :(
I called the health benefits at my new job to discuss options for changing my gender marker, identifying myself as non-binary at least twice and the call center person called me ""ma'am"" at least 5 times in a 10 minute conversation. 😒
I love this! I wish I had more upvotes to bump this higher up.


You don't *have to* correct anyone, but you shouldn't be made to feel uncomfortable. 👌
I really like this one! May I borrow it? :)
I normally don’t correct anyone. But ma’am and sir are pretty much the worst. I like your gentle correction. And even if you don’t change any hearts and minds you are sticking up for yourself. I can see there being a lot of value in that both for one’s own self esteem and mental health. 

Maybe there are other “gentle corrections” or things that can steer people away from the ma’am/sir word vomit.  Maybe one could say “thanks mate/friend/comrade”. Hit them back with a non-gendered term. Could be a little way to stick up for oneself especially in a circumstance where maybe you don’t feel safe/comfortable correcting.
This has been my go-to, but I have more than once been met with the person reiterating ""Ma'am"" because they must think I said ""I'm not a man"". >.< UGH.
I do this too! Especially with “sir, oops, sorry, maam” - neither is right but (insert response)
Thats a good way to do it.
I've always want to channel Janeway and say, ""Ma'am will do in a pinch, but I prefer Captain."" (Even though, no, ma'am won't actually do, but I really want to see someone's reaction) 😆
Well said. Even if they aren't trying to be offensive, if can still sting, and I think it's important to acknowledge that. But it's not your responsibility to educate everyone.


And I too weaponize pronouns when they are weaponized against me mouhahaha.
I was at Subway and the dude sir'd me. He looks up and goes ""oh sorry, ma'am."" And I just go: ""no worries; either is fine."" IDK makes me laugh.
Oh that’s funny. I might try this!
What do you *say* in correction? Aside from asking for the opposite binary option I am never sure what to even say...
god I hate customers like that. I think if I had a customer get mad at me for not calling them “maam” or “sir” I’d just explain I’m not out to assume anyone’s pronouns.
you could test out wearing a pronoun pin or something perhaps?
I try not to use gendered pronouns when dealing with strangers or referring to 3rd parties. One thing I have found is that it can be difficult to get someone's attention in public without using sir or ma'am, like if you see them drop something. ""Excuse me?"" people tend to ignore. I've tried to come up with something else, like ""Excuse me good person?""  but that still feels awkward to me
It is what it is. Youre aware of it, its personal to you, it matters to you. To some stranger who doesn't question gender identity it probably doesn't cross their minds. I hope it changes, I don't think it's a big deal but then again my brain is my own and idc what people think of me.
Oh of course! I try to say it pretty cheerfully, and it normally just gets met with a questioning glance (although I live in a decently progressive area.) In my mind, it's not going to change anything for myself, but the next time somebody appears outside of the binary they might think twice before gendering them.
Hahah that happens quite often, especially when i am in asia (or asian dominant malls honestly) where people arent as accepting, or just arent as exposed to the LGBTQ+ community. 

I get the full body scans in women's washrooms, i get people who looked at me and looked at the door sign. 
Most time i just said ""hi yes you are in the right washroom."" Then they usually ease up (or not. Idk. Idc ) lol
I only get misgendered as female due to unfortunate bodily features, so I say ‘thank you, I’m not a girl though :)’. If they don’t ignore me I then go on to say ‘I’m Nonbinary’. If they do ignore me I just ignore them right back.
Pronoun pins are great and it depends on where you live at least in my town if you wear a pronoun pin the majority of people will use other pronouns more to frustrate you. So if you wear a they/them pin they guess your gender and use he/him or she/her. If you wear gendered pronouns as a pin they call you the opposite gender it’s super annoying
But like what term would you tell them to use instead of ma'am?  I feel like there needs to be one
i got gendered incorrectly by people way more often when i had a pronoun pin.
You know you could deliberately misgender them as well.

Edit: I love this community because you're all great humans but we are allowed to treat people who treat us badly like shit. There are no repricussions for bad behaviour. That's why they get away with it. We can too. We should stop letting them bully us. We really should.
I don’t, I don’t like any of the gender neutral terms. I’m just sharing my personal experience?
Conveys your pronouns *and* instantly reveals assholes? Sign me up
O I didn't mean it like that, i meant is there even a gender neutral word that could replace sir/ma'am.  I would prefer they not be used at all but it's a lot easier to replace vernacular

"Medical practices need to track gender identity independently of ""sex"""	"I've been thinking about this since it happened, and the more I think about it, the more annoyed I get about it.

Kinda long, so:

TL;DR: I was misgendered at a hospital because the only gender indicator on the medical paperwork was my AGAB.

Background: I'm an AMAB she/they demigirl. I almost always present femme, even at home. There's a strong chance that I'll be pursuing transition in the coming years.

So, having recently turned 50, I had a colonoscopy yesterday (colon cancer screening—zero signs, zero polyps, thankfully). Because I have severe sleep apnea, it was done at the hospital instead of the outpatient facility.

Opting for comfort, I wore a loose dress that would be easy to get out of and back into. As instructed, I wore no jewelry. I put my hair (that goes halfway down my back) up in a tight bun so that nobody would have to worry about it. Obviously, no breast forms or gaff, as they would have to be removed before the procedure anyway. (I don't normally wear them for medical appointments anyway, because they tend to get in the way.)

Spouse dropped me off at the entrance and went to park the car. (You have to have a trusted person present to drive you home after a colonoscopy, because of the anesthesia.) From the moment I walked in, people were polite and gendered me as I presented, even the registration person who had my (still masculine) name and medical info on her screen). Which I appreciated greatly.

Then Spouse and I were taken back to the prep room, and I was given the medical gown to change into. Obviously, for a colonoscopy, you have to take off everything. So gone were all signals that I'm not simply male, except my hair—which, to be fair, wasn't particularly gendered given the popularity of ""man buns"".

From that point, I was gendered solely as the ""M"" on the paperwork. There was no indicator anywhere that my gender identity is NB. I didn't make a big deal of it, because there was no way anyone would know at that point unless I told them, and I wasn't about to repeatedly explain it to every person who I had to deal with (two nurses, an orderly, three doctors, and whoever else was in the room during the procedure—I didn't count them).

But then I was in the procedure room, and the anesthesiologist made a comment about my ""man bun"" when he was fitting the oxygen mask. I spoke up at that point and corrected him, saying that I was nonbinary and so it wasn't a ""man bun"".

Now, I will mention at this point that I have always hated the term ""man bun"". It's not called a ""woman bun"" when a woman wears a bun; it's just a bun. It doesn't need gendering. I can't even think of another hair style that's called ""man X"" or ""woman X"". So part of my irritation was from that.

But I think I struck a nerve, because the entire group in the procedure room went silent. There was no more banter while I was awake.

The rest of the procedure and recovery went smoothly. But that one comment continued to irk me. And the problem could have been avoided if the paperwork had two gender markers: one for the anatomy/AGAB and another for gender identity/pronouns.

I've seen the personal data fields on a variety of medical software (doctors tend to show me what they're doing when I commiserate about how badly the software is designed), so I know that it is now standard for the software to have a field for gender identity. No medical office I've seen this on uses it. It's always been blank, even in offices where I've explicitly identified myself as NB/M on the paperwork.

Now, I'm the last person to argue that my AGAB/anatomical sex don't matter in medical—they absolutely do. Medical is the only area of life in which I believe people need to know all the details: your gender identity, your AGAB, and the status of any medical transition. Anatomy matter there. So I don't think that my AGAB was irrelevant there.

But it really bugs me that the way medical records are used in most facilities means that non-cis people are doomed to be misgendered, because all that's on the paper is a bare ""M"" or ""F"". From now on, whenever I check in for a medical appointment, I'm going to specifically ask if they can include gender identity in my record, and insist on being marked as nonbinary if they can. The only way this is going to change is if we push the issue."	"It's also medically necessary to have more than just agab for some patients if they've had hrt or something like that
I work HR for a rather large health system in my area. I've been trying to advocate for them to update the HR system and all systems used by clinical and nonclinical team members to display preferred names and include a field on the personnel file for team members' sex as well as gender identity. I understand the need to have biological sex/AGAB but it's just as important to have gender identity. 

It has not been easy and honestly if it weren't for myself and a couple other trans team members, might not be considered at all. 

You bring up an incredibly good point that we should fight for patients to also have that option. I do see a doctor within my company and I know they have notes they can put in for pronouns and identity, but honestly it's an LGBTQ+ clinic so I'm not sure it's system-wide. 

Thank you for sharing your experience.
I was put in as “genderfluid” in my doctor’s forms after disclosing that I was trans despite not asking them to change anything in my records— and they still misgender me lol
I’ve seen some places doing Sex assigned at birth, Legal sex, Gender Identity. It’s nice, sadly not the standard and I still get misgendered because legal sex/agab are plastered across their screens automatically. For the rest of them I’ve been dramatically scratching my own options so they are visible.
We use a program called Epic and inpatient and outpatient patients are able to select the option for nonbinary, which has been really lovely. Haven't seen too many adults using it, but loads of teens, which makes me happy that they have the option.

I think it depends on the health system if they choose to use this option or not, [here's a wired article about it](https://www.wired.com/story/the-battle-to-get-gender-identity-into-your-health-records/).
👏👏👏👏👏
I'm very sorry you went through that. I've dealt with it in the past. And you are right the issue has to be pushed.

And this makes me grateful that the system I go through has a Pride Clinic, and I am allowed preferred name and gender identity.
I work and live in a really progressive area. Our charts have both AGAB and gender digitally but if if orders are printed the gender/sex area will be blank. It’s just frustrating for me In the lab because everything has to be legal names so I have to verify that over the phone vs preferred names DX we could totally fit both. We could even fit gender identity acronyms too but it’s probably not going to happen DX
I am blessed to have a local hospital that does this right. The electronic patient info I fill out has three items that get shown to everyone who looks at my chart.

Gender/Sex marker on ID

Gender Identity (Optional)

AGAB (Optional)

All I give them is the F on my ID personally, but this is the way
Gahhhh this is so frustrating. I'm so sorry that happened to you! (Also colonoscopies are the actual worst but I'm glad they didn't find anything) 

Tbh, I didn't know that at the hospital I go to for doctors appointments had a Gender v Sex choice until I saw it in their online system. The gender choices were simplified to a degree but it was definitely progress which is good.
From what it sounds like the silence must've been them internally cringing at misgendering you for that long.

At least, it sounds like it to me.
Yes 100% agree with this. While it’s important for doctors to know assigned sex for obvious reasons it should also be just as important or then to know how you identify. It wouldn’t be a big deal to have a second option on the forms for gender identity/pronouns. Going to the doctor is similar but also different to taking your car to the mechanic. The difference: we are social creatures, so acknowledging how your patient identifies is extremely important. The similarity: the mechanic obviously needs to know what make and model your car is to work on it properly.
im sorry this happened to you. i’m glad to hear the results of the procedure were good though 🙌 i get this the other way around, where my sex is assumed and not asked for. i am legally NB on my ID, but F for health insurance, but doctors assume i’m male and just put an M on everything. i worry the medical needs of my body are being overlooked when doctors assume i’m male when 1) im non-binary and 2) im afab."	wtfg1n	NonBinary	96	1.0	2022-08-20 19:33:22

It's been a rough start to the new year in terms of validation, both external and internal. For a while I was getting misgendered so much that I started to misgender myself. So I ordered a couple custom bracelets to be a visual reminder to me of who I am and how far I've come. 💚		"That’s beautiful, the step you took to provide yourself validation and a reminder. It’s tough. Our brains, for many of us at least, seem to tell us there’s something wrong with us or we should be someone or something different. You are good and beautiful. I’m glad you’re here my friend. 💚
Cool bracelets. Where'd you get them?
Love your bracelets! They’re very cute!
i’m sure you did this purposefully, but it’s facing towards you. if you want others to be able to read it you should face it the other way. <3
That is really awesome. I had something similar for quit a while and I am still wearing my ace ring a lot. I hope it can help you as much as it helped me. You are definitely valid!
Thank you so much. It is tough, but we find ways to get by. Sending you the best. 💕

Yes it's on purpose, it's a reminder for me.

oh okay. i think you said that. but just incase felt like mentioning it. have a nice day.

Got attacked and kicked out for being non-binary	"
UPDATE: the DA refuses to press charges. 




I'm in a bit of shock still because I didn't see this coming, so I guess I'm just here to vent. 
I'm writing this from a friend's couch where I've been sleeping since Friday. This is Wis. where there's a huge alcohol and DV problem. 

Tldr: my partner's brother went HAM and is now in jail. All because he is dealing with his own gender and projecting that on me because I've been out for years. 

CW: violence and transphobia, ofc. 
.
.
.


Preface: I'm openly non-binary, on hrt, had surgery, all the good stuff I've enjoyed. I've been staying with my partner's parents since my car wreck. They offered and I always enjoy hanging out with them. 
 I'm waiting for it to get out of the shop but it's taking a long time. When my car is fixed, we planned on moving back to CA where we met. The car definitely put a hold on that. In the meantime, my partner (trans woman) and I are living with her parents near her brother's house.

 Her brother came out as genderqueer but hasn't changed pronouns or labels so I'll be using his agab masc labels, as he prefers them. Let's call him C. 

Her family are liberals but definitely performative.  That day, her other sibling bragged about buying a PS5 just to play the Hogwarts game, saying it's okay because she's a social worker and helps trans people daily. 🙄 That sibling also misgenders me behind my back and mocks my clothing, saying I look homeless. I also get mocked for being from a Muslim family.

So, C. came over, drunk as usual, and wanted to talk about his gender. 

The irony is C is a HUGE transphobe. I have gotten mocked for wearing ball caps and t shirts and not being girly enough for him and the rest of the family since I've been here. He is often very verbally abusive and transphobic to my partner. 


Now, I never really trusted him because he and the dad always laugh about how he shot a pedestrian (with a stroller) in the face when he was 15, on a dare. He got community service and my partner got blamed by her fam. because she's the older sibling. I remember his wedding in Sept and how the speeches were laughing about the incident. It made me sick. 
 But I was never scared of him because he's not that big and I guess time makes you less vigilant. 

Friday night, he came over as a peace offering and bought food for my partner and me. 

He vented about not being accepted as genderqueer by friends, and began to project these feelings by misgendering me and mocking my pronouns. The hypocrisy was too much and I got upset, told him to respect my pronouns and stop mocking my clothing choices. So we got into a verbal argument, then he got violent and threw me against the TV, furniture, just rag dolled me a bunch. He pinned me down and immediately pushed his thumbs into my eye, as my partner struggled to get him off me. He broke her finger by pulling it backwards and got lose, went right back to going at my eye. 

I was angry af and we fought, but since I'm much smaller than him, of course I kept getting rag dolled. 😅

He didn't stop until I got a large dog bone that was near. 


He refused to leave so I called the cops. As we waited, he called his parents and lied that my partner and I had attacked him and he was a victim. Her parents ofc believed him. 

They showed up and took statements. He was belligerent with them and it took 3 hours to remove him from the house. He cussed out the cops, kept being transphobic about my partner and myself, and kept laughing hysterically about the situation. The PD  took him to jail that night and I got kicked out by the parents (who wanted me charged with assault for fighting him off). 

He'd told the police (misgendering me of course) that if I wanted to ""dress and act like a boy [he] could beat [my] a** like a boy."" He laughed about pronouns being a joke and me being sensitive for correcting him and getting angry when he purposely misgendered me that night. He said he couldn't be in trouble because he'd bought us food and is queer himself, plus ""pronouns aren't that big of a deal.""

Went to the ER after this. Yup, my partner's finger was broken. I have bruises and scratches, am sore but generally okay. My eye is bugging me still but meh, Dr said it is not damaged. 

 My partner got blamed by her family for the incident. They're mad she didn't lie for him to the cops. 
They told her to break up with me or get lost, so she chose the latter and we are moving out today and staying with some family out of state while we wait for my car repairs. 

This has been such a physically and emotionally hurtful event, and I hate seeing my partner hurt like this by her own family. I blame alcohol, but I know that it's her brother's choices that did this. 
I felt bad for calling the cops because I felt it escalated things, but when I found out her finger was actually broken, I knew it was the right decision.

Update:
Not that it matters.. ...
In some kind of conspiracy theory, my gf's family has convinced themselves that I manipulated her into setting C up by provoking him into being violent so he could catch a charge. Truly mental. 

As an Arab-American, I didn't expect my Muslim-immigrant family to be so supportive when I said my gf and I had been in this incident. But my parents drove +17 hours to come get a hotel with us and help us move.     
... ^_^"	"Oh my god, I’m so sorry you went through that. 

And you absolutely did the right thing by calling the cops. 

One of the aspects of an abusive and toxic home environment is the desire “to keep it in the family” and not involve outsiders. I had a roommate once who left their kids with me while they were at work. Their parents came over, assaulted me, broke into the home and took the kids. Their family was so fucking shocked and angry when I immediately called the cops and the parents were arrested. 

You did the right thing to both call the police and move on from this situation.
That situation really sucks. Don't blame alcohol. Alcohol lowers inhibitions, not changes people to be violent. My recommendation is to never be around that person again. 

Don't feel bad about calling the cops, abuse shouldn't be tolerated, and the parents behavior is reprehensible.
I'm so sorry to hear that happened to you and your partner. I hope your eye and her finger recover quickly ❤️

You handled that situation very well. Calling the cops was the right choice and getting the two of you out of that situation is important too. I'm proud of how you handled it all and wish you both all the best luck with moving 🤍💛💜🖤
Honestly sound like a hate crime. Even if he says he’s genderqueer ( kinda sus) like he thought he can get away with hating you and your gf and trans people cause he’s queer. 
I’m sorry this happened to you. Hope you and gf are fount good
Sorry that this happened to you and your partner. You got assaulted for nothing and your partners brother is trash. The fact that he feels comfortable to shoot people and laugh about it says plenty about him and the parents who look past his behavior. And you made the right decision, hope you and your partner feel safe and are feeling better right now.
If you have the opportunity to get some therapy, this sounds super traumatic. Might check if there are victims services in your area. This is terrible, rest and feel better.
Yeah I've never been violent when I drink, so that's a good point. I suspect cocaine was also involved, but at the end of the day it's who he is as a person and no drug excuses that.
All I found in Madison were costly resources but yeah we definitely need to talk to someone. I'll call trans lifeline again. 
It was a traumatic event fr. Thank you for your comment."	117dkxj	NonBinary	93	1.0	2023-02-20 16:55:27

Misgendering myself	I find that I misgender myself a surprising amount via idioms, metaphors and other sayings that are on autopilot. When I notice it then triggers the imposter syndrome. Anyone else fight this?	"You've spent your entire life practicing and being bombarded with gendered terms. It's only natural that you're going to struggle to break those habits and build new ones. We all experience this because that's how the human mind works. Cut yourself some slack :)
Well when you've spent your entire life being told you're a certain gender and to refer to yourself a specific way its hard to change the way you speak about yourself. you'll eventually start referring to yourself correctly so you dont need to worry about it
All the time. I spent 30+ years living a lie. I know it better than I do myself. That’s why it’s called transitioning and not transforming.
I still misgender myself and even use my old name in my inner monologue all the damn time. I’ve only just now got to the point where I’m consciously correcting myself.
I find I do it a lot in situations where I'm refering to what someone might say to/about me. Like, ""oh yeah he's a loon for sure"" and then I feel weird because it was me who made them misgender me.
Yup! It's frustrating af. Sometimes I practice talking about myself with the right pronouns, it'd probably be helpful to do it more often. Gotta redirect that brain circuitry.
I remind myself that just cus was raised and socialized as a girl doesn't mean I *am* a girl
Oh my gosh, constantly! I'm always reminding myself that even mothers mix up their children's names. Other people always joke around with me that we're all the same when I accidentally sign my maiden name instead of my married name, or the wrong date or year. 

I used to work in an office, and I had to sign my initials every day, and one day, I signed with initials I hadn't used since I was 18! Haha, I was so confused, but it's just muscle memory.

I figure pronouns and names and such are the same way. It's just that people don't go around being like: Ohhhhh boo-hoo you'll regret changing your name after you get married why can't you keep your maiden name oh wahhh 
So when I accidentally say my maiden name, people just joke with me, but if I misgender myself, it's the same exact mistake but there's just that underlying insecurity
This resonates.  I've had a tough trying to break out of the habit of using certain gendered words.  A lot of the time, it's not even towards myself or other people.  

like using ""man"" as an interjection.  Or realizing that outside of the area where I grew up ""dude"" is very much a gendered word.  If I say ""dude"" in a sentence, I'm not usually referring to anyone or anything specific.  It's an interjection.  

&#x200B;

I don't really mind it so much, because it's what I've heard and said my whole life.  Like ""oh man, there's a spider on my truck"" or ""woah...dude.... look at those balloons hitting the power line!""  These are two examples from my internal monologue earlier today.
Yess I did this all the time! Especially with sayings! What’s a gal to do? … SHIT
Haha absolutely! I’m actually better at using They/Them pronouns in general for other people (while telling a story) than using them on myself. 
It’s frustrating and especially when you have a crush on someone and wondering if they’re thinking about you, but their dialogue, in your mind, uses she/her pronouns 😖 even though they’re not the type to use your wrong pronouns…
It’s a thing. I don’t even feel bad about it at this point, as it’s just a sign of acculturation and habit, and how gender as a concept runs so deep. I don’t really think of myself as male, but if I happen to call myself “daddy” to my cats, I just think of it as a role, one of the many characters I play. I perform gender roles out in the world, but it’s a performance. It doesn’t mean anything about me beyond that. 

Imposter syndrome… wish I could tell you that would go away. I’m the only person who doubts me at this point.
I'm in the exact same boat and it drives me mad! But as others have said we are trying to unlearn a lifetime of behaviour and automatic responses. It doesn't make us any less valid. I am absolutely an enby, it's just that the hamster at the controls is a little slow on the uptake with learning the new ways of doing things.
I do this too! And it even happens when i know that person would get my pronouns right (like they’ve always gotten it right before). So strange 🙈
Dude!

Dude?

Dude.

Curious about your thoughts using they/them when referring to cis people who haven’t endorsed these pronouns. Is it misgendering?	"I apologize in advance if this is a stupid question, but I’ve noticed myself using “they” much more often when speaking about cis people. 

For example, I have to be mindful of privacy for my job, and will often use they/them pronouns to maintain a higher level of anonymity when I’m talking about work etc. 

But it’s kind of spread to other areas of my life too, and find myself using they/them when referring to cis people. 

In regard to using it with my job, it feels protective of the folks I’m working with. But it occurred to me this morning, that other folks in my life or periphery might not like that I use they/them for them, and it may not be a good/neutral thing that I’m using it interchangeably with their inferred pronouns. 

To be clear, if someone uses specific pronouns I adhere to those always. This more so refers to cis folks who are comfy/settled in their gender as cis. 

Is this a misstep on my part? Do I need to reel it back? Am I doing harm I’m not aware of, either to our community or theirs? TIA!"	"I don’t think it’s misgendering to use they/them to maintain anonymity. That’s one of the main uses of they/them as singular pronouns apart from personal pronouns, isn’t it? Maintaining anonymity and addressing a hypothetical person you don’t know the gender/pronouns of. 

If you’re not trying to maintain anonymity though and you know a person’s pronouns and still use they/them, that’s misgendering.
Do you not know which pronouns someone uses?

Are you attempting to hide the gender of the subject, or make a general statement?

If the answer to either question is ""yes"" use they/them pronouns. But if you know someone's pronouns, and are not trying to obscure them, use the correct pronouns.

Imagine how hurtful it would be to use they/them pronouns on a binary trans person. That would be hella invalidating. And some pass so well that you might not realize that you hurt someone. Don't risk it.
[removed]
I think it really depends on the context. 

""A client contacted me today, they would like to know if..."" - is fine, because the client's personality is irrelevant to the topic.

""This is my colleague Jane, they are working in the same department"" - not fine if Jane prefers different pronouns, because in this case you are talking about a concrete person whose personality matters and who might be present during this conversation. Even if Jane doesn't get offended, it would look odd.
Personally I think it's fine if you're doing it to protect the privacy of a client e.g. if you're talking to a relative or friend about a client, where it would be inappropriate to give enough information away to identify them.

I used to work with children and still say 'I used to work with this kid that would say/do ...' rather than saying 'boy' or 'girl' as these were vulnerable children I was working with, and because it's a small world professionally, where there was some overlap between my service users and the people I was talking to (friends or relatives in similar industries).

If you're talking to a colleague and you both know the client (or know of them from, say, a case file) and you think you know what their pronouns are, then I think it'd be fine to say he or she.
if u don't know their pronouns, are trying to speak about multiple people, are trying to avoid specific pronouns, are talking about a theoretical person, etc. they is fine (and ofc if *they* use they/them)

if u do know and are not trying to do those then just use their own pronouns.
If you know someone is cis-gender then you would know what pronouns to use. 

If you are simply assuming that person is cis-gender based on their gender presentation.  Please stop doing this. Also using they/them if you don’t know someone’s gender is fine.  

I think using a gender neutral term until you know someone’s preference is okay.

Also for anonymity sake its best to be as vague as possible. If you work in a setting where anonymity is required and possibility legalized… that would trump pro noun preferences in those situations.
If they didn't explicitly tell me their pronouns, I use they/them for the person. I don't want to assume someone is cis because non binary folks can still present on the binary. And in reality, I'd prefer to give a cis person a neutral pronoun than give someone the wrong binary pronoun (and I feel like trans folk deal with being misgendered so often that I'd prefer to accidentally misgender the cis person instead of adding to a trans persons misgendering)

Again this is only if they haven't said their pronouns. If a cis person said theirs, I would make all efforts to use the correct one.
They them are gender neutral pronouns so it's grammatically correct, but if the person asks you to stop you should. It's not misgendering, but you don't want to make them uncomfortable.
I think, unless someone has specifically told you that their pronouns do not include they/them, you are not at all at fault, and honestly, I think this is a great idea.
Well, historically speaking people have used singular they in order to refer to someone with unknown pronouns for about 700 years now. So yes, if you do not know someone’s pronouns gramatically speaking you should use they, and cis people have been referred to with they their entire lives, so technically no, not misgendering unless they specifically tell you otherwise.
i don't think it's misgendering as it's part of the english language. It's the initial use of the singular they pronoun. I wish we started referring to everyone as they personally \^\^;
I've started using they whenever it won't obscure meaning or just using names instead of pronouns. Unless specifically asked to use them I avoid pronouns.
If you know what pronouns the use, use those pronouns. If they haven't said but are cool, probably ask them. If they are the annoying type that says stuff like ""I don't use pronouns"" or any of the transphobic dogwhistles (eg ""transgenderism""), then go for it
I think you're fine and probably overthinking it. The only people that would really care are transphobes
Everyone uses they/them all the time when referring to cis people and don't think anything about it when they do. You're just using it a bit more frequently, is all. I don't see this as an issue at all.
I feel like this is something that in practice is done so much in so many situations that I don't even know if you can say it's misgendering. Like cis people so it a lot to each other even. I hear people refer to cis people ""with ""they"" over he/she so often that honestly it's confusing to me when people even bring it up as an issue regarding transgender/Non Binary people. And I'm not even talking about situations like anonymity or unknown gender either.
No, not really. I stopped and asked myself if it’s possible to misgender cis people in the first place. After all, they have the institutional power and they don’t have (by and large) an investment in thinking about gender or using it as a tool of unconventional expression and agency. But that’s a very like, cis hetero analysis, because there are actually plenty of cis people that are gender non normative. (Gender abnormative?) And actually all women have to think about their gender all the time because of gender based violence and misogyny. That being said, cis people have to be pretty marginalized for misgendering to hurt them. I am thinking of butch women who are harassed out of women’s bathrooms because they are assumed men, or the athletes being pushed out of competition because of their endocrinology. 

That being said, saying they as a general practice is only misgendering if it’s hyper targeted on someone despite correction. For instance, I’m sometimes gendered as they cuz I serve a little bit of an enby look when I go out sometimes (re:male bodies with feminine accoutrements) and that’s fine with me. But if I were a trans woman and I corrected to she/her and they continued to use they, they would be a shady way of calling me a man. 

But notice the pattern: marginalization needs to be present for misgendering to have material impact, and greater marginalization increases the emotional impact as well. 

Also referring to anyone as they is technically never *incorrect* per se. It is a gender neutral pronoun by design, whether applied to singular or groups.
One of my trans NB friends uses they for everyone unless otherwise specified. I kind of like it, it’s one of the things that made me start thinking I might be enby. Cuz they’d use they for me and I liked it so much
They/they can be used if you don't know someone's pronouns or if you're in a situation where you're trying to anonymize something (such as referencing a friend group with only one she/her user in it, and you don't want to specify which member you're talking about or something). But using they/them to refer to someone specifically who does not use they/them is misgendering.
I use they/them as default until someone tells me their pronouns.
Not misgendering - unless they have clearly stated pronouns that you are ignoring. They/them is absolutely preferable when gender is unknown or uncertain. I cringe when people say ""he or she"" nowadays because it feels intentionally exclusive and antiquated more than anything.
They/them pronouns are grammatically correct in any situation, as far as I’m aware. So there’s never a time not to use they/them if you want, cause it’s technically correct even if it isn’t someone’s pronoun of choice. I find that it’s a really useful neutral option.
Imo, I think it's completely fine to refer to people with they/them ALONG with their *primary* pronouns.

I think people believe They/Them only applies to NB gender or something, when, no, They/Them are gender neutral, it's just referring to another person without *bringing gender into it* (hence why someone like me uses them).

So using them along with somebody else's preferred pronouns doesn't mean they're being misgendered as non-binary, it just means that sometimes you refer to them with pronouns that acknowledge their gender and sometimes you use ones that don't acknowledge gender at all.

I always thought the problem was going out of your way to JUST refer to someone with they/them when their pronouns are she/her or he/him (or whatever else).

Bc then it's very likely the person is refusing to acknowledge their gender identity as real, but instead of being as outright transphobic by calling them the opposite sex, they wanna be sneaky about their transphobia.

Also, I do get if a trans woman/trans guy says ""hey I'd appreciate it if you JUST use female/male pronouns & stop using they/them at all, it makes me dysphoric otherwise"".
But if they haven't, I don't see why using they/them along with their preferred pronouns would be wrong. 

So, to use an example: ""Have you seen Heather? SHE got her hair cut & it looks awful, THEY have the worst taste lol"".
That doesn't discount Heathers gender identity. It's fine.

If Heather was a trans girl & preferred she/her, but somebody said ""Heather got THEIR hair cut & it looks awful, THEY have the worst taste lol""
Then I'd be thinking that something transphobic is prob going down, like, ""...why are you pointedly refusing to acknowledge Heather as a woman?""
I think this is definitely the right thing to do. You don’t always know that they’re cis, and if they aren’t then they’ll appreciate it. It’s not misgendering unless you know what pronouns they use and choose not to use them. (Except in the case of anonymizing them)
I often do this as well and as long as someone doesn't tell me that it bothers them I'll keep doing it because it's what makes sense to me.
misGENDERING. They/them are not gendered terms
Using gender neutral pronouns for the sake of ambiguity in general is totally reasonable — but also, I think it genuinely worth recognizing that gender isn't relevant most of the time in our day to day lives! There's no reason to specify for everyone what the gender of the human you're referencing is constantly.

So in summary, I encourage you to use gender neutral pronouns whenever gender isn't relevant in the moment.
27 year old mtf 1 year 5 months hrt here…

I usually refer to people at my work that I work with (and non work people) by what they look like. If they seem more neutral or hard to gender, I go with them unless they say what they are. If they are already non binary/trans, they usually appreciate it when I’m speaking to them.
I think it is misgendering, if you’re talking about someone who’s gender you already know. I don’t think it’s exactly wrong per se, but why not just use the pronouns that person prefers to use? Cis people may not come out and tell you their pronouns (because they’re cis and often don’t think about gender like we do), but I’m sure you have an idea of what they go by. If you don’t, obviously you should ask.
I think there are plenty of ways of using more gender inclusive language, but I think one of those is just using the pronouns people want to be referred to by, cis or not.
Also, you never really know how someone might feel, and you don’t always know if someone is or isn’t cis. There are tons of passing trans people that might not appreciate being referred to by they, and there might come a time when you don’t clock someone.
They can suck it up tbh.
You can't really misgender a straight person... just like you can't really be racist against a white person.
They/them is never misgendering since those pronouns are gender neutral and can be used to refer to anyone. The only potential issue I see is that it could be considered rude, invalidating, or transphobic to always refer to a transwoman or transman as ""they"". I wouldn't worry, though, about referring to cis folks as ""they"", regardless of whether they have endorsed it or not. You're not obligated to constantly validate cis people's gender.
I personally try to refer to everyone as they/them because that just makes the most sense to me as the existence of gendered pronouns is nonsensical. I wish that is how society operated and I don't particularly like upholding pointless gender norm things.

I understand the argument about how a trans person could feel invalidated by that, but I would hope I could validate that person's gender in many other ways. In general I feel like trans people tend to care so much about pronouns because they aren't validated in other ways by society and using a certain pronoun is an easy way to be validated by society. 

If someone is bothered by it then of course I would use whichever pronoun makes them feel comfortable. But my view on it is that everyone should just use they/them and validate people's gender outside of that.
My experience has been that cis folk who haven't indicated a preference aren't being harmed in any way by being called ""they/them"" like, I have for years referred to my exes as ""they/them"" typically because while I may wish to share information about my history I do not wish to share information about them specifically as individuals.

When it comes to maintaining privacy I think ""they/them"" actually trumps a person's specific pronouns. Yes, in person you may call a client She/her regardless of AGAB as that is her stated gender identity, but when you're trying to protect her client? She may be best served by you as a professional calling her ""they/them""

They/them isn't a gender, it's gender neutral it's Agender terminology. You're acting in good faith. Both for yourself and for your clients.
Depends on context. Often at my work for confidential reasons we use they/them when speaking. But if you are introducing someone or talking directly about them without constraints then use what they prefer. With all that said using they/them upsets far less cis people than using the opposite gender. Singular they is thing and used frequently.
I think when you're doing it for anonymity sake then it's fine. But when you're using a pronoun for someone that they don't want used for them or haven't asked for, then it's misgendering. Of course, pronouns and gender aren't the same thing, and cis people can also use they pronouns or ""mismatched"" pronouns (like some cis butches use he/him and some cis gay guys use she/her). I don't think it matters whether they are cis or trans or not sure or whatever, it really is as simple as that - use the pronouns people ask you to use for them, intentionally continually using different pronouns that they aren't ok with is just unkind. It's more along the lines of de-gendering. 

Anyways, I think you already knew this, otherwise you wouldn't have thought to ask about it.
I think generally it is respectful to default to they/them if you don’t know. You can only misgender someone if you’re doing it after they have already disclosed their pronouns to you. 🏳️‍⚧️💖
Depending On The Person, It Might Seem Rude To Use They/Them For Them When You Might Usually Use A Gendered Pronoun And You Know What Pronouns They Use. But There Are Many Cases Where It May Make Sense To Refer To People By They/Them Even When They Use Different Pronouns That You Know. One Of My Best Friends Is Cis, And Uses She/Her Pronouns, But I'll Often Refer To Her With They/Them Because It Feels Weird To Specify Her Gender To People Who Don't Know Her, When It's Completely Irrelevant, If That Makes Sense.
Or even some non-binary people like me, who don't use they them pronouns.
I wouldn’t say it’s intentional, so much as a healthy habit (protecting my clients privacy) that sometimes leaks into using they/them for cis people who have not defined specific pronouns to use.
I completely agree, and in person, I always use their pronouns. It’s more so if I’m referring to another person to someone else in passing. “Im seeing sally this week and will ask them,” kinda deal. I’m so used to referring to my clients in general terms that I’ve noticed I’m doing it more when referring to cis people with “default” pronouns. 

If someone has expressed specific pronouns, I always take care to use those no matter what. 

And I’m willing to acknowledge this take might be problematic, despite how harmless it feels *to me.*
>If you are simply assuming that person is cis-gender based on their gender presentation.  Please stop doing this.

This, exactly. Also please don't assume that cis people do not care about what pronouns you use for them. If you take these things into account I think it's clear why this is a bad idea
this comment!!! (and i think OP is trying to express that although they are likely cis, they don’t want to assume their pronouns are in line with their gender expression)
I think that’s the part I’m struggling with. Like it’s intentional for some people (myself included) but it’s also a part of grammar and the more I use that function of grammar (to protect client privacy) the harder it is to turn off in other spaces, perhaps.
I really appreciate you taking the time to share your perspective. I agree with you, and, I wanted to make sure my own blind spots/privilege weren’t showing up in harmful ways. 

I wonder too about my worry that the singular “they” could be offensive in the first place, and that I might need to do some work around metabolizing nonbinary-ness as a 3rd gender vs being genderless. And I’m nonbinary. 

It’s given me a lot to think about and I’m grateful for all the responses today.
>So, to use an example: ""Have you seen Heather? SHE got her hair cut & it looks awful, THEY have the worst taste lol"". That doesn't discount Heathers gender identity. It's fine.

I don't think this is great. Why would you do it except to make some kind of point, if you know Heather uses she/her pronouns? If anyone tells you their pronouns, trans or cis, and you intentionally use different pronouns, that's shitty, even if you only do it sometimes.
I completely agree, and this is what I was getting at, more or less. *of course* if someone has specific pronouns, I always use them. And, i have found myself using singular they, and wanted to make sure I wasn’t making an ass of myself.
Umm, yeah, you can...
Those two things are not the same.
I occasionally do the same thing as a side effect of trying to use more inclusive language in general, so I'm not at all meaning to criticize you, but I'm not sure why you're saying these people don't have specific pronouns? Just because a cis woman doesn't wear a pronoun badge or whatever doesn't mean her pronouns aren't she/her. I think it's kind of disingenuous to claim these people don't have preferred pronouns if everyone uses she/her or he/him for them and they've never indicated otherwise.
How do you even know they're cis? If your co-worker has not told you their gender identity or preferred pronouns, then you have no idea. You shouldn't assume that a cis-passing person is the gender they present as. I try to use they/them for anyone who has not expressed their preferred pronouns.
In this case I think I would use the following criteria: Would you mention this person's name in the same context or is it irrelevant? If you are talking about your friend Sally or your neighbor Steve, then you should use their real pronouns. If you are talking about a friend of yours without specifying their name, ""they"" should be perfectly fine.

That said, I don't think referring to cis people as ""they"" is very harmful in most contexts, ""they"" is gender-neutral. I mean, you can tell a cis person ""you are a nice person"" instead of ""you are a nice guy"" and it would be fine, I think using ""they"" is somewhat similar. I'm not a native English speaker though, so I might be missing some nuances.
It strikes me as a bad idea thats likely to cause harm sooner or later.
This is true. Even before I realized I was non-binary I detested any term that referred to women being owned by men such as Ms. MRs. Ms.  Also ma’am.  

I also deteste being called lady unless it’s as a joke because being “ladylike” was a term used to square people into binary gender rolls and women who didn’t fit the gender rolls were said to be unladylike.
I feel like this is something that is done fairly commonly regardless of gender though. People use they/them as a sort of sparing alternate for he/she. Often it just rolls off the tongue that way.

Obviously it's different if people specifically use they/them to avoid correctly gendering someone or if you use they/them when people specifically ask you not to though.

(Also this is just my experience, might be somewhat regional)
nope
They're not the same but they are similar.

When someone misgenders a trans person even by accident it is a microaggression towards that individual because it can trigger their gender dysphoria. Most of the time when trans people get upset about being misgendered it is because it wasn't accidental or an innocent mistake. Someone was doing it intentionally mock or invalidate that person's gender identity. It is transphobic, in the same way calling a BIPOC the wrong name because you cannot pronounce their name correctly is a microaggression, but can also be racist (as in an aggression aggression) if done repeatedly after someone has been corrected or done in a mocking way. 

No one questions or attempts to invalidate cishet people's gender identity unless in the very rare situation where they assume that cis person IS trans. So by calling that person they/them out of habit or because you don't know which pronouns they use, you're not misgendering them. You're not causing them harm. You're not triggering their dysphoria or invalidating their gender identity.
Yep, that’s a really fair critique. I could have used more precise language, and have more to think about here too. 

What I was attempting to touch on, is that the singular “they” is a function of grammar. If someone communicates to me that they use particular pronouns, whatever those may be, I will use them. 

The area I’m trying to engage with are cis folks who perhaps haven’t shared insight one way or another, and if using singular “they” in reference to them is an ok thing to do, or if there are perspectives I’m missing in my use of singular “they” for folks who haven’t expressed one way or another how they feel about it.
I feel like people shouldn't have to specifically ask though. Once you know someone's pronouns, I think it's implied that they want you to call them only by those pronouns...
I guess what I'm saying is that I don't really agree that these people haven't communicated how they feel. If they identify as a man/woman and listen to people using he/she pronouns without correcting them, isn't that communicating that they feel those are the correct pronouns? (Of course there may be some closeted trans/nonbinary people in the mix, but I don't think it's appropriate to change your entire approach to cis people because of that possibility.) 

This is entirely separate from ""they"" as a grammatical issue. ""They"" is a function of grammar for people of unknown gender, theoretical people, or people who have specified that they use they/them pronouns. Applying it outside of those contexts can absolutely be misgendering.
I'm in the closet at work. Based on what I experience there, it is the wise thing to do. No one there has or is ever going to ask what my pronouns are, and I'm never going to volunteer that information. 

If someone used they/them to refer to me at work, my heart would melt, and I would know that I have an ally there."	zngle3	NonBinary	85	0.92	2022-12-16 14:59:15
Was misgendered on my 1st day back on campus but at least I looked good 😅		you look rad!!	nwvx9o	NonBinary	84	0.98	2021-06-10 19:17:16
My name is Noah	"So, last night, after a several months of being misgendered and deadnamed pretty much constantly by my family (I came out in November if I recall correctly), my mom, of her own accord, sat down with me and said “if you’re serious about being called Noah, let’s make the switch officially and have that just be what everyone calls you” and I almost cried because I was so happy.

I’m not quite ready to change my name legally, I want to live as Noah for a year before I take that step, but if my whole family and my friends and therapist are all calling me by my chosen name and using the appropriate pronouns...that’s a damn good start!

Just thought I’d share this positive experience :)"	"Congrats, Noah!
That's awesome Noah!
I'm glad your family finally came around! Hope they adapt to your name. I like the name, by the way, Noah!
That's brilliant, so happy for you.
Congrats Noah :) legally changed my name last year and it felt great! So happy for you and the journey you’re about to go on! Good for you 
Thanks for sharing, Noah!! I love hearing stories like this. :D
I’m so happy for you. Have a great day Noah "	84qxof	NonBinary	87	1.0	2018-03-15 23:13:11
I'm not a lady!	"I was with my sibling waiting on a sidewalk for a restaurant to bring out the food for her (because COVID) and a person walking by said to us, ""hello ladies."" Me, being loud, out and proud told that person, ""I'm not a lady.""  the asshole totally ignored me and walked away! I felt so invisible, disrespected, and dehumanized! My sibling grimaced and said, ""I think he was just trying to be polite"" because she doesn't understand the negative impact of being called something you're not for 44 years, and she probably never will. 

I feel so alone. And so angry that I have to stand up for myself, because who the f@$# will?! I don't care that my sibling, and other people feel uncomfortable when I correct them. What about MY comfort?! What about MY well-being? Nobody's thinking about that. 

I live in a society that wasn't made for me, and is not interested in making space for people like me to exist freely and happily. So I have to carve my own path, feeling lonely, unsupported and sometimes doubting my own self-worth, in the hopes that future generations won't have to feel this way. I don't always feel strong enough to blaze a trail, and be my own advocate. I just wanna stay in my room and not be around other people, to avoid possible misgendering. I just want support, and to not feel like I'm the only one going through this."	"I know that's really painful,. Your sibing needs to go to her room and stay there! 

Aaaand increased server pay and explicit training/restaurant culture development around genders are essential.
I can relate to this so hard. What makes things even more challenging is that my fiancée is transitioning so these greetings (hey ladies, welcome girls, etc.,.) are *such* a confidence boost and form of euphoria for her but then she sees how down I get even though I try to not let it show because I want her to feel good and excited and happy. I’ve even stopped wearing the clothes I like and expressing myself through makeup in hopes to stop some of this for myself but it’s really no use. I think the best course of action, at least for me, is to wear a jacket or something with pins and patches to indicate proper pronouns and such in hopes to be seen properly.
I'm sorry that happened!! I hope that society gets to a point where people don't think they can tell a stranger's gender just by looking at them. I also hope it gets less lonely in the future, and you feel more recognized! (edited because of seeing your post about not liking being called strong, sorry)
Genuine question. What are people supposed to say? If someone presents as feminine, that's probably the greeting they'd use. Is it better to avoid the pronouns altogether?
Idk I literally get misgendered every day, I just don't let it bother me as much as it used to. My sister knows my pronouns. The friends that matter respect them too. I don't need random strangers to know though.

If they see me, a presumable man and call me 'he' then so be it. I don't need to expend the time nor the energy to explain to someone my identity when they might not even care, understand or respect me enough to actually use my pronouns.

I focus my efforts where it matters and think no more of it.
I’m sorry, I know the feeling.  Here’s to a more gender-neutral world, or to one where we can be respected.
honestly more people should just do this instead of the polite little muttering or ignoring it all together. Why should I hide myself and be oh so polite to someone so i don't hurt their little cishets feelings?

I for one don't want to ask people to use the ""preferred pronouns"" and be so polite and docile as to not scare them with me being me. I demand the use of my Correct Pronouns and they will respect it.

It's not my fault they can't be bothered to see that not every person is cis or binary, and it sure isn't my problem that they have ""a hard time learning"" idc, do better. you think i didn't have a ""hard time"" living in a world that wasn't made for me? being told i actually don't even exist or that I'm not a person but an ideology?

I don't want to be an acceptable queer person, fit into the mold of what they deem the correct version of non-binary as to not break the status quo and, god forbid, stand out and maybe even demand respect.

So sorry for the little rant, didn't mean to hijack your post or anything like that, it just made me a little emotional lol. I really admire you standing up for yourself and hope you don't feel too down about the whole situation.
Your emotions are valid and just. If it's something that effects you that much, it might help to have some kind of visual indicator (a flag or pronoun pin, etc, your choice) that you can use as a teaching tool. Almost no one is going to guess someone is NB, especially older people to whom it's just not part of their worldview.
Well you're not alone here. I don't have those experiences, but I'm sorry it's so hard for you. I hope your sibling comes to understand you. I wish I could give advice, but I can't think of anything at the moment.

Hang in there! You're a lovely person and we know that.
What a shitty thing to happen, it’s so horrible when you feel like no one has your back. I know the feeling quite well. It all goes back to ignorance, people just don’t know the true effect of this sort of thing because they don’t even have an equivalent.

Thank you 😊
- Hey there

- Hey folks

- Hello

- Howdy (or something regional)

- Good day/Good afternoon (or evening/morning)…This is what I’ll generally go for as I feel it’s as classy and professional as sir/ma’am/ladies/gentlemen

I might say I can’t think of a situation when a person walking past would have to say “hello, ladies” unless it’s an attempt at catcalling or something lol. “Excuse me, ladies” I could see being used, or “Hello”. **This might** be a regional difference though, maybe people say that a lot elsewhere. Where I live I’ve only ever heard that from sleazy guys trying to chat up someone in the group.
What complicates this more is there are trans people who really want other to call them by their preferred identity (ofc without other knowing them). So for some people like OP it really fucking sucks and damages them while for others it can give a confidence boost and a feeling of acceptance...

I'm not saying any way is wrong, not at all. What I am saying is that any solution we make, could have people feeling left out.
Y'all is a good go to for situations like this or even people, humans, or even just ""hey"". The only time I use gender specific greetings is if I know the people and what they are. Hope this helps.
In this scenario, a simple ""hello"" would have been completely fine. Also, just a thought on the ""feminine"" presentation: would that many people really greet someone with significant facial hair or other ""masculine"" features as a lady no matter how femininely they presented? And would they actually use ""man,"" or hesitate and just avoid the issue? Yet people perceived as having ""feminine"" features routinely get called ladies no matter how much they strive to present in a masculine"" way. (Honestly I *do* think pronouns and gendered terms should be avoided regardless, because you never know. It does unfortunately tend to make binary trans people feel like their efforts are going unappreciated, and if I knew a solution that accounted for that I'd absolutely advocate for it, but at least that way one isn't contributing to the idea that body type or presentation determine gender.)
Good advice 👍
thank you! You're totally awesome!
Oh I already have a large pronoun pin on my backpack, and since the person only saw the back of me, I guess that this person just didn't read it.
>you can't just scold someone like a child for simply trying to be friendly.

Is 'Hello ladies?' friendly? 

Sounds creepy to me. Like a form of catcalling. In the UK at least if you're just doing the friendly 'passer-by hello' you'd probably just say ""Hello"" or ""good morning/evening/afternoon"" or just ""Morning!"". I hear that on dog walks and such all the time, accompanied by a polite nod. 

""hello ladies"" is a bit patronising even if you identify with the term, never heard someone use that outside of people addressing the class when I was at an all girl's school.
I think op was happy that they corrected the stranger and then annoyed that their sibling was scolding them (op). Like it’s not publicly shaming to tell someone they are wrong and you aren’t a lady. 🤷
Please allow me to disagree. First of all, op did not ""publicly humiliate"" someone just by saying they were not a lady- they didn't make fun of them or act aggressive towards them in any way. Next, this is a vent post and they have every right to be frustrated, because sure, the stranger couldn't have known they're nonbinary/trans, (because you can't tell what gender someone is just by looking at them) but it's tiring to only hear ""Ma'am"", ""Ladies"" and whatnot all day every day when you're just not that and may have gender dysphoria (it means it hurts to be called these). Finally, say I know you. I'd know your name, right? Would calling you by your name and not by ""Joe"" or ""Gertrude"" be asking a lot? Would it really be respect? I don't think so. It's basic acknowledgement of someone to refer to them with their pronouns and name. I don't know op personnally, but in the situation of this post, they are absolutely not entitled, they were just venting their frustrations on said post.
Don’t belittle people’s struggles. That doesn’t help anybody.

I fell off my bike avoiding an animal the other day and got a nasty bruise. It’s okay for me to say my leg hurts even though some people aren’t privileged enough to own a bike themselves.

I’m living somewhere where I would be put in danger if I made a public comment like OP did. I don’t sit here saying “Well you should just be glad you can *be* ‘out and proud’, OP!” I can empathize.

If you want to have a discussion about more impactful, serious problems let’s do so—in the proper place. This isn’t relevant to the discussion here.
The person who said that only saw my sibling's face, and only saw the back of me. Since my sibling is very pretty, and since I was wearing a dress (I'm of the firm belief that clothes have no gender), that person was probably attempting a dual chat up. Which is like ugh 😫
All totally true. But I guess the important thing with what OP is describing is not to make assumptions about total strangers.

It is easy to say ""Hi"" to one or more people without adding in a gendered descriptor.

It can feel nice to get the validation of a stranger correctly guessing but that definitely doesn't mean we should try to do that for people we don't know.
That’s why we should normalize pronoun pins more
These are great, unless you’re trying to be more formal.
Yeah that's fine. I'd get some funny looks using y'all in the UK though 😀
I don't like being called ""feminine""or ""masculine"" at all. I'm un-binary, and those  words don't apply to me.
[deleted]
Then they’re just an ass no matter what their phrasing simply because of their intentions. (I firmly believe it’s gross to approach people like that on the street).
This. It is not necessary to constantly gender what feels like everything. All. The. Time. I get called ma'am quite frequently and absolutely hate it. Your feelings are valid OP. I wish and hope society will stop gendering everyone and everything. It's obsolete.
Yes! Also it's highly unlikely that anyone will guess my gender correctly, because I'm Agender.
My backpack had a big pronoun pin on it with ""THEY"" in large letters. This person only saw the back of me, so I guess that person didn't read it.
It being outside of the situation doesn't change my point that gendering someone correctly, or, more fittilngly because they couldn't have known, not gendering someone is basic acknowledgement. Next, they weren't taking it out on the stranger, they simply said they weren't a lady. Also they weren't assuming the person was being intentionally malicious, at least from what they wrote! I don't understand what's so hard about just going ""oh, sorry"" out of simple politeness and then moving on. That's all we ask. Just like when you talk to a cis stranger you thought was the other binary gender, but then turns out not to be, you say ""oh, sorry"" or something along that line. It's really not that hard. That person was not evil or transphobic or malicious at all, they just made a mistake. Also, correcting someone who misgendered you is not creating a parent/child transaction, because it does not belittle nor infantilize the person you interact with unless you talk to them in a condescending, patronizing or infantilizing manner. I genuinely don't understand what cis people find so hard to do with trans people what they do so easily with other cis folks without claiming they infantilize them.

Pluie (Rain - prononced plu-ee) Automne ( Fall - o tone) Nuage (Cloud - nu aje) Coeur ( heart - ker) Flamme (Flame - like flat but with an m) Cendre ( Ash - sendre) Menthe (mint - mente) Ciel (sky - si el) Grenouille (frog - gre nou ye) 

Voilà ! Hope that it'll help ! Good luck
Metal?
I’m getting Ash vibes
Idk why but you seem like a Tilly to me.
Kim
From your posts you are a goth nb that has a soft spot for animals and fruit and you want to make the world a better place. This all gives me nega or spooky druid vibes.

""Branwen"": Beautiful Raven

""Cinder"" or ""Ember"": relates to ash but more unique since ash is so overused. Also gives rise to cinderella which could symbolize having a bad past but headed towards the future. Ember is also nice in that it sounds like Enby.

Garnet: A dark red gem. Also popular character from steven universe. One of the only shows with envy representation.

Rune: a mark of mysterious magical significance

Nyx: Greek word for night

Wren: A songbird

Dawn: Time of day
You're so sweet! And I do really like the name Gwen. Reminds me of Dark Sun Gwendolyn from Dark Souls.
Ah Ceres. Quite a mystical sounding name. I like it.
I certainly haven't heard this one before.
Kinda on the nose but I do like the vibe of it!
I do like the name ash. Very neutral, but more often is a feminine name and has a bit of a goth vibe to it.
I really like these! I also really like that you did research on my interests lol I probably should have elaborated on them in a comment as soon as I posted this. I'm not super active on this account and I need to update some stuff but I also really like barn owls, dragons, obscure mythical creatures, horror, anime, and digital art.

Constantly misgendered here 😑 Do I really look like nothing but a woman?? Please give your honest opinion. If so, what could I do to change that? It's extremely frustrating when I go out of my way to dress masc (not look so femm) & people STILL call me a lady. First two pics are me with my wife.		"Hi.  I think you are in a difficult situation. No matter how you dress, people will tend to gender you based on your face and secondary sexual characteristics in to a binary gender.     People are typically looking at  secondary sex characteristics influenced by hormone profiles to determine sex, and then clothing and body mannerisms for sexual orientation.  Even using crazy blue or green hair will not trigger most people to consider non-binary or transgender. :-(.  in the region i am, most people dont even know what non binary is
Your hair looks great but it kind of softens and feminises your face. I think a more masculine hairstyle would make a difference.
You look NB to me, but then I sometimes think of being NB as being a giraffe in a world where people only believe in horses and deers. It should be obvious that one is something else, but people still try to figure out whether one’s a weird horse or a weird deer. I, however, believe in giraffes, so I have a tendency to think of everyone as a giraffe until they gender themselves… Socially I mostly follow whatever pronouns seem to be in use about a person, but I also look for how a person is trying to signal gender to see what they’re saying about themselves. It can sometimes be hard to tell butch women, transguys and NB people apart unless I hear them talk about themselves, or see their reactions to being talked about in certain ways (like cringing at being gendered or grouped with a gender), but I still think it my bad if I slip up. And whenever anyone else think I’m a lesbian and they’re obviously surprised that my partner is a man, I think that they have picked up on my gender identity, but not understood what it was they noticed. 

I hope people will get generally better at picking up on what gender people are signalling instead of looking for physical ”clues” as they get more clued in to how gender actually works, but unfortunately we are not there yet. It sucks waving huge flags saying ”I AM A GIRAFFE!”, and get a response like ”Deers really seem to be politically engaged these days”, or ”I wish those horses would make up their minds”.

Soo… unfortunately, I think the world needs to move beyond a binary and physical understanding of gender before the signals we send can come through clearly. I spent my whole twenties trying to express queer enough not to be gendered, and even though it worked fantastically well with people who were clued in, no one else got it. So it’s not you, it is them. Up to you whether you want to go the route of persisting with coming out until people learn who you are, ignore the non-giraffe-believers, only hang with clued in people or try to change the way people talk and think about gender in general around you. I’ve done quite a bit of all of those depending on context, but currently I am fairly done with the struggle and trying to decide whether to transition anyways, or just try to find peace with just being myself whatever others think it means.
in my view, you lean fem in the first two pics, you're close to androgyny in the third, and you lean masc in the fourth. it's hard to say what you could do to stop getting gendered feminine; cis people will latch onto the smallest things and assume people's gender with it. it could be something we can't even see in these pictures, such as your voice, height, or gait.
Its unfortunate and I'm sorry that it keeps happening, but you do have fairly feminine facial features (delicate lips, small nose, expressive eyes). I think a lot of people would jump to conclusions based on that. In the last pic you do look quite handsome though.
Your hairstyle & your glasses really feminize your face. I have the exact same problem you have, no matter how hard I try I can't pass at all. It's extremely disheartening, but we have to remember that no matter if we ""pass"" or not, we are still Valid 🖤
Take it from me, who is also a trans masc enby married to a woman-- you will probably be misgendered no matter what.  I've tried VERY hard to try to at least get a mixed bag of misgendering, but really, I never do.  It's mostly because trans masc fashion and butch lesbian fashion is basically identical, and I can't afford hormones at the moment. Trying to look like a cis man just kinda makes me feel ugly and boring, anyway.

Best I've gotten is just wearing my pronouns on my jackets/hats/etc and hoping for the best.
I am here to be the voice in dissent concerning your hair. I think it is just fine and that cutting it shorter won't really do much to not get misgendered. It's really nice and full which gives you a stylish but masc look - my cis husband has hair just like yours. 

You might be like me in that T was ultimately needed to give that extra boost towards masc appearance. It was really hard because after I cut it *really* short, my facial features became harder to hide and dysphoria actually increased! Of course this is just my personal experience and yours could easily be different. I have also always used my hair as a sort of psychological veil to hide from the world lol so that might have been a factor.

T will absolutely help you though, once I had been on it only a few months the misgendering stopped. I was able to grow my hair completely out all the way to my butt and people just saw me as a metal head dude, which is accurate. 😅
In the first two pics, I’d say you come off as more fem. I think it’s the hairstyle. But in the other two you’re very androgynous. And I love your hair in the last pic btw, you look really good regardless :)

Edit: now that I’m seeing this, you look more masc in the first two, just with a feminine haircut. My initial thought was that you where amab trying to pass as more fem. idk, take what you will with this.
I'm new here so maybe not what you want to hear.  I've always been called a man.  I like my hair short and wear men's clothing.  It made me upset.  Dress the way that makes you happy.   My mother always said don't worry about the small stuff.  And most of life is the small stuff. Love yourself and those around you.
If i saw you in public and you spoke to me, i would ask your pronouns because you do not look like a cis woman haha. If i were to assume, i would say they/he?

Btw your wife is lucky, you are very handsome!
Look like an enby to me tbh
There will always be someone that does it intentionally to be an ass.

I think really it would be the hair if anything. Its too nice 😆
The curl resting on your glasses is what throws people off, as to most it would look fem, cut the hair a bit so the curl doesn’t stand out too much, or just go for a full masculine hairstyle. Hope this helps
You can look like a guy. I think the main thing is probably curly hair. But, I like to remember that even if other people misgender you, what you know about yourself is most importan
I honestly didn't see you as a woman. I thought you were a slightly fem amab, until I properly read your post.

I'm in a v similar boat, and a talk with my gender doc has me starting on t soon to help balance out some of the more feminising traits :) maybe a chat to gender doc might be good for you too?
I relate to your struggle so much. I started microdosing T, and 5 months later I was still being misgendered. I wear a binder and I have an even more, stereotypically, masculine hair cut. I ended up deciding to just transition to male. I don’t ”identify” as any gender. But I am forced to live in a binary world. Being gendered as male is much more palatable to me, and I will get to a point where I pass and I won’t be clocked as “she/her/miss/ma’am”.

I know it’s infuriating and disheartening. Sending hugs.
You could try masculinizing makeup? There might be some YouTube videos on it. Could try looking up theatrical makeup for men or drag king makeup.

Looks like people already suggested a different hairstyle.

I saw you mentioned microdosing t. I think that could help a lot.

I'm sorry you're being misgendered, it's not a fun feeling. Wishing you the best.

You look great BTW. Love your style and you look really fun to be around :)
If you want my most honest opinion, you look like a 9th grade boy lol
It's the glasses, the cat eye shape of the lenses gives your face a more fem look.
Try some glasses with a heavy frame
Sorry for being so late to the game, I was searching this sub for something else and this post popped up. Figured it wouldn’t hurt to comment since nobody else touched on this yet.

I was trying to figure out *why* you looked more feminine to me in the pics (is it the smile? The hair? The soft facial features?) I can’t say for sure but I think the soft face is a big part of it, how often do you see a brown haired cis guy with a shave as clean as your face? This gives people a sort of cognitive dissonance regardless of how you present. People only looking for binary genders figure you must be either a pre-pubescent cis male or a female. Since there are probably lots of clues to confirm you are not a tween boy they default to female. You also have a sweet, bright smile, it’s fucked up but people associate that with feminine, the majority of cis guys are really terrible at smiling, esp in pictures, no idea why. 

The one thing that really stood out to me was your earrings. It’s exceptionally rare to see a cis guy with both earlobes pierced, and the only times I’ve seen that it’s usually with a 0 gauge or larger stretched lobe. I can’t recall ever seeing a cis man with small sparkly studs in both lobes (not saying they can’t, just saying I think most people associate that with female).

Also, I can’t remember exactly what it was but you made a comment earlier to which I recall thinking “nonbinary doesn’t have to be masculine or feminine or androgynous, nonbinary doesn’t look any one way.
I'm sorry you live in a place that has lots of ignorant people. That _really_ tough.

Thank you for your honesty. I just had a chat with my doctor. Next month, I'll start microdosing on T so I hope that helps 😔 Getting misgendered is so dysphoric.
Then I'll probably have to get my hair cut even shorter. I currently have it shaved on the sides with it longer on top. My hair is super wavy and curls beside my face no matter what I do 😅
Oh my god, I love your horse deer and giraffe analogy! 😂 I needed a laugh and you certainly made my day. And my wife's; she loved it.

You bring up some very valid points. I only just figured out early this year that I'm nonbinary and I've been trying to figure out what that means to me. I've never felt comfortable in my own skin and for once in my life I just want to feel like me so badly.

I think you're right. There are lots of binary people out there who don't get it or just don't want to _see_ other genders at all. Those are people who have an opinion I can't change. It makes me a bit sad but there's nothing I can do when it comes to that. Maybe I just need to focus on making changes to myself until I can look in the mirror, just smile and say- that's ""me"", regardless of what others say.

You have given me so much to think about and, best of all, made me smile. Thank you for your honesty and sharing your experiences with me.
>It sucks waving huge flags saying ”I AM A GIRAFFE!”, and get a response like ”Deers really seem to be politically engaged these days”, or ”I wish those horses would make up their minds”.

OMG this is the best.
This is a lovely and thoughtful and spot on response 🤍🤍
I want ""I'm not a deer or a horse, I'm a giraffe damn it"" on a shirt now. This was awesome
Maybe starting with the hair would help? I beginning to think getting it cut even shorter might help a bit. I don't expect to get gendered correctly _all_ the time but I'd like to at least feel like I somewhat pass as nonbinary. Even if only for a moment. I don't feel like I've reached that point yet.
Thank you! 😭 Hopefully someday, I'll find the perfect balance of masc to my femm that feels right for me. It's been a mission of mine that I've been pursuing all year.
Awww, thank you 🥺 It's good to be reminded of that.
I so get that! I was born with such a 'sweet' and 'cute' face so I can't really blend into the masc scene very well. And when my wife and I are put together the sweet and cute factor just increases, haha 😋 

As for clothing style, I'm still working on that for myself too. I look super young (the photos I posted are current photos of me) but I'm 32 years old.
Oooh, okay. I probably think a bit more before I go rushing to get it cut. I'll actually be starting microdosing in November. Maybe I should wait and see how much my face changes before considering other styles? 🤔

It actually makes me feel better knowing your cis husband has a style similar to mine 😁
Thank you! That honestly makes me feel a lot better. Maybe I'm doing better than I originally thought? I guess I'll need to play around with my hairstyles some more.
You guessed correctly! They/he are the pronouns I feel most comfortable with. And thank you for the compliment ☺ I feel a little sheepish 😁

I realized I wasn't cis during the beginning of covid and I never really got a chance to interact with other LGBTQ+ people in person. I've been around mostly cis people. They have a knack for misgendering others.
Thank you!! That means a lot. If you think so, then I must be doing something right.
Too nice?!! 😂 Awww, what do you mean?! If anything, it's too _incredible_ 😎
Haha! Yeah, my wavy hair is hard to tame at this length. Thanks for the tip.
Thank you for your kind words. It really means a lot. It's a tough thing to remember- that it doesn't matter what others think but how you view yourself. I'm still learning to love myself for the person I am so I appreciate the reminder.
Yes! I can pull off a femm amab! Is it strange that that makes me happy? 😁 I'm really trying to give that masculine vibe so I'm glad it can be picked up on in some degree .

How exciting! I'm glad you're starting T soon. Dysphoria is rough. I've finally worked up the courage to talk to a endocrinologist in November so I'm hoping to start microdosing on T.
Hugs back! You and I are definitely in the same boat. I am proud of the traits I inherited being born afab (like being able to see things from a woman's point of view), but my mind mostly processes things in a masculine way. I feel more confident when I present masc and I think they/he pronouns fit me best. It's hard being called miss and ma'am 😑
Thanks! 😄 I try to be entertaining.

I honestly hadn't thought about using makeup. That's definitely something that I'll have to look in to. I just found out that I won't be able to see the endocrinologist until January 19 of 2022 😅 Until I can start T, I'm hoping makeup will alleviate the dysphoria. I appreciate the suggestion!
Not helpful, dude.
All points you made are very good. Thank you for being so thorough and honest. In the end, I think T is the only thing that will help me with the dysphoria I struggle with every single day. It's only been for a few months now but I've been seeing a trans therapist who has helped me come to a deeper understanding of what I'm going through. I'm not JUST a woman. I have a very strong male side to myself that is never seen no matter how I act or what I wear. People are only seeing a tiny percentage of who I really am. In the end, never having my masculine self acknowledged hurts like hell. I want to be a creature that exists in the middle.

That stuff I said in a previous post- ""nonbinary doesn't have to be masc or fem""...yeah, I know that that's true. But knowing it and feeling it are two very different things. I've been telling myself for years ever since I realized I was nonbinary that I shouldn't let what others think/say get to me. I was born with this body so I just need to deal. Learn to love it. I've been telling myself these things because I'm afraid of starting T. I keep hoping I'm wrong; that I can learn to love this body so I don't have to face the strange unknown that HRT will bring with it. I guess I'm still trying to figure out what I want.
Thank you for your kind words.  I live in an eastern european orthodox region.  I started transitioning in the country of malta, wearing skirts... That was kinda intense... But it was nothing compared to the difficulty of this region. I really cannot imagine how lgbtqi+ children grow up in this region. 

If you are looking to be gendered as non binary, testosterone may result in you being gendered as male.  Maybe that would be much more comfortable for you than being gendered female... If you wish to be gendered as non-binary by strangers, you might have to use a pronoun badge... not a particularly fun option...  i appear male mostly, so i will either get identified as scotish male (due to my kilt), or possibly female (at corner shop where i am a regular).  even when i put my pronouns on my facebook and email footer, i still get mr and sir in  all my emails.   

trying to say - the humans are problematic, and in most cultures the population is not sensitive enough to non-binary, as there is no universal visual queue for non-binary people.
Often, I accidentally get called ma'am because of my long hair. I really don't care what other people think and I think you'd be happier if you didn't.

Did you transition for them or for yourself?
If you want to look more masculine, I would look at masculine celebrities with hairstyles you like and try to understand what it is about the hair that makes them look masculine then copy that. Generally masculine hairstyles make the head look square and hard, feminine hairstyles make the head look round and soft. 

Alternatively, just go to a good barber and ask them to make you look more masculine.
Also, a random tip: you can comb your eyebrows in a more masculine or feminine way, it works great! (Basically, heavier and more rugged = masculine, it helps to ""un-soften"" your face)
You’re very welcome, I’m glad it was of help
it might be more styling than length? it looks like your hair is the same length in the 3rd and 4th pics, but you read as solidly masculine in the 4th while you don't quite read that way in the 3rd.  
  
that's about as much advice as i can give, unfortunately, as my journey has been mostly trying to get people to *stop* reading me as masculine.
These endo wait times are ridiculous! Hang in there.
God, that sucks. 😟 I wish you nothing but the best. I really do.

And I hear ya; even when I wear a they/them badge I run into a lot of people who don't honor it. I live in the southern United States where it's Bible central.

As for getting misgendered, after talking with everyone here, I think it's just gonna happen when I'm dealing with binary people. I think I'll just try to focus on what I think is nonbinary for me and try to reflect that on the outside. Whether people get the message or not, what's important is that I'm satisfied with how I look; that I'm reflecting what I feel on the inside.

Thank you so much. You have given me a lot to think about.
Thank you! I'll definitely give that a try. I appreciate your help 🙏
Oh, thanks! I forgot I could even do that, haha 😋
I still appreciate your suggestions 😊 It looks like I have even more experimenting to do. ...This could take a while to figure out 😋
I think there are some binary people that get it... and hopefully over time that will increase. We are at the cold hard front of trying to shift those perceptions. our efforts will help make the pathway smoother for others.  So i really respect you as you navigate your path forwards. 

Wishing you safety and understanding from others.  

Bee!
You're welcome! I'm sure you'll be even more handsome!"	qerl7d	NonBinary	81	1.0	2021-10-24 12:53:34
I'd like to expand my vocabulary to avoid being rude	"Do you nonbinary  people have a word to replace guy/dude/man ? ""my person"" isn't exactly wonderful of a sympathetic appellation and I'd just like to change my habit of calling people ""my man"" or ""bro"" to avoid misgendering"	"I like saying peeps like short of people :)
Buddy, mate, friend, pal. Maybe amigo. Multiple people: folks. For strangers, I would default to 'friend' or 'stranger'. I feel like the receiption of those names is down to how you say it, when using a light friendly tone people are more receptive. I feel like buddy is the most used alternative.
I personally like the idea of reclaiming “dude” as a genderless appellation but not everyone feels the same way
I aay ""fam"" a lot for this reason !!
I like to use ""bean"" (as in human bean), although the connotations are generally more cutesy
For a group I really like “folks” 

For an individual, pal or buddy or friend works well imo
I mostly just let my inner Philadelphian out

'Hey yo'
Friend, friendo, pal, bean, bub 🤷
fam! what’s up fam!!
I use “Team” a whole lot.
Slut is gender neutral but idk how most would take it😂
Like pretty much everything, it depends on the person. I don't mind but I know a lot of folks that  don't like it. Friend, buddy, pal, I've heard cuz (like short for cousin) used but I'm not sure how I feel about that, are all gender neutral
I go with friend when I don't know someone's preference, but having grown up in California I'm comfortable with dude and bro but that's not the case for everyone
My friends use Comrade, but most of us dont mind dude.
""Friend"" in the singular and ""friends/folks"" in plural work quite well. 

If you don't want to come across as overly friendly, ""stranger(s)"" works well in US contexts (though sounds strange to my British English ears), and there's always just referring to people directly with ""you"" - e.g. instead of ""what's up fellas?"", you could use ""What's up with you all?""

(Though - and this is entirely a personal thing - I personally have a strong dislike for ""folx"", as ""folks"" is already gender neutral and so it just feels very unnecessarily performative to me to put the ""gender x"" in there too. But I know other people who value it, so I guess part of all this is just taking the time to learn what the people you regularly interact with are comfortable with!)
bbs, friend, peeps, bean
""Yall"" is a versatile word I highly recommend it... and you can even use it for a single person I think it's kinda fun when people do that to me :P
buddy, pal, comrade, friend, mate
As you can see by the comments people have different preferences so just ask people what they prefer instead I am non binary and personally like being called bro and dude it just depends every person is different
Human

Human bean

Refer to them in context to something they often wear or say

The world is a canvas and you have a paintbrush... do with it what you will.
I personally use hun and bud a lot tho some people get annoyed at hun cus they assume it's me being sassy or something lol
I like ""friend""
i usually default to pal, bub, or amigo. altho im puerto rican so the last one just comes naturally lmao

bonus: if you feel like being a cowboy you could always start calling people partner /j
Peeps?
I typically use “my friend”
My folk!
It’ll honestly depends on the person you’re talking to and what they’re personally comfortable with.
I always suggest Bitch or Monarch
mate, gremlin, fellow human, gnome, goblin, all-knowing being, genderless void, your highness, greg, liege, lord, etc
Buddy, pal, homie, peeps, fam, chum, mate, folks

Those are all ones I use

I also enjoy calling people ""my old bean"" but you have to judge if they'll enjoy that one before busting it out lol
I personally say 'dude' because we're all dudes. All men are dudes, all women are dudes, all us in betweenies are dudes. We're all cool dudes.

If someone doesn't like that, I honestly just call them by their name then or a nice nickname. I also say brosinzki because I am actually stuck in the 90s lol
“Folks” or my “friends” works great for me!
happy cake day
I say mate a lot
For southern types you can't go wrong with ""y'all"". It's gender neutral, singular, and plural all at once.
I use homie a lot. Imo dude is gender neutral but idk if everyone feels that way
The word “friends/friend” is nice. For the lives of god, don’t call anyone “buddy” lolz
Friend, friend-o
I think the idea that ""dude"" or ""guys"" is neutral is born from a misogynistic society but yknow, just food for thought. I say homies, pals, gang, etc
Hey there buddy chum pal friend buddy pal chum bud friend fella bruther amigo pal buddy friend chummy chum chum pal i don't mean to be rude my friend pal home slice bread slice dawg
Same :D
Personally, I usually just say ""dude"", ""man"", ""boi"", ""ladies"", ""children"", or sometimes ""women of the office!"" to anyone, including my mum and dad lol! But that's just me. 

But as an NB, I want to be respectful of my fellow peeps! 

I think it all just depends on context and the nature of the relationship. :)
I feel like Stranger works best with a cowpoke accent \^\_\^

Comrade is another in the Friend/Pal category, might get a few people who are all offended by that one but those people tend to be -phobes anyway
Y’all
Agreed, it’s a lot about tone! I like all of these, not sure about amigo though… I think in Spanish it’s male only
""amigo"" is actually a gendered word on masculine fyk


I personally like to use pal
trans woman here, i don’t like buddy! it feels like something you call a young boy, not an adult who you respect! depends on who it’s coming from though
I don't like this at all. I feel like many cis-women are okay with being called dude because it is *generally* clear that the person calling them dude doesn't think they are a man. 


However, as I was amab and still often present very masculine, when someone calls me dude it feels like they are just trying to tell me that they still see me as a man. 


Dude is a word I try not to make a fuss of, especially with people who have already proven to ne that the respect me as a nonbinary person. But weirdly enough, the people who have shown to me with their actions that they respect my identity also almost never call me dude. And they have not once tried to tell me that calling me a dude is ok - they just made a mistake and we move on.
Me too. I call cis women dude all the time.
I’m non-binary and to me, dude and guys are both genderless. Like “guys” is a collection of people and “dude” is someone who is just cool. 
But it depends on the person. I have a few gay friends who they’re definitely not dudes. They’re queens, bitches, sisters and honeys and they will bat their eyes, twirl their ‘staches, and sling their purses if you call them dude.
I've always seen dude as neutral slang. I've never seen anyone take offense to it before regardless of gender. (There might be some people but I've never encountered them.)
You can expand that to ""old bean"" in your best British accent for bonus points.
Jabroni would be a good gender neutral option
Oh yeah it does like I'm perfectly happy being called a dude or guys cause I see that a gender neutral but its different for everyone. Also I'm on a personal mission to appropriate 'y'all' from Texas for the NB community 😂😂
Y'all is what I use... have a coworker that chose folks
Yeah, I wasn't sure about amigo. Growing up, everyone said it to everyone. The definition says ""used to address a friend; especially a male friend"", so I guess it's another dude situation where it can be used either way but may be considered more of a male term.

I still stand by that dude is a gender neutral term tbh. It's 'slang for a person, typically male' but that doesn't mean only male. The word dudette was so unnecessary (not aimed at you, I'm just cringing at some childhood memories lol).
Could always use ""compadre"" instead.
A mixed gender group of friends would be “amigos” so I think the “non gendered” version is unfortunately gendered male.
I get it. By reclaiming I mean like the term “queer” was reclaimed. It used to be an insult. As much as I would like for it to be recognized as genderless, doesn’t mean that I would use it for everyone.
Cis women (often but not always) have less baggage that they are carrying around with respect to people viewing them as a man.
I'm into that, my mum is from Florida so I tend to say y'all! 😁
Spanish is a gendered language, and ""amigo"" is the masculine form of friend
Yeah, I just mean I don’t personally associate my use of dude with masculinity. I do understand that it can be interpreted that way though.
I'm from the UK so literally no one says it here 😂😂"	t6l3f1	NonBinary	80	0.98	2022-03-04 15:12:32
He used my pronouns for the first time!	"I don’t know if it was on purpose or not, but when speaking to our son, my husband referred to me as “they” vs “she”.

It took a beat but when it clicked I was really happy. I’ve been out since Jan. 2021 and he was the first person I spoke with. I have frequent “check-ins” with him about my presentation, as I suppress the more masculine presentation as I understand he is heterosexual and that is not something he is okay with. Being fluid I can swing androgynous or femme with him and I don’t experience dysphoria.

I have just started using my pronouns at home with our son, but still use “mom” as he is autistic and 6, and I want to avoid throwing too many complex concepts at him. Developmentally, he is just learning to understand I am, in fact, ma/mommy, that is enough for me.

But to hear this man, who just usually doesn’t care, acknowledge and use this 4 letter word….the euphoria was so great!

I’m misgendered with my immediate family (it’s okay, they don’t understand I think), work is weird as I’m transitioning from she/they to they/them and present femme…but ahhh he used the right one.


Sorry for the infodump. I’m just so very happy."	"Yays for you!!

I got my letter! I'm getting top surgery!!!	"I'm incredibly lucky to have an amazing therapist who understands non-binary issues and recommends gender conformation surgery for her patients (should the need arise), including her non-binary and gender non conforming patients.

The road ahead is still long (since my surgery will be government funded, I'll be about a year on the waitlist), but progress is being made. Since December, I went from crying in the car as we left a Christmas party where I was constantly being misgendered, to going to therapy for the first time in February, to having an official dysphoria diagnosis in May, and now, to an actual plan of action to help me overcome it. 

Every day, things are getting better. I'm going to be okay and happy and euphoric about my body.

Things can get better for you, too, whatever ""better"" looks like for you. You are valid, and loved, and I see you. ❤️"	"So proud of you!
Congrats!! So exciting!!

I'm waiting for the insurance to approve of it and then I'll be able to get surgery soon as well!
That's amazing! I'm looking into gender therapists for that exact surgery! I wish you he best of luck!
Congrats!! I just had my surgery done a couple of weeks ago! I got real lucky; my insurance covered most of the procedure under the understanding it was actually a breast reduction lol just a very very large reduction. 

&#x200B;

But it's truly such an amazing feeling! So affirming! So euphoric! And TBH the pain has been so easy to manage. If you have any questions about the procedure or anything feel free to message me :)
So happy for you!
Thank you!!
That's awesome, I wish you all the best!! NBs who need surgery unite!!
Good luck finding a good therapist! If the first one doesn't feel right, it's ok to try a different therapist.
Oooh awesome, congratulations!! My therapist and I talked about going that route, but it felt off for me to ask for a ""small female"" chest instead of a ""reconstructed male"" chest. I'm glad you found a way to get insurance to pay, these operations are expensive af 😩 I'm really lucky to be in Canada (and within Canada, I'm in Montreal, where the most experienced trans operation center is located!!) so I don't need to deal with insurance for this. 

I might take you up on that! Having a nb point of view instead of the classic binary trans masc will be nice. I feel like there are still relatively few of us who want/need surgery so I'd love to talk to you about that!
Thank you ☺️
I feel yah. I didn't really care about the semantics. In the end all of my breast tissue is gone so if they want to look at it as a small female chest than they can Lmao 🤷

And I'm so glad to hear you have good health access! My breast surgeon was awesome and I definitely feel like she made the process so much easier, so I'm happy to hear you'll have some good people on your side! 

Also just thought of this, but prior to my surgery I found that looking at post op pics helped me out a lot, both with preparing mentally and also figuring out exactly how I wanted my chest to look. If you want to do the same I highly recommend the website transbucket! It has user uploaded post op pics with reviews of the surgeon. 

Anyway! Good luck! And again feel free to message me with any questions anytime :)"	c8hm1x	NonBinary	79	0.99	2019-07-03 00:57:49
Im being cissplained gender by 12 year olds on tiktok after my tiktok about being misgendered blew up. Thanks yall for always making me feel valid in my queerness ❤		"Omg, I’ve never heard the term “cissplained” before. That is brilliant!

Also, your hair rocks!
Ah yes. The 12 year olds with degrees in psychology, biology, and social anthropology that have written so many peer reviewed papers on the subject. Oh wait...
Oh god

AMAB enby here	"I use they/them pronouns. I get misgendered by strangers all the time, as you can probably imagine, and it's a somewhat even split between he/him and she/her (maybe she/her a little more often).
Part of me is like ""this is fine, I confuse the cis. That's cool"", but most of me wants to distance myself as far as possible from my AGAB. Like, if I'm gonna be forced into a box by this binary society, I wish strangers would strictly see me as femme.
Anyway. Not sure if any of you can relate"	"Exactly the same but in the opposite direction. If I have to choose between male or female before being allowed to proceed I'll always choose male but internally I am nonbinary. I mostly gave up on telling people that though because I know the majority of people still see you one way or another.
Yeah, I think this is pretty common for a lot of enbies, regardless of AGAB. I'm genderfluid so it's maybe a little different for me, but I definitely feel this a fair bit.  Sometimes the opposite feels extra wrong for me too though.  


But yeah, goddamn boxes.
I've entered a very passive aggressive phase with this -- I'll usually have like three or four super large they/them pronoun buttons (size: in-your-face large according to Redbubble lol) I pin to my shirt, along with like a thousand other smaller pins. mostly to remind people that they done f'd up by calling me sir all the time lmao.
I know that feeling to well.
Yeah I've reframed my brain to accept that strangers who don't know me are gonna pick 1 of 2 options no matter how I look. So I try to focus on those closest to me that respect my pronouns and I feel better :)
Damn i wish someone would misgender me with she/her... i only get he/him
I find I actually get sir'd *more* since dying my hair a *very masculine* (/s) shade of blue and piercing my ears.  I don't particularly care aside from finding it curious, like something is slightly ""off"" so they subconsciously need to reinforce ""dude.""
I feel this way exactly hahaha. I use they/them, I’m nb and gf, sometimes I do makeup and wear dresses etc and other times I’m more masc / andro. Even when I’m not femme ppl mistake me for a she though.
I used to feel good about causing gender confusion until I finally found enough clued in friends (and enough social isolation) to have gendering be a rare experience in my life. Now, any gendering rubs me equally the wrong way, rather than ”balancing eachother out”. I had already figured out that my own gender confusion probably was due to being agender, but this contrast between the comfort of never being gendered and discomfort at any gendering really drives it home.
Afab here. Same thing happens to me. I look androgynous and it confuses people.  It can be euphoric for me at times though as I view myself as kinda in the middle in a way.

Pro owns pins are a thing if you feel comfortable with the. Sometimes a they they/them pin , or any other pronoun,  will alert some knowledgeable people that this person uses different pronouns and is not cis
afab here. masc dressing women are common. people don't even bother thinking that i could be a ""he"" (i am a he)
I'm an afab NB with a somewhat fem face and I'm forced to try my hardest to look masc in order to even pass as anything but ""madam,"" ""lady,"" etc. I wish I could be more androgynous or maybe even embrace my fem looks when I feel like it (I'm gender fluid) but if I don't go full guy with my appearance I look like a cis girl to everyone. It sucks!!
I feel a similar way, the difference being (I think) that I would very much prefer just being feminine and not simply being read as such though that would be nice too it's to a point now where I'm seriously considering hrt and stuff, waiting on a therapist before I commit to anything tho because 🌟repression🌟
I feel this exactly. Except despite for my wish and feeling a bit more fem than masc I look very masc and have been called he/him almost my entire life by family and friends. (Only really came into myself recently). Though I’ve gotten to the point where what I wish would happen and what does won’t meet and while not super okay with it, I let it go. I sound masc, I look masc, I can’t afford any changes. So I just accept masc pronouns because people haven’t changed for me. (Probably doesn’t help that my family won’t use other pronouns ether.) so yes OP, I can relate. Hope things work out well for you.
My life in a nutshell -_-
I like pins. It's not like we're made at people for a truly honest mistake and as long as there's effort being put in after.

Came out to coworker and now she's intentionally misgendering	"So I finally felt comfortable enough with a few coworkers to tell them that I'm NB and go by they/them. Another coworker was nosey and wiggled her way into the conversation. Anyways she asked a ton of invasive questions and I answered most since I'm fairly open, but limited myself in what exactly I would explain/say. During this convo I specifically told nosey coworker that I dislike the terms:lady, ladies, girl, girlie, etc. She responded that nobody even really uses those terms. I told her its more common than you think. Also that I don't get upset if clients misgender me bc they don't know me/barely talk with them. 

Anyways, it's been a month and it seems like nosey coworker is now intentionally misgendering me and using the exact terms I told her I disliked. The terms she said nobody uses 🙄 yeah she uses them a bunch. This week I was called girlie, girl, lady, multiple times. Anyways I just wanted to complain here. I hate cis people, especially cishet morning people 😮‍💨"	"Does your workplace and/or local government have a policy about discrimination toward gender identity and gender expression? Where I live and worked, that was grounds for being fired.
That's sexual harassment. I would contact hr and file a complaint.
Act unbothered and refer to them as; ""man, boyo, dude, guy, etc..."" Then live in peace knowing that their life is so dull they felt the need to misgender you to spice it up.
Basically I only came here to complain and maybe get some validation/ emotional support. But I don't want to solve this or engage in a conflict with my coworker. Additional info below.

In response to everyone saying to go to HR I probably won't. I am not out to my family or a majority of my other coworkers. We work pretty closely with everyone and there's only like 14 of us. I have not made it clear to my boss that I'm NB. My boss had some kind of bullshit sensitivity training with corporate and would want to ""know more if I don't mind"" if I came out to her. She thinks the only out cis lesbian at work is the one who can educate her on Trans issues. I don't want to educate all of my coworkers and feel like they're watching me differently or going to ask me more invasive questions. It's honestly exhausting. And sure I could say no, but then they'd still be watching me differently. 

I also live in a pretty conservative area and it's not entirely safe for me to be out to everyone in my situation. My goal was to tell only a few people at work who I'm closer with. I also never wrote in my sign on forms that my pronouns were they/them because in the end it still made me pick she/they and I thought well fuck it then they don't actually give me the real option so I won't give them that information. I made myself appear cis on paper. I also work for a big Corp that I don't trust at all.
Sorry you're going through this. The Position I always take is that if someone can remember to use a different name after someone gets married or can remember to call someone Dr. so and so after getting an MD or PhD, they can remember a damned pronoun. As for her having tough times, I wouldn't accept that excuse. I'm disabled, pretty much in constant pain and exhaustion, and even when I was also in a 20-year abusive toxic relationship, I was still able to be considerate to others. I hope your situation changes for the better soon.
Could be that she's a dumbass. I have so many of those who seemed receptive when I told them, but just don't seem to get it. Doesn't *feel* malicious when they use those terms for me, but they've made it clear to me that they're just idiots. Honestly, if you can remember a cat's pronouns, you can remember mine. Same with gendered terms. How often do you correct your coworker? If it's everyday, then she's probably doing it on purpose. But if you've only said something once or twice (spaced apart), then she *could* have forgotten. 

I stopped correcting people for the most part, so I just deal with it.
The only sexual harassment aspect of this was OP for talking about this at work
That's a good suggestion. 👍
I think it's possible that it's not malicious. But it seems odd that she's using every single one of the terms I told her not to use for me. I think cis people just don't care. Im not out to all my coworkers so i think its easy to just not change anything and pretend we didnt have that conversation. I dont correct anyone. It takes too much energy that I don't have. She made it sound like anything other than cis would be too hard for her when I told her. I was like yeah the world of pronouns CAN be complicated in the same way that people can be complex and complicated.
its funny your name is ""independent thoughts"" the way you parrot conservative talking points without a semblance of critical thinking. hope you get thoughts of your own one day <3
How on earth is disclosing your pronouns and name preferences at work sexual harassment?
Incorrect. The topic and the fact that it makes the OP uncomfortable makes it sexual harassment. That is how the law defines it.
It’s not. I’m just trying to point out that the whole idea that any of this can be considered sexual harassment is just false. From both sides
[removed]
Okay, I would rephrase your original comment then because it doesn't come across the way you implied it to
Then you did a shit job because all you had to say is that it doesn't qualify as sexual harassment. Instead of clearly communicating your point, you independently thought your way into parroting the right wing party line.
But pronouns are not a sexual term. The ones referenced by the OP are sexual on nature, that's what makes it sexual harassment.

Tomboyx is transphobic! don't support businesses that misgender their trans workers		"A trans model was continuously misgendered while working for tomboyx and was blocked when they tried to call the company out. Trans people deserve better than transphobic brands
It hurts just a little bit more when queer people and groups are transphobic. Like I expect a good portion of cishets to be a little transphobic, but not queer people and brands.
My partner (met her on [TS Dates](https://datingadvocate.com/ts-dates)) had a bad experience with tomboys too! cancel them!
I remember when this happened over the summer, I believe TomboyX issued an apology. It’s weird and sucks that this even happened...it’s like I want to support a queer brand that makes non gendered undies but then they do this stuff
Gonna add incase someone comes across this while researching the brand like I did: No, they did not apologize to the model. They actually blocked him and cut contact.
Well, fuck. Guess I'll be looking for a new brand. I just became aware of this cause I decided to Google search them instead of going directly to their website (don't ask me why, I don't know) & the first search option to pop up was ""tomboyx transphobic"". 

If anyone has leads to a company that has stuff similar to their 9 inch boxer briefs (and maybe period underwear?) that'd be great.
This made my mind up, not gonna buy from them if that's how they treat people who have worked for them. Will look elsewhere for my lgbt needed stuff thanks for sharing.
Thanks for sharing!
Well this is really messed up I was going to order from them and now I see a reason not to.
Ive never had issue with them & i order from them all the time. & yes i'm trans.
Could you provide a link to said apology? I can't find anything and Trent (the model) says they never apologized and still have him blocked on Twitter
Well this has been a disappointing chain of links... I've had a hell of a time finding bras that look good and have a suitable pocket for breast forms. :/ Guess I'll keep looking. Can't say I'm overally surprised by a company that got in bed with Target.

Edit: thank you for the update
Okay? Obviously they're not going to be transphobic to their customers. That doesn't somehow erase the fact that they were being assholes to trans employees. You can buy from them if you want but personally I'm not interested in giving money to transphobes"	k94d99	NonBinary	74	0.99	2020-12-08 13:42:48
Misgendered by the gender identity clinic!	"Today I saw the letter the GIC sent to my GP after my last appointment. He mentions that I use neutral pronouns and then proceeds to use she/her pronouns throughout 😑

I’m going to complain about this at my next appointment because surely of all places to get my pronouns correct, after I have talked at length about why I use they/them, and how dysphoric being misgendered makes me feel, the GIC should at least get it right, especially the Dr who has seen me! "	"That sucks, and it’s happened to me too.😕💜💜
A lot of psych majors get to the part of the class that explains the difference between sex and gender and just ignore it. It's disgusting to me, also a psych major, because *this is the field that actually looks into this stuff*

And then these people become therapists and doctors.
That is so sad, had initial assessment to get on waiting list for tbc today and was so validating to be asked for pronouns after I mentioned not identifying with my assigned gender. Can't imagine what it would feel like to have that just thrown back at you like that.
My shrink is bad for this too. I mean, it’s not as bad as the gender identity clinic misgendering you because that’s pretty much the most infuriating place to get misgendered, like hello do you understand what fucking job you are doing here, but it’s annoying because I know he knows my goddamn pronouns. I’ve had to correct him enough times that I’m ready to start every appointment by reminding him of my pronouns. 
This is the ""She prefers they/them pronouns"" shit I've noticed a lot recently. To me it is very telling that the person is more so 'playing along' (ew) than genuinely understanding about how gender identity really works. Considering where this happened though I really don't want that to be the case because like you said this is definitely the sort of person who should accept, understand, and believe non-binary people when they've stated who they are.
Totally with you. My gender therapist mixed up my pronouns this morning. 
As a person in healthcare, I am so sorry this happened to you! And that makes me more mad that it was at the gender identity clinic! Have faith that there are more and more of us gender queer folks in healthcare and working on making change happen so that things like this don’t keep happening. 
You’d think out of all the medical professionals, those working at the gender clinic would at least get it right. I have a report written by a mental health nurse using neutral pronouns and I don’t even think I asked her to (I know that it’s written on my medical documents somewhere, so she must have been paying attention!) yet this doctor who I’ve spent a good few hours taking about my gender with can’t get it right? I’m sorry it’s happened to you too, it really sucks xx
I'm a psych major in grad school. I've found that most of the students actually accepted into grad programs are incredibly more understanding and supportive! That being said,  I'm also from a liberal city in Canada which might bias things..just my two cents! 
It’s even worse when they know. I spent 2 weeks in hospital enduring the misgendering cos I was too sick to correct anyone, then out of the blue a new nurse asks my pronouns and when I say “no one has asked me that here yet” he looked at my file and said “it says right here, gender neutral!” and that was the first I knew about it even being on any records! So either staff just didn’t bother, or didn’t understand and didn’t bother asking anyone... my shrink used to do it too and it was infuriating, I’m sorry you have to experience it too 😔

I also use Mx as a title and constantly have to complain to my pharmacy cos they keep changing it to Ms! 
For sure. I think they write mine down every time I go in!!
That's good to hear. I've still got a year ahead of me in that aspect
If they include gender neutral in your file, I wonder why whoever initially typed that in didn't also put your preferred pronouns? 
It even says at one point “she prefers to use gender neutral pronouns” like dude come on do your fucking job and gender me correctly, you’ve just written it RIGHT THERE! "	9x0nr2	NonBinary	77	0.97	2018-11-14 14:41:31
Long hair is enby too!	"So I'm an AFAB enby with long hair. And of course, living in Texas, I'm constantly being misgendered. It nearly got me to the point this weekend that I seriously thought about chopping it off for a ""traditional enby style."" 

I'm glad I've told my wife to never let me do that because I'm now very squarely thinking fuck the binary assumptions that force AFAB enbies into masculine hairstyles.

I absolutely love my hair. It's gorgeous. It's a huge part of my connection to my culture. And my culture considers long hair gender neutral. So I know I'm not going to change it. But damnit! I wish people would stop ma'am'ing me! "	"@Nonbinary folx with long hair, you all look fantastic!

I hate being AFAB [TW// Swearing, misgendering mentions]	"I love wearing skirts and dresses, I have since i was little.  But eventually it got to the point where even after I came out, people would call me a girl if I was wearing a dress.  I hate it, I hate people calling me anything feminine, but they just.  Won't.  Stop.  All I ever fucking hear is SHE thinks this and that happened to HER.  I'm so fucking sick of it.  I want to wear skirts, and as weird as it sounds, I want to get dirty looks from Karens, I want to get called a boy, derogatory or not.  Because anything is better than being her.  I hate her.  I hate her and how she took over my life and I hate how everyone wants me to be her.  I don't care how, I just want to look like a boy.  Or even just less feminine.  I don't care that I was ""pretty as a girl"" because I never fucking WAS a girl.  It doesn't matter that you like my dead name, because it's not your decision.  Fuck you.  Fuck you for doing that to me.  
(I'm sorry, I just needed to get this out.  If you read this far, thank you!  Your a great person, I love you, and I would die for you.)"	"I feel you, I’m Enby/genderfluid and I still like to wear skirts and dresses. It’s hard when you’re AFAB and haven’t changed your body so all people see is “woman.” And even though I don’t feel like a woman inside I’m still subject to society’s expectations and judgment of that gender because it’s assumed. I have to live with it every day. Especially since I’m a mother and am married to a cis man. It’s a struggle.
I feel you, I get so uncomfortable when people call me a boy, I kinda ge it but something just don't sit right with me when I get associated to that.
I feel you. I don’t mind she and her as much, but (I’m still closeted) a relative called me princess recently and it made my skin crawl. I definitely prefer presenting as masculine. If you have long hair, I recommend an undercut and tying the hair into a ponytail at the back. Most euphoria I ever felt. Also, love you too

I got misgendered 21 times in the span of 2 minutes	"I wish I was kidding. I was sobbing in a bathroom at a ""youth mental health centre"" which is SUPPOSEDLY LGBT+ friendly. I've been going there weekly for two and a half years. My girlfriend was arguing with a person of power outside the door (long story for another subreddit)

My girlfriend counted how many times this cis person in a position of power at this company misgendered me. My girlfriend corrected her every time, getting more frustrated as time went on. And this cis person in a position of power at a ""safe space"" for diverse people said ""I'm sorry, it's just hard for me""

I've introduced myself there every week with they/them pronouns. And I still got misgendered 21 times in two minutes.

After two and a half years there, I won't be going back anymore."	"I'm so fucking sorry for you. Fuck that person, and fuck that ""safe space"" for hiring them.
I find sometimes ""safe spaces"" can be much worse than random spaces. My sympathies.
I know how that feels.  Sometimes when I am at a restaurant and the server is talking to me it is 'sir' every other word and place someone could fit it it.  And I am wearing a dress and presenting myself in an obviously non-masculine way.  However, I don't get upset after the first occurrence because they don't know me and maybe I am in their eyes a non-conforming ""sir"".  And I am totally cool with guys who that is true for.  But, for me, I am more sensitive to being misgendered after I have either introduced myself or have asked them nicely to not call me ""sir"".  Regular pronouns such as ""he, him, his"" do not hurt as much and can tolerated those to a much higher threshold unless the person knows my preferred pronouns and then continues to use the non-preferred pronouns. 

The ""I'm sorry, it's hard for me"" is such a lame excuse.  Its called professionalism.  They are serving the public.  And in this case, a clientele that is sensitive to these things.   If this is too hard for them, then they should be in a cube doing a task where human interaction is minimal.  

I am sorry you experienced this.
I'm sorry
Would probably be a good idea to leave a review to this effect on Google Maps if you're comfortable with that!  You can always create a dummy account if you don't want the review associated with your main.
If this person in power has anyone they are answerable to, contact those people and relay your experience. Have your gf relay hers. Explain how this incident has destroyed your trust in their mental health center, which relies 100% on developing trust! If there is no one accountable, leave a review on websites with 1 star. Trust me, people like me takes those negative reviews very seriously, as I've had bad experiences with mental health care professionals too.
21?! FUCKING?!?! TIMES?!?!?! I feel SO sorry for you. I'm not open about being non-binary, at least not yet. I feel really uncomfortable being called ""he"", but I'm worried about coming out, ESPECIALLY after my family literally told me they don't believe in being non-binary and that it's ""not real"". I hope it gets better for you, and all the people out there who get misgendered due to ignorance and insensitivity.

Upvote for the petition to fire the idiot who somehow misgendered someone in an LGBTQ+ Safe Space for the love of A×20
That's absolutely brutal. I'm so sorry you had to go through that. I hope you find a more comfortable space.

And props to your girlfriend. She did amazing in correcting the person in power.
I'm so sorry. Like...that person could have used just your name and dropped ALL pronouns. It's no excuse to find it difficult to remember someone's pronouns. It sounds like they blatantly didn't try.

I agree that you should say something though. Or write something. Or write to the other staff members. Or ask the other youth if they've experienced something similar with that same person. Because if they have, your speaking out could help them speak out too. Best of luck.
Her difficulty with remembering OP's pronouns is in a different solar system than the difficulty OP has in living their truth and hoping someone treats them with dignity even once during the day. Or even hoping to get through a day feeling safe, depending on their circumstance. This woman should not be in a position to deal with people.
That is what I tried to say regarding the woman who is dealing with people."	c5q1zz	NonBinary	75	0.99	2019-06-26 13:50:02
I keep getting misgendered at work and I can't anymore. any tips? already have my pronouns displayed beside my name in large block letters.		"Is there anyone on your side? I find that it really helps to have someone else who can interject ""oh, it's *they*, actually."" Somehow people seem to find it more credible coming from a third party sometimes. Other than that, if your company has inclusive policies and your manager refuses to get with the program, it may be worth talking to HR to see if they can instruct your manager and direct coworkers to gender you correctly. However, HR's job is to protect the company, not you, so how successful that would be really depends.
Some more information: I get misgendered by mainly my female co-workers, my male co-workers dont gender me and only refer to me by my work name. 
I get misgendered with she/her and he/him but no one has used they/them, my actual pronouns, since I was hired in January. 

My manager said she needed ""time"" but she still misgenders me when she genders me. 

I work remotely and I have my pronouns displayed everywhere that I possibly can. 

This company likes to talk about how inclusive they are, and how everyone deserves respect, and then in the same breath someone will misgender me. 

I am convinced that I am the only enby in the company in my country.

Edit: More Information 

For those saying to contact HR that isn't really an option for me. I work in a mega global corporation  with an enormous amount of staff. HR is there to protect the company not me, especially in this situation. 

I work with the internet, specifically ads, and work with very large brands.

I do believe that I am a ""diversity hire"" since the company is pushing a narrative that they are diverse and inclusive. I also told my manager that I am nonbinary during my interview with her and another hiring manager and that my pronouns were they/them. So they have known since the start, and are just blatantly refusing at this point. 

I have no one on my side. My position was created for me and didn't exist before. When I was hired I was hired as the first team member for my group. Until very recently we were just a duo but I have a new co-worker now so we are three. New coworker hasn't misgendered me but we also haven't technically met yet since his first day was Monday. 

Even the president of my company region, whom I had a 1 on 1 with when I started, misgenders me while knowing that I use they/them. 

The only allies I feel like I have are the guys at work, not because they will say anything, but solely because they basically refuse to misgender me by not gendering me and only using my name.
I think a lot of cisgender people struggle to grasp the “they/them” pronouns. They live in a world where this isn’t an issue for them, and they don’t understand how this impacts you, sadly. Kudos to you for being who you are at work, and I hope you find a work solution but the business world pretends to care about this, but sadly we are still evolving here.
HR? Message them about pronoun sensitivity, explain with examples of how to effectively use singular they/them pronouns for the *particularly* dense. Basically tell them to send a mass email to everyone with VERY EASY instructions on how to use them, so if people still don’t get it you can just be like “refer to the email plz”
I dont know shit about NB or T but if you are trying to pass as fem, shave.

&#x200B;

if you are trying to pass as masc, fade your hair into a skin pomp.

The rest of the features will sadly sell without PS.
No one on my side. My team is actually a trio and the 3rd only started on Monday. We haven't met yet either. 

There is one co-worker who might be an ally because he asked for clarification about my work name and always seems to be respectful when referring to me. 
But my manager does not have my back for this and will not correct anyone.
You may be the only enby, but that doesn't excuse anyone misgendering you. I'm so sorry that's happening! 

If I may make a suggestion: don't try to be polite—be firm. It's not okay for your manager to ""need time"". You don't need time to use her pronouns! Whenever someone tells me ""how hard it is to use they/them"" I point out that we all use singular they/them frequently, when we don't know the person's gender. I also point out how small the effort is to use correct pronouns compared to the harm that misgendering does to you. Cis people really don't seem to think of how painful it is to be misgendered.

Half joke suggestion: start misgendering anyone who misgenders you. See how they like it!
I had the same problem awhile back even though I had pronouns on a badge no one ever took notice so I just gave up and people just call me whatever! 

Tommorow is trans and nonbinary visibility day at my work but I'm probably the only one that's aware of it!

Luckily I don't mind too much but I know it can be really frustrating or upsetting for others. Sorry I haven't got any suggestions but I hope you come up with a happier solution
HR has not been helpful. 
When I was hired I filled out a document to basically avoid all this. Gave them my pronouns, work name, and title mx (not a fan but it beats the binary ones) but they didn't bother actually using the document. 
Everything was set up in my deadname and it took me a week to get it changed and the change isn't totally done yet months later because IT didn't change everything. 
This caused: me to get locked out of my PC multiple times, sync issues with the servers, and so many calls to IT. 

We also can't send mass emails. I work in a mega global corporation that spans the globe. I won't say what it is exactly that I do but I basically stock the internet with ads (sorry) and I work with big household name brands.
Because of this a lot of our HR is centralized and honestly they care way more about protecting the company than helping the employees. 
I also work with multiple teams from multiple agencies within mega corporation. 
So short of HR sending a massive email to hundreds of thousands of people, most who wouldn't know who I am, telling them my pronouns the emailing is out.
i'm not trying to pass as masc or fem, or in general really. 
for me passing, or wanting to pass, ends up with me trying to live up to the hidden standards of others.  which i find to be quite exhausting now. 
even when i made this post what i really wanted was for my then coworkers to correctly gender me, regardless of how i presented.

fixed the problem though by quitting and finding other work that's way better for my mental health. 

i am a little confused by your last comment however. what does

Starting to get more comfortable expressing myself in the hospital. Representation is so important, and I’m fortunate to have a supportive admin. Still sucks to get misgendered all the time, but it’s also super euphoric when ppl get it right!		"Best experience so far: my attending (basically the real doctor in charge of me) messed up my pronouns a couple times in a patient room. After we left, he said that even though it takes a lot of mental energy for him to use the right pronouns, but I am worthy of that mental energy. I almost started crying in the workroom y’all! Then he promised to do better and did. I think everyone I meet from now on is going to be judged by that standard!
Good for you! This is of course so important to you, but you are also doing a great thing by being visible. I bet you have made a real difference to a lot of non binary people you have come into contact with who may not be so open as you. Here's wishing you a day with no misgendering x
Good work! I’m a resident rn. Hospitals are whatever- some are better some worse, some attending are better, some worse. But I love that doctor is gender neutral ^_^ and I can always assert that without having to have a whole talk about my gender identity."	jdp29g	NonBinary	74	1.0	2020-10-18 21:47:31
You know that moment when you get misgendered but you waited too long to correct it so now you are misgendering yourself to keep the conversation going?	And you just can't stop because you feel so wildly uncomfortable but are too scared to ruin the good vibes? Ha ha ha 😐	"Once I dead named myself when introducing myself to someone else and had to continue the entire day as the wrong name because I didn't want to get into the whole ""I'm Non-binary..."" Conversation and explain myself to probably still be misgendered and named.
Misgendering is always gonna happen, but it’s also ALWAYS  a good time to correct someone. It’s never too late, if a relationship is ruined then they don’t deserve to have it. Everyone deserves to know the real you whether they like it or not. Be strong, you have support :)
>and explain myself to probably still be misgendered and named.

This part kills me. I finally came out to everyone in my life, even at work with my email signature, and continue to be misgendered. That hurts a lot, and I'm sorry you had this experience where the comfort of others and maintaining a pleasant convo ended up with being dead named and misgendered 💔 hope you have a euphoric week!
Aw thank you! Just brightened up my whole dang mood! 😁
i did the same thing. came out to everyone at work and in my personal life, asked everyone to use they/them pronouns, everyone was very supportive with it and said they would. nobody has yet.  

on one hand, i want to start correcting people. on the other hand, i dont want people to be uncomfortable talking to me. so i kind of just let it happen."	f8962j	NonBinary	72	0.99	2020-02-23 13:02:13
“Preferred pronouns” rant	Hey y’all. At work I’m surrounded by cis people and, to make a long story short I was just wondering if anyone thinks it’s uncomfortable when people say “preferred pronouns”. I was misgendered by someone, they apologized and said “well yeah I just know that they/them are your preferred pronouns.” To me it feels like someone is implying that 1) my identity / gender identity isn’t “real” or is being invalidated in some way (if that makes sense), and 2) that this (cis) person doesn’t actually view me as trans - I’m probably just a “quirky” girl to them. I know I shouldn’t be complaining because at least they are considerate / careful about it, but still. I just wanted to see what others have to say!	"I honestly wish I could find the person who first said “preferred pronouns” so I could sock them in the face. It’s so invalidating and my pronouns are MANDATORY bc they are MY pronouns.
I think it depends on who's saying it. If people are doing their best to be supportive, they may be simply repeating language the heard somewhere, and it's probably not worth throwing in negative feedback in the moment. If someone's being a transphobe though, I'm not pulling any punches: short, simple, and to the point; it's so easy that a child can do it.

Then again, I accept any/all pronouns, and it kinda shifts around a little, so it's not that wild that I might have preferences. On the other hand, someone with exactly one set of pronouns clearly doesn't have
Imo, the only time there are preferred pronouns is when someone uses more than one type of pronoun and they like one type more than others. I use he/they, most the time i prefer he, sometimes i prefer they. But if someone called me she, and then said something about she/her not being my preferred pronoun I'd be upset. Like no, its not a pronoun i go by at all, its not a preference between she and other pronouns, she is out of the question completely. He/they ARE my pronouns. If there are no other pronouns you use besides they/them, then theyre not youre prefered pronouns, they ARE your pronouns. 

If/when they do that next time, maybe talk with them privately real quick and try to politely inform them that your pronouns aren't just a preference, they/them are the pronouns they use, and explain that referring to them as a preference implies that youre fine with others deciding whether or not to use your correct pronouns. People have preferences for food or music genres, etc, not how youre expected to correctly refer to someone.
Yeah ""preferred"" has entirely too much ""optional"" in it imo. They're just pronouns.
My pronouns are they/he. My preferred pronouns are they/them. 

People either use the term ‘preferred’ because they have multiple pronouns but prefer 1 or because it is polite enough to appease the transphobic rhetoric of “They’re shoving it down our throats and controlling our words!”. 

Fuck them, i’ll shove it up their ass if I need to. They don’t deserve the respect of politeness if they don’t respect my existence. 

Respect is a mutual give and take.

I’m never going to be rude when I correct someone but in your case OP, thats a shitty disrespectful thing they said and it was a choice. 
It’s not your preference, it is your chosen title.
“Preferred pronouns” implies that you use multiple sets of (3rd person) pronouns. If you don’t, then they aren’t preferred, they just *are*. I wouldn’t worry about these particular cis people though. I personally just like it when people care enough to correct themselves.
Imagine if a cis person were misgendered, then told that those are only ‘preferred’ pronouns and you know what is preferred but you don’t have to use ‘preferred pronouns’.
Preferred pronouns are actually mandatory, using pronouns at all isn't. If people don't want to use my pronouns, I'd be fine with being referred to solely by name. I use they/them and he/him, so it's pretty hard to get it wrong. Nobody in their right mind would she/her me if they didn't know me, and if they know me then they know that's wrong.
Depends on the person on question. If someone uses only one set of pronouns, I find it really infuriating when cis people think those pronouns are optional. No, those are their pronouns, they're mandatory. Nothing ""preferred"" about it. 
Personally, I use they/he. I don't mind he but I prefer they. That's when the the term ""preferred pronouns"" is accurate.
I agree!

I used to ask what people's preferred pronouns were and then I get more, and then I got one I preferred over the rest but still a list: I found asking ""what's your pronouns?"" and properly saying your sentence after corrected is the best way to go. 

If someone asked me what my preferred pronouns are, I would just say ""it/its"" and stare blinkly as they react.

While if someone asks me something along the lines of ""what's your pronouns?"" I'd give them the irl list.
I don't have an issue with it. I view it as a transitory thing. When the idea of someone using different pronouns than those they were assigned at birth was new, ""preferred pronouns"" was the way to address it. Just as anytime a new concept (particularly when it comes to social matters and social justice) is introduced to society, the first stab at addressing it is never the correct one. It's a step in the right direction, but it's usually a step made with the intent to offend as little of the rest of society as possible. I do think the 'preferred' part should be dropped and I do see it being dropped too, as more and more people and places become more aware of the concept.

TL/DR; I don't have a problem with 'preferred' because I think 'preferred' is going out of fashion anyways.
I will go out of my way to tell people that my pronouns aren't preferred they are mandatory. I don't put up with that shit
I think in some cases talking about 'preferred pronouns' still makes sense. Like if someone uses multiple sets of pronouns, they could have a preference for some pronouns over others.
But I agree with you, the way it is used most of the time is really bad and kind of makes using the correct pronouns seem less important.
Pronouns can be extremely emotionally triggering in every which way. This concept is so new to general society that there is no established ""polite"" or ""proper"" way to ask. I always try to keep this in mind and assume best intentions. We are surrounded by so much hate it can be hard to see things otherwise.
I know some people who use multiple pronouns and have ones they prefer over others, but I agree that for most people they are just your pronouns, not a preference, but a fact.
Oh, no. I correct people. They're not ""preferred"", they're my pronouns.
I like the phrase... I know that's an unpopular opinion. And I do respect those who would rather ""your pronouns"" be said(and get why), but know that as someone who uses multiple pronouns and previously was questioning pronouns that ""preferred"" gives room to not limit yourself to your answer. 

It also acknowledges that some people consider any pronouns used for them as ""their pronouns"" and might have a preference to those. 

So for example, while I use He/him and they/them, when someone asks what my preferred pronouns are and I say just one of them, I know that my other set is just as valid though unmentioned because I'm not currently preferring them... 

That said, the statement being *just said* to trans people makes it really ick..  

But so is any pronoun question tbh
I agree, I hate the term preferred pronouns, it makes it seem optional or up for debate. In the same way as I hate my gender being described as ""Nyx *identifies* as agender."" It implies I'm not really that gender, I just think I am, if that makes sense. (Pet peeve of mine lol).
Whenever someone asks what my preferred pronouns are I just ask them ""don't you mean CORRECT pronouns?""
Yes, among other cisn't folks I'll joke that I actually *do* have preferred pronouns in that I'll take a couple of neos preferentially but when I know cis people are just going to mess those up, I usually tell them to just use my name."	tg04bv	NonBinary	74	0.97	2022-03-17 02:48:01
Lil Uzi Vert fans are the most disgusting fan-base ever.	"If you didn't know, Uzi came out as Non-Binary about 6 months ago. 

I am a large fan of their music and am in their community.

I checked the subreddit for r/liluzivert and it's all misgendering Uzi in every comment.   


I ""call them out"" by just reminding them. They get pissed and downvote me because ""it's not real"" or whatever bs is up next. 

&#x200B;

THEY DO KNOW DAMN WELL THEY GO BY They/Them pronouns. these mfs gotta be serious.

(btw i am binary but am ally and thought this was messed up.)"	"Thanks for sticking up for them and us
Never knew Lil Uzi was nonbinary. I’ve been using he/him thinking they were cis all this time. Good to know
Most of us have been following Uzi for well over 6 years now, and so it will take time for us to adjust to using new pronouns as we've referred to them as ""him"" for 6 years. 

Uzi's announcement of shifting to they/them pronouns was well received and celebrated in the community.

Individuals who are rude and refuse to acknowledge it are assholes. They're just trying to get you upset.
well yeah uzi a goat"	10omzxz	NonBinary	71	0.95	2023-01-30 00:03:56
Not out at work yet. Constantly being misgendered by coworkers and patients and I'm trying to not let it get to me. Any other enbies in healthcare out there?		"Oh my god your hair is so curly and cute!!! Sorry about people misgendering you, that’s really rough 💛
[This is what I do at work](https://imgur.com/gallery/7owu9eA)
I’m in health care too! I have a they/them pin on my badge but still get constantly misgendered anyway 😅
i work at a school and sometimes the kids get confused by my presentation
I work in health care too but I'm too scared to wear a pronoun pin to work. I haven't told anyone at work my gender or pronouns either.
Cool!!! I hate that the first comments you see below it are all hella transphobic 😩 I really like the idea of a pronoun pin though
I never thought of a pin! I might have to look into that. I think I can accept that my patients will probably always misgender me lol but it would be nice if my coworkers knew. How did you come out to them? I'm a floor nurse in a rural hospital"	ezy44f	NonBinary	71	0.99	2020-02-06 20:06:32
CW: Misgendering. Ever since I came out as nonbinary, I've been the happiest, bc it feels right. But being around people who constantly label me as she/her, even when I correct them.. is exhausting. I feel like no matter what I do, I'll always be something else to them. No matter how I present.		"Wow, gorgeous! But seriously tho, as much as it can suck sometimes I think the best thing we can do is to embrace our power as outsiders and be the change that needs to happen. Progress is slow but just by living our truth we are making a difference!
I’m sorry🥺
Thank you so much ;\_\_; <3 I totally agree. I am usually pretty indifferent about it, and shrug it off, but todays one of those days where it's affecting me more than usual I think.
it's okay!!! <3 ;\_\_;
Yeah I feel that, I've been feelin pretty dysphoric recently, (hence all the selfies Ive been posting this sub 😅) so don't forget self-care and self-love is far more important than validation from those who wouldn't recognise a rigidly enforced gender binary if it came and slapped them across the face!
I'm sorry you've been feeling dysphoric. :/ You are so valid! And yes, self-care and self-love is so important right now, and always. <3 Thank you."	ild186	NonBinary	69	0.98	2020-09-02 18:58:44
Pregnancy Feelings	"I’m 22, identify as nonbinary, use they/them pronouns and am 28 weeks pregnant. 

Maybe I’m just looking to vent but I feel like most people who fit into their assigned genders at birth don’t understand.

I’ve always prided myself in and enjoyed androgyny. I know I don’t owe that to anyone, but becoming pregnant has seemingly ruined all of that.. I’m frequently misgendered and deadnamed and it’s killing me. I look like a pregnant woman, my stomach is round and my breasts are considerably larger.. which is seemingly harder to fit in more masculine clothing, which is what i’ve always preferred.. and ALL maternity clothes are so feminine presenting. I feel like I am so permanently trapped as being labeled a woman due to this. I want this child and I am so excited to be a parent but I feel so invalidated and dysphoric. 

I’m sad. I don’t feel happy in my body and my social presentation. My partner has been lovely, he assures me I am valid in my feelings and that I don’t owe anyone anything.. but it doesn’t mean i’m ok with  not passing as well as i used to be able to."	"Come on over to r/Seahorse_Dads ! 
I’m 25 weeks pregnant with my second kid and I feel every word of your post. You’re not alone, you’re not invisible, and I’m sorry because the situation STINKS.
That is tough! I can only imagine what you are going through, as I can't gestate life...but I did do a bunch of work in the gym before my egg cracked and now I feel like I made myself less androgynous right before I accepted that I didn't want to look like a man anymore.

I keep reminding myself that gender doesn't look like anything, and that our presentation should be for us, not for others. Then I get misgendered, and it feels much less straightforward. I guess, in the end I feel like society is wrong, and there's nothing I can do to unfuck that. I will be harmed by their views, including the internalized transphobia that I learned as a child.
Hey, I'm sorry to hear this. As for the presentation - maybe try getting larger shirts? I know it's not much, but something to look into maybe?  
In either case, stay strong, you'll get through this! Everything comes to an end eventually! <3
I understand you very well. My kiddo is two and a half now, and when I was pregnant I just lost all sense of self and who I was. I didn’t recognise myself anymore. I love my child more than anything but somedays I do feel like I gave up a part of myself. I know I’ll never choose to be pregnant again and if we want a second child we’ll adopt.
As a enby who just had a baby, I found men’s shirts to be way better fitting and more comfortable than maternity clothing. I bought tshirts in several sizes larger than I got pre-pregnancy (S —> XL) and it worked out great.  

The other thing that was really helpful was my whole care team knew I was nb and supported and respected me. Everyone along the way (and all the folks at the hospital) asked me what titles (mom/dad/other) I wanted to use and used my pronouns.
I feel for you. Gender stereotypes are awful. But keep in mind that men can get pregnant. And so can enbies. Being pregnant doesn't mean you're a woman. You have every right to seek out clothing that best expresses your gender and wear it with pride. The only way to break the stereotypes is by expressing our gender identity and sexuality with pride, and advocating for equality

solidarity, comrade
I am so sorry you've been made to feel like this. Kudos to your partner for validating your feelings and being there for you! I wish there was a clothing line for pregnant non-binary people that don't wish to present as feminine. 

Someone needs to make clothes for pregnant non-binary folks!
I felt this post so hard. I spent my whole pregnancy wanting to climb out of my own skin. It was awful and beyond awful. But for whatever it’s worth, it IS survivable. And at the end you get a baby, which is also hard but also pretty rad. I’d do it over again to get kiddo here, hands down. Thinking about having the baby here in my arms and not occupying my body anymore was what got me through it. But you are super not alone in this feeling. 

*suckiest solidarity fistbump*
That does sound like a very tough spot to be in. I never thought about maternity clothes being feminine, because every pregnant person I've met has been feminine so it fit pretty well.
I hope it'll be okay if you keep thinking about your baby and how great that's gonna be. c:
I feel like as far as trans acceptance has come, the idea that not only women can bear children is going to take a bit longer for society to get. Push the envelope, you know we all love you for it!"	zotmls	NonBinary	70	0.94	2022-12-18 08:15:25
Gender affirmation	Cool thing at work. A member of the Women’s Employee Resource group at work is organizing a luncheon at a satellite site to celebrate upcoming International Women’s Day. She called my boss to ask if it was ok to invite the women at my site to join the fun. My boss told her it was fine to invite the two women I work with but to be very respectful of me as I was enby and thus I might be uncomfortable being grouped with the women. He then checked with me to see if I was ok with his answer. I LOVE my boss. In 35 years of working I’ve never had such a supportive boss who respects me for who I am, never misgenders me and always uses my correct pronouns (ze/zim).	"My marketing department recently reached out to the ""women"" in my company for interviews for our social medias celebrating women in construction. I am out to my local branch, but word has not reached upper management in other cities.

When I explained that I am non-binary and asked if we could to a Trans Day of Visibility interview instead, she apologized for the gender mix-up and said she'd ""be honored"" to do trans representation at the end of the month.

It's so affirming to have a company that so readily accepts my gender identity. I feel you there.
That’s great! Thanks for sharing, this put a smile on my face.
That's amazing! Your boss sounds awesome! <3
That's great! Based boss"	11h0ei1	NonBinary	69	0.98	2023-03-03 13:10:36
I regret coming out to my parents	"I came out to my parents as someone without gender about a year and a half ago. They have strong religious beliefs that contradict that, so I've always tried to make it clear that I didn't expect them to change their beliefs. I just wanted them to use They/Them pronouns for me. 

They have never used the correct pronouns. Around 6 months after I came out, I sent them a message to tell them it upset me that they still hadn't once used my correct pronouns. I asked them if I could correct them and they said yes. But I felt very awkward doing so, so I stopped correcting them for a time. 

Yesterday, I had a talk with them. I said I wanted to talk to them about them misgendering me. Before I could even say anything my Mum started shouting, aggressively saying that she ""doesn't get it"" and that ""she's trying"". I reiterated my discomfort to them about using incorrect pronouns. I told them that I'm going to be a lot more consistent about correcting them. 

They said such horrid things. My Dad kept asking why this is ""such a big deal"" and why I was ""making this so dramatic"". When in reality, I imagined sitting them down, saying what needed to be said and moving on. I didn't want it to be dramatic. He said that I was ""disrespecting their beliefs"" and ""forcing them to change"". 

My Mum told me that she'd ""read about the sort of people who say things like cis gender"" and that she pretty much believes cis gender to be a slur. I explained the meaning of cis gender, she understands the meaning. But she said she doesn't like the sort of people who say that word. I said ""people like me?"" she said of course not, the people at large who say it. This of course means LGTBQ+ people and allies. Which basically means she is not ready or willing to be an ally.
 
I said the phrase ""come out"" and my Mum said ""What do you mean 'come out' your not GAY are you?!"" as if me being queer would be the absolute worst thing in the world. I am a  closeted pansexual to them (not closeted to anyone else) so you can imagine how this made me feel. 

They said ""we're just never going to get it."" which of course means that they're never even going to try, even though they keep saying ""we're trying"". 

It was just awful. I don't get why it's so hard to accept their child. To just respect me. To care about me. It's so confusing as well because up until this point, they've been such amazing parents, honestly the best parents someone could ask for. Which means that their caring for me had small print attached ""I'll care for you but only if you're cis and straight."". 

It's honestly making me want to say to them ""right, I can't do this anymore. Just call me she/her. I'm sick and tired of it."". I regret coming out to them so much. It's completely ruined our relationship in a way that I don't know if we'll ever be the way we once were. 

It also makes me scared for my child, who we know as our daughter unless she says otherwise. What if she's trans? Or queer? Or non binary? I said this to them and my Mum aggressively said ""let's just not go there"". Which was scary and horrible to hear."	"Kind of a random thought for me to attach to here, but does any religion actually say anything explicitly against being non-binary or just trans in general?
Okay so first I’m so sorry that this is happening. Second if your parents wouldn’t have accepted you in what they view as a same sex relationship then personally I don’t view them as good parents. Anyone who puts conditions on their love is not a good parent. My best friend is trans and comes from a big Mormon family and they have accepted her despite their religion so this is an excuse and a crutch not to change. You have explained how this hurts and upsets you and still they have not tried to change despite saying they are. I am glad they don’t visit often so you don’t have to deal with it super often. Sometimes in situations like this an ultimatum is necessary letting them know either you accept me and try because that’s all you’re asking for or you will go no contact. They won’t see you or their grandchild anymore without trying. This is only a suggestion and obviously it’s your choice. The other suggestion is having family counseling with them.
How old are you? Do you have many years left in their house? Do you intend on attending college/university? 
Sometimes it is best to find the emotional support you need outside your relationship with your parents until you can be financially independent.
This is a complex and rough situation. I’m really sorry you’re going through this.

I do feel for you a lot but I’m trying to understand where both sides are coming from. You’re frustrated that your parents can’t do something really simple for you, address you by they/them pronouns (something that I agree is really really simple in the grand scheme of things), but I really hope you consider that for your parents it’s probably not as simple as it is for us. The idea of a non-binary gender identity and using gender neutral pronouns is likely not something they were raised with a very good understanding of, and if they’re particularly older which it sounds like they might be it might be the all the more difficult for them to adjust to.

Honestly I’ve read through your post three times now and it seems like your parents do really care about you. I think the shouting and aggressiveness is unnecessarily cruel but everything your parents have said indicate to me that they are really trying to understand you and are frustrated that they can’t.

I think you guys need much clearer communication. Something that stuck out to me is the things your dad said about making this a bigger deal than it is. You and I both know how important pronouns are and how crushing it is when we’re misgendered. But to your dad that crushing feeling is probably something he can’t even wrap his head around  since it’s something he’s likely never even experienced. That’s why to you this is extremely important but all he sees is you making a big deal out of nothing. So, bridge that gap, if you can. Don’t just ask him to use your pronouns, explain why it’s so necessary that he does.

For me personally, I remember my mom had a lot of trouble understanding why being misgendered was so terrible for me. I told her that every time somebody called me she/her it felt like being shot in the chest. I opened up to her about the pain. I was brutally honest. And no (good) parent wants to see their child in pain. So that changed things for her. It might be hard but maybe what your parents need is some brutal honesty from you about your experience being non-binary.

This is a really shitty situation no doubt and if your parents don’t want to change that’s 100% on them. But from what you’ve said about them I think your parents do really care about you, which means there’s some hope there. Keep trying, and try to see things from their point of view. That might help get things across. Good luck.
The religion that theu are a part of, and that I used to be a part of is The Church Of Jesus Christ Of Latter-Day Saints, more commonly known as Mormonsim. It doesn't explicitly say anything about there not being other gender identities. But it does talk about gender being sacred, and gender being very important to one's spiritual identity. Also, members are called ""brother [last name]"" or ""sister [last name]"". On Sunday, the men and women are seperated out into different lessons etc etc.
Patriarchal religions require a gender binary in order to maintain their power structures. That's why they hate anyone who doesn't conform.
Thank you so much, it's nice to be defended! I've thought about cutting them off, it may have to come to that eventually but I hope not.
I'm lucky in that I'm 27 and not living with them any more. They come up about 4-5 times a year to see me, my partner and our child. I asked them if that makes it difficult to remember, but they said it's ""constantly on their minds"".
Thank you for that! I have been brutally honest to them in the past. In this talk, I told them that it's hard for me to feel respected and cared about when they misgender me. I told them that it puts me on edge when they come to visit, and that I have bad sleep when they're here.

My parents made it quite clear that they hated having this conversation, it's made me scared to ever open up about it again :S
I feel that a lot of transphobia and homophobia within religions seems to always be based on some vague ideas that are ingrained into the community without it actually being directly based on anything explicitly written down.

Like for them the justification of their hated is just assumed to be this really obvious thing, but as an outsider who wants to point out why they are wrong, I can't pin down this vague feeling that the religious have against us. It just seems like hatred for hatred’s sake, and being part of a community that repeats this idea that no one has ever thought to question. Then again, a lot of aspects of religion are like that, where no one really questions anything.
If their religion explicitly says gender is ""sacred"" and ""very important to one's spiritual identity"" then they should understand how important it's to you and how they should respect your indeed very important gender identity even when it doesn't fit neatly into the gender binary.
I grew up Mormon (or a member of the church fi Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints) It’s *very* binary about everything, especially gender. It’s so binary that I used to be really angry whenever people at church talked about gender/sex at birth and that your gender is sacred (there’s no difference between asab and gender in this religion). I couldn’t really understand or tell people why it made me so angry but later realized that maybe it was because I had no words to describe that maybe I wasn’t quite one gender all the way. Or that I was one sometimes but not other times (I’m some sort of genderqueer/fluid I think. 

Tl;Dr I grew up Mormon and it is *very* binary. You’re either a man or a woman based off of what genitals you were born with and you’re being tempted by satan if you ever think differently
Oh phew. I’m glad you’re not a kid living in their home anymore. 

But I totally get you on the emotional part. It’s huge not being accepted exactly as your truest, most beautiful self. And totally normal to have all those feelings of abandonment, of not being heard by the two people you count on the most in many ways. 

I’m so sorry OP. I hope the passage of time helps. Sometimes the threat of not seeing the grandkids can do the job. Hate to say it, but also you don’t want to be mis gendered in front of your kids. That’s the type of bad stuff I work hard to make sure doesn’t touch mine as much as possible.
I’m really sorry to hear that. I sincerely hope things improve. No matter what you deserve to be respected and you really shouldn’t tolerate anything less from your parents or anyone.
The quote from a very important piece of religious doctrine: ""Gender is an essential characteristic of individual premortal, mortal, and eternal identity and purpose."" so yeah, you'd think that they'd see why it's important wouldn't you? 🙄 But I guess, I don't have a gender, so maybe that's why it's so upsetting...?
Nice to see another Mormon on here! I hope you have a good situation where you are :)
Yeah, I'm really glad that I'm not living with them any more! Thanks, it's really comforting reading your message :)
If you're NB you have a gender, unless you explicitly identify as agender.
I no longer consider myself a member, but thank you! I hope things get better with you and your family!
Yep, I don't like labels, but agender describes me accurately :)
Yeah, I've not considered myself a menver for about 2.5 years now :) I more meant someone who was raised Mormon 😅 thank you 😊
No worries! It’s also nice to see someone on here who has kinda the same background!"	122ecyi	NonBinary	66	0.99	2023-03-26 07:20:42
Misgendered... by my mother.	"I'm nonbinary (born AFAB, they/them pronouns). I came out and I I had to explain literally everything.

I always thought my mother was supportive, she always asked more about the community, to try and be a better ally. But today she blurted out, ""you ***ARE*** a woman"". I've previously explained the pain and dysphoria deadnaming and misgendering do. And she still said it.

It cut me like a knife, and I don't know what to do.

For some more context, she was talking about ""specifically in the eyes of healthcare"", but it just shows she lacks the knowledge that trans-healthcare is a thing, or fully understands that people ***who are not women***, may have a vagina or a uterus.

I feel like I should be mad at her.

But instead I'm just I'm so disgusted with myself, I've never been so fully reviled by myself before. I hate my own mind. I hate my body. I hate myself. I don't even want to keep breathing. I can't speak up or say anything, my mother is proud and won't admit she's done any wrongdoing, she's already gone back to acting like she hasn't said anything wrong, because in her eyes she hasn't.

That's it, I just needed to blow, thanks for reading.

&#x200B;

EDIT: Thanks for the support, everybody. I decided I need to have a long discussion with my mother, and how she phrased her words. I think she understood the impact her of words, and how it affected me. She said she still can't fully understand what I feel inside, and I don't expect her to be able to, but she apologized to me for what she said, and how she said it, as well as how it made me feel. Thanks again everybody, for the support. <3"	"Oh my god. I'm sorry you went through this. This is an unacceptable way to treat someone who's trans / non binary. I am going through my own tough time as well, my own family or rather whatever small contact I had left with them evaporated.

They didn't accept my coming out. They outright rejected it. I was told that I'm mentally sick, that non binary isn't a thing. That I should get a therapist to stop not conforming to my assigned gender at birth.

And yeah, it hurts like hell.

If you want to talk, my dm's are open.
This sounds like a really unpleasant situation, to say the least. I'm sorry you had to go through that. You are valid and your feelings are valid and even though it may not feel like it right now you matter; you mean something.
Is your mother your doctor, or your health insurance? If so, her opinion on your medical care and situation doesn't matter. Feel free to tell her so.

non binary in queer spaces and people still don't get it.	"I got my a new legal name as of two weeks ago and haven't gotten new credit cards and stuff yet.

I am really into the local queer scene in my city but I feel like there is still a lot of underlying transphobia I get misnamed and mispronounced a lot and people seem to think they just know from looking at me but I feel like being nonbinary isn't a look really. I feel pretty androgynous at this point and get mistaken for different genders on occasion depending on how masc or femme I present for the day but I usually opt for close to androgenous.

It sing at a gay karaoke bar and when people do misgender me I try to correct them but then again some people still don't get it. it sucks cause it's a so called and self stated safe space but sometimes I feel less then safe especially because I have been a victim of predator behavior in the past so a lot of anxiety tends to follow when I feel unsafe.

I feel the silver lining is there are some wonderful people I have met who are enby and I feel like I am at a point where I present in a way that just feels right to me. I might also go to an enby meet up that is hosted at a coffee shop.

anyone else experience transphobia in their smaller queer communities?"	"Yeah, I gave up on my local youth queer community because they kept misgendering me. It was really nothing but cis lesbians there and a few asexual cis women, so I just gave up and left.
In my experience there’s (unfortunately) a distinction between gay spaces and queer spaces. Gay spaces can be really male-oriented and exclusionary, where truly queer spaces are a safe place for femme, queer, and trans people. Just look at the controversy with rupaul as an example of a gay space. So I guess my question is how queer are these spaces actually? Most cities are gonna have both, so if you don’t feel comfortable I would dig deeper into the scene. 
ENBY here! (They/ Them/ Theirs)

Trans/ ENBY folks will unfortunately always come across transphobia. Try grouping the awesome folks you are already emotionally invested in and create a group. Rent a karaoke room in the city, some have amazing day prices. See some queer art together. Build each other up. Uplift one another, especially when you have an understanding of what life will be like when everyone goes home.

If OP corrects them and they still do it, that's transphobia.
Old habits die hard. I still misgender myself and refer to the “2 genders” despite identifying as NB for several years."	82k35c	NonBinary	66	0.98	2018-03-07 00:31:48
got a lot of gross comments and misgendered a lot at work today so i felt like i had to do this		"*nervous in colorblind*
Well, you’re probably a very handsome darling bro of a nonbinary person, so I hope you get the respect and kindness you deserve, dude!
has u got one without the colours on it?
Is kid a gendered term?
I’m really happy I found this, I’ve been looking for terms to refer to myself as. Thank you!
omg i’m so sorry
thank you so much 😊
on the second pic
I'm guessing it's included as a neutral equivalent to boy/girl. So instead of ""That's my boy/girl!"", asking for ""That's my kid/child!"".

That said, I've not heard of anyone that isn't basically a parent referring to their child use kid or child towards an adult. Unlike girl and boy. And there's no daughter/son options.
i’m not really sure tbh, i don’t feel like it is and found it weird it was included fr.
At least the reason why I'm nervous is bc I don't wanna misgender you! Hope they have the same attitude :)
i appreciate it a lot :) my pronouns are they/them he/him.
Mine too, nice to meet ya :)
you too :D"	sgodui	NonBinary	70	0.97	2022-01-31 01:16:55
Thought my mom was starting to respect my identity but I was wrong	"My mom always writes a birthday message on my Facebook wall. She writes something like ""happy birthday to my beautiful daughter"" but then last year so changed it to child (mind you I've been out to her for about 2 years at that time and this was the first time she actually  made an effort, shes been misgendering and deadnaming me for years). Still, today I woke up and realized she called me her daughter on her birthday post. It just feels really shitty to get misgendered on your birthday, it feels like she doesn't care"	"I like listening to the Savage Lovecast; his advice often centres around presence being a present for queer people. If you no longer live with your parents and don’t depend on them, then you have the option of withdrawing your presence from their lives if they hurt you. They can be mad about it but you don’t have to answer their calls, or have any contact at all unless they honour your wishes and respect you. 

You certainly don’t have to be friends with your mother on facebook anymore.
I am sorry we all deserve respectful parents. If it is still your birthday.  I will wish you a happy birthday. You are a wonderful person.
I don’t know anyone who would feel listened to or cared for in that situation. All you can do is your best to get through the day, other nonbinary people all over have solidarity for you in this exact situation, but I’m sorry it happened at all.
I feel you.

One year my sister made a post in reference to sister's day and tagged her best friend. I'm like oh she finally gets it! 

Yeah, nope, she came to visit me and called me she/her pronouns the entire time. 

I'm sorry that you're going through this with your mom. I don't have any advice but I understand how much that can hurt.
Sorry
im sorry. Happy birthday tho!
Happy birthday! I’m so sorry that your mom isn’t respecting you. I can’t do much but I can send you a big virtual hug. 🥰"	128frtk	NonBinary	66	0.95	2023-04-01 08:24:28
Kinda upset with my therapist. CW for intentional misgendering.	"(Keep in mind the reasons I’m going to therapy are unrelated to my gender & sexuality).

My therapist knows that I’m a demigirl, I even taught her what it was because she didn’t know (which is fair ofc). And one time she handed to me a test and it asked for birthday, name, age all that and I remember I got really happy because it had a space for me to put my pronouns, so I did that. She knows my pronouns and still continues to misgender me, and it’s confusing because she seems to be very supportive. The other day she almost gendered me correctly but then she went back and “corrected” herself, and I know that’s cause I refer to myself the right way. 

It just feels weird that she is supposed to be a pillar of support that will help me change but can’t even get past my pronouns.

TL;DR: therapist knows ab my pronouns & still misgenders me."	"You apparently have a really really terrible therapist.
Therapy is a two-way street. Ask her why she's doing that.
find a different therapist. and if you’re in a safe state/country, report her. (if not just get away from her)
I would definitely ask her why she’s doing that. Cause why tf is she doing that.
I'd say first off ask her directly to call you by the correct ones. Then if they still refuse I'd say see if you can request a different therapist at the place (depending on place of course) or try to find a new location
Yeah no ditch that little PHDed shit. 

Ok but seriously, please find another therapist who will respect you for who you are without putting up  any of this bullshit. 

You deserve that
Sounds like a terrible therapist. You deserve better! ❤️
Dump that therapist.
I see a lot of comments in similar positioning, granted, I'd be a lot more confrontational. I'd bring up that it makes you feel worse and hurts you mentally, when you've come there for help and therapy, not the same noise you've encountered (I'd imagine you've been misgendered before and outside the office of this therapist) outside the supposed safe place of the office. 

That's just me. I'm very confrontational with things that will agitate me when I'm supposed to have something be a way, or it be a certain way and someone is intentionally undermining it. Purposeful or not, I go after it whole ham. 

But, I do feel for you. Stay safe and best of luck. If your not confrontational, try another way you see fit to settle the dispute. Since your therapist sounds like an POS.
Well tbh, our country (US) has shit standards for gender-based training in psychology. And when I say shit standards, I mean there are no standards. There is no requirement for any licensed therapist, psychologist or psychiatrist to train in the subject of gender. Assuming you're also in the US or a country with similar non-standards, you can expect much of the same from any therapist that isn't specialized in gender issues. It likely doesn't come from a place of malice but rather habits from daily life. They probably have no professional training on dealing with us, and as much as they want to be supportive, they just don't have that built-in ""What are this person's pronouns"" kind of social instinct that we gain by being part of the community.
It shouldn't matter if you are in therapy for gender and sexuality or not. I am in therapy because of lots of things, the big thing being my autism and trying to communicate with people that isn't biting. 

I suggest you tell your therapist about how misgendering is hurtful. After all issues with gender and sexuality can fuel into other disorders like dysphoria, stress, emotional fatigue, etc.

Mind you I taught my therapist about nonbinary. And she often calls me she, but since I use all pronouns except IT, she also has fun with it, and tends to go pronoun wild on her notes. SO much so her superiors now know what nonbinary is.

If you don't want to change therapists which let's face it is hard to do. I say play a bit hard ball and just misgender her.  works for me every time.
Fwiw, I’ve had MUCH better experiences with therapists licensed through social work (LISW) vs psychology (PhD)

That’s speaking as both a patient and someone who once started pursuing it as a career, the emphasis on cultural competency is so much better in social work"	129s0mk	NonBinary	68	0.97	2023-04-02 17:32:55
Transitioning in a binary way while not being binary?	Does it feel like you're always going to be in gender limbo? because that's how I feel. I'm taking T to minimally get masc features but also because that's really the only other way to not have to deal with being gendered as a woman. On the other side, it feels equally off being perceived as a man. there really is no true way to perceived as neither but feel it's impossible to do so both socially and medically. would you rather be perceived as another binary gender even of it doesn't fit you just because it stings less than being seen as your birth sex? at this point I stopped caring at being misgendered and just go along with whatever others see me as. I'm afraid of having to out myself and don't like dealing with confrontation. its mentally exhausting but I feel like it's really all I can do at the moment	"I’ve been on low dose T for 8 months and it’s a constant gender limbo. I’m gendered differently in every interaction, I’m a waiter and guests at the same table with hit me with conflicting pronouns in the one conversation. I thought the ambiguity would result in less ‘gendering’, now it’s a constant whiplash of being placed in a different binary person to person.
With low dose, you will eventually traverse further towards a binary male appearance. And for me, I’m starting to see that as more authentic for me than being read as a woman. Happy to be frequently be getting “he” than exclusively “she”.
I'm the same when it comes to just going along with what other people assume. I find the anxiety and awkwardness of having people be confused or ask questions too much. I hate that aspect of being non-passing: having a target on my back

For me, getting gendered the opposite of my AGAB feels just as dysphoric as getting gendered as my AGAB. Especially as I've been hormonally transitioned for almost 5 years, getting gendered either male or female causes the same feelings. All aspects of my transition were distinctly non-binary, not binary

For me, I've had to / am still working on making peace with the fact that I will never get the social transition I want. I will always be misgendered and feelings of gender affirmation are almost absent. Luckily, my medical transition wasn't for that - it was to alleviate physical dysphoria. So although it was no improvement socially, it saved my life by correcting some aspects of my sex
I've been on T for 20 months and I've had to our peace with the fact that a lot of the time, people will try to gender you. I get sir most often at work but there are those really good days, usually when I bother with eyeliner, when people generally aren't sure or stumble when trying to address me. Those little panic face journeys make the gendered stuff worth it
Now don't quote me on this, I have not done any research into this because it's not my transition plan. But I think micro dosing T can make you have more ""masculine"" features without it being obvious or making people think you are a man (androgynous) but really just doing whatever your comfortable with is key. Personally I'm going to basically transition as if i was ftm ( - the bottom surgery) I will legally change all my gender marker's to male (even though my State does have x as an option on licences) I choose to do that because it will fit most with what I am in my head. And how I would like people to see me. Yes I wish people wouldn't assume I was automatically one or the other but if I had to it hurts more to be seen as a woman than a man
Yeah but I believe at time goes on enby options will grow. Agender and salmacian have transition options now. I feel as time goes on more enby subgroup will get medical options.
I get you completely. My approaching the due date for my next T injection but I’m a little scared cause the last two injections have left me feeling weirdly dysphoric in a “too masculine” way which is extremely weird when I spent much of my early life plagued by “too feminine” dysphoria. But I’m a little scared to ask about lowering the dose cause I don’t know what the consequences of that would be.
Im at a point where strangers gender me as he or she pretty evenly. 

Im p content w that tbh. Still misgendering but its largely not a thing to use they until *knowing* someones pronouns in broader society. I only rlly care if i *do* tell some and they *keep* misgendering me.
So I have always wanted „a male body“. I thought of myself as a boy for my entire childhood. So it was only natural to transition when I realized that it‘s actually a thing I could do. 

I only later had more time to think about gender and find mine. 

I am fine with being perceived as male. Since it is the body form that I find to be the right one for me. In my mind gender doesn‘t actually exists. Hormones and genes define how you look and society decides to do their weird thing about gendering and shit. 

What I will say, is that due to society‘s deep underlying misogyny, it is far easier to get around unnoticed while being perceived as a man. Since I‘ve gotten my first changes from T, not a single soul has made a stupid comment about what they assumed my gender or sexuality had to be, solely based on my presentation. (Back when I used to answer with „girl“ on the typical question, every single person commented with „oh, so you‘re a lesbian then. Right?“. Bish, I’m asexual and you‘re an ignorant asshole)

I can even wear a skirt an make up and no one says anything about it. Idk if this is helpful for you, or just makes you cringe more in seeing how misogynistic society still is
The way I’ve been going about it is just dress as a Jojo (-‘s bizarre adventures) character, as wild and colorful (or colorless) as you can, stick to what you know as your personal style but vamp it up. Form fitting is okay on legs and arms, as I feel it makes you look buff, other than that something loose but in a draping way not like a big hoodie way. Also see Stevonnie from Steven Universe, excellently gender-neutral but slim fitting design!!!! I hate to say it but the stranger you look, the less people will even think about what’s going on under the clothes and the more they will just think you’re cool (or weird, which is arguably more fun)
Love, a fem-presenting person
I still generally am read as a woman 99% of the time. but there are moments where I'll be sir'd based off my appearance or voice lol. sometimes I embrace the confusion and others it just comes off as annoying, especially if they flip-flop around while talking to me. really at that point I'd prefer they just continue referring to me as what they assumed first
Generally, microdosing T just makes your changes slower, not make you androgynous. You are still expected to get all the same changes from a microdose as you would from a full dose of testosterone.

For a lot of non binary people, the appeal to microdosing hormones is to use for a period of time and discontinue once they have the permanent changes they want. Another thing would be taking a DHT blocker alongside hormones to prevent or minimize specific changes like hair loss, body/facial hair growth, and bottom growth. You can do both those things on a full dose also, a microdose may just be more ideal to ease into those changes and determine a 'stopping' point.

There is no way to know what changes someone will get from hormones, microdose or not. Some people will be on a full dose of T for years and look androgynous, some will microdose for 6 months and completely pass as male.
true but those are mainly dealing with genitalia. I don't know if it'll actually ever be physically possible to be perceived as genuinely ""genderless"". the closest to that is androgny and that may not always be everyone's goal."	126auop	NonBinary	66	0.99	2023-03-30 03:58:55
Working in my least favorite area at my job, ready to be misgendered. But atleast I got my nose pierced 🤷		"I’m so sorry that happens. I hope it gets better for you soon.

How do I stop accidentally misgendering people/friends??	" So recently I have made this friend and they go by they/them but I keep accidentally misgendering them in real life even though when we first started the friendship we established our pronouns. So I'm not fully understanding why my brain keeps misgendering them even though I already know what their pronouns are and I feel like shit when I do!

I'm really not sure because I've been trying to recently get out of that mindset of she/her and only he/him since I have realized a long time ago that really impacts someone especially since now that I go by they/them and he/him.

Is there any way I can train my mind to start using they/them without thinking about it?? I really don't want to make people feel bad because I'm using the wrong pronouns. Or any methods on training my mind to use they/them?"	"The easiest way to not misgender someons is by habit. Just don't make a big deal if you accidentally use the wrong one, apologize and thats that. You'll get used to it in no time if you don't pressure youself too much,that'd only slow things
Hey! It's great that you've realised that this is something you want to work on :) Firstly, the best thing you can do is simply practice. Have conversations about this friend where you are consciously using they/them pronouns. If you make a mistake, simply re-say the sentence with the right pronouns. (If you live alone, try talking about them to your cat/plant/wall - I know it's a bit silly but it works). Try to do this regularly, even if it's something as short as ""I haven't spoken to X today, I wonder what they are up to?"".
The second thing you can start doing is using they/them for strangers who haven't shared their pronouns.  Obviously once someone has told you their pronouns (or has their pronouns visible) you should use their specific pronouns but it's a good habit to use they/them for strangers. This can be when talking about strangers when you are out with friends (""The waiter said they would be back in five minutes"", ""We could ask that person over there for directions, they might know the way"") or even when you are just thinking about them. 
I know that's a lot to read but it's two simple changes to make! After a bit of practice, it won't take any concentration or effort. Good luck!
(Edit: spelling)
A lot of people discussed practice but you gotta do it OUT LOUD. When you’re going about your daily tasks, practice, out loud! 

Depending on how close you are with this friend, you may also say “hey I’ve fucked this up a bunch. It’s not ok. I’m actively working to fix it as quickly as I can, because you’re important to me and i know using your correct pronouns is a big part of showing you that.”
Every time you misgender them, repeat the sentence you said with the CORRECT pronoun at least ten times in your head. You can do this every time you misgender them silently while just thinking about them too. Trust me it will help. Repetition helps.
It has helped me to tune in to the gender  euphoria when I gender someone correctly. I have an nb kid (8) in my life that had a hard time getting their parents fully on board with pronouns… but after I used their pronouns a bunch, the parents started using them, too. They were so ecstatic that it feels like something awesome I can do for them. Once it was clear that everyone respected their wishes, the misgender slips seemed to disturb them less. 

It’s kind of like when they say “don’t think about an elephant, and that’s all you think about, vs simply directing your attention to another topic.
Think of them as a swarm of kitty cats in a trench coat.
A good mental training exercise for this specific problem is challenging yourself to use they/them pronouns when talking about strangers. This gets you into the habit of breaking with the decades of socially ingrained learning that pronouns are determined by bodily features or your perception of their gender expression. 

&#x200B;

Now. I need to say. Use your judgement. Quite a few people perform gender expression with the intention of communicating their gender to you. Breaking the connection of body + gender expression = pronouns repeatedly just gives you a new tool to approach others more respectfully (being able to 'see' someone in different pronouns, no matter how they look to you), but that doesn't mean using they/them pronouns when talking to strangers is always the right tool to approach others in all social situations. 

For example: a woman puts together a gender presentation to go out in public, and you see this woman in public. This woman has noticeable boobs with clothes that show them off, long hair, a full face of makeup, and feminine clothing, this person knows that people who share those traits are typically called ""she"". You may or may not know this, but this woman is transgender. Regardless of whether this woman is a binary woman, or uses she/her pronouns, this woman is going to expect to be she/her-ed by you and will know how to tell you whether those pronouns are correct or not (if the situation warrants it). It's your responsibility to be capable of respecting this woman's wishes, no matter what they are once you've talked about it.

It's not wrong to use she/her pronouns, at first, for a person who clearly goes to great lengths to fit into feminine gender roles (or he/him pronouns for masculinity). But you should test that you *can* fluently use different pronouns for this woman before you speak because you *don't* *know for a fact* that she/her are the right pronouns until you two talk to each other about it.

&#x200B;

So what does this all mean?

I think about a stranger I see in public, regardless of body + gender presentation, I think about them using they/them pronouns. Good practice.

I'm talking about a stranger I saw in public to my friends, regardless of body + gender presentation, I use they/them pronouns and non-gendered language or I practice how to talk without using pronouns (this is harder and a little bit awkward at first but an incredibly useful skill) to refer to the stranger. Good practice.

I'm talking to a stranger, first I listen to what pronouns other people who know them use, and mirror that language. If no one who knows the stranger uses pronouns for the stranger, I do my best to avoid pronouns altogether, but I might make a judgement call based on gender presentation if it is very clearly being communicated. If later in the conversation, someone who knows the stranger uses different pronouns, or the stranger refers to themself in the third person with pronouns, (whoops!) to I switch to those pronouns without bringing it up. Still generally respectful, good practice.

If I have reason to believe that I might be getting to know this stranger, I might introduce myself with my own pronouns, if the stranger doesn't offer pronouns back, its safe to bet they want me to go with what their gender presentation is communicating. Respectful, and good practice.
Make sure you think of them with the correct pronouns, when you are thinking of them. If you use the wrong pronoun in your head, go back and correct it. By doing this, it will come more naturally when you are speaking. 

You can also practice just using their name in lieu of a pronoun (also acceptable).
Practice using your friends pronouns. And yeah practicing speaking out loud does help. 

Here is a website that you can use to practice someone’s pronouns [pronouns practice website](https://www.minus18.org.au/pronouns/)
The thing is your brain is used to call feminine people she and masculine people he. If you want to use the correct pronouns naturally you need to force your brain to see your friend as nb which is even more difficult than for a binary trans person because there is no such thing as non binary presenting and because your brain isn’t used to use they/them pronouns for one person specifically.
Practise and correct yourself. I misgender *myself* all the time and I have to work on it.
Try writing a story with a non binary character. Doesn’t have to be a serious or cohesive story, just write with they/them pronounce.
I have a whole bunch of people in my contacts with their correct pronouns. So every time I text then I mentally connect the name to the right pronouns. I have some trans friends for who it was really easy to switch my speach and some for which it wasn't as easy. I've only slipped up one time since I started doing that. Even tho before I constantly has to catch my self right before misspeaking. 

Note: I don't just put the trans people with pronouns I started going that for everybody. Also nice if you send someone contact info. (I inadvertently taught someone that a mutual friend uses all pronouns not just he, the mutual friend didn't mind)
Hey! What I do to get use quickly to new pronouns or new name is: every time that I think about them, I repeat in my head some sentences like ""Paul loves pasta, they're a person who I meet when they were 11, ..."" (my example isn't about a real person). Repeat until it sounds natural. I think it's very important to think correctly in your head because at this point you'll hardly do mistake orally. 

When I do that I get use to the new gender in few days, but no stress, everyone needs time and as soon as you do efforts and care about it, this is wonderful (not like my parents who know for 2years that I use they/them pronouns but NEVER tried to use it and keep saying that's it too difficult)

Edit: And it IS difficult to get use to neutral language because it's like learning a new way to speak, that you never spoke in your entire life. It's a little bit longer but as soon as it's done it'll be easier for every non binary (who use they/them) that you meet!
Maybe this is a weird answer but I've honestly found it helpful to just talk slower. Try to be intentional about every word that comes out of my mouth. Pausing in the middle of a sentence to find the right word is okay! It can even make you seem more mindful/intelligent.
i've seen some other people suggest this, but what helped me get used to it (and actually can help your nonbinary friends feel more comfortable!) is using they/them for people in general. it's a nongendered singular pronoun, it doesn't only apply to nonbinary people. if i'm telling a story about one of my friends to someone, even if that person is a cis woman that uses she/her, i can say ""they picked me up and we went out for lunch."" that's totally normal and no one will think about it, but it's a great way to get adjusted to naturally switching to they/them for people who only use they/them. and if you use singular they to talk about anybody, that means you're not singling any of your nonbinary friends out as much.
Just repeat [name] they a lot 

So that your brain auto associates they with their name. This may not help in person when talking to them but should help when referring to them to others
first +10 points for the effort its very appreciated second anyone whos pronouns you dont know start mentally labeling them with they/them and any time you use the wrong pronouns for your friend calmly correct yourself for example “he went- oh sorry they went” dont make it too big of a deal just show that youre trying to fix it also you should mentally correct yourself every time you accidentally think of them with the wrong pronouns
One way I've learned how to stop misgendering people is by calling everyone they/them pronouns when we first meet, and after a while it feels weird using any other pronouns. So just keep working on it and you'll get it eventually
It all takes time and effort.  Correct yourself, but dont make a big deal of it.  Dude, I misgender myself and i started identifying as nb over a year ago.  I also try to default to they/them with anyone i dont know just to further form the habit of the fact that anyone who looks like anyone can identify with they/them pronouns
Practice. When you're alone, occasionally think or say ten sentences about that person using their correct pronouns. That will help your brain make the new connection
Talk about them (to yourself or to others) out loud, making it a point to use correct pronouns. Imo this works better talking to yourself bc you dont gotta have your mind on Keeping Up A Convo as well. Just like. A few times a day say a few sentences referring to them with their pronouns."	yf5q8m	NonBinary	67	0.97	2022-10-27 22:38:35
Anyone else get sad about being misgendered in the direction that once made you ecstatic?		"It's been a steady six months of being gendered as male by strangers for me. The punched-in-your-stomach feeling I used to have when I got ID'd as female has now switched over to when I get ID'd as male, though not as heavy. I used to always have to fight a smirk whenever someone gendered me as male in public before but now it makes me shiver.

Although it's hard for me to see me as anything but genderqueer and non-binary, I am aware of how I look to the average person and it makes me a bit sad, since I feel like such a satisfying combination of both. Been considering calming down at the gym and lowering my dose of testosterone to maybe get back to something more androgynous.

Sad feels. That's all. :'[
Happy Leo season, babies!

i hope you find a way that makes you feel comfortable and happy enough in your own skin! i hope you dont mind me saying this, but i think that you're super attractive!
It's totally ok to feel whatever feelings you have and it's ok for your feelings to change, over time or even day to day. No advice here, just want to validate you and say you're great no matter what. Getting misgendered, regardless of how you present, sucks and it's on those people and not you.
Why is part of your skin green/yellow here?
I'm not there yet, but.... I can see this happening if I physically transition ""too far."" After the novelty of being recognized as not female wears off, I am reminded that I'm still not being recognized for my actual gender.
I feel you - it's not an issue for me yet since I started testosterone 2 days ago, but I don't think I'm going to like being read as male full time much more than I like being read as female full time. I'm probably going to keep myself at normal male T levels in the long term, bc sports are important to me and I want to be able to compete, but there's definitely a sense of loss there. The gender binary just sucks :/
Was doing some photos for a friend's queer project that required me being painted gold, ahah.
It looks gold/metallic. I'm guessing some kind of safe-for-skin spray paint for cosplay/a costume/just for the heck of it
Same here too. 4 months on T so far and I’m really happy about it. I like being read as a guy in public, but I’m not one, so I will probably dislike it if it happens 24/7. But I am looking forward to wearing makeup/fem-leaning outfits and not being seen instantly as a woman... though I wonder if I’ll face more issues/discrimination if strangers then read me as transfem instead of transmasc
Yeah same, also looking forward to dressing my more masc body in a more femme way than I present now, also wondering if it might be more difficult to be read as transfemme. 

It'll be a while before I have to worry about it though, so far I've been called ""monsieur"" once ever."	91r7w4	NonBinary	64	0.98	2018-07-25 12:03:19
Getting misgendered by your parents? I feel you, folks. Like they say, if you can't beat 'em, join 'em. Dads are now she/her and Mums/Moms/Mams are now he/his		"Counterpoint: everyone is neutral “they” until they come out otherwise. 🤗
Agreed
Oh, I’m so doing this.
Just call them whatever named u want too, if they're doing the same

Should the responsibility be on us when correcting pronouns?	I use any pronouns but whenever people i ask i say i prefer they/them. My pronouns online are also set to they/them. But when people refer to me as she/her, especially people who know I prefer they/them, it makes me so sad, but i dont feel strong enough to correct people and i always hope my friends help me correct others. Moreover, i have a rather feminine name so people always just refer to me as she/her. But i once heard someone say or a comment i saw online that as an enby we have the responsibility to correct people who misgender us. But i dont know, i dont feel comfortable enough. What do yall think?	"If you want to correct someone and feel comfortable doing so, do. If you don't, then don't. There's no moral obligation that you *have* to correct people on behalf of the entire non-binary community. If you're friends with someone who isn't making good pronoun choices for you, the onus is on you to tell them what your correct pronouns are, and from there it's *their* responsibility to be respectful. But people are human, and helping each other is part of what friendship is about. So maybe you can think of it as doing them a favor, helping them be more respectful.
i think the way it should work is that people use they/them (neutral) pronouns by default, for *everyone*, until they know a person’s gender (which shouldn’t be assumed since expression =/= identity)

that said, since the world is not like that realistically, i do think the easiest way for us right now is to correct people *if we feel like it*. this doesn’t mean you have to tho
It's not our responsibility at all. You don't have to correct people if you don't want to, and I would argue your friends and other cis people who know your pronouns have the responsibility to step up and correct people. Having said that, if you want someone to stop misgendering you, often the most effective route is to correct them yourself as well.
Thanks for posting this :)) was feeling kinda overwhelmed about my NB experience and seeing that you have a similar way of articulating your pronoun usage is so validating for me :)) 

You are so valid in your experience and I too have a strong preference for they/them pronouns , but I think that I can see myself using other pronouns in some circumstances (I like calling it ""they+"" pronouns) I moreso think that while I'm ok letting people refer to me by other pronouns, ""they"" feels best. You are absolutely valid in feeling hurt that people who know that you like ""they"" are not calling you by that. If you feel comfortable, I would let these people know how you feel and you by no means have any obligation to correct them in the moment.
I've found that the less I correct people, the more they realize and correct themselves. I also find it's a great social test to find who is cool and who is not.
A fun trick I’ve picked up is making sure I always ask everyone their preferred gender pronouns, this almost always prompts/reminds them to ask me mine. I happen to be totally fine with the pronouns that match my agab but esp when I’m talking with someone who presents as cis I feel it’s a good reminder to myself and to them to never assume- which is our end goal here anyways, right?
You don't have to, but you can't expect people to know/get better without correction. Not that you *shouldn't* be able to, but rather that it just won't happen.
Dealing with similar feelings over here! I completely understand the reluctance to correct. At the same time it’s also alright to allow yourself to not correct people if you don’t feel like it. By being you you’re already doing enough.
I also have a feminine name, and often get misgendered as she even though I wear a badge that says they/them on it. My sister corrects people for me and my friends correct each other. One friend over corrected and misgendered me as male, which I had a good laugh with him about.

My trans friend and I have found people respond better from correction from others than by the offended party  so we correct for each other
I feel similarly- I get really nervous correcting people. I can correct people, but not face to face. I’ll text them or email them or something. I feel bad that I can’t do that for myself, when it’s something I could do for other people- and if I could do it for myself it would help people get used to using different pronouns. But ultimately I have to make sure I balance what I think is most just with making sure I have the energy to keep up the positive things I am doing. And sometimes the positive thing I’m doing is just being a trans person existing and doing my best to live a happy life.
It’s always going to depend on you because you’re the one it matters to most. Good friends will speak up of course. 

Whether I do or not depends on the person. If it’s just a simple slip up from someone used to referring to you the same way for years, eh, everybody does that (me included). If it’s a frequent problem, then yes, I will. 

With some dipshit at Walmart? I fight the battles that matter. If it matters, I do. If it’s not worth the effort, I don’t. My identity is far more than just a pronoun from a Maga hat wearing chucklefuck with socks and crocks and an ‘I’m with stupid’ shirt who is by himself. 

Ultimately it’s like exercising. The more you do it, the more comfortable it is.
it... doesn't really sound like you use any pronouns, it sounds like your pronouns are they/them. 

I'd say the only ""responsibility"" you have is towards yourself, not towards others. If you don't tell people they're making a mistake, they probably won't realize they're using the wrong words for you. But it's not like an outsider can get mad at you for not doing anything. And if someone is using the fact that you don't correct them on using your correct pronouns to misgender someone else, that's them being an asshole, it's not on you.
i totally agree it honestly just makes sense to use gender neutral pronouns by default. but yea, totally agree thanks!
yea… i think i just tell myself i “use any pronouns” so when teachers and/or more conservative people use she/her on me i psych myself thinking it’s okay, so i dont feel as bad??? i dont even know man…"	rzv8d9	NonBinary	63	0.97	2022-01-09 16:24:36
Love people not seeing my whole face at work anymore, but I wish it would stop people from misgendering me		"Cute （ ＾ν＾） , if you don't mind me saying
I used to have a shirt that said ""They/them and I'll buy you a cake, say the wrong thing and I'll stab ya with a stake"""	jdrsa8	NonBinary	63	1.0	2020-10-19 00:34:45
Pronoun hell	"I hate the expectation to share pronouns. 

I'm a ""closeted"" enby with no intention of ever ""coming out."" I'm not scared or anything; my gender is just something personal and private to me, and I do not want anyone knowing about it except maybe people who are close to me. 

The expectation to share pronouns forces me to either out myself or misgender myself with my assigned pronouns, and declining to share pronouns makes me look like an asshole. 

No pronouns have ever felt right to me, and I would prefer to only be addressed with my name, but even saying (none/any) gives people more information than I want them to know. 

I know I just need to suck it up and commit to something, but I don't know what I want, and it's making me avoid spaces where I suspect pronouns will be requested. Help! 🥺"	"i feel similarly, i just don’t like pronouns, but pronouns WILL be used for us no matter what, regardless of whether people are asking or not. so i’d rather be in control and get a say in the conversation.
How about ""i dont care""? it's more accurate (in that it's a non cis-centric answer), but easily could be misread as just a 'idgaf about your stupid gender question' answer from a cis person.
Asking people to just use your name seems like a reasonable option. Would you be comfortable with that?
I personally felt similar prior to coming out.  I think it is important for any HR/company encouraging pronouns to do it with the understanding it is not mandatory. Honestly, it's easier for cis people to not worry about putting pronouns on their account. Those who are closeted or worry about being judged or whatnot, or whatever reason feel now compelled to come out when in reality pronouns can be very personal and not everyone is ready. I came out to my friends at work prior to officially coming out (same with my name) and im lucky, my company is suppppper open so they don't mind if people chose to add pronouns or not to emails/intros. At the end of the day, my mindset is so long as your pronouns aren't mocking others, like ""beer/drunk"" or something shitty like so, then I do not care if you have them in email/intros.
The point of giving pronouns is for our benefit, so I have no qualms over refusing and looking like an asshole. I'd rather people think I'm transphobic than do their song and dance and make myself dysphoric
I’m in a similar boat. Some people I share my preferred she/her pronouns with, most I save them and myself the trouble and just go with he/him, but honestly I hate having to share them at all cus it just forces categorization. I’m happy that it works for others but I find it self-defeating. Power and love to you!
I RELATE TO THIS SO MUCH! I will forever be closeted and so if someone asks (and they aren’t a VERY close friend), then I just tell them my AGAB pronouns. If I tell them that I don’t care what pronouns they use, or that I would rather them use none at all, they won’t get it and it’ll be a five-hour discussion about stuff that I don’t even fully understand about myself.

I hate sharing pronouns as well because the intention for doing so was supposed to be in LGBT spaces where everyone was (at least expected) not transphobic and use the pronoun you give. The intention was never to be at work or school where trans people either already pass, have to lie, or have to deal with transphobia. At this point its just virtual signaling from cis people who dont have to deal with an repercussions of putting their pronouns out.   


I used to think ""any"" would be a good answer. But I've also been questioned about that, even at a LGBT event. People just keep saying ""i dont get it"" when I literally tell them any pronoun is fine.
I used to feel this way and still basically do, but I changed my name for gender reasons and told everyone why, so now I guess I'm out?  It wasn't like a secret or anything it just hadn't come up because it's personal.

I have my pronouns on my name badge but only 2 people use them.  They're not in my email signature and probably never will be, because I'm super uncomfortable about sharing my gender identity with a total stranger who literally knows nothing else about me except my name and job title.
Think about being agender or something if u don’t want to go by pronouns. It’s someone who doesn’t identify with a specific gender!
hm, not sure if it fits you but I say ""I like using they/them, but I really love when people switch between the genders. You literally can't misgender me as I am any gender."" so you can try that. But who knows. People around med don't care.
I definitely used to feel like this, and I would sometimes opt for a kind of noncommittal answer. Like “oh you know…” if asked for my pronouns directly. Some people will continue to challenge you but if you can pull off the vibe of not caring to answer the question, a lot of people will just drop it.
If I had to choose, I would pick some neopronouns (fe/fer) because I don't like how verbs are conjugated with ""they/them."" But people are so dang nasty about neopronouns, and getting people to use them for me just seems like a lot of energy I neither have nor want to spend on this.
Yup. And if you tell them you don't care what pronouns they use, they typically use your assigned ones anyway. 🥴 I'm sure cisgender feels like the default to cis people (which is why they think the burden of explanation is on me), but non-binary feels like the default to me, so I do not know how, want to, or feel like it's my job to explain something that's obviously so subjective. Just shut the 🦆 up about my gender! It doesn't concern you!
My name is already a classic non-binary ""nature/object"" name, which is why my gripe is with pronouns specifically. I imagine I would feel differently if my name were more strongly gendered.
I'm not confused about what I am ([gendervague](https://www.aane.org/gendervague-intersection-autistic-trans-experiences/)). I'm mad that I live in a society which makes it hard to be that, and which assumes that something else is the default.
it sounds like it comes down to what’s 1) more of an energy suck (avoiding spaces and stressing vs telling people fe/fee) and 2) what has the outcome that feels best. 

of course you do you, but for me, i will tell people what i want/correct then because that’s the only thing i can control. if they want to be nasty, or have trouble, or mess up, etc etc, that’s on them. i’ve done my part.
Exactlyyyyyyy 😩😩
That’s fair enough. But if u wanna go by no pronouns that’s completely fine. U shouldn’t have to be forced into something u don’t want to.
I've also considered ""name (name/name)"" to indicate that I really only want my name used, but I am autistic, so I need someone with more social sense to tell me if this would come off as flippant or disrespectful.
I'm autistic too so maybe the wrong person to ask, but I think people might respond better to something like ""name (no pronouns, please use my name)"", as that makes it super clear what you want them to do, and a lot of people act like assholes to cover up insecurity when they're not sure what to do
I’ve met some folks in college who just go by name/name. Pretty cool, haven’t seen any huge issues arise from it besides some mental adjustments. You’ll definitely get some questions, but I don’t think it’s disrespectful in any sense. Most of those friends also go by they/them just from being tired of explaining it all the time though, so maybe keep that in mind (since energy sucking was mentioned)
You could just say ""Refer to me by my name please"" a friend of mine does that and it works.
You have 100% figured out the social rules here!
Ok I am going to do this in spaces where I feel comfortable. Thanks for your help, friends."	w9582g	NonBinary	62	0.94	2022-07-27 04:38:57
I finally came out to everyone.	"On facebook i have a lot of my fiancés family and family friends, and since today is national coming out day, i came out. 

Here is what i posted:
""Happy national coming out day!
I'll take this day as a (scary) opportunity to share that I identify as nonbinary.

Nonbinary means that i don't identify with either male or female, and i prefer to be seen as androgynous. Not all nonbinary people want androgyny though, and that's okay! 

I'd like to ask of the people in my life to use they/them pronouns for me, and to just call me Leo.

I understand its a weird change, and i'm not that fussed about it, but if you love and respect me, at least try.""

And surprisingly only one person was aggressively transphobic and trying to be transphobic to my 1 year old son? Idk why really it was weird, like this post was about me and not him. He's literally a baby.

Another one was this 50 year old family friend that while they came off as rude, they just didn't understand it so they in the end asked me to explain it to them in messages. Messaged them with a very simplified explanation of what being nonbinary means, and they even thanked me for explaining it to them. It was nice :)

The rest of the people that commented were defending me from the transphobe and being like ""good for you"" and ""i'm proud of u for coming out"" and were generally just really nice and supportive. I wasnt misgendered once in the entire comment section and it made me so happy."	"That's awesome. I'm trying convince myself to come out as well. I changed my public pronouns on social media. I just dont want to come out for the wrong reasons. This gave me alot of confidence and I'm gonna take some notes from it.
Very cool, I am so glad for you that your coming out went so well 😊. I came out to my best friends ( we are a group of 6 queer artists) this weekend and it was only love and support 🥰. Though i did not expect anything different, earlier this year one of my friends from that group came out as genderfluid and whilst researching to understand and support them better i kinda realized that i am enby myself and their coming out in our group was also very supportive and accepting, but still one feels pretty vulnerable whilst coming out.
I am so glad to hear this. I just came out at work today. I'm sure there is going to be a lot of reminding people about my pronouns, but so far, no negativity.
Thats great to hear
I'm so proud of you.  It is terrifying to come out, especially with a bunch of people nowadays being hella transphobic.
You are wonderful and I'm glad you came out as your authentic self ♥️
P.S. honestly fuck what other people think.  Just be you!
Congratulations Leo!
wow i wish
You do this at your own pace and when you feel ready. I changed my pronouns on my socials months ago too, and i'm proud of you for taking that step too!!
Aww thats such a nice story! You deserve support and loads of it, and i'm proud if you for coming out to your friends!!
> but still one feels pretty vulnerable whilst coming out.

It took me a fucking year to come out to my queer friend group that already knows I'm bi. I got into the group from a non-binary friend and was scared I'd look like a poser. Stupid, but either way it's scary enough to come out to people who know what it means and you know wont ask questions like ""what's non-binary"", way more scary coming out to people who have no idea and even if they're an ""Ally"" start spouting shit out of ignorance. Somewhat innocent ignorance, but ignorance all the same. The ignorance I've got from my wife's friends has been very fucking unsettling.
Hey congrats on coming out!! I'm proud of you :)
And they'll hopefully get used to it quickly
Thank you so much 🥺❤❤
Thank you!!
It's hard i know. You got this though, one day you'll be able to come out and be your true self ❤
Thanks :) I do find it alot more validating coming out. Its a very nice feeling.
Thanks ☺️ It’s interactions like this why i love this subreddit so much
To come off like an imposter was a concern of mine too, but i guess most of us had something like this or the thought „am i enby enough to use the label“  floating through our minds one time or the other.
I feel ya, even if the ignorance doesn’t come from bad intentions it still hurts and is tiring. How does you wife react to the behavior of her friends towards you?
Aww my gosh 🥺🥺
Exactly... It is a sort of imposter syndrome... Especially since I get misgendered mostly as cishet male, I feel like I don't deserve the label because I'm not transitioning or wearing makeup or skirts or whatever, not as obviously queer as other folks I know and selfies on this subreddit... But I know the biggest reason is I'm scared and I just feel safer, and honestly it'd just add to existing social anxiety. In the end, I know cis people don't deal with these feelings, and I remind myself that. It'd be a lot easier, and it's not that way.

My wife, honestly she didn't do well. She wasn't saying ignorant shit like her friend, but they were both misgendering me right in front of me, not on purpose. It was odd, her friend said ""so I hear you go by they/them, that's cool"". And then right after they keep using ""he"" for me right in front of me, like they didn't pick up what was just said. Ignorant, like didn't put together yeah use they/them, but not on purpose either that I could tell. And I'll put it this way, I had to explain to her friend why Elliot Page isn't ""doing it for attention"", why it's bad to deadname them, and why it actually validates people like myself and my enby friend to have public representation. She listened, but it's upsetting that's her first response ""yeah you're cool but other people do it for attention"".

My wife was also outing me for a bit like ""he doesn't identify as a man"" without even telling me, and I had to explain why I don't want to be outed, and that it's at least better to say ""they identify as non-binary""... I told her she can out me now at her discretion but that was rough. Like all her friends knew without me even having a clue. She told me she didn't understand, if it was her she'd just be ""out"", so it really is plain ignorance like not understanding how I feel and why I feel it. She really apologized and cried and said she wants to do right by me. She loves me to death but she's still learning. Much better now, just a very rough start..

Oh god and she told me ""my work friend wants to know what you think of the latest Chapelle show"". Im like hmm why... Oh maybe it's transphobic... I try watching it with her. It's the most transphobic shit I've seen. I'm like YEAH HUN IT FUCKING SUCKS. I don't think she understood why that was a little upsetting to watch. I turned it off before the end, around when he started saying he agreed with TERFs.

The important thing is it's always been ignorance, when I explains things she listens, and she does get better. It's not out of hate, it's out of ignorance and she wants to do right by me.
Oh no, coming out is such a personal thing, that really sucks! If it is ok for you, feel hugged from me. My ex was like that too, more with my mental health stuff, but i told him x and y trigger me and if you than do z it really makes my life just harder, he followed it twice and the third time over he went back to doing z again, or with some things he never followed it, one of the reasons he is now my ex. Maybe she understands it better if you ask her how she would feel if she found out she is pregnant and you would immediately tell everybody.
Thank you ❤️

I'm sorry to hear you went through that... Definitely toxic, and glad he's your ex. That all sounds very intentional on his part... That absolutely isn't acceptable. It's one thing to be ignorant, another to be intentionally hurtful.

Yeah, she really really tries. She's never done anything to intentionally hurt me, only been confused about what's appropriate and why I might feel a certain way, like not wanting to be outed before I was ready, and how I might still get hurt hearing transphobic stuff like that last Chapelle show even if I'm not visibly trans. Just sucks to see that's how so many people see us, sucks to see how popular that opinion is, and I'm not sure she understands that a big reason I'm not visibly trans is BECAUSE of shit like that being so mainstream.

But she tries, and anything I've brought up we've moved past and she has always listened and responded with love. I'm not worried about her at all. I just think that her understanding of everything has grown and it was a rocky start, but still just out of ignorance. And besides I've been ignorant of her own specific issues. It's not about magically not being ignorant as much as learning from it.
Thanks ☺️. 
Yes that was quit something with him, he has a bachelors degree in social work, so he should have known better, but he is very egocentric he just saw his own inconviences🤷. Ok that sounds promising, as long as your wife is listening and tries to do better it has the potential to turn out great. I guess it has to be appreciated that such a coming out is for a partner quite a process too, especially when it seems that they haven’t had that much contact with queer folks. And the media portrayal doesn’t help very much, even the more positive examples are still problematic. There far too few fictional characters that just are enby, trans, pan or in some other way queer, just as a trait of them and not their entire plot."	q5zqek	NonBinary	60	0.99	2021-10-11 16:31:09
what up y’all I keep getting misgendered at work. Thots?		"Hmm maybe a pronoun pin or two would help? Especially if you are around people who mean well but are... Thoughtless.
Hey, me too! Amab and Honestly the he/him pronouns don’t bother me so much, but it really really bugs me being referred to as a man. In my case I’ve had they/them pronouns in my email signature for months and have referred to myself as non-binary with some folx, but haven’t had a big dramatic coming out event and I’m not sure I want to after hearing the stuff a lot of people say even though the place I work should theoretically be the most accepting workplace ever. Are you out to everyone as nonbinary at work?

It definitely feels shitty to be misgendered, so I’m sorry you have to go through that! I see you though!
Thank you for the support! I’m sorry you’re going through something similar.

I also have my pronouns in my email signature and on my first day I let everyone know I use they/them pronouns. I work in entertainment and my workplace is very accepting, but some coworkers use she/her pronouns still which bothers me. I can at least tell that they catch themselves right after it happens but cmon. I don’t have the energy for this.
The fact that they’re catching it right after is a sign of growth. Hopefully that means they should have it down soon. Humans aren’t perfect machines you can flip a switch on and magically have them perform an operation perfectly, regardless of how much them doing that operation means to us, unfortunately. 

Not to dismiss your feelings, because of course it’s valid for you to feel down / upset about it (!) but this is probably going to be common for a lot of your life if you’re non-binary. I’d say try to work on coping skills so it stresses you out less, that way it’s easier on you when you encounter it."	ew00c0	NonBinary	61	0.93	2020-01-30 04:52:36
I embroidered two of my masks because if i get misgendered one more time im going to commit arson		"I’d buy one of these tho. I too want to commit arson. I mean. Will be forced to do so if people keep being assholes.
Thank you! And yeah, i got she/her’d not two minutes after correcting someone about my pronouns the other day"	lfrkkq	NonBinary	60	0.99	2021-02-09 01:43:04
Told my mum about my pronoun preference	"Whilst we were on a walk, I asked my mum how I should correct her when she misgenders me. (A few weeks ago I told her about being non-binary and she seemed accepting). I tried to be as open with this conversation as possible because I didn’t want her getting angry.

She said stuff like “What if it’s a phase?”, “I think this is too much to ask” and “It’s really hard for me”, which all came across as very selfish. I’m aware of my right to be gendered correctly, and I told her how happy being referred to as ‘they/them’ made me feel. 

We came to an agreement that if I’m patient with her, she won’t get angry with me when I correct her. I truly hope that will be the case. I wish she was more understanding especially because she accepted my name change in 2019, but hey ho what can I do about it? /rh"	"Why do some people get the idea in their head that if they accidentally misgender you, you'll be super angry with them, and then use that as an excuse to keep misgendering you?
>She said stuff like “What if it’s a phase?”, “I think this is too much to ask” and “It’s really hard for me”, which all came across as very selfish.

Because it is. Paris Hilton is 40 years old and has *zero* problems using Demi Lovato's they/them pronouns. These are invalidating statements dressed up as ""love"" and ""concern"" but these statements really just make you doubt yourself and push you back into the closet. 

No one responds with ""What if it's a phase?"" to someone who says they want to be a doctor or a parent. Even if you think the person is unfit to become a doctor or a parent, it's just plain rude to say that. It is here, too.

To be fair, your mother seems like she genuinely cares about you, but is struggling with the stigma and a lifetime of cis-indoctrination. That's understandable. I'm sure many of us also had to struggle with the same things, especially before coming out.

My advice is to be compassionately assertive. Assure your mother that it's okay for her to feel scared or worried, but that your requests are reasonable and that you should be respected, regardless of whether it's a phase or not. I'm sure she has zero problem referring to newlyweds with their new surnames. You're not asking for anything more than that. Also, artists and musicians go through phases all the time, and we respect and celebrate them for doing so. I hope your mother can find the space in her heart to respect and celebrate you.
The fact that you can have this conversation with your mom at all is something to be happy about.  Good for both of you.  It sounds like she is trying.  I'm not sure how old she is, but I'm approaching 40 and my brain doesn't adapt nearly as fast as it used to.  I think she is afraid of messing it up because she cares.  Take that feeling and be patient with her.  It sounds like she loves you. ❤️
She trying to say how hard this is for her, but it’s way harder for you.
Honestly, there’s no winning with mothers sometimes. Much love to all of the kind, accepting mothers and mother figures out there, but my experiences up to this point haven’t been great.

My mum actively misgenders me, then gets angry when I gently correct her (all I do is quietly say “he” or “they” under my breath when she gets it wrong, loud enough for her to hear but not loud enough to draw attention to it, and she throws a fit) but will actively correct others on my pronouns incorrectly (I’m he/they and am fine if you use other and I’ve made this ABUNDANTLY clear to her, but she’ll still get into a blow-up argument with my little brother when he calls me “they” instead of “he” because it’s “not valid” and “misgendering” me). 

She does this with mental health, too. She used to get really really angry when I didn’t tell her every little detail about my life, so she’d ask very direct, personal questions in extremely blunt and inconsiderate ways. I had depression, she knew I had depression, and she ALSO had depression, but every time I seemed down and she asked me if I was depressed and I said “yeah” she’d immediately ask “Why?!” In an aggressive and accusatory tone. Depression doesn’t have a direct cause every time, that’s WHY it’s depression. Same with if I said I didn’t feel comfortable with something or felt a certain way, always “Why?!?!”. I told a psychologist and they asked my mother to stop asking that and she agreed, and we lasted three tense days of her continually wanting to accuse me of faking my emotions by asking why but being unable to before she snapped and said my request was “unreasonable” and that I was “infringing on her right to be the parental authority” (I was like, 16). Mothers can be sh*t sometimes, or just generally hard to manage, and it’s not your fault. I wish you the best!
If it is a phase, then by all means treat it like the fucking moon. That thing comes, goes, gets covered by clouds, and glows like a lightbulb when full. But, it never, leaves, the sky. It is always there, different phases, sometimes blocked by things it cannot control, but it is still there.
My parents and brothers were kind of difficult about pronouns when i first came out, but they got better with time. They were also sort of forced to accept that it wasn't a phase around the 2 year mark. (It's been 6 now)
I've had a similar experience with my chosen name. For me, relentlessly yet kindly correcting people helped. It didn't take long for my 12 year-old and 13 year-old cousins to get it, and now they're doing the job of correcting everyone else! Just keep your cool and try to find some allies. And most importantly, remember that you're valid. We're all rooting for you 🏳️‍🌈
You are so brave. I can never come out properly.
I totally agree with you. I would understand her concern if I wanted life-changing gender-affirming surgery or hormones, but all I’m asking is to be referred to with a different set of pronouns.

I’ll do my best to keep everything you said in my mind. This is all so helpful and your words made me feel more confident in my identity! So thank you so much for that. Your analogies are super good too.

I’ll make sure to not get angry but also know what my rights are. It’s funny because when I speak about my non-binary friend she actually tries to get their pronouns right. I’m guessing it’s different with me because I’m her child and it’s more personal! But anyway, thank you so much for the advice. :-) I appreciate it immensely!
You're right; she does love me — I don't doubt that. :-) I just wish she didn't come across as selfishly as she did. It kind of made me feel guilty, but I know that I have a right to be gendered correctly.

I'll just see how it goes! And, thank you for replying. It's interesting to hear from someone who's around the same age as my mum!
I am so sorry that your mother isn’t accepting of your identity and mental health problems. Everyone deserves a caring mother. If you need anyone to talk to, you can talk to me. 💙
Beautiful analogy!
Thank you! 💙 I wish you the best on your LGBT+ journey
Thank you. One day you’ll get the courage to do so. I believe in you! ☺️
Yep, you absolutely have that right.  And I'm glad my old perspective is helpful!  Honestly, this stuff has all changed very rapidly and my generation is sort of there, but can still be a little tough.  Even being NB myself, I struggle a little with the neutral pronouns and it is hard to change decades of binary thought.  I think it's also hard for parents when they are so used to thinking about you a certain way for literally your entire life.  My son is 12, and I would have no problem accepting any identity that he feels best represents him, even if that changes over time -- but I do know that it would take time for some things to adapt in my brain.  And being that I try to be very honest with him, I'd probably tell him that it is going to be a little difficult and I might not be perfect.

None of this is meant to minimize or invalidate how you feel about it.  I don't know all the intricacies of your relationship with her.  I know this is harder for you than it is on anyone else in your life, but you've had years of figuring this out and learning to accept it.  She's a week in and probably still processing and understanding.

So my fatherly advice is, give her grace.  Accept her love.  Know she's trying.  Keep talking to her and support each other through this journey.
Thank you so much. I think I’ll be okay, I’m living with my dad now and trying to cut her out of my life for good, but I really appreciate the offer. I hope things turn out well between you and your mother and that she respects your identity and pronouns 💜
Haha, you’re not that old!

Thank you again for your words. I’ll try my best to be patient and keep an open mind with her.

Just out of interest, when and how did you find out you were non-binary?
That’s amazing news. Best of luck to you going forward! And thank you :-)
It was just probably in the last month or two that I started getting comfortable with that label.  I was always in to more feminine stuff, liked to dress up, etc.  I was always honesty in my romantic relationships about it.  Never felt trans, even though it's pretty hard not to wonder.  Started trying to incorporate more feminine things in to my life a few years ago -- stop trying to hide it as much.  Over the past year, pretty much stopped wearing men's stuff except for certain things where I'm just drab.  I have a lot of women's clothes that are very neutral as well.  I just kind of took the viewpoint that I was a dude that expressed more feminity.  But eventually got to the point where NB felt more true to who I am, and it was comfortable.

Just got on here yesterday -- it's really eye opening to see the variety of people.  Everyone is coming from some place different and wants to represent themselves in their own unique way.
That’s awesome! I’m so glad you found a label that accurately describes your gender identity. 

I joined Reddit in 2018 but left and returned only a few days ago. I find that people here are more open-minded than on other platforms. I definitely agree that there’s such a diverse variety of people! :-D"	pbclxt	NonBinary	56	0.98	2021-08-25 14:40:05

I did an experiment to show what it's like to be a non-binary person in a binary-centric society. For 30 days, I put a penny in this jar each time I was misgendered. There's at least $1.07 in there. Each instance may not be a big deal, but it adds up to feeling like I'm not being seen as who I am.		"Dang. Even though it doesn't look like a lot, that is 107 times (if I can math). That in itself is more than enough to make someone feel worthless. 

I feel like if I did this, I'd reach 100 pretty fast.
Yeah this is why I try not to be around people.
I get why you feel that way. Though it would me more fun and less depression inducing to do it the other way around, a penny every time you are correctly gendered
Try it! I'd be curious to see others' experiences. During those 30 days, there were 6 days during which I wasn't misgendered at all. One of those days was when I was sick and laid in bed most of the day.
Do it! I may have to try it myself!
I tried your idea for the last 30 days. I was correctly gendered 23 times.
I shall! I don't know if I have any pennies laying around, so maybe I'll use pieces of paper or something!"	mqvoog	NonBinary	59	0.98	2021-04-14 17:37:35

If you ask for names and pronouns on the first day of class, do not tell me how hard it is for you to use they/them - A rant for my professor	Why even ask if you can’t be respectful. I would rather you not know my pronouns and misgender me out of ignorance than have you knowingly misgender me while asking me to forgive you over and over again. Do better or do not refer to me at all	"They asked what everyone's pronouns were at the start of class. They were the one who instigated. I would go to the Dean or whoever they report to and talk with them if you've already spoken to your prof and they still proceed to give you grief. 

If nothing else, you can let others know on RateMyProfessor.com what the deal is. Super sorry you have to go through this, hopefully it'll be over sooner than later. :/
This is just cruel. Screw this professor...
This is the way to go. There is such an incredibly small power differential between professor and student (if you're at a college that would be supportive tbf). The headache for a professor if a dream gets involved, and the fear of a lawsuit, means you actually have a fair amount of power here. Doing let them walk over you!"	l30mqy	NonBinary	57	0.97	2021-01-23 00:04:55
We need more support for clean/sober non cis people	"I've been in and out of sober living since I was 21 the cis male (I'm afab) house I was first  in was amazing but ya know relapse.

I'm 24 now and I've been in this house full of cis women. It's a midsized organization 86+ split between eleven houses. The owners are as respectful as they can be but I can't expect them to use more inclusive language when I'm the only non-cis person here. But I'm tired of “You are Princess Warriors” and “Attention ladies” and “You are all beautiful”

So tired of the misgendering-even tho none of it is meant to be rude. I appear masculine and I wear skirts cause we live in the south and damn it if Imma roast. Tired of every new girl asking what's in my pants, tired of explaining my story, of educating and being tolerant all the while I'm trying to put back the pieces of my life.

I do know it's just been a hard week and I do have really supportive people who do there best to understand. I just can't help but imagine a place where there are others just like me who struggle with trying to overcome addiction. I was denied at so many places because of who I am, so I'm grateful I do have a place and that I kept trying to get help. 

There must be others like me and I just don't want them to be as uncomfortable as I get sometimes whole undergoing recovery. 

Treatment for addicts needs to improve in general but there really needs to be some focus on those who are not cis. Especially with how gendered 12 step programs can get."	"I just had a similar conversation with a friend the other day about foster care. I can see how this relates to your situation. While in one aspect I appreciate the faux-support for females, it gets manufactured too much. Like they can just buy jumbo poster pack of generic pink & flowery affirmations and it will make someone feel better. These kinds of things magnify a crappy week when you’ve been “Hallmarked” into being supported. Hear me out: consider making the type of posters with affirmations that would make you feel supported! Hang those puppies up with the women rarw stuff.
I go strictly with co-ed houses now for that reason - me being a transmasculine person in a “female” house was a mess for everyone involved. Though that comes with issues of its own, and still isn’t perfect by any means. Honestly, I plan on pretending to be binary male as soon as I’m passing bc it’s honestly such a hassle 🙄
Men's Oxford in the NW has been supportive of my transmasc friends, and it's a lot more personal and autonomous than larger sober living organizations. Perhaps try that?
Conservative AA people are how I ended up not getting the right help for my gender issues in early recovery. I had 14 years when I finally cracked. Got loaded over it. Don’t assume a bunch of addicts will understand or respect your identity. LGBT meetings exist for a reason, and even then you have to remember that too many gays and lesbians are not cool with trans or non-binary people. When they say “to thy own self be true” they really mean it, even when they completely forget what that means.
ugh pisses me off how gendered this world is, im so sick and tired of it, like what is this OBSESSION with putting people in tiny boxes???? we're all human, period. 

sorry rant lol i really hope things get better ✨
Honestly? I'm too drunk to read your post properly. Which says a lot. I'm sorry. I'm pretty lost. But I send my love and support.
Exactly!! You hit it right on the head! I’m also a former foster kid and it’s my dream to be a worker and to create policies that protect and support kids and teens.

But making my own support stuff sounds awesome thank you so much for the suggestion I really appreciate it :)
I can only speak for the NW but there are also good queer 12 step groups here. I would hope there are some where you are too.
Thank you so much 💕 Please make sure you drink some water and get food into you when you're able to!
Former foster kid here too! The idea of the poster-making comes from my non-Binary first born who makes posters to put out on the lawn that are more inclusive! We are running into the ra-ra rawr issue in Scouts where they are encouraged to make a lot of gender specific empowerment stuff and it makes them feel crappy that they aren’t so happy about the gender label!
Yes, I did. Thank you 💗"	ou9dq1	NonBinary	54	0.98	2021-07-29 23:53:11
I just need someone to tell this to	"I have been crying for the last 10 minutes over having to shave my legs for a family social even tomorrow. I live in the Southern Hemisphere and it’s summer so I can’t show up in jeans it’s way too hot. Shaving my legs have always made me feel like a woman and I feel like I am misgendering myself to conform to what society wants me to be. I have always known that this isn’t my identity but it feels so demoralizing and at the same time absolutely something stupid to be upset about.
Shaving has always made me feel completely out of touch with my body even more than my chest sometimes because this is something I am actively going along with as woman."	"No need to feel stupid for being upset over this - dysphoria looks different to everyone.
I know you might receive questions or remarks from family but what if you didn’t shave? The world would still be intact and you would feel comfortable. We are in a changing world where we do not need to conform to societal standards or stereotypes. If you don’t want to shave, don’t do it. If people get upset about your personal decisions then that is their problem — you can’t make everyone happy or like you so why not do what you want?

I know that can be easier said than done, and it feels scary NOT to conform to these standards, especially when you feel like people will judge you. But eventually you have to say “fuck it” and do what’s best for you. And if not shaving your legs is one of those things, then so be it. You’re worried about seeming stupid for being upset about this but really your family would be the ones who are stupid for being upset — it has nothing to do with them and doesn’t change a thing about their life in any way.

If it makes you feel any better, I’m afab (and unfortunately present feminine) but I don’t shave anything, including my legs. I live in the south US where it’s hot and people are extremely judgemental but me having hairy legs or armpits is something they will forget about 10 min after I leave. Conforming to a standard that makes me uncomfortable is something I will be thinking about for days, maybe even a week or two, until it grows back to how it was. Whatever you decide to do, just make sure you care for yourself!
No shame crying about that at all.

I recently had a thing regarding hair growing where I didn't want it, I just took the choice and shaved it away. 

A definition of stress is not being in control of something. As the other comment said I'd take back that control over your body and just not shave (if it's safe to do so).

💜
If you don't want to shave but you don't want people to notice the hair, could you dye it white blond?
I think shaving your legs should be for every gender. “Women” shaving is something people forced for control of peoples body’s and everything. So I try my best to ignore all these “standards” and it definitely helped with my dysphoria. Once I stopped shaving my arm pits I felt so much more like me. But I still feel that pressure form society that I should look a certain way and it is a struggle. So sorry you have to shave
As someone else said, you could bleach the hair on your legs and/or armpits next time if that would help?

But also, something that helped me be more comfortable with letting my leg hair show since I still had to pretend to be female, was knowing that it really only became a thing not even 100 years ago. It’s another bs social construct rooted in misogyny and racism and definitely doesn’t determine your gender identity and/or expression. There’s plenty of men & masc people that shave for sports or just bc it feels nice, and plenty of women & femmes that don’t give into the bs societal expectation that “fEmiNiNe pEoPle mUsT sHaVe”. 

I can totally relate to how you must be feeling, and it’s *understandable* to cry and let it out. *Not stupid at all!* I stopped shaving when I was 14 and I had a huge panic attack after I felt pressured to shave on a hot day when I was 17. So you’re not alone! I know it’s hard, but try to remember that it’ll grow back real soon, and though you may not feel like yourself rn, you *are* still you! Having body hair or not doesn’t make you any more or less enby. You are still valid and *always* will be no matter what!
Feel no shame, friend! I feel the same way about shaving my legs. I finally quit within the last two years or so. I was super worried about wearing shorts though, because my legs are seriously more hairy than most men’s legs. Like, it’s super dark and thick and noticeable. 

Literally nobody has ever said a word about it, even in the southern US, where I live. I even wear pretty short shorts sometimes. It’s never been an issue and I’ve gotten so much more comfortable with my body after finally just going for it. Some people might assume I’m a guy. Others, a girl with crazy hairy legs. The people I care about know I’m just a nonbinary critter person. 

I encourage you to try it! I know it’s scary. But try to embrace the wind blowing through your leg hairs lol :)
Not dumb at all. Sorry you have to do this. I had to cut my hair for work around a year ago, and it made me feel like I betrayed myself.
Trust me, I understand you, if it could help why don't you bleach your hair? People can't usually tell from far away but you can still sense them! Hope it helps
I always hated shaving, too. Not to mention it would always give me terrible rashes.

....If you don't mind a white lie, you could try to go that route...My armpits would sometimes get punishingly itchy and sore. But you might open yourself up to a whole world of beauty tips and tricks.
How you feel is understandable and valid. I get how you feel like you’re conforming instead of being you but you’re not. You’re doing this because it’s what’s best at the moment, if you were doing it to conform to society then you’d know that’s the reason you’d be doing it for. This doesn’t discount your identity, it doesn’t misgender it, it doesn’t have any impact on it in the slightest. I hope you’re alright now and hopefully I helped a little =]
In my experience it's best to make yourself happy before making others happy (unless you are willing to make that sacrifice for whatever reason).
Thank you for your kindness. You make of course a great point that I could just not x’D I wish I considered it before. The pressure of embarrassing close family in-front of others is the driving force but honestly pleasing people I don’t even care about to put myself out of my comfort zone is not worth the stress and dysphoria. I will keep this in mind next time
Thank you for your kindness. It’s just amazing to have others who can relate
I'd worry about potential chemical burns for dying leg hair but it may be worth it to try a small patch test. Another option, if OP feels compelled to shave is to only shave what shows. If you're wearing longer shorts then only shave below the knee. I usually let my arm pit hair grow out because in the average t-shirt no one will notice, and it's my secret pocket of joy.
I’ve tried this and loved it!
I want your confidence. I’ve had nightmares about shaving. I should just take the plunge and try
Thank you for your kindness. I wish we didn’t have to do things for other people and devalue ourselves
I have never thought of bleaching them but my skin is very sensitive
It gives me a terrible rash too so it’s a valid excuse
Thank you for your kindness it really does help
[deleted]
Yea it's a glorious thing in that way. We can post 'oh this happened' and feel totally alone but it happens in some form or another to others.

You are never alone 💜
Yes you should!! It’s hard stepping out of your comfort zone but it’s so worth it. It has helped my confidence a ton.
Same! I haven’t shaved my legs in years and no one notices. I did make an exception when I wore a dress to a funeral, but that was a personal preference to not go unshaved in a dress and did not cause dysphoria. Once I have a more enby wardrobe for formal events, that won’t be an issue."	qxgdm6	NonBinary	56	0.99	2021-11-19 13:38:04
Help an old ladies crazy brain out!	"I'm going to preface this.


One of my kids is trans. I do not misgender or dead name them. Ever. And I only learned about this since the pandemic started.


Into my bed for help. My kid years ago told me they were they/them. I promised to try to respect their wishes. I fully mean that. 


But. For some dumb reason you'll see all over my profile me talking about my son and my daughter.

I think this is where my brain is getting stuck. If I say my son (he/him) and my daughter (they/them) (this is used online a LOT) what is appropriate for the term daughter there that makes sense? I've asked them and they said they were fine with being called my daughter. But. I really want to show respect for them.

I think this will help me stop referring to them as she/her otherwise because I talk about my kids A LOT.

A little help?

PS. I'm loving these generations coming along. Y'all are making things safer for those that follow you. Please don't stop and don't give up. I know it is hard, painful and at times totally fudged up but y'all rock. If you need a second mom I'm always here. Love you.

Edit for clarity. (hopefully)"	"First of all I’d just like to say I’m very happy that you take the time to figure this out and be an inclusive and accepting person!

This specific situation is kinda tough since there is no real commonly-used specific word for “gender neutral kid I had”, so we kinda gotta reuse general words for these purposes. Like the other comment said, “my child” works, ot there’s also “my kid” which is more casual. There is the ever-ironic “my offspring”, if you would like as well. If you wanna go full funny, then “crotch goblin” is a small internet inside joke which works (though it may come off as making fun of them to an ignorant observer)

My favorite is “my kid” since it doesn’t sound overly formal and it’s easy to say.
I guess you could say ”my son and my enby kid”, since it seems you are using the gendered terms to kind of single them out. Language has still not settled on a specific term for kids that are neither sons nor daughters, and I can see how this is not the situation where the gender neutral ”kid” or ”child” would work, since they become too general.

Other suggestions might be they-child, enbion or the like.

The longer I look at it, the more I like enbion.
My child? Or just their name?
When I refer to my two children as a group I say ""children"" or ""kids"".  I've gotten pretty good with the they/them and sometimes use it for both kiddos, which the younger doesn't mind.  My elder child sometimes refers to themself as 'bean' which was sort of mispronouncing 'being'.  They also like the term 'enby'.  It definitely takes time and patience.  But I agree that I am also learning to embrace that future generations will view gender very differently from mine and I think it will be beautiful.
If it was me I’d have a conversation with the two of them and ask them what they think.
My mom calls me and my siblings by our birth order online- so youngest, middle, and oldest. This made it very easy for her when I came out as non-binary lol.
Yeah but...... My son (he/him 30yr) I gave birth to. Whereas my kid I did not (they/them 32) but when my son was two they came into our life at the tender age of four. All of my stories typically start ""my son and daughter"" which is what is really breaking my brain because by saying ""my daughter"" I'm having issues sticking to the appropriate pronouns. But..... What to use instead of ""my daughter""? It's only online because irl it's their name most of the time.
Enby? What does it mean? (thank goodness there's a term!!)
No names on reddit. So my son and my child? If I say my kids that encompasses all ten of them. (only had one second mom to the other 9!)
Someone gave me terms and I've sent a message to them asking. I felt better approaching with a small amount of knowledge. Silly, no?
Original, collected 1...... Huh. That might work...... Now to remember when each kiddo popped into our lives. I had one but collected 9 more!
Ohhh sorry, must’ve missed that detail. That’s a toughie, all right.

Edit: my oldest/youngest/something like that might work. It implies the same connection as “daughter” does
Enby is a version of NB which is short for nonbinary, which covers most gender positions that are not completely male or completely female. Not all they/them people feel like NB covers them though, so check with them what they’d like. They may still prefer ”daughter” for practical reasons, such as not having to deal with coming out fallout from strangers, but personally I’d really prefer NB (enby) terms
No. Not say their names here. Meaning : Use their names in place of saying “My son and daughter.”

EDIT: You meant when you talk about them on here, didn’t you? In that case, my non-binary child?
What about just ""my children""?   


My youngest (a teen) just came out as enby and I realize how often I have lumped my kids together, posting ""the girls this"" and ""the girls that."" I decided I will use ""The kids"" or ""My children"" or just their names (right now, my enby is sticking with the name we gave them at birth).
That makes sense!
Thank you so much!!
Another potential with ""enby"" is it's perceived by some as infantilising. I personally consider it to be the nonbinary equivalent to ""boy"" and ""girl"", which of course are not often used in reference to adults. So the word may not be appropriate for this individual.
Oh offline I totally name the brats in talking about. On here however lots of my stories feature those two which is why I brought it up. They came into my life when they were only four and my son was two. So lots of craziness from these two! (30 & 32 now)
Yeah, I’ve heard that. Personally I use NB, which would still be pronounced something like enby, and I’m 38. Would you prefer nonbinary to be used in entirety for adults, even as a noun, or something else? 

Like we see above, the gender neutral traditional terms kid, child, sibling, parent, etc don’t quite do the same job as their gendered equivalents, because they also include genders and become too general to effectively single people out in a family constellation. They would work if we were striving for a generally neutral language, to be used for everyone, but personally I prefer if people use specific language for nonbinary people, so that it is clear that it is something other than male/female. Since sibling, for example, is a gender-inclusive term, it would be applicable even to sisters and brothers, and thus does not save me from being thought a sister or brother if used.

What I like about enby/NB is that they are terms that are gaining general use and are thus starting to become effective as language. If we want more terms for us we need to make them up and use them consistently, the way all language is created.
Got it! Yeah, that’s a tough one to figure out.
Online, I would say something like ""two of my children (30M, 32NB)..."" 

Or there's a Reddit habit of saying ""My kids, let's call them [fake names] or [initials]..."" 

In person I think names would be easier.
Maybe something like ""when my oldest two, name1 and name2, were 3, they..."" you're definitely not alone in this one it's something that many families struggle with but I'm very happy to hear about how much respect you have for them :)
Whew not just me!! I've tried ""my two oldest"" but they aren't in age only time. My kids gah!........ Mayhaps the two kids I've had the longest? It's long but I need to really stop with the wrong gender on reddit to be able to get they/them and names only offline. The way my brain thinks really needs to line up......

Thanks for your patience and thought!
I like that first one! In person it's easier because yes it's names only.

What do you say instead of ""your sister""? Your enby?
'My first two kids' maybe? Also ask your 32 year old if they're okay with daughter because of practical purposes but are 'meh' about it, or of they're truly okay with being called daughter. For a lot of non binary people different words mean different things and pronouns doesn't always have a direct link to other words. For example, I'm a she/her nonbinary person, don't mind being called daughter or sister, but dó mind being called miss or mrs (in my language) _unless_ it's children I teach calling me that as an honorary title. Maybe being called 'daughter' is actually a huge thing for your child, since you said they aren't your birth child but you are their mother and the word is affirmative of that for them. But also maybe they actually hate the word but are okay with it for practical purposes. Only way to figure that out is to ask them, really.

Thanks for being an awesome mom though!
Honestly, the fact that you're trying and you're seeking out help on your own probably means a lot to your child.
“Your sibling”
Personally, I'd say ""your sibling."" But I have other NB friends who prefer very neutral terms, so I've had a few years of practice. :)
There are 9 more besides my son. That's why it's hard to figure out what to say. I collected kids and now in adulthood things are interesting :)"	qbmao1	NonBinary	56	0.97	2021-10-19 22:09:25
Does anybody else dislike smiling because you feel like it misgenders you? My smile has always been a source of dysphoria for me. Working on my happy, not-mad-I-promise, face.		"Yessss and idk how to make any face besides 😐😕☹️ that’s the pose I do in all selfies😩😩😩 lmao. I’m glad other ppl feel this too. I love your selfies btw I think you look really cool :] and not mad at all!
I understand this 100%
YES. I feel really weird when I see myself smile. As a kid I was always pressured to keep a ""pretty smile"" as I needed to ""look cute"" so I can't smile for photos, it feels forced/artificial just like it was back then.
I like your smile
Yup, although I didn't much think of it before! I always think of adults telling child-me: ""smile sweetie!"" and ""you're so pretty when you smile"".

No one every said that to my brother, not one single time.
YESSSS. I feel like my smile TOTALLY gives away my AGAB and idk whyyyyy.
i am EXACTLY the same way lol
Uugh same! Thanks for the kind words. It's easier for me to pull this off in a selfie than irl though.
I'm glad somebody else does!
I can relate to that for sure. My eyes would always reflect how I was feeling too; uncomfortable and gave off an, ""am I doing this right"" vibe.
Thanks, but I'm not smiling in either of these.
Oh yeah, makes sense. In real life we’ve got to constantly focus on the non-mad face. In a selfie you just gotta do it for 1 sec! 😂"	s1zgpg	NonBinary	54	1.0	2022-01-12 06:30:40
anybody accidentally misgender themselves sometimes? feelsbadman.jpg	"heyo. so I’m non-binary and kind of really started to figure that out this time last year. it’s something that I’ve found a lot of acceptance and comfort in, and I’m grateful for the community you folks bring and give ❤️ 

anyway, I got a new job recently and applied with they/them pronouns, have they/them pronouns in my email signature, and was even allowed to give my workshop on how to use pronouns in the workplace that I developed for my old job (!!). the folks  here are wicked accepting, and kind, and respective of my pronouns, so I couldn’t be luckier.

but here’s the thing: although everyone is kind enough to refer to *me* with they/them pronouns, I’ll sometimes catch *myself* referring to *me* with she/her pronouns. like, I was talking about my first job as a camp counselor and I mentioned I was the “queen of the crafts cabin”, which, I was, but I couldn’t help but notice a flash of confusion pass my colleagues’ faces. and, again, when my boss (who champions my pronouns and politely tells others what they are if someone should refer to me as she/her in her presence) asked my team if one of us could do some simple in a meeting for her, I responded, “I’m your gal.” 😞

regardless, tl;dr every once in awhile I misgender myself and it feels as bad as someone else doing it. does anyone else have this problem, and are there ways to curb it, forgive yourself, etc? I’m sure this isn’t uncommon, but I just, 😔."	"I do that too. I kind of feel like it's just something that takes time to get used to. I mean, we've lived our whole lives as she/her and just recently have realized that it's not who we are. And I think internalized homophobia could also be a part of it. Anyway I hope this helps. 💛💛
I definitely still do that seven months after I've come out. Not out loud these days as I've grown used to it, but in my head I will do. They/them pronouns and gender neutral language doesn't come natural, it's something to become accustomed to even when referring to yourself since everything is so gendered. It will get less frequent! And it doesn't invalidate you in any way.
I just came out like.. within the last 2 weeks and I do it constantly. My girlfriend has started correcting me once I mentioned it to her, in an attempt to get me used to it as well. It helps I think. Don't let it invalidate you. It'll take time
Very new, keep doing it, drives me crazy!
I did it just today and I felt so silly, like I don't even know myself. But it happens to us all.
I did that in a meeting with like 20 people the other day. I wanted to crawl into a hole. But we need to give ourselves a break. Unlearning habits in all.
dang, it's comforting to see I'm truly not the only one who does this. it's true, just a big change of habits. I just wish it didn't hurt as bad :("	f8aba3	NonBinary	54	0.98	2020-02-23 14:45:28

[TW: discussion of trauma regarding dehumanization and racism] My enby roomate wants me to use it/its pronouns, and as much as I want to do it for them, or it, it triggers some dehumanization and racism trauma for me. How can I cope with this while also being respectful to my roomate?	"I've been largely trying to just stick to they/them with it/them but it wants/they want me to switch over full time and I find it hard to call someone ""it"" without feeling gross for basically dehumanizing someone, even though it/they want me to do so. It is/ They are aware that it triggers major unvibing with me from trauma related to dehumanization and racism.I don't know how to proceed. I feel like if I keep trying to bury the trauma down I will eventually associate it/them with it, but also I'd be misgendering it/them if i still use they/them.

What am I supposed to do?  


Edit: im dumb and the switch isn't full time, but the question still stands"	"as the friend this person is talking about I don't understand why their being downvoted. they want to call me by the correct pronouns (and for the record i am okay eith they/them and do not plan on switching to it/it's entirely. that being said even if i was planning on making the switch i would never ask someone to do something traumatic for them because it makes me feel better.
See a Mental healthcare professionals to help with your ongoing C-PTSD first, if you haven't go see one yet.

It's seem you have get severe trauma,
(Often under evaluated on people victims of racism).

Can you explain your friend you have traumatic experience with this term? 

And because of that you prefer to use they/them for the time being, at least until you get enough help from a mental healthcare professionals?
Not using someone's pronouns is dehumanizing. If it wants it/its pronouns, you can't hurt it by using them

Edit: someday I will be able to advocate for it/it's pronouns on a *Nonbinary sub* without getting downvoted. Y'all (not op) suck
I am. I have been.   
I have explained it to them, but I also don't want to sound like a ""cis complainer"".   


I feel stuck. I don't want to associate my roomate with my deep seated traumas that no one can properly help me with. I feel horrible.
I guess. I don't want to hurt it, but I also don't want to inevitably feel like I can't be around my roomate without astral projecting to the times I was tortured.
You are being downvoted for your callous disregard for OP's trauma.
But op will hurt themselves… which is literally what the post is about.
Do your friend say they don't understand, or have they let you understand any resentment?

Do your trauma are taken care?

You are not an horrible person, you are just someone that have been victim of trauma, and your brain react normally with a C-PTSD.

You have nothing to feel ashamed of...

If your mental healthcare professionals dismiss the gravity of your trauma, change it.
Racism is often under evaluated on the damage it caused on mental health.

Your reaction and guilt seem to be rooted more on self hatred that in something else, so again : do your friend have said anything that let you think they can't understand?
It sounds like you and your roommate have a decent relationship that has pretty good communication. Is there a chance your roommate and its pronouns could help you past some of the trauma response?

It seems like you have a safe space where you do recognize that you're not dehumanizing your roommate and it knows about your trauma and is patient and understanding. Maybe easing into using it/its pronouns could help you?

It seems like something your therapist might be able to help you navigate. But it seems like you have a supportive friend too. I hope things work out and you're able to heal more from your trauma. I know that's a lot of work, and you're making progress just by having this conversation. 💛
Me: ""you can't hurt your friend by using your friends pronouns""

You: ""this is disregarding someone's trauma""

Okay

Edit: idk why I can't reply to Beelzebub but I mean this in the nicest way possible, but that it something your friend needs to deal with if they're choosing to interact with someone who uses it/its. I am not misgendering someone because gendering it correctly makes someone else uncomfortable. That's ridiculous. Listen to yourselves. 

Respect people's pronouns. If this would be a nonsensical thing to say about she/her or he/him, why do you think it's okay to say about any other set?

Edit2: one's trauma cannot be used as an excuse to traumatize others. I'm not a scumbag. Stop responding to me when I can't even reply to you.
They haven't/it hasn't, no. They believed that they could help me cope by using a similar method as to one we employed for them not cringing when they hear their deadname used in another context, since my name is similar to theirs, they would associate hearing their deadname more to me than who they used to be.

Having chatted with them more, they said that if push comes to shove when they/them is uncomfy for them, that I can just refer them by name if i also get uncomfy. Hopefully I can use a similar strategy for other enby people who want to use it/its as well.

As for the medical professionals, they're trying, my severe bpd complicates matters further. In the end, my trauma is so unique to a majority of canadian professionals and people in general. All of my traumas are in some way or form connected to racism, so it doesnt get overlooked, i'm just one hell of a basket case.
Thanks, my roomate and I go as back as high school, before they/it had come out.

Ultimately I believe you are right, this is probably something I have to try to see my psych again about.
you're a scum bag. 

""I refuse to understand that people have trauma from racist people attempting to fucking kill them so I am not going to use a different pronoun, which the non-binary person is comfortable with being used, because why would a traumatized person have a trauma response?"" 

I don't know how to make this more clear a group of people who are referred to it by pieces of shit might not like calling other people it.
You are taken care, and you must take care of you, it's the most important thing.

And yes calling them by name is a good solution that  can avoid trigger anxiety for you and don't denie them their identity.

But don't blame yourself for your trauma.
The persons at the source of it are responsible ,not you.
I know it's easier said than done, but it's the only path to understand that kind of reaction is not your fault, if you want to be able to ""fight"" your trauma, and be able to handle this kind of situations in the future.

Understand that is not your fault is needed to aknowledge you have no control over it, and be able to regain the control on it.

You are trying to be respectful, and support your friend, but as they understand and they come with a solution that mean they care for you too.

So take your time, use their name instead of pronoun, and don't guilt trip yourself.
Thanks my guy (gender neutral)

coworkers gossiping about my pronouns and name behind my back	"Title pretty much says it all.

Found out from another coworker, D, that many of our coworkers have been making fun of and complaining about my pronouns and chosen name. D is new to the job and didn't know me before I changed my name, but now knows my deadname. 

I have never corrected someone on my pronouns at work and just assumed most people didn't pay attention to my pronouns on my email signature. But now I know they not only noticed, but have chosen to disregard it *and* complain about it with others.

This has enraged me so much I am vowing to correct people on my pronouns every time I notice. What's the most ridiculous way to do this? I'm thinking clown horn that I honk in their ears every time they get it wrong. Or hit them with glitter bombs! Or a stamp that says ""they/them"" that I smash on their faces whenever they misgender me... 

Please give me your own absurd suggestions!"	"Contact HR
This is a human rights violation and sexual harassment, and fortunately for me, for my province's laws too. Hopefully you too. Also, remember that HR is there for the company's interests, which don't always align with yours but must align with the law. Document everything.
Besides contacting HR, which you absolutely should do: the first nb person I ever worked with just straight up put a post-it note in a shared space that tallied the number of times they were misgendered. This was about a decade ago before nb pronouns had entered the national conversation so you can imagine the learning curve. It was effective af and I love it.
If they're using your correct name but not pronouns: ""Oh is there a [male/female] [name] who works here too?"" *innocent clarifying look and tone*
First def contact hr second i saw this online but every time someones family misgendered them they would use a spray bottle to spray them w a little bit of water (tho i dont recommend this bc u could easily get fired but its an idea)
I'd just never respond to anyone who deadnames or misgenders you. Doesn't matter who it is, even management. Just pretend they don't exist unless they get it right
I've heard it suggested to use the wrong pronouns for the offending parties until they get fed up or change their behavior. I've never tried this myself and I don't know if it's effective or safe. But it sounds like it could be fun to cause chaos.
Oh I will be once I'm back in the office!
Yes my workplace and location have rules/laws about this, too.

And yep, I am very aware of HR's role -- but I never tire of folks reminding each other!
Genuine question. How is this sexual harassment?
This is brilliant!
🤣 I love this approach. (Won't actually do it, but I love imagining it!)
I wouldn't actually do this, but imagining the look on coworkers faces if I misgendered them is fun
But otherwise I would just not acknowledge them until they use the right name/pronouns. Especially if it's 1:1
Unwelcome gossiping about someone's gender / sexuality creates a hostile work environment by verbally discussing someone's sexual status. Of course it depends on exactly what is being said, how frequent, what the impacts are etc. Negative discussion of what your pronouns are descends pretty quickly to what's in your pants though.
I'm a city employee, this is from our handbook:

Sexual harassment is a form of sex discrimination and is prohibited by Title VII of the 1964 Federal Civil Rights Act and the New York State Human Rights Law. Sexual harassment can occur between any individuals, regardless of their sex or gender. Sexual harassment includes harassment on the basis of sex, sexual orientation, gender identity or expression, and the status of being transgender.
Great idea. Will remember I can just exit the room in those cases!

How to be a better ally to my nb acquaintance?	"Hi, 

So I play board games every week with a group at the uni, and one of the people there is non-binary. They're amab and are male presenting, so when I first met them, I would refer to them as 'he' and they never corrected me. But one day, I specifically asked their pronouns just to double check, and they informed me that they go by 'they/ them'. I apologised for having misgendered them in the past, and asked why they hadn't corrected me. They said they felt uncomfortable correcting people. 

The thing is, pretty much everyone else at the society misgenders them because they don't realise, and people always say 'he' when we're playing games. I will always make a point of clearly saying 'they' when I refer to them, hoping that other people will hear and pick up on it, but they never do. 

I feel really bad for this person constantly being misgendered, but I'm not sure what to do about it beyond just using the correct pronouns myself. I've considered correcting people, but then I don't want to be speaking on behalf of someone else in case that would be offensive. And we're only acquaintances rather than friends, so I can't ask this person what they want me to do as I only see them when I'm playing games with them, so I wouldn't get the chance for a private conversation.

Do you think I should just leave it as it's not my place, or should I correct people next time?"	"i would ask them privately if they are comfortable with you more aggressively correcting the other people. if they are, ask how they would like you to go about doing this. if not, ask them if they are comfortable with you just using their actual pronouns. they may not be comfortable being out to a larger group of people.

oh i just saw that youre only acquaintances. i would still try to like maybe pull them aside before or after one of the group meetings to ask them.
Perhaps instead of correcting them in an obvious way ('they go by they/them actually') you can just emphasize their correct pronouns? Like

\- Where is he? 

\+ *They* must be on their way here
You ask them.

Being an ally is *never* about going off and doing your own thing. You speak to *them* and ask if *they* are comfortable being outed and having other people corrected on their behalf.

It's nice that you've come here to ask, but just ask them! They're the person you're talking on behalf of! It's not just being an ally, it's being a good friend/acquaintance too. And then you don't assume what they wanted is what the next person wants, or the *next* person, or the next... you go on treating nonbinary people as individuals. Forever and ever. Amen.
I agree with the suggestion of trying to catch the right moment to ask if they'd like you to be more forward with encouraging others to use the correct pronouns.
Before I found the confidence to correct people, even just one person in a gathering using the correct pronouns would fill my heart with the warm and fuzzy feelings. You're already being a brilliant ally~
another nice option is to ask *everyone* at the table to give their pronouns when you all sit down or start talking, start with yourself! its a great way to open things up and make sure everyone is on the same page. not as scary as it sounds once you give it a try. just a quick ""and now that we're all here can we do names and pronouns? my name is x i use blah blah pronouns"" and go around the table
Your friend has told you They Them are their pronouns. 
It is exhausting to constantly be the person who corrects. 
Speaking up and offering correct pronouns is a small act for you, and a huge support for them. 

Font make it a huge thing. 
If you had a cis woman in the group and someone used He for her you would probably just say 'she"". 

Do this for your friend. 
When they are there and when they are not. 

It will help you deconstruct the binary for self. And do a world of good for them.
The next time someone new comes to the board game group (maybe you can invite someone to join?), you could initiate introductions where everyone goes around and says their name and you can share your own pronouns and see if they would be comfortable sharing theirs to the larger group.
ask them privately if they would like it if you corrected people for them. that’s what my friends asked me and i’m so thankful they did bc i have a hard time with it as well
Just in general, to help anyone who is marginalized, ask them what would help them, don't try to figure it out or ask other folks, because no group is a monolith.   


They may not want you to do anything, given they've expressed discomfort, and that's okay too.
You could try and initiate a ‘whats ur pronouns’ introduction at one of the events - when I was teaching that’s how I got to hear and remember all the pronouns of my students. (enby myself here if that helps.)
Ask nonbinary friend explicitly, ""Would you like me to correct people when they misgender you at the table and/or in private?""

and listen to whatever their answer is.
Unfortunately I don't really have an opportunity to speak to them privately. It's quite a large group of us all in one room, and this person lives further away so they always arrive when there's lots of people already there. So I only ever speak to them with lots of people already there. Even when I initially asked their pronouns, there were a couple of others sat with us, and this person was very forward about being 'they/them', so I think they are out, just no good with conflict so they feel awkward correcting people.

I will ask them privately if I ever get the opportunity to, though. I'm just not sure if I'll get the chance given the way the room is set up.
This is a great way of handling it.
[removed]
That can backfire really hard be careful
is there any way you could try to get their cell number? that might be another option
Take them aside and speak to them privately. It's not an impossibility.

A little rant. Sorry	"If you don’t need negativity today please keep scrolling on.  

I came out to my parents about 6 months ago and not once have they used my pronouns, they still call me their daughter and really seem unwilling to change. 
Due to health issues I had been living with them for a month and every time I heard she it made me feel sick, but I think I eventually got used to it. 
I moved back home this week and met a friend for coffee today who instantly used my pronouns and it has hit me now how much that month at home affected me. I’m starting to consider moving forwards in my transition but I don’t even know how to start. 
I’m so anti confrontation but I can’t keep being misgendered. I know I need to start standing up for my self but I had hoped that my sister would have at least once.  I understand that it takes time to get it right but it’s like they’re not even trying. I don’t know what to do anymore."	"Solidarity. 

My mom called my preferred name and pronouns imaginary. When I get mail with my preferred name on it she loudly proclaims ""your evil twin has mail.""
I still get my child's pronouns wrong about half the time and have to correct myself. 

After hearing how badly it's affected you I'll redouble efforts. They say they don't mind which we use but prefer they/them/child if we can get it right. I think they are just been nice to us.
I'm sorry you have to experience this.
I understand your situation. Tho, I use any pronouns (but he or they sound cool too) and I know I could never come out to my family. They already think I am lesbian (I'm aroace) and it seems like they don't understand asexuality no matter how I try to explain it. 
I have celiac disease and okay, the diagnose is only 2 months old.. but they can't even understand something as simple as this? And this time their not understanding is kinda life threatening to me..? It's been 2 months and they have full access to the internet. Why am I the one who needs to explain over and over again that I F king can't eat gluten whatsoever?
I doubt they would understand I'm not a girl, actually.
I'm sorry. That really sucks. I hope they come around. I live with family too and although they accept me (I dress more feminine, wear makeup, etc. But my moms side are old Filipina ladies and I think in her head she lumps trans and gay people together. Like she's kind ignorant about it all. My dad doesn't live here but I told him too and he told me I'll always be James to him (I think he was trying to be positive) and I said, ""thankfully I don't care too much about pronouns or changing my name at the moment so I guess there's no problem. But I'd hope if it meant something to me you'd respect it and and address me differently.""

It's weird because they accept me more than I thought they would. Like it's not really an issue too much...but I wish they understood more. And I wish your family did too. They don't understand how important this is to us and how much it affects us. I hope everything gets better for you. ❤
I can't order a binder because I brought them up once and my mum screeched about how unnatural they are...
a lot of parents see their children as property not people, it’s about getting what THEY wanted instead of who YOU are, it’s like talking to a brick wall convincing them otherwise. i cut them all off and then started transitioning because i am my own person and i am allowed to live my life the way i want to. regardless of what anyone has to say. seems to me they don’t care about your identity and if it’s what you want go ahead and move on with transitioning you can’t live your life the way others want or you’ll just be miserable and the relief of being correctly gendered and being comfortable in your own body is above all
Family can be hard to deal with, depending on if you keep them in your life or not. Hopefully they come around at some point.
This is most of my friends sadly (not my family yet cuz I'm not out)

But yea somehow most of my friends are straight gamer boys somehow (probs cuz im the emo ""girl"") and they don't even try to use my correct pronouns
Hey, yeah i know how much this hurts and im sorry you're dealing with this. I've come out a few times since 2020 and i came out as different things so fair enough that was confusing but i specifically amd definitely have said every time that im not a girl or female and i dont like being referred to as such but thats exactly what im called. Ive kinda given up for now at correcting them but i feel so shit every time they misgender me because i can see that they're not trying at all even though they claim to accept me and im going to sit them all down and address it one day soon because we're human beings, we understand ourselves better than anyone else and we deserve to be respected.
I hate when I read this kind of things because this is the reason why I did not came out with my mom yet, I decided to move from her house a few years ago, but when I go to her house I feel really bad cause I don't like to hide my life. She is constantly pointing out that she do not like that I use nail polish or dye my hair but she is ""ok"" because I have a GF, not knowing that I'm pan and feel genderless.

Patience and talk, I think is the way, for now.
I have a they/them coffee mug. Quietly drinking coffee as others sort out their own issues.
God that must be horrible. I’m so sorry you have to deal with that. 
It breaks me that the people who chose to bring us into the world and are supposed to love unconditionally can be so hurtful and damaging
I'm sorry that has happened to you. :/
I obviously don’t speak for everyone who uses different pronouns, so where it affects me it genuinely might not be as big a concern for someone else. But the fact your willing to try will be noticed and I’m sure appreciated
I’m sorry that you understand and I wish you didn’t. I think that is a massive part of the problem with my family is that they don’t seem to want to research or ask questions, like I wouldn’t mind them asking questions and getting stuff wrong at least they would hear my version of my life but they don’t seem to want to know. I don’t need them to understand everything but just for them to try. I’m also ace so I understand the frustration too about people not getting it. 

I was investigated for coeliacs last month and had to do the gluten free diet for a few weeks and my mum was the same- I think because gluten free diets because a bit popular they forget that coeliacs is life threatening and it took me being incredibly blunt (probably quite rude tbh) for her to understand that if I was diagnosed a little bit of gluten wasn’t an option. The second I had it ruled out it was like thank god because you were horrible to deal with lest week. I hope they start to understand how serious it can be and somehow can support you in managing it
I can’t imagine how confusing some kind of half acceptance is (if that’s the right way to put it) I hope they come round too and understand your still you and accept how you are now.
That sucks, I wish they could understand that we wouldn’t be binding if we had a choice you know.  
most places have discreet packaging now or could you get one sent to a friend?
I don’t currently have the guts to do that but massive props to you for putting yourself first
Thank you,  I don’t think I have the guts to cut them out completely so hopefully they will.
I’m sorry,  hopefully you can find support in others. I know it’s easier said than done but know there is a community out there that will be accepting
I hope when you have the conversation it goes well and they are accepting.
I hate that we have to accept being a palatable version of ourselves to deal with family
It does suck. I've learned to be more quiet. I get little joys over things like getting nonbinary squishmallows from my partner with him saying ""they reminded me of you"". 

Makes it even worse when she is 100% okay with my other trans friends and respects their names and pronouns.
I see we are almost on the same boat, heh. Yeah, I do hope for anyone struggling like this with their own family that it will get better. I'm at college now, so I'm not at home that often. In that case I can finally have proper gluten free kitchen. Tho, I still need to be careful because I share kitchen with whole bunch of people from the same floor, so the contamination is almost inevitable. Luckily when the cross contamination happens I don't have noticable symptoms. But I think it still does skme damage, tho..

and about the GF diet being popular - I told my father since I visit them from time to time too and he actually got on that trend train too. I mean, you do you and it's kinda bonus for me because I bet he did his research in such a diet. Now he can read more about the actual disease.
Ya and if she notices me wearing it then what? It will be a huge fight
Thats totally valid. I cut mine out about a decade ago and I’ll tell you parts of it aren’t easy.
Thank you lolz
How adorable of your partner. I need to find some thing that brings me joy 

It sucks that the best options are to quieten who you are, I had a conversation with my (not so great) therapist before coming out to my parents about how I was terrified that despite knowing they are accepting of trans people that it would be different being their kid. I hate that I was right to have that fear that I thought was so irrational-and that others are living through it too.  I just don’t understand how my identity and pronouns unacceptable in comparison to a friends.
I’m sorry NON BINARY SQUISHMALLOWS!!
Sorry you had to do that, but glad you were able to put yourself first.
I have a few theories. One of them being with all the information on trans bodies and dysphoria and such, that they may see it as another ""you've failed me in this way"" kind of thing. I think they're taking it personally, as an attack on them as parents, instead of accepting that we are fully functional humans who can have our own wants, needs opinions and beliefs. 

I think they're too caught up in making it about themselves ""I was a good mom, how can you do this?"" ""I gave you that name, how dare you dislike it"" kind of thoughts. 

This is coming from my own thought process when I was pregnant with my first child. My thoughts were ""if my child is trans, if they're born in the wrong body, a body that my own helped grow for 9 months, would that mean I failed them? Does it mean that I've, unintentionally caused them suffering and pain?"" Ultimately I decided no. But it was a long process getting there.
Yes [nonbinary squishmallows ](https://squishmallowsquad.fandom.com/wiki/Category:Non-binary)
Not only are there non-binary squishmallows, but one of them (Meadow) comes in the 24-inch size on the Costco website for way cheaper than other sites and is delightfully giant. I have them and use them to prop myself up when I’m sitting up in bed.
Oh it’s totally fine. Just don’t let them get you down too much.
That makes a lot of sense,especially with how my parents react to other things when they come up. 
I think I have been kind of selfish in my way of thinking about it because I know for me someone’s identity is theirs and my only involvement is to be respectful and supportive. I forget that I’m so immersed in queer culture and have so much visibility of the community that other people don’t, so everything is going to be more shocking and confusing for them.
I have some squishmallows and Meadow is actually the one I want! I’m in the UK though so no Costco
ahh I hope you’re able to get them soon!!

Cis gay white man coworker misgendering me	So there’s this cis gay white man I work with and he knows my pronouns (they/them) but still is misgendering me. Before I brought up to him my pronouns we were pretty good friends. Then I started a conversation about how i’m non-binary and feel uncomfortable being msigendered as “her” and how i only use they then pronouns. A couple minutes later he said something about me and in that statement called me “her.” I was so shocked i didn’t even correct him. I’m so tired of the privilege of cis gay white men. He never had a hard time coming out and his mom was accepting. I can’t relate and he misgendered me the other day again, I know I need to say something but it’s like why should I have to? Get with it! I feel like the misgendering hurts even worse when it’s someone else who is LGBTQ— anyone else relate?	"I had a lesbian manager who would purposely misgender me and apply female stereotyping to my behaviour because she was gay but attracted to me (I can't help being hot), so she'd misgender me. 

She got in trouble for doing this with me and being very inappropriate to another gay girl at work. Guess who doesn't work for the company anymore.
As a trans man working in a gay coffee shop, I absolutely hate the audacity of these cis gays calling me ""giiiirrrl"" just because it's ""their culture"" or something. I have politely asked many gay men to not use cis colloquial gay language with me, but they just updated themselves by adding ""and I use girl with everyone"" after each time they she/her/girl/queen me. I'm just like. Can you not.
Cis gays are the least tolerant imo.
> I feel like the misgendering hurts even worse when it’s someone else who is LGBTQ— anyone else relate?

Yes and no. I find it more annoying because of a ""you should know better"" feeling. But I also find it a lot less stressful to bring it up and have a conversation about it. Also because of a ""you should know better"" feeling.
Are you sure it is intentional? I go by they/them and I will sometimes screw up pronouns for others myself. It isn’t on purpose and I correct myself. It is just very hard to unlearn years of ingrained ways of speaking with pronouns.

As a result, I let people use my AGAB pronouns as I know what I look like… even if I would prefer they/them. Not saying you need to do that, but I am saying it could be unintentional.

All my very best….
I know it's a pain and you shouldn't have to do it, but correct him **every time**. Consider whether you need to have a longer discussion and/or if it would be helpful to bring in management. I know that's not always the best choice for everyone, but if it's a route you choose, it's best to have specific documentation (dates, times, etc.) of the misgendering. I'm sorry you're going through this!
[removed]
I had a trans coworker that couldn't understand when I said I was not binary, she was also white and said I had to pick one boy or girl. She went on about how hard it was for her to pass and all the work she put in, she also was very conservative and didn't like the LGBT community.
oh wow 🙄the “i can’t help being hot part”😂😂i felt that lol at least she doesn’t work there anymore
""I can't help being hot"" OWN THAT SHIT PAL
oh my gosh yes my one coworker kept on doing this to my other coworker who is also a trans man… and i kept telling her to stop it was so uncomfortable
That’s so fucking obnoxious. I frequently use terms like “dude”, “bro” and “Hermano” in a completely gender neutral way, but you bet your fucking ass I’m not doing that when referring to someone who it could bother. And IF it were to hypothetically slip out, I wouldn’t be like “sorry dawg, I’m from Madrid, we call everyone hermano, sure sucks to be you”.
Ah yes ""their"" culture as if they didn't just steal it whole cloth from POC queer people only to turn around and act like it was theirs the whole time 🙄
I think it is intentional, since i’ve said multiple times i use they/them pronouns and have talked about being non-binary and he never uses them. I’ve never corrected him exactly and confronted him, but i’ve said in conversation to him that i don’t want to be called she/her and only want to be called they/them. That’s the way i usually feel comfortable “correcting” someone at my work about my pronouns. Instead of saying “i use they/them” in response to misgendering i like to have a non related conversation about it and hope they get the point and respect it. The one time I had a whole conversation that went on for about 5 minutes of me saying i’m non binary and don’t want to be called she/her, etc, i go by they/them, etc and he proceeded to call me “she” right after that conversation. The next time he misgendering me i’m going to confront it  directly in the conversation, but it really just makes for an uncomfortable experience and he knows i use they/them so im not sure if he will start.
I think it says something that only a few minutes after the OP corrected him, he got it wrong. That shows he's not paying attention to what they say, and that's not okay. It's different if you don't know, and it's different if you catch yourself. if you're misgendering someone all the time, and you don't think about it, it's a lack of effort.

I also trip up with people's pronouns, but I think as long as I realize I did it and make an effort to not do it in the future, it will be okay. Sometimes you just make a mistake, and that's fine, as long as you correct yourself and don't do it again.

I treat my pronouns in the same way. If someone misgenders me and corrects themself,  I have no problem with it. However, if someone consistently misgenders me, whether intentionally or not, that's not okay. At that point, it's either transphobia or a lack of respect and effort, and either way, they are in the wrong. I don't let people use my AGAB pronouns if I've already told them that I use they/them, because what would be the point of that? That's not going by they/them, that's using mixed pronouns to cater to others (mixed pronouns are obvs cool, but only doing so for others isn't).

TLDR: Even if it is unintentional, that signals a lack of effort, which is a problem by itself. There is no excuse to consistently misgender people when you know their pronouns.
Thank you for the advice! It seems like the best idea going forth. Honestly, i have a lot of coworkers misgender me. I only really emphasize any of my pronouns with LGBTQ+ people. Unfortunately i get not everyone’s gonna understand and so i don’t always push the issue with non LGBTQ people (although i should and might in the future, it’s just a constant fight). It’s just like i was friends with him but am not cool with another queer!! person misgnedering me. I already am going through enough with my family that queer people in particular shouldn’t be putting me through more stress. I’ll talk to him about it and he keeps doing it i just don’t want to be friends with him
The point isn’t to say that this group isn’t marginalized. As someone who is also bisexual and trans/nb, I know the struggles of multiple parts of being queer. There are some people who are gay or bi for example who are not allies to other identities of the LGBTQ+ community and that is the point. You would think after that being marginalized they would know what it feels like. In my opinion, i think it is privilege. In the case of my coworker, he said he didn’t really have a hard time with his family or a lot of people accepting his sexuality. Not to say he hasn’t at all experienced difficulty but it’s been rather easy for him. Comparatively, I struggle with having to disown my whole family to the point it causes major depression. So the fact that he can afford to not care and misgendering me shows that he really just doesn’t care and can afford to not care.
I don't actually feel that way but apparently I am? It wasn't the first unwanted attention and it probably won't be the last. It's just sad, because people like that just encourage homophobia
How can you tell if it could Bother someone or not ? Genuine question
I think your plan sounds like a good one. It would be good to hear the issue and, if it is not unintentional, I would go to HR for support.

Best to you….
Ok but like especially the comment that says that cis gays are the least accepting can be really harmful. Cis gay people are still an oppressed group and they're not uniquely bigoted compared to cis people of other sexualities, but it seems like a lot of non-gay nonbinary people treat them like they are. Like do you realize how isolating that can be to a lot of nonbinary people who are gay or lesbian? A lot of us, especially nonbinary, transfem, and gender variant lesbians, are called aggressive and mean by other LGBT people and completely excluded from the trans community when we call out homophobia or set any sort of boundary. Yes, being nonbinary is important to me but ultimately what people are going to see first and what I and many other nonbinary gay people need support for is that we're gay, and we don't get that support from other nonbinary people. Some of you really need to learn that yes, gay doesn't erase cis and white but cis and white don't erase gay either (also the fact that a lot of people complaining about cis white gays are literally also cis and/or white never fails to be hilarious).
Besides my other reply, I just want to address what you said about how your coworker has had it easy as a gay man because I'm not sure that's as true as you're saying it is.

First of all, you don't know everything that goes on in his daily life and he might not be comfortable telling you, especially when it really seems like you talk about gays and lesbians like we're some privileged monolith.

Second, even if his life as a gay man actually HAS been as easy as you seem to think it is, you really need to understand that most gay people haven't had a similar experience. I'm a nonbinary lesbian and while I have definitely faced some pretty serious transphobia, being a lesbian takes priority for me most of the time and has been more formative to my experiences. Since I don't want to go on T, am somewhat feminine presenting, and am fairly closeted as nonbinary, being able to pass as cis is actually fairly easy for me. 

But being able to pass as straight takes active, conscious, exhausting effort. Any sort of gender nonconformity I display is read as gay, and being gender nonconforming as someone who's perceived as a woman is often literally just existing in your natural, unaltered, most comfortable state. Being able to pass as cis often just means allowing myself to be misgendered, which I'm not denying how painful that can be, but being able to pass as straight means I have to actively lie about my past and pretend I've had more involvement with men than I actually have, put way more conscious effort into my appearance, make up some bs about why I'm not interested in finding a boyfriend or husband, and watch literally every single word in any conversation that has any mention of partners, crushes, dating, or plans for the future. I came out as a wlw first, and that has led to way more active rejection, judgment, and scrutiny from many people around me than coming out as nonbinary. It meant I lost friends, it meant I had to disown a significant portion of my family, it almost got me fired, it's meant I have to closely watch anything I do or say around women and children so I'm not perceived as a predator, it means I'm scrutinized and profiled like a man and rejected from womanhood but I still face all the same misogyny as a cishet woman, it means I constantly have to overcompensate for any gender nonconformity I display so people don't ridicule me for being a stereotype, it means people throw a tantrum when I'm not a complete doormat, it means constant stereotypes and double standards, it means I can't get married in my religion, it means fetishization and sexual harassment, it means having my relationship treated completely differently because it might make someone uncomfortable but nobody gives a second thought to blabbering to me about every graphic detail of their straight relationship for hours on end whether I want to hear it or not. 

And on top of that gays and lesbians are still alienated and attacked within the LGBT community, not just by cishets. Scrutinized and shamed for having any sort of sexual boundaries, told we have monosexual and allosexual privilege, told that expressing our love and attraction makes aces uncomfortable, told that we're not inclusive enough because we're not into all genders. We're harassed, alienated, and excluded just for standing up for ourselves or prioritizing our own needs, accused of being biphobic just for talking about the difficulties that come with not being m/w attracted, told we're being biphobic or transphobic for pointing out that it's not a privilege to be hypervisible or that being in a straight appearing relationship comes with a lot of benefits that we don't have access to and never will. Lesbians especially are treated like aggressive, mean harpies by other members of the community and experience constant boundary violations and double standards that don't happen anywhere near the same extent to men or straight women, and trans and nonbinary gay people are constantly treated like we need to choose between our gender and our sexuality by other trans people who seem to see gays and lesbians as their enemies and then we also have to deal with cis bisexuals acting like being bi means they automatically understand our experience better than cis gay people do.
If I already know they’re non binary or trans af is pretty much the only way. Most trans people I interact with has either been online (where I use gender neutral unless pronouns are listed) or in real life, where I’ve always just kinda been told before hand.
You make a lot of great points. I hear what you’re saying. But i also think that we need to focus on accountability to everyone in the LGBTQ+ community to be inclusive, regardless of if the people being transphobic are gay, bi, ace, are, etc. Whatever it would be. It is not cool to be one part of the community and not support others, something which unfortunately happens a lot. And yes, as you are saying, it is not to say that one part of the community struggles more or is more marginalized, but we all need to hold each other accountable to be allie’s of spaces we are not. I think just me personally i have heard of a lot of white gay cis men that have not been allie’s to trans and non binary people. I have heard the stories countless times. That’s why i made this post to bring awareness that there needs to be more accountability and education. Not to say that cis gay white men aren’t marginalized at all (but they are objectively as a group comparatively privileged as someone who is cis, white, and a man)yet the ones who are transphobic need to do better. I actually have been kicked out and homeless just for coming out as bi, so i know that sexuality can be a harrowing experience to naviagate. But if i was cis it would never be okay for me to not be an ally to someone who isn’t.
Oh okay that makes sense, I thought u meant someone looks non binary or not
You're right, more privileged people in the community do need to do better at being allies...but that goes both ways. I've seen plenty of cis passing nonbinary people act like butch lesbians and femme gay men are privileged over them, for example, or like gay people are automatically seen as more socially acceptable. I'm sorry but if someone is an afab, feminine presenting she/they dating a cis man, a cis butch lesbian with a girlfriend is pretty much always going to be more vulnerable than them and, at least visually, less heteronormative. There are butches who don't identify as trans or nonbinary but use masc names, who bind or pack, who use all pronouns, who shave their heads. At that point it doesn't really matter what either person calls themselves, it matters how other people perceive them.

Filled out paper work for work to be seen as non-binary	"I filled out paperwork at my job as I am non-binary and want to be addressed as such only for my leaders to constantly use the wrong terms even after correcting them multiple times. 
Today at work the leader who does it the most often went 
""Hey Lady, do you mind doing this for me?"" And I responded with 
""Not a lady but I got you! Remember I'm non-binary and this is the fifth time you've misgendered me"" only to be apologized with 
""Im sorry Ms. X"" 
It's even more annoying cause my company will have ads running how inclusive it is to work here.

Do I look like a girl :| or was the mf who called me one just a blind bat or what 💀 ruined my day fr. If I do look like a girl- any tips on how not to? Sick of being misgendered 24/7.		"You Look very AMAB/masc to me! 
That person was asleep and saw the hair maybe and forgot that lots of AMAB folks have long hair 🤔
Years ago I would hide my long hair up under my cap because I was pumping gas for a living. At the time I wasn't trying to do nothing I thought I was cis and I was just doing my job. 
But because I had on the polo shirt for the uniform  had a cap and was pumping gas people misgendered me all the time! 

Especially old men! They dont even really look at someone they just make quick assumptions based off of their stupid biases. 

I hope your day gets better 💓
look pretty androgynous to me
Don't know if it will change much, but wearing eyebrow liner and thickening up my brows helps me feel more masc presenting. You look great btw, and don't let the idiots get to you. *Hugs*
This picture does strike me as AMAB personally :)

A lot of people assume people are girls just because of hair which is bizzare, and the masculine version of long hair is usually mistreated locks. 


I guess the only tip I could give is maybe a bulky chain/necklace..? 

I can't tell, you look amazing.
You look androgynous to me. Like, right in the middle of AFAB and AMAB.
1 is very masc, 10 is very fem. 3
Just from your face I would 100% assume you were a guy.
You have quite a masc face shape - square. And the rest of your features are very neutral. I don’t see how you were misgendered, they truly must just be as blind as a bat lmao
That mf was trolling you. I don’t know if you’re consciously going for androgyny, but you look pretty androgynous to me. Some people look androgynous in a way that seems like they were born without a gender. Others seem androgynous in a way that’s kind of a mix of elements. That’s what these pics look like to me. Leaning masc. Either way you look like you’re fully inhabiting yourself just as you are and I’m celebrating you for that right now!
Not at all but i can see your hair is both longer and a little curly, and ive found in my own experiences people tend to gender curly hair as feminine, so w the mask i can see the mistake, but without, idk how youd look that much like a girl.
If you haven't mentioned I wouldn't have thought about it. But sadly I sometimes thought from a fellow enby that they were a girl before a friend told me as I was dumb. 
But nonetheless, hope your day will be better than this.
Important reminder - if people can't figure it out and guess, they have a *50% chance of being correct* (at guessing your AGAB).

This happens more often than you think.
Aw thanks so much qwq a lot of people tend to think I’m ASMAB which is kinda what I’m going for even if I’m Agender lmao 💖💖 appreciate it :)) 💗💞
:D 💖
Awe 🥺 *hugs back*
Aw thanks :)) 💞
Oo :o thankie
Ay 👀🤌✨

I think I need a new job	"I put my pronouns (they/them) on my nametag at work, and even tho my boss could see them he kept using she/her pronouns right in front of me. And he was super judgemental and kept questioning me about my identity and pronouns. And he said no one will care in the real world and that college should be prepping me for the real world and it obviously isn't in his opinion.

It pissed me off that he was intentionally misgending me at work while talking to our new hire. So, I think I need a new job because my boss is a major dick."	"Do you work at or live in a place with anti-discrimination and/or harassment policies?  What he is doing is harassment.

You might not need a new job, but a new boss would be good change.
That's so fucking shitty im sorry.
Mmm, no, I'm with you. In the ""real world"" I get very prompt apology emails at work when I correct pronouns and when I had to pull in the head of school to a conversation with my kid's teachers she was livid. Even when people in general around me/us get it wrong, it's not on *purpose* so much as that breaking the binary breaks their brains a little and they are legitimately struggling.
For sure get a new job 👍
You should start mosg3ndering him and see what he says aha
If you can find a new job that respects you, great... but many people don't have a choice.
I'm sure there are policies against what he's doing, but at the same time, I don't want to get him in trouble because he's an otherwise great boss. It doesn't help that I'm a people pleaser and want to avoid all conflict tho.
Obviously, that job isn't for me. Don't get me wrong, I love the job itself, but I won't stand for homophobic/enbyphobic comments in my place of work.
Exactly! Struggling, I can understand, but when someone blatantly misgenders me or anyone else, it's not okay. Like I told my bff that if she struggled I didn't care, as long as she tried. Same thing with my bf. My pronouns are in all my email signatures for school and on my nametag for work, but if you make a mistake, I'll gently correct you unless you're being a blatant asshole.
He's not a great boss if he's actively harming you.

If you do not feel comfortable with a complaint, and you do leave, please consider telling HR that you left because of his behavior.  If you're in a location with a civil rights office, please consider talking to them.
I agree with u/6eyedwonder - he's actually not a great boss, this disgusting behaviour is revealing his true colours. Any consequences that follow are entirely on him so you shouldn't feel bad about reporting him - he's getting himself into trouble, not you. 

I know it's easier said than done but none of this is your fault so why should you have to leave the job you enjoy and go through the stress & hassle of finding a new one?? 

A couple years ago there was a similar situation at my work. A couple managers had been making horrible sexist jokes & comments over a period of a few months, multiple people reported them to HR and they got a talking to. There was an almost instant change in their behaviour.

Not sure of the exact anti-discrimimation laws where you are but here in Australia gender identity is a protected attribute and it's illegal for a workplace and anyone in that workplace to discriminate/harrass/bully on the basis of gender identity. There would definitely be grounds for disciplinary action if my boss was doing to me what yours is doing to you. 

I hate confrontation and reporting things like this makes me super anxious but I wouldn't let anybody at work get away with that bullshit. I suppose my anger in those situations outweighs my anxiety haha.

Anyway, I would have a chat with HR to find out about the reporting process in your organisation. I hope you can get it sorted out 💜
And you shouldn't. People saying shit about the ""real world"" is such condescending BS, a blatant excuse to be phobic. 🔪🔪🔪 youre in college AND you work, how much more in the real world can u be? Its totally meaningless.
My main fear is that even after talking to someonen higher up, nothing is going to change. When I was in high school I was sexually harassed by a manager and a coworker at a different job, and when I went forward with it (albeit not for 2ish years), nothing happened. The general manager didn't talk to them and HR didn't do anything.

Until last year, it was legal in the US (which is where I live) to be fired on the basis of being LGBTQ+ so that's another fear I have. I totally get what y'all are saying, but my fears outweigh my anger as opposed to it being the other way around.

Another worry I have is that if I do complain about what happened, there will be some form of retaliation from my boss. We only have three employees besides my boss, so it'll be very easy to determine who said something. So, I'm worried that he'd get angry and retaliate.

I completely agree that his behaviour is unacceptable, but the US is a shitty place to live and work and there are so many homophobic people in this world. I work 2 jobs while going to university, so I can't afford to be fired or just quit without another job in the works. Ideally, I'd find a job in my career area (therapy), but most won't hire me without at least my bachelor's degree.

I appreciate both of you and what y'all have said, but my fears outweigh my anger/discomfort. I just don't know what I'm going to do at this point. I know everyone on campus is a lot more accepting of LGBTQ+ people and I love that, and now that I'm mostly out, people don't really misgender me. Like I said in a previous comment, if it were just that he was struggling, I probably wouldn't have even said anything on here, because I completely understand struggling. But it was just so blatant after he told me he saw my pronouns.
Totally understand, it is a shitty situation and I'm sorry you have to deal with it. None of us should have to. Ultimately your safety is most important so do whatever you feel you can/need to. 

I've had my pronouns in my work email signature for about a year now but it seems it's basically invisible lol. And I suck at correcting people when they use the wrong pronouns :/ I find it much easier to call people out when they're being blatantly & intentionally transphobic especially when it's not directed at me, which is great I guess, standing up for my fellow trans folk and all. But then there's me... Mx Doormat 😅

I would probably be more open about my identity at work and more consistent with making sure people use the right pronouns if the colleagues I work closest with hadn't been massive arseholes a few years ago when I sent them an email in response to some insensitive comments made at a work lunch. I didn't accuse anyone of anything, it was more of a ""hey, just letting you guys know that thing that was talked about at the lunch yesterday kinda hurt so please be more mindful when discussing that topic. here are some useful links to find out more about it, happy to discuss"". 

One colleague was actually nice, apologised to my face and thanked me for letting her know (she doesn't work with us any more unfortunately). The other two (who do still work with us.. unfortunately) sent me replies picking apart my email line by line and telling me how everything I said was wrong and that if I want people to learn about stuff then the links I give them need to be more reputable than a random article and a wiki page - ""something like the Ted Talk video I would watch, but I'm not reading those other things"", one of them said. As if it's MY fucking job to educate everyone on how not to be a transphobic asshat! 

They never spoke to me for the rest of the day and I think I ended up taking a couple days of sick leave because I couldn't handle what they'd done. Our then-supervisor was part of the email so she saw everything but gave minimal support. 

I know I should've brought up the issue with them verbally first but I wasn't out at all back then, I was in a pretty bad place actually, and didn't have anyone outside work to talk through my feelings after that lunch (if I had I probably wouldn't have sent the email at all). I can't speak when these kinds of things happen, it's easier for me to write my thoughts & feelings so that's what I did, under the impression that these people would care since they'd known me for about 3+ years at that point. Lmaooo big mistake.

I was also sexually harassed at the same workplace a couple years before that incident & didnt report it because one time it happened right in the middle of the office and a number of colleagues saw/heard but did nothing, never checked up on me after. I was way too shaken up after that incident and the transphobic crap to be able to do something about it at the time (the disgusting man who harassed me left not long after so maybe someone did report him idk) so I definitely understand your apprehension. 

I'm still not really out at work yet because of those arseholes. And even though our organisation is very inclusive & lgbtqi+ friendly, and very open about being so, I don't feel safe in my department. Or in the organisation as a whole tbh since they don't acknowledge the 'a' in any of our branding/info packs/leaflets/pride & awareness day things etc. I've wanted to bring it up for a long time but I don't feel like I can or should. I mean, anti-discrimination laws don't stop people from being arseholes so they're still very much present in my workplace too. I feel like companies love waving around the rainbow flag & telling everyone they're sooo inclusive & make sure all employees know about the laws & do training etc because it's a good look - the actual culture of these places is still vile. It's just ticking boxes and slapping a rainbow on everything 🙄

Sorry I ramble too much! 🙈 

Anyway! I'm sorry you're dealing with this crap and I hope it gets better. I know it might not count for much but you're definitely not alone and I'll be sending you good vibes through the interwebz 😊💕"	lsnuan	NonBinary	47	0.95	2021-02-26 02:42:21
Do you like being asked your pronouns?	"Saw this being discussed over at /r/ftm and the overwhelming majority was no - felt invasive, like being singled out (lots of situations where these folks' being asked felt singled out, like they were not cis-passing. Obviously you want to ask everyone and avoid sitations of singling others' out, especially in a public space) and obviously, people's reactions are going to be different, depending on trasition/gender goals. Some people who want to be cis-passing find the question distressing. So I was curious to see how my fellow enby's might answer this question 

I am currently going through a whole thing with pronouns on name tags at work, and I've been processing a lot of feelings on it. I have a relatively new coworker who started doing that, and then I offered to take a tag, because the constant misgendering was driving me crazy and I wanted to support my coworker, and then it turned into A Thing™ and uppermanagement is considering name tags with pronouns for everyone (or those who want them, with an opt out option). The store is mostly in favor, but also mostly cis people who dont have a stake in this conversation. 

The other handful of trans people at my store are for it as well. And I know I've been uncomfortable with people asking me in the past, because, yes, I have been singled out. But this is also a social change I'm fighting for, and trying to make people more comfortable. But if its not working for us....idk, is there something better? 


TL;DR - The question in the title "	"YES, PLEASE, FOR THE LOVE OF GOD. /Everyone/ guesses the wrong set for me and no one ever asks. I feel like people who bitch about getting asked their pronouns are people who usually pass (and are in identities that have a ""pass"") and don't understand at all what it's like for the rest of us when they go on about how ""rude"" it is to ask.

Side note, about the nametag thing - expect most customers to not even notice. I've worn pronoun pins and the like around and it's... not really understood at all.
YES please please please ask me. You don't know anyones pronouns without asking or being told, and I'm only likely to offer them to people I'm comfortable with. If you ask me, I know you're aware of the fact that my pronouns might not be the same as my body type implies, and will be more comfortable asking you to use they/them. 
Edit to add: I REALLY like the idea of pronouns printed on name tags, especially if EVERYONE uses them! Cis folks can help normalize conversations about pronouns this way :)
It's definitely situational, but overall, *very* no. Especially in a public place or at someone's work (and even more so if they're not out), it can make them uncomfortable at best and put them in danger at worst. It's *much* better to volunteer your own pronouns, which gives them the opportunity to volunteer theirs, without forcing them to either misgender or out themselves.
I think everyone should normalize pronouns, telling people their own then asking for a new person’s if they have the spoons to do so, especially cis people.

I went to a gym that had a circle and everyone had to give their name and pronouns and goddamn it was nice for that to just be an everyone thing.
I'm not out, but if someone were to ask for my pronouns in a conversation, I'm willing to share that with them. It admittedly still throws me off, but I know that they're usually coming from a good place (I've yet to meet anyone who's used that for nefarious means). For me, it's definitely an indicator that I can at least trust that I'm in a safer space due to the fact that they actually asked this (because hey, it's really not a norm). I can say, ""Yeah, I prefer they/them.""

Call me idealistic, but I really do think a workplace or a school environment that do consider people's pronouns can create that safer space I mentioned. Your peers are more aware, you're not going to be as stressed and struggling with dysphoria. There will be slip-ups, but there's now an introduction of using people's wanted pronouns. It's normalizing the idea that not everyone fits into the gender binary which, yes, *is* going to take a lot of getting used to for cis people in particular… but that doesn't mean it's going to be a step backwards either.

It's each to their own, and I do understand why FtM/MtF may be uncomfortable with being asked this. But I think in the particular case for enbies, we're probably a very enthusiastic YES!, haha.
I always feel awkward when people ask what pronouns I prefer. The honest answer is that I have no pronoun preference, but that always confuses people when tell them that. 
I commented on the ftm thread. I’m a dude, but to me gender really doesn’t exist (mild autism) so the base of my identity in non binary. I’ve never gotten mad at someone saying, “Hey! Let me respect you! Gender and gender expression are different, so I really can’t assume anything based on your appearance.” When I was pre T and now 9 months on T and  post top, I really don’t care as long as the intentions are good. I do understand feeling clocked or not “man enough” (stupid term but you know what I mean), I felt that a lot, but people are trying their best to be supportive of the queer community and I’m not trying to shoot them down when plenty of people hate us already. 
If I have to use the correct pronouns, and also I can’t ask what is correct, how do I interact with other queer people??
Also many mentioned it wasn’t okay to use gender neutral pronouns if you aren’t sure and that is extremely confusing to me. 
I've used they/them outside of work for about five years now and still have no idea how to get co-workers to use them without being the weird one for bringing it up, so yes please.
I would say if you're going to ask someone privately, sure. But DO NOT ask them in a public setting with many people around.

It's also in the way the question is phrased. Obviously just a ""Hey, by the way, what are your pronouns?"" Is a lot better than ""Hey, sorry, but I'm just having trouble figuring out this whole gender thing you've got going on. What are your PREFERED pronouns? Sorry for asking it's just so confusing ugh.""


Yes! With some caveats: the person asking is respectful and willing to accept my answer AND I am speaking to them one on one. That lets me control the interaction a little more. In the end I like it because that shows me that I might be passing as androgynous/a confusion.

If I was in a group, I would feel singled out and awkward but I’ve gotten comfortable saying “my pronouns are they/them” when doing introductions going around the room style. Only if I know I have multiple friends in that room who consistently get my pronouns right though.
Nah, but I don't really like any pronouns for myself. I've (somewhat) jokingly told my close friends to use ""it"". Having pronouns for me just means having to have more conversations I don't want to have, so feel free to make things up.
I want to be asked cause even though I am nb trans I do not /look/ visibly trans so there’s always an assumption of pronouns which is usually just tolerated. So whenever people ask I’m so touched.
Please ask my pronouns! I am pretty okay with she, which most people assume for me, but I want to live in a world where people don't assume. A world where we all get an opportunity to define ourselves, rather than having people guess, is a better one.

If somebody were obviously doing it in a ""you are visibly trans and I am singling you out"" way that's one thing, but just in conversation ""So... sorry, 'cuse me, what're your pronouns?... so they were saying that..."" is totally cool.
For me it really depends on the setting, situation, and the response. 

I might be fine in the asking process, but then made uncomfortable if too many cis people respond with ""I don't care"" (always said with a laugh and an eye roll) or a similar dismissive response that makes it clear they really do not understand why they are being asked (I always make a point of varying pronouns for people who give that response, and wouldn't you know it, they all **do** actually care what you call them and are upset when you call their bluff by following their request). That sort of response always makes me personally feel as if I am silly for the pain I experience when misgendered, and generally communicates they don't think respecting these things is important. More often then not these are the folks who are most likely to misgender me/have misgendered me before that point and I find myself constantly on guard with them.

In grad school (I am a social worker) however this was a massive debate - how and when is best when asking pronouns? Essentially the best answer I and a group of other social workers who are not cis could come up with was always being sure your system was an opt-in/opt-out one where attention is not drawn to a persons possible reasons for opting-out. In part to facilitate that, behavior like the above (treating it like a joke) does need to be addressed. I've started leading groups I facilitate by telling people explicitly before we start that if they do not want to claim a pronoun set, to merely say pass. If and when someone starts dismissing the process if I am a group facilitator I press them to either say pass or say a pronoun. I believe this makes it easier/more comfortable for those who really need that pass (at least it has been for a handful of people who have asked to speak with me in private after). 

But these sort of larger settings are different from personal one on one. When it comes to personal interaction (outside of professional settings, where pronouns are something I need to fill out on every form - or are already listed on a clients forms so I know what they stated they use at least during their intake)  I try to keep an ear out for what others are using, and avoid pronoun use outright until our second conversation at the very least, and only ask when in private.

So basically, your name tag situation is an interesting one, but I think the fact it is opt in/opt out creates the space needed for people to back out if needed. Everyone needs different things, and people who need their pronouns clearly stated and visible (a group I belong to and it sounds you do as well) should be able to access that respect in a normalized manner, just as those who feel they are being put on the spot or owning their pronoun set should also be able to claim a respectful manner of not labeling themselves in that way.
I almost never mind. Like you, I wish it was more common for people just to ask everybody their pronouns, even ""obviously binary"" people. But I always prefer someone asking me to taking a guess based on how I look / sound.
For me personally, as nonbinary, I always feel like I'm passing as something other than a cis woman when people ask me. 
IMO, the best way is to do it with introductions.       
>Hi I'm Taylor, my pronouns are they/them. What is your name and pronouns?         

It normalizes asking pronouns and doesn't feel intrusive if it's standard introduction procedure.
I have mixed feelings. I appreciate the sentiment when people ask me, because I *know* I don't ""pass"" to most people as anything but my assigned gender. I think it can be a little different if someone is transitioning and wants to pass as a man or a woman, and I can see why being specifically singled out would be hurtful. But for me, being asked is theoretically a positive thing.

In reality, I've had mixed experiences. For example, I think it's good in theory to normalize sharing pronouns so that it's not just visibly trans or androgynous people who get asked, but in practice, it can still feel alienating when I'm the *only* one who goes by they/them. I only started feeling more comfortable sharing my pronouns at work after a couple other non-binary people put their pronouns in their e-mail signatures and I no longer felt like the only one. 

As someone who hasn't always had a strong preference or felt confident expressing one, I've stumbled over providing an answer at times (and then regretted not being clearer later).

I've also had people ask my pronouns or encourage a culture of sharing but then regularly use the wrong pronouns for me, which is...awkward. I get that accidents happen, but when it happens often and they never catch themselves or apologize, it makes the efforts to be inclusive feel shallow, and it creates an awkward situation that I could have ignored if there was more plausible deniability about whether they know what I go by.
I'm lucky to speak a first language that doesn't use gendered pronouns so these situations rarely arise. But if I'm in a safe place like among other LGBT people, in a gay club, at roller derby practice, it's nice to be asked. At derby whenever we do have a practice in English, pronouns are generally told along with names and everybody does it so that no one feels like they're singled out. We also have a lot of cis people who don't mind they-pronouns because they are so used to neutral pronouns so they don't feel strongly about pronouns.

Among strangers it's good to ask more discreetly. And maybe also make sure how they want to be spoken to publicly. Because pronouns could out the person and that might not be good. 
It's all about courtesy, which many people say it's a lost art and I would say I agree.
i was asked once by a person on the internet (lol) and didn't feel singled out because they didn't have a reason to think i was trans. it felt great to be seen finally though.
No! If you can't figure it out just don't use pronouns or use they/them! Obviously it depends on the situation but if you are meeting someone you probably won't ever meet again then NO! Especially if they are with family! 
This is a great solution, especially for cis allies.
Yeah 100% to that last bit. I mean, I'm coming from a non-binary position, but why so much hate for neutral pronouns?

Trying to answer my own question, I guess there are people who would prefer that no pronouns be used until you're certain what someone wants, but if they also don't want you to ask... then we're stuck in awkward sentence structure hell.
However there are cis people and some trans people for whom they/them is insulting (insinuation that you can't tell their gender by looking). These folks may think they look a certain way, and being told they don't is insulting/painful. I once knew a person with a unisex name who was very androgynous in appearance, I couldn't figure out what sex or gender. I didn't want to insult this person, so I avoided all.pronouns. She turned out to be a cis woman, and she was furious I didn't use she/her.
Yeah, I can get behind this for sure, thanks for pointing it out!
that's really just not a reasonable/logical way to live. i think it becomes their problem at that point, you meant no harm and simply doing the polite thing to do! 
I've heard a saying before... ""If you think transgender people get upset if you misgender them, try misgendering a cis person."""	8bphb3	NonBinary	47	0.98	2018-04-12 11:40:28
On going misgendering killed my mood last night (in comments)		"Does anyone else have just one person at their club who just irritates the joy right out of you? 


So there's this woman who also goes to the local goth club pretty regularly, and also tends to hang out outside (music is too loud for conversation inside). The very first time we met she insisted on calling me a girl even though she was told multiple times by myself and other people that I am not a girl, and was present during discussion of being on T for nearly a year, but because I was wearing eye makeup I had to be a girl (despite it being a goth club where at least half the cis men were also wearing eye makeup, and all my clothes being pretty masc). 


Then she insisted on discussing how gone with the wind is her favorite book and movie and is ""really good actually because it really let's you get into the mind of plantation owners and experience their suffering after the war"" ... so pretty much the worst take ever. After a few minutes of it I just walked away. Then she'd find me and try to start again and I walked away again, repeatedly for two hours until I just left.


That was months ago and she still consistently misgenders me and I can't get over her stench of polite racism. So I don't like her, but I'm polite. 


Anyways... last night I wore a skirt for the first time in over a year. It was a pretty epic black silk ballgown skirt with the train looped up to my wrist. But I was also wearing a mesh shirt and tie (and it shouldn't matter what I was wearing anyways). All she did was comment about how dolled up and girly I look compared to my usual ""tomboy style"" and that was it. My mood for the night was completely gone.


I thought I looked damn good, with the corset and skirt making how broad my shoulders are even more prominent, I felt like a guy wearing a gown on a runway until her dumb little tomboy comment. 


It feels so stupid, but I'm at the point of hating her and going out less because I don't want to deal with her bullshit.

Want to look feminine in a masculine way	I don’t know if the title makes sense. I’m afab and currently present more masculine. I want to experiment with different clothes and makeup but I’m scared it will just make me dysphoric and get me misgendered.	"I think I know what you mean. I’m also AFAB, and I want to look feminine but as if I was AMAB. I don’t know if that makes sense but that’s how I feel
that's such a mood
for me it makes it easier to experiment with that stuff when I know exactly what's causing my dysphoria - I can't wear feminine tops, for example, bc of chest dysphoria, but skirts are fine. 
also try experimenting on your own or with supportive people to mitigate social dysphoria. 
and remember gender =/= presentation and clothes are just clothes!
So you're a femboy (or maybe something adjacent)? Cool!
There's some outfits floating around of really tall amab enbies in long accordion skirts and a wide-brimmed hat and they don't look like women and I'm just like. Yes. That. I want to be able to look like that. I want to have that option. I want to be feminine, but, from like a masculine angle? Masculinity from a feminine angle is, idk, too male for me? But at the same time, while *I* may feel like an enby in a skirt, I'm afraid others will see \[regular woman\] when they look at me, in a way they'd see \[GNC woman\] when I'm wearing pants. --Though women wearing jeans is so normal that they wouldn't even think that, but at least they're not thinking feminine woman, which is No and Bad. I can deal with being \[androgynous woman\] or even \[masculine-ish woman\] if I can't be \[unidentifyable\], as long as it's not \[feminine woman\] that they see. 

If that makes any sense.
That's part of why I'm on T! I have pretty feminine genes (as do all the men in my family) so I'm hoping eventually I'll be able to pass as a somewhat fem/andro cis man lol.
Could do some traditionally feminine expressions in a masc way? Like masc earring or jewelry or something?
I enjoy clothes ""made for men"" (obviously I think clothes shouldn't be so gendered but you know what I mean) but with more ""feminine"" qualities in texture or prints. Examples are Hawaiian shirts with floral prints, or a velvet sport coat.
Yes! I feel this too! I enjoy makeup and a lot of feminine clothing, but my body is already so noticeably feminine that I feel like if I put on a dress I’ll just disappear into womanhood
I feel like this on days i'm a demiboy lmao (i'm genderfluid)

Spite Misgendering	"Whenever I piss off anyone in my family or just so much as inconvenience anyone, they go out of their way to misgender me. 

My mom left a voicemail on my phone calling me the wrong gender at least 4 times just because I hung up on her. In my defense, my mother is making terrible decisions with her life and I’m tired of her asking for advice, me giving it, and then her not taking it then wondering why I’m upset. 

Anyways, this isn’t the only example. My father does this constantly too whenever I inconvenience him in any way. All of a sudden, there’s just ALL the misgendering. 

I’m getting so tired of this. It really does bother me…"	"That's super shitty of them and I'm very sorry you're experiencing that. I broke up with a friend who was doing it to his ex-ish spouse, because no amount of acting ""supportive"" the rest of the time can make up for *that* being what they go to when they're mad, imo. It'd be way, way out of bounds to use he/him as an insult to your mom or she/her about your father, and them doing it to you is no better at all–actually worse, since it holds enough meaning to successfully hurt you.
Are you able to go no/low contact for a while to protect yourself?
I am sorry that sort of thing happen to you, I don't have a lot of experience, I can't imagine how much it can hurt and feel horrible to live that, I'm sorry I don't have solutions about this... But maybe you could talk with them, if it worth do it, or take your distance ? I don't know... But don't ever hesitate asking for help here, or to a therapist, there are maybe people here who can help finding solutions.

You have my moral support, sorry if my post isn't that usefull...
I’m sorry that’s so shitty. I think there are boundaries you don’t cross with a loved one, or anyone really. If you love someone you respect them even if you’re fighting. It’s no different than if you got called nasty names every time you had a fight. Like, being angry doesn’t change the fact that they said it. And if they didn’t mean it, they wouldn’t say it.
this sucks, i’m sorry your parents are like that! my first thought was to be petty and misgender them back, maybe a taste of their own poison will make them understand how shitty they’re being. protecting yourself by setting boundaries and not crossing them yourself is a good way to go as well - like every time they do that, you hang up/don’t respond, etc. I know it can be really tough holding your ground with parents. sending you all the luck!
Cut ties with them, it doesn’t matter if they’re family. You shouldn’t have to put up with that shit just because they get mad and petty over the smallest of things.
I appreciate the sentiment. It is pretty shitty.
I’m not answering phone calls or texts right now. If that’s what you mean.
I appreciate it. Thank you.
Yeah, it’s boundary time. Was also checking if you have to live in this toxic environment, sounds like you don’t so that’s good. You deserve to be respected, they’re intentionally disrespecting =set tons of boundaries until/if they start missing you and show some respect.

Do you ever misgender yourself in your head?	I’m AFAB that just came out recently and I’m seemingly having to “memorize” calling myself they/them. It’s not that I feel uncomfortable with they/them pronouns- it’s just I’ve lived as a female for so long that I’m kind of used to it. Anyways I hope everyone is having a good day!	"ALL THE TIME and then I get into a spiral of oh god if I instinctively use dead pronouns for myself am I actually enby and it's super stressful and scawy
ive been using they/them for two years and i still catch myself using the wrong pronouns in my inner monologue all the time. for me i think it stems from not being out in most irl spaces so i dont actually hear the pronouns out loud from people that often.
THIS. Even someone new I met who's NB also got their pronouns messed up.
Oh my god. Yes. I am AMAB, and while I'm okay with he/him, I hate it when I'm actually trying to present female. I prefer my pronouns to match how I'm presenting at the moment, but they/them feels the most \*accurate\* to describe me, as it includes everything I am. But in my head, I find I use he/him pronouns accidentally, purely from being called that for so long.

I never think of myself as a ""guy"" though, and every time someone mentioned my masculinity, it always felt like they were talking about someone else.
I recently started using a different name and it is going really well but a few days ago I met the parents of a friend of mine and nearly introduced myself with my deadname
I personally dont, but i know lots of people do
ive been calling myself he and him for 4 years now and the other day i misgendered myself in my head (where i thought i was safe!!!) and had 2 sit down for 10 mins. its just a thing of habit ya gotta break! dw
I can say them for literally anyone else. But I've been so conditioned to refer to myself gendered that I find I often do the same. If I take the time to think I'll correctly gender myself
Yeah..it gets worse when I feel bad about myself
Not as often lately since I've been NB for a while now (a little less than a decade) but I still do it & I did it A LOT when I was younger. It doesn't mean who you are isn't real, it's simply old habits. If you think something about yourself, anything, for years and years and you've never thought anything else, it'll  take a while to adjust.
Totally. Especially since I am finally living my truth after 31 years. I still call myself a male a lot out loud and I cringe at myself.  In my head I'm often ""she"" but I think that's more current slang like ""oh she's a beast"" but even then it's like ugh she doesn't really fit all of you either. Self actualization is a blessing and a curse. 

Have a wonderful day you beautiful creature :)
Very, very often. My Language doesn´t have an ungendered option, so its even harder to break the habit. Even though I switched to thinking in English nearly all the time, as soon as I talk to anyone, I have to go back to gendered designations (most nouns are gendered too). It makes talking to others so tiring and I lost count of how often I drew a blank on translating some word, or just mixed english words in without thinking.
Thank god I'm not the only one. I always feel so silly and dumb for invalidating myself lol

I recently decided to use they/them pronouns, therefore most ppl in my life don't know, so I'm just used to people referring to me as she/her. Sometimes I slip up and even call myself a woman, which is embarrassing, but I try not to beat myself up for it. I'm still on this journey and I've just started, so of course I wont be used to it yet.
Im non-binary and afab
I go by they/them when people refer to me as ria(my name) but when referring to me as kelly/kitty(my sona) i get referred to as she/her, because my sona is female, but irl me is non-binary..

I refer to myself all the time as she/her, but more as the mindset that im displayed as my sona rather than myself irl online


My Sona's pronouns are she/they, but the more used pronouns with my sona are she/her


Me and my sona are like two separate people, but the same at the same time, if that makes sense, because my sona has a separate gender identity and sexual orientation

Irl, i am bisexual and poly, while my sona is pansexual and poly

Irl, i am non-binary, while my sona is between cis female to demigirl 

The only real similarities is that my sona will always have the same romantic partners as myself -v-


(Also, my Sona's name is kelly, but sometimes people refer to her as kitty, which is actually her middle name, but its like a nickname for her)

Anywaysss yehh, whenever someone or myself online refers to me as she/her, I'll automatically think of myself as kelly(my sona) rather than me irl
thats me all the time like what if im just tricking myself am i even nonbinary or am i just faking it

Is it weird that I'm okay with coworkers and others misgendering me?	I present pretty fem and I'm okay with that, but I use they/them pronouns. I only really ask that my close friends and my partner use my correct pronouns, rather than she/her like everyone assumes from looking at me. (My family is a different subject, they won't use my name, let alone my pronouns). It really doesn't bother me very much when people I'm not close with, like coworkers, occasionally misgender me and call me she, so I've never pushed my pronouns at work at all. Of course my deadname is off limits though. The pronouns just don't feel worth the fight when it's not that important to me. Does anybody else feel this way?	"It's not that weird. Their opinion or validation doesn't matter to you, so it makes sense that you don't care if they misgender you
I don’t think it’s weird. Pronouns are just one facet of expression and while for some people they’re very important, for others they’re not so much. I’m kind of indifferent to the pronouns people use on me and am okay with any, because I don’t see it as important to my gender expression.
It sounds like you have strong healthy boundaries and are able to prioritize what matters to you and equally kinda what affects you emotionally, to a degree, based on that. 

I wish I had this level of emotional boundaries. I tend to be very anxious of what anyone thinks about me. It’s probably a good survival instinct in a small group of hunters/gatherers but pretty meaningless in todays society where many strangers literally don’t even care.
Honestly, I do the same thing. I look fem so when in public and at work, I just go by what people assume. But with friends and family (I don't really correct them but) I hope they use my preferred name at the very least.

My family is transphobic for the most part (some exceptions), but they are taking baby steps, so that's nice.
I barely consider my coworkers people, when I clock in I turn off my brain and pretend I’m back home with my dog. don’t over think it, as far as what they think at work. sometimes it’s more peaceful to just roll with it. very situational though ✋ just don’t be too hard on yourself! not everybody gets to know you, you’re VIP af ✋
Absolutely the same but I have a tendency to suffer in order to avoid conflict according to therapy. I am pretty femme as well (but AMAB) and I started telling the “I’m not good with new pronouns” people to use “she” then until *they* feel more comfortable. 

I just want acknowledgment that I’m not a man, so I’ll take she over he. I’m also not trying to educate everyone I meet either, just starting to push back.
The world we live in is strange and it affects us all in different ways. There’s nothing weird about your feelings here at all, it’s just one of many possible (all equally valid) responses to the pressures of cis-normative society.
I’m the same exact way but for different reasons, im stealth to everyone I don’t really trust, my family and coworkers are all massively homophobic, so I just don’t care if people use my correct name and pronouns because it just happens constantly
This is how I feel. I like the saying ""letting others in"" vs. ""coming out"". There are people that I don't trust or want to fully let in. I'd rather preserve my emotional energy.
It's not weird at all (at least I think), I'm mostly still using she/her as it's just to much effort to ask it of everyone. 
My friends use he/him mostly and my fam doesn't all know yet but I'm (mostly) fine with it.
It only bothers me a second if I'm dressed real masc and someone calls me lady but yeah that's for a second and it's not worth the effort to correct them.

It is nice when my colleagues try to use other pronounce but it doesn't really bother me that they misgender me.
I don't think it's that weird I don't have any strong preferences on pronouns I have friends that call me girl, I'm gendered male mostly by strangers And I have Old close friends in the queer community who call me they
it bothers me when people misgender me but i've gotten to a point where i'll take the misgendering over having to have a whole conversation about it and potentially having to deal with transphobia or weird vibes from people i see regularly. i mostly keep to myself so it doesn't come up often anyway. i'll usually get misgendered once or twice a day, i wince a little internally and then move on. i don't hide my gender and if someone asks or we get into it i let them know my pronouns. i just don't have the energy to correct people, especially since it's mostly old people. definitely get big euphoria when people get it right though.
I feel the same, I speak spanish and here people aren't used at all to gender neutral grammar, it's too much of a hustle to bother.
Not weird at all! You are able to set your own boundaries and that’s good! You enforce them where you are comfortable with the people who matter! I always let my pronouns slide at work because I didn’t want to stress of having to always be the one to correct people to protect myself! But I was also comfortable with it and they also respected my name! 
So others are allowed not to be comfortable being misgendered anywhere because that is awful and frustrating but if you found a healthy balance and it doesn’t effect you then you’re good! I wish you all the best!!💖
I'm the same way. I don't want to deal with people's opinions or just have the coming out conversation at all.

Even with new friends, I generally don't come out. It goes more like, Sarah has talked to me about Max, and to Max about me, using our respective pronouns. Max and I meet, we already know each other's pronouns. Most of my friends exercise good judgment regarding like, not outing me to conservatives.

I do use my deadname at work, but I won't once it's legally changed.

I go by they/them but being called he isn’t dysphoria inducing. Is that bad?	"Masculine pronouns are not my preference and I’d truly love to be called they/them consistently. The only people who even try are my girlfriend and my (not yet out for the same reason as me) brother. The worst part is both me and my brother have to misgender each other in front of our mom.

But back to the point, I live in a conservative town and still present rather masc. I understand that at a glance people will call me he and that doesn’t bother me. But it’s the people that I tell my pronouns to and disregard them that are the issue. I’m more pissed off that they don’t even make an effort than I am that they called me he. My brother suggested that maybe I’m he/they but I don’t really want to be called he at all, it just doesn’t affect me.

I’m so confused 😭

Edit: typo fix"	"I also go by they/them, but being called a ""good boy"" by my partner isn't dysphoria inducing (quite nice, actually). 

I don't think its bad at all. Being enby isnt a set standard that you have to live up to, or else you aren't valid: being enby is an expression of self that manifests in a variety of ways for different folks. You are enby enough :)
there no wrong way to feel!! navigate your gender through what feels better
Nope! I go by they/them but for memes or in phrases I don't mind being called something gendered. ""Yas queen"" or ""bro"" don't phase me at all.
Nah. Getting misgendered only occasionally bothers me. 

I don't know about other folks, but what dysphoria I do get comes and goes.
I'm afab and use any pronouns but she
I'm not out to many but out of those I am out to it's around 70% they and 30% she 
It doesn't affect me to the point of dysphoria but it does affect me in the way that I question whether I am even queer enough to request different pronouns or correct them
So I feel I understand your social discomfort
Do tell me if this is similar to how you feel
I feel similarly. I feel disconnected from myself when people misgender me, like I should give up trying since no one else seems to want to try, or barely does. And I'm only out to one person irl + online friends. Plus dysphoria which for me most of the time makes me feel consistently dissociated and hazy. Only recently has misgendering started to really bother me and like you said, it's more that it feels like a sign of someone not caring rather than like, a deeper pain. I feel more upset at the person and the thought behind it than the misgendering itself.
It's normal and perfectly okay! You need to go by the pronouns you prefer, but it's fine and still valid if your AGAB pronouns don't induce dysphoroa
Of course it's not. Dysphoria is not something you have to experience any particular way or over any particular set of things, and it's honestly better for you if you don't. Don't look a gift horse in the mouth here, just be glad it isn't worse.
Gender is unique to everyone. I got strictly go by they/them but don’t mind being called sir, dude, bro. On the other hand I also don’t mind bitch (like bad bitch or dumb bitch lol), or being called beautiful which tends to lean to being more feminine. 

I am a gender goblin who is just picking a choosing between things from all over the place.
You are absolutely valid! I use they+ pronouns for this exact reason. Like I definitely prefer to hear they and will sometimes hold space for myself to only be referred to by it, but I can also just be and not feel obligated to correct everyone who refers to me by other pronouns. It felt freeing to acknowledge this.
Why would it be bad?
Crying rn thank you 🥺
TW for internalized transphobia, self depreciating thoughts, negative self-talk that kind of thing.

I feel pretty similar. I'm a nonbinary trans guy and because I am very physically dysphoric and disconnected I feel like an imposter a lot of the time and like ""Do I feel *bad enough* for this to be worth 'causing a scene'"" ""I shouldn't bother people by asking for this"" even though I deserve basic human decency, I feel like a burden for having needs both for being trans and for anything else.
No worries :) stay safe, stay hydrated and love yourself"	swexuo	NonBinary	52	0.98	2022-02-19 17:18:21
anyone else get impostor syndrome?	"like, i KNOW there's no one way to be non-binary. i KNOW there's no one way to ""look"" non-binary. but i'm afab non-binary and dating a cis man and most people see me and just think ""girl."" i've been identifying as non-binary for 6 years now, but every once in a while i feel like i'm not ""performing"" it and get sad about getting misgendered so often. i don't even dress femme, my style is pretty neutral/slightly masc leaning, but i like wearing makeup.

idk. just feeling down i guess."	"I only realised I'm Nonbinary about 8 months ago and I sometimes still feel like it's all just a front and it's not really me so I understand. I don't get much body related dysphoria, my dysphoria is more social and it makes me wonder if I am nonbinary if I don't have much of a problem with my body in relation to my identity.

Seeing other enbys in the community and their style helps affirm me but I understand that might not help everyone. 

No matter what though, you are always valid!
I totally get you. I'm afab too and my presentation leans toward fem most of the time. Because I don't feel the need to change my name and pronouns, I'm not out to most people (not even my family haha) and I feel like I'm always being read as a woman. 

I don't like it. Most of the time, I wear sport bras and large clothing to hide my chest. At work, due to a recent weight gain, I wore skirts and tunics+leggings almost every day. Even tho I like those sometimes, I feel most comfortable in jeans and flannel. I can't really wear those at work because it's too casual.

I feel like an imposter because I'm not a ""typical non-binary person"", but looking trough this sub and other NB subs made me realise how different NB people can be, while still being NB. It helps me accept and embrace my fem self and reduces the imposter syndrome.
I came out as non binary a couple months ago and I still am trying to feel ok with it. I am AMAB and transitioned to female in my early 20’s but never had bottom surgery. Over the last year I’ve realized that I’m not really male or female I’m kind of a mix. I’m actually most comfortable when people can’t tell. I definitely prefer to have female pronouns used still but I’ve come to realize that I don’t really like to be considered either male or female. Sometimes I feel like an imposter as I came out as a trans woman nearly a decade ago"	gazpw7	NonBinary	45	0.97	2020-04-30 17:07:41
Feeling very dysphoric after being misgendered all weekend (yay holidays). Any advice for how to androgynize my style and/or could you just call me they/them in the comments (my name is Raven).		"Hey, Raven. I absolutely love your shirt. You look so handsome with your hair and all. Does anyone else have an idea to make them look more androgynous? I think they already look perfectly androgynous :)
Raven and their cute little kitty bat. I absolutely love your hair!
Idk if looking more Andro will help with misgendering. Regular folk tend to see man or women and not much in between. I hope with the holiday season ending you can get some time away from those who don't get it.
Solidarity, friend—just had the same experience around the dinner table, happened about a dozen times in as many minutes. Sending virtual hugs; you are who you say you are, no matter what anyone else says.

*whisper shouts to the rest of the group* RAVEN’S STYLE IS SO COOL! I LOVE THEIR HAIR!!!
Hey raven you look like dantdm
Omg Raven, as a fellow enby my goal is pretty much exactly your style and looks!!! Looking awesome and definitely a person.
I recently dyed my hair pink, but seeing Raven’s blue hair has me thinking of what colour I should try next. They really pull it off, I wonder if I could too? They just have such great style. I was sorry to hear they had a tough weekend :(
Raven is super cool, I love their cute cat bat shirt!
This is Raven, I think they're pretty neat. They have hair that is an amazing shade of aqua, and glasses that look like mine. We hold our phones the same way, which I think is cool. Raven also has an amazing sense of style with their shirt with the cute Lil batcat on it. 

Raven, I think you look neat. Keep being you, others will see how much happier you are and get their turn on the braincell to accept that.
Do yall see that person in that pic? I really like their shirt and their hair! All around a very good look for them don't you agree? They said their name is raven. Let's all welcome them and wish them a good week. Have a good week raven!
Raven is an amazing enby pal they are a great person who deserves attention and respect.
I feel you Raven, I had a similar weekend, you look androgynous to me :)

Hey Raven's 'family:' they deserve to have their pronouns respected. They seem pretty cool.
Thanks, you're probably right about the misgendering, especially from family. Just a painful experience but at least there's a corner of Reddit and a few friends who understand me.
Dang, sorry that happened to you also. You're valid!"	rqonel	NonBinary	45	0.94	2021-12-28 20:18:55
Manager won't use my pronouns :(	"So, I know I'm not very good at advocating for myself, especially correcting people when they misgender me, because I have  ✨childhood trauma✨. So I don't know if it's even fair for me to be upset when I've never corrected him, but I did tell the assistant manager, who interviewed me initially, about my pronouns right off the bat, and several of my coworkers as well, and a couple of them told me that the manager who doesn't gender me correctly does in fact know that I use they/them pronouns and has been corrected by others multiple times. I had no idea because he doesn't seem to even make an effort. I thought it was just me not ""passing""  (which I know isn't really possible as an enby, but you know), but I guess he just doesn't care. I don't know what to do. I'm the only trans employee there so I'm scared to reach out to HR, even anonymously, because he will obviously know it's me, and besides that I don't even know if this is a big enough issue for HR to get involved. Like, it hurts me, but what if I'm just overreacting. a;slkdfj;lsdfj;alskjf I don't know, it sucks, sorry. Thanks for letting me get that off my chest :')"	"I’ve worked with people that refuse to take my pronouns seriously. For me they would use the right name because I didn’t tell anyone my dead name (until an old manager I had came in and messed it all up), but then would say “she/her” while calling me “Sebastian.” Like bro.

Anyway, I think you should go to HR. If you write it like “we have a trans coworker who isn’t being respected and some of us feel that they deserve…” then it’ll be less likely to lead back to you. Multiple people supporting you and correcting him will throw him off of who told HR, because if they care enough to tell him off even when you’re not around they probably care enough to go to HR if they believe you’re struggling. 

Honestly even if he does get mad at you for going to HR, what’s he gonna do? You have multiple supporters and once HR gets involved if he does some sly shit he could lose his job. 

You don’t have to get along with all your coworkers, but just as you respect them they should respect you. Keep your head up, kiddo.
I'd check corporate policy for LGBTQ inclusion and speak with HR
Ugh, that honestly makes me upset. I would go to HR and mention the issue of a coworker's pronouns not being respected. I'd also try to get others to do the same if possible.
TBH I'd post about this on r/antiwork, they're very accustomed to helping people deal with shitty coworkers and management.
You're not overreacting and your feelings are completely valid, i'm so sorry you're dealing with this! I think you got some good advice here from the other comments
Honest question, how would someone appropriately use they/them pronouns? Can you please share some examples? Thank you!
Be sure to document each time they do it. Literally have a notepad for this, pull it out in front of them, write the incident down with a timestamp. If there's witnesses, ask them if they'll sign it. Maybe they're realize their own words and deeds can be used against them in a court of law. (Even if you're just bluffing, it should at least clearly communicate to them and everyone around just what a dick they're being loudly enough for them to finally hear you. Whether or not they'll then choose to be respectful of their fellow entities is a mystery.)   


If you can't afford to lose this job, then you may just have to be nonconfrontational until you can ditch the manager or the job.
I had this exact same issue and once I corrected the manager he continued. I filed a case with the EEOC and got a settlement out of court.
[removed]
Smart
i agree with going to HR but only if they're sure HR will be on their side. i was fired from a previous job for going to HR about trans stuff.
Yeah for sure. We’ll take my friend Sam for example. They’re so cool. I met them while we were in high school and they were always so nice to me. It’s sad cause their parents aren’t very supportive but they’re still really confident in themself and I’m proud of them for that.
See the difference here is I am not bound by your petty mortal conceptions of identity. I pity you, truly. And I will be sending my blessing for your quest to gain a basic understanding of the topics you’re so desperately trying to make a point on. Also I’m sorry you don’t understand the simple pleasure of being able to shift the state of your nether regions at will. I’ll tell you, it is quite the treat. Sometimes a dick is really annoying to have and being able to retreat it at will is very helpful.
That’s so fucked up, not to mention illegal since they aren’t supposed to fire you for discrimination on sexuality, gender, religion, or race. I’m sorry that happened to you
Thanks! So it’s just using “they/them” instead of “him/his” or “her”? Are there any other tips to keep in mind? How would someone address a transgender person in a formal letter, instead of Mr. or Ms. you should use what?
well, it happened before it was explicitly made illegal and the Official reason was something completely different. i appreciate it but you don't have to be sorry, that place sucked ass and not in a good way lol
No not really. Anyone will appreciate you asking like you did instead of just trying to guess. Other than that, I guess just try not to make a huge deal if you mess up. Everyone slips up and we get that. We appreciate you trying your best. And I appreciate you. Thank you.
Thank you! But can you please help me with the second question? I recently ran into this issue and didn’t know what to do.
In english we have a androgynous term Mx for writing a letter too someone we dont know the gender of. Mx is pronounced as mix. I hope this helped.
Oh haha sorry I missed that when I was reading it. Mx (pronounced mix) is generally used, but when in doubt you can always ask what someone prefers.
Oh, ta. That's useful to know!"	qmlj3i	NonBinary	48	0.9	2021-11-04 14:14:58
no one sees me as nonbinary (they/them)	i’m afab and still in highschool and recently came out as nonbinary to some of my friends. i still look very feminine and wear makeup often because i enjoy it and i think it looks good on me, but recently i’ve been noticing people refer to me as “girl” or “her” so often. i know nonbinary people don’t owe others androgyny but it’s just so difficult going around being misgendered by the people who are supposed to care about me. i want to correct them but i’m scared of making it awkward or uncomfortable so i never do. i hung out with some friends today and noticed them use the wrong pronouns a few times and i’m just… frustrated. even my other gay friend misgendered me, when i thought we were supposed to support each other. i know it’s not from ill intent but it still hurts. i just want to be affirmed in my gender </3 it would be greatly appreciated. also advice on politely correcting pronouns without making it weird would be helpful.	"In my opinion the best way to deal with it would be to take the extra moment to make it awkward and correct them nicely. It can be very beneficial and can make your overall experience better if they decide to support you like good friends but if you do correct them and they get offended or refuse to support you then those aren’t the people you should spend your time with. Just my 2 cents. Hope it helps
I don’t think it’s awkward to correct people, you have a right to do that. If they are really your friends, then they will understand and do better. Don’t be afraid to advocate for yourself, that is your *right*.

It might be good to pull aside your close gay friend and talk to them, tell them “I’m really afraid to call people out but this has been really hurtful to me, can you help me check people?” That might help you feel better. 

I have a good friend who is gay who corrects people for me when I feel like I’m not being heard, it has really helped, and it makes him feel good to do it.
I cant correct people with my pronouns either so id try telling your clostest friend- maybe the other gay one?- how its bothering you and how it makes you feel and asking them if they could help correct people (and themselves)
I feel your pain but as a NB 28 year old if you present feminine 90% of people are going to call you female names. It’s only normal for people. When I’m in line I still get “next in miss”. Friends still say “girlllll” and so on. You cannot expect people to use neutral words when you clearly present feminine. That’s the harsh reality of it. I know online says otherwise and in a perfect world it would work but the reality is it doesn’t work that way.
sadly i can‘t offer advice because i have the exact same problem. i always feel like i‘m annoying people by saying ‘i’m not a girl‘ for the tenth time a day, so i just let it slide. everyone sees me as female and i hate it. feels good to know i‘m not alone. but we deserve to be treated with respect, so let‘s both try to start correcting people, okay? if they react poorly, they‘re not really our friends.
I got this so much when I first came out about 7 months ago. Only just now have a lot of my friends started using they/them more often than he/him. I think for some of these things, it takes a while for some ppl to realize it's not a phase and you really do prefer new pronouns in a serious way. I think if you just correct them, maybe like once a month, eventually people will get it through their heads and even start correcting each other. The way I would correct my friends is sometimes when we would be hanging out as a group, a friend would say something that ends with ""him"" when referring to me. Since I wasn't interrupting anyone as the friend had finished talking, I would just add ""I use them."" Quietly and subtly, although I'm sure some others in the group may have heard it too. Usually I got a nod, and then we moved onto something else. Eventually I did this to each friend a time or two (except one who always nailed it), and not they use they/them for me more and more often :)

These things just take time sometimes, usually more time than we would like for them. I hope your friends will adapt soon tho! Much love 💖
Might sound weird, but if you can find moments to refer to yourself in third person, hearing you call yourself they/them will have a big impact on your friends. Obvi these situations don’t come up often, but something to keep in mind. 

Pronoun pins are great too, I also am trying to get in the habit of writing my pronouns everywhere I write my name. It can feel pushy or annoying, but it’s rarely perceived that way.
my friends are very supportive and i decided to message them seperately about it! i was just a bit nervous haha but thank you!!
i talked to her (the gay one) seperately and she was very understanding. she even offered to talk to my other friends about it as well which was nice, thank you!!
yeah unfortunately i know the “harsh reality” and most of the time i expect feminine comments from strangers but imo it’s a bit different around my friends who i’m “out” to. i expect *them* to see me as nonbinary in a way i don’t bessecsrily expect from strangers but i think they struggle with that because of how i look.
pronoun pins are such a great idea! definitely buying myself some asap!
Of course! Hope it all works out!
Yeah I deal with the same from my friends hense the “girllll or hun” comments. I guess I don’t blame them because I understand how their brain in working. They would have to retrain their brain to not assume: person who looks like a girl, isn’t. And I don’t expect them to do all that mental work just so I can feel validated. That’s just me tho.
I got this one and absolutely love it! It’s subtle but there, and looks really classy if that’s your vibe:

Hi there friends! How do you correct people who don’t use your pronouns? I grew up with abuse and hate confrontation so I don’t correct people and need to learn how lmao. Pronouns: they/them. Picture of me yesterday before getting misgendered as ma’am 😬😞		"You could wear pronoun pins
With total strangers I don’t generally care. It’s like if I give them my name for a Starbucks coffee and they spell it (making up a name) Jessie instead of Jesse, that doesn’t matter to me. It matters more when they’re someone I care about. 

My partner often uses the wrong pronouns when we’re in couples counseling (wekre working on our conflict avoidance). I found another time to discuss this with him, and told him the reason I’m not correcting him is that in that context, the content is more important than the pronouns. I still wrinkle my nose in distaste though, lol! I haven’t had to correct him in other contexts, I think in couples he’s focusing so hard on the ideas, that he forgets the pronouns. Elsewhere with other people, I would just interrupt with a smile and say “they”.
I too have a problem with confrontation, but you can definitely learn it! Maybe practice with your friends, people you’re comfortable around. You could treat using your right pronouns as an act of self-care and ask them for other small favours for a start (idk how to explain it better I hope you understand what I mean.) Also I’ve made the experience that if you’re approaching someone in a nice way, most of the time they’ll answer in the same way. I don’t know if this helps you, but I wish you all the best anyway 🌻
Pronoun pins might not be a bad choice! Might be able to put them on my keys ☺️

Thank you 💜
I wish I didn’t care with strangers but I’ve only been out for a few months so it’s still really hard 🙃

And good on you and your partner for working on things, I wish you the best of luck!!

Thankfully I haven’t had many issues with my fiancé using the wrong pronouns, and if he does, he usually corrects himself. I still get my own pronouns wrong sometimes too, so I know it’s definitely a learning curve 💜
Thank you 🥺💜

It’s so hard because it happened last night at our local movie theater (which we visit frequently) and I had on 3 layers of clothing which I was hoping would disguise my body but I guess not 😬

I like the idea of asking for small stuff first. I appreciate the suggestions 💜
I think another aspect is that I’m not out to his family, my family, or my work, and I’ve left it up to him for his work. So switching back and forth isn’t the easiest thing. Not to mention we’d already been together for more than 15 years before I figured all this out, lol, and it’s only been a couple years since.
You’re welcome! I guess it’s even harder because most people still think in binary gender roles. But you got this! It’s baby steps 💙🦕
I feel that, I’m not out to my future in-laws either as my NMIL is transphobic and homophobic. When the two of us came out as bi to them, she laughed and acts like it never happened 🙄

I’m out to fiancé’s work tho, and I’m not currently working because of a disability so it’s not too too bad. We were also together for almost 4 when I figured it out so it’s been a learning curve for us both! 😂
My fiancé pointed that out last night too, so it’s funny you say that! He said to me “it’s probably not how you look or present yourself, it’s that we live in a small town and when people see a couple where one presents themselves as male, the other is assumed female”.

Also, adore the dino emoji. Dinosaurs are a favorite of mine 💜😂
My nfather would use it as a feather in his hat to show how accepting he was. My emother is still struggling with accepting LGBT+ people — she appreciates my logical argument of “you raised me to think everyone was equal and could do anything they worked hard for, so of course LGBT+ are equal and should have equal chances too!”, but she hasn’t internalized it. My MIL (well, “mother-sin-law”, my partner and I aren’t married) and FIL are very accepting people, but MIL can’t keep a secret and once in a while she talks with my mother, so if I don’t want my mom knowing, I can’t tell my MIL. 🤷 Oh well, my chosen family all know.
I’m with you there, chosen family is what’s important anyway!"	pzgf0v	NonBinary	49	0.97	2021-10-01 20:28:22
Do you ever avoid talking because your voice automatically gets you misgendered?	"I present femme and if I’m masked, some people actually “misgender” me and call me ma’am. Although I’m not trans, I don’t mind this. Makes me happy as long as they don’t think of me as a man.
But I dread opening my mouth in a public place. The moment I open my mouth people automatically call me “sir”, “he”, etc. If I’m out with someone, I always whisper to the person I’m with, so that they’d speak on my behalf. I hate my voice for this reason. I’m not sure if I want to do vocal training. 
Does anyone else have similar experiences?"	"i do it and i'm transmasc/nonbinary. 
when i started my last contract job one of the association members asked for my pronouns and then followed it up by saying ""yeah your voice just trips me up"". i literally think about it once a week or so now and worry when i go to speak in public.  

it sucks cause now i feel myself starting to worry about passing, instead of just living my life. 

sometimes when i'm feeling really dysphoric about it my partner goes out and does stuff that would require me to speak on my behalf. when we eat out he is the one who does the ordering and i try to speak as little as possible, this is also because we live in a bilingual area but i speak the minority language. 

however, you're not alone in having these feelings; and i am sorry that you are dealing with this. 

we should be able to raise our voices and speak without people assigning us into boxes. 

vocal training is an avenue that might help you like your voice again, if you want to try it that is. your existence is your own. if you don't like your voice and want to change it for you then go for it. if you don't want to change your voice, then don't, and screw anyone who says you have to. 

do what makes you happy. 

i hope things get better for you
I am non-binary transfeminine, and I present feminine in my daily life. I use she/they pronouns. Masked, I get called ""ma'am"" fairly frequently, and lately even unmasked I've been getting ""ma'am-ed"" a bit. But the moment I start to speak, it's all ""sir"" this and ""he/him/his"" that. Effing hate it. I've done voice training and if I actually practice at having a more feminine voice my dysphoria about my voice does get better...but that requires me to fight through the dysphoria to practice in the first place. Also, I really wish that people were not taught to automatically ""sir/ma'am"" people ""out of respect""...there has to be a way to be respectful without gendering me.
i hate talking in public too. sometimes when i'm even hanging out with friends i'll become really aware of how my voice or inflections sound masculine and it makes me incredibly dysphoric and sad. voice training is something i think i'd like to do but i'm not in a position to afford a voice therapist/teacher and am a little intimidated by how long the process might take for me to comfortably get my voice to where i'd like it
Yeah, one of the main reasons I’m starting T is that my voice always gets me ma’am’d unless I have a head cold. Even if I get called sir by looks alone, people revise their opinion the moment I open my mouth, and once I even got accosted by a confused transphobe who noticed the mismatch and came to the conclusion I was a trans woman.
I work for a bank over the phone….I get called sir, bro all the time. Gah
I know that I don't want to go on T, but I'm considering doing voice training because my voice is so high pitched and I hate it. I feel like it doesn't sound confident either
Yes, especially when I unintentionally code switch. I’ve been working on undoing that trauma.
Thank you so much! That’s so reassuring 💕
My partner, too, speaks on my behalf. They (fellow enby) don’t have dysphoria over their voice and so they don’t mind ordering for me, for example. 
I hope the world improves and people stop assuming genders through appearance and voice 😞
Me too! I’m a receptionist at a university and when people call, they do that. Especially undergrad students when they call, they think that addressing you as sir is polite 😣
Sometimes I want to introduce myself as Riv your NB banking specialist…but my department deals with military and their families…so"	x9fzaz	NonBinary	47	0.98	2022-09-09 00:00:30
