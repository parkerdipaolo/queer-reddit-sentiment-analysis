Got in the local newspaper with correct pronouns!		"Sorry for the excessive censor, but I didn’t feel like putting too much personal info out.

Also, I’m now claiming tallbikes as enby culture 😈
what a badass pic
All I feel is fear when looking at that
hey op i'm hella happy for you but as a dutch person that bike activated my fight or flight response and i'd like an explanation as to what the fuck pretty please
what on earth are you riding
Cool as fuck, congratulations
Hey, a fellow tallbike rider!

At least in my experience, tallbikes are trans/enby culture. My freak bike club is like 70% trans/enby.

Do you joust?
Cool and all but I can't unsee the bike
That's fucking cool, bike equivalent of stilts or a monster truck
Wtf is this bike, it's so cool yet so terrifying.
alright but can we talk about how fucking sick that bike is
I feel like getting correctly gendered in the newspaper is one of those enby achievements that has to unlock extra content. So let us know if you develop any nonbinary superpowers!
Hey op what the fuck
That is a dope bike. It looks like it took a lot of work to make lol

Congrats on getting in the paper and double congrats on them getting your pronouns right lol
fuck yesssss! you look like you're living your best life, op! and your outfit is *chef's kiss*
So how do you get off of that monstrosity
Fuck yea this is amazing! The bike the outfit the whole scene. This is mad enby joy right here and Im so for it!
That is a terrifying machine please don't ride it in my direction. It is very gender though
Fuck yes local newspaper getting it right. Also, you’re a badass. Serious congrats!
OP I love your shirt
HOLY SHIT WHAT ARE THEY RIDING
This makes me wish I could ride a bike 😆 that is so friggin cool. What made you come up with this?
your tallbike is cool live your best life my friend
That is indeed a tall bike.
Damn that really is a tall bike
thats legit
YES!!
Honestly; this is your world and we’re just living in it.
Tall bike is cool as hell just like you congratulations <3
The enby energy of this vibe is utterly impeccable
What happens if there’s a stop sign? How do you get on? I already struggle getting on my kinda-road bike, this is just mystifying.
Hey Bobbie whatcha doin there bud?
Wtf why are you so cool. That bike is amazing
Dude I used to ride tall bikes in high school! Are they coming back? I’m thirty lol
I have a friend who's aggressively NB and they build their own tall bikes! What's up with enbies and weird ass bikes

I tried to ride one and it bucked me off.

Edit: the bike, not my friend
Bobbie looks like the coolest person ever
This the most non binary shit I’ve ever seen and I’m living for it. Get it Bobbie!
Bestie... I’m speechless at everything about this
Wow, that's a really tall bike!
let’s fucking go this is the nb representation we need. thank you so much for being you.
""Bobbie Rides Their Tallbike"" sounds like a children's book
Everyone is asking how you get off - I'm waaaay more interested/concerned to know how you stop at a traffic oightt WITHOUT getting off or run over lol
That looks incredibly dangerous, please be careful.

Now you need a dashcam so us commoners can see the nice view too!
I LOVE this picture of you and i LOVE this new form of biking for me to learn!!!!!
Wooooahhh!!! So happy for you!
bro what with the tall bike tho???? bro--- thats terrifying and so cool omg---
I now know what to add in my next daydream : )
Hell yeah! That’s awesome. Also, you look very cool in this picture
congrats dude!
Imagine the confusion on the faces of some people reading that oof
I legitimately thought this was a surreal meme, and its still cool
How long are the brake cables on that thing? That said, it's a rad bike
That bike is sick as fuck and I want one!
Congrats! Also I’ve never seen a bike like that before!
Damn I can't even ride a normal bike. Your bike's color scheme is cute!
Accidently read this as ""Baddie"" instead of Bobbie and just went with it 😂
My Dutch heart is unsure how to feel about the bikes you sacrificed and tore apart to make this… bike. Cool picture nonetheless B)
sick fucking tallbike
That bike looks absolutely terrifying to ride
how the hell do you get down from there 😭
We have a tallbike rider in our neighborhood, too! It's the only time I can wave at someone from my yard since our fence is like 7 feet tall, but I can always see their head passing by and sometimes I'll get a little wave back.
that smile and fit and tells me you are crazy stylish and genuine ✨keep freakin biking
Tallbike bobbie tallbike bobbie

Ya really do love to see those - congratulations bud!
Thank you Bobbie, very cool
That's so dope 😱😭😁💖
Life goals neatly compiled into one image.
Seriously kickass!
That’s awesome that they actually put the correct pronouns!

But also, that looks absolutely terrifying and horrifying to ride (cool but)!!!
Yay! So happy for you!
Omg more tallbike nonbinary people!!!!! Feel free to dm!
Nice!
But that’s a fucking high ass bike 
I would not get on that any time soon
This is so fucking cool
W
Congrats! Also, your outfit fucking rocks!!
Superior
That's such a tall bike. Congrats getting on the newspaper! I hope people continue to get better with nonbinary pronouns as the years go on in this world :)
I am in awe of everything about this
Everything about this is iconic
Badass, but also, badass!!!
Tall bikes are PEAK non-binary... I'm gonna get one now...
This photo and comment thread temporarily cured my depression wow
damn that bike sure can tall
Yes that is awesome!
thats a fucking SAVAGE LEAN
I’m sorry, your *what* bike?
Wow that's a tall bike
BRUH YOU'RE SO COOL
pls tell me abt ur tallbike, im intrigued. it looks very different to [colin furze's hicycle](https://youtu.be/vZFDNR9V5Nc)
That’s cool as heck. I need to know more about this tall bike. Did you make it? What was the welding process like? How many different bikes were used?
Ngl that looks terrifying lol
this is awesome but is the side of your body and head okay because that looks very unbalanced
As a cis person, lemme say *woah*
Wheres ur helmet lol
I love you Bobbie
This made my whole decade
NICE

also, iconic caption
You look so cool!!! And the bike is also very beautiful 💗
Everything about this is so amazing
Earthbound 4 is looking real good.
yo that bike is BOSS. love the bars and the paint especially!
It’s awesome that you got in the local newspaper, but *what in the Kentucky Fried Christ are you riding on?*
YAY!!!!
Period
That’s amazing Bobbie !!
Tallbikes? Wtf? Every day we stray further from god

But fr that's awesome you got gendered correctly
Ok main character 😤
Love this so much. Fellow freak bike enthusiast here :)
this is the coolest pic i have seen today
how do you stop that and get off lol
you are my idle 😭😭
Bobby is better than the rest of us
Where a helmet Bobbie. You're very important.
This person is 23km to your location
Wow. You are incredible!
how do you get on and off???
Is that even grammatically correct
I love everything about this except that you're not wearing a helmet! A fall from that height will cause D A M A G E. Pls be safe
this is exactly the kind of representation I want
Make every one look up to the enbys!
I’ve seconded the motion to enter tallbikes into enby cannon Now all that’s left is to vote. I also want one but I’m lazy and don’t know how to weld.
This is super epic, but how the heck do you get up on the tallbike? Do you have a ladder or a stool? Does a friend give you a boost? Or are you just blessed with supernatural climbing and balancing skills?
You are truly badass. Bravo Bobbie! Edit: autocorrect
I think the headline ""Bobbie rides their tallbike"" is anyway one of the best headlines
🔥🔥✊🏾
Alright shit, gotta build a tallbike now
Talbikes omg. How do I make one?
If we don't know where you live, how can I go to your house and take your bike??? smh bobbie
Well i know another enby framebuilder and i'm starting myself (at both lol), it could be a thing
The excessive censor is half of the reason I upvoted lmao

&#x200B;

Bobby... rides their tallbike-

 No other context
Not pictured: my terrified face while almost falling off after turning hard to show off for the camera (:
*good*
What I tell people who don’t know me: it’s for social distancing 

What I tell my friends: it’s because I crave attention

Why I actually did it: I’m insecure about my height
I know a guy in the Netherlands with a tall bike. I believe he has a tandem version as well, where you sit above each other instead of behind.
First thing my Dutch brain thought was: This bad boy can fit so many extra kids and shopping bags
It’s called a tallbike! It’s a mishmash of like 5 different bike frames (made by yours truly) specifically designed for me to live my best attention-hoe life :)
It's two bikes that glitched.
Thanks I tried my best :)
I do not joust *yet* but have always been interested!

By the way, where can I find freakbikers? I’ve been looking for groups for forever but I’m resigned now to the idea of just starting my own
I mean, fair enough. Half of the reason of posting at all was to show it off ¯\\_(ツ)_/¯
Umm actually, monster trucks are the car equivalent of this one specific bike
It’s called a tallbike and riding it’s only as terrifying as it looks for the first couple of times :)
Alright but only if we also talk about how Australia started (and lost) a war with *emus*
FAQ:

Q: How do you get off?

A: I find the nearest BMW with dealer plates and clatter down onto the roof like a nicotine-addicted college freshman drops a plate of tacos onto a customer’s chest at the whitewashed Mexican restaurant they get underpaid to work at

Q: did you make it yourself? Why?

A: yes, because I’m an attention whore

Q: what happens if you fall

A: death

Hope that answers at least one of your questions :)
Thank you, double thank you, and triple thanks lol. Next time I’ll put some pride flags on it :)
To quote myself from another comment:

I find the nearest BMW with dealer plates and clatter down onto the roof like a nicotine-addicted college freshman drops a plate of tacos onto a customer’s chest at the whitewashed Mexican restaurant they get underpaid to work at
How do they get on in the first place 👀
I love ***you***
Hoo buddy, I’ll tell you, giraffes are one **hell** of a gateway drug
If there’s something nearby for me to hold onto or put my foot down onto I’ll do that, or just ride in slow circles while I wait. Worst case scenario I just hop down and get back up when i have a safe chance to go
Uhhh dying slowly, I guess
Hey buddy, takes one to know one. You’re cool too 😎
They never left! It’s not too late to get back into (on top of?) tallbikes again :)
I spent lots of time with my local bike shop on that one actually. Front brake is 6ft, rear brake is 8ft 3in, and my rear shifter cable is 10ft 8in
Honestly it applies perfectly well :)
There’s really no right way to make a tallbike, it’s actually a pretty personal and self-expressive process. Furze spent a lot of time planning his out where as with mine, I just threw metal together till I was satisfied
It’s got parts from 7 different bikes, but all in all it’s 4.5 bikes worth of metal. Mostly done with a cheap flux-core MiG welder, but some other welders at the shop I built it in put a couple of stick and TiG welds on it too
centrifugal force keeps them solidly anchored to the ground
Picture was taken during a hard turn so lean angle was intentional, but I did *almost* fall afterwards
Maybe they jump on it out of the first story window like they're a movie cowboy escaping their lover's spouse on their trusted steed.
Bobbie...
haha, i was wondering if the you were doin a sick turn or mid fall tbh
entirely valid and righteous
Me, with my platform shoes, all of these answers
Well make sure not to fall while soaring above us commoners
I kind of love it, it's like a modernized penny-farthing, which I WOULD use if it weren't so difficult and dangerous.
I want one
Geez tallbikes are so cool! It's so awesome that you made it yourself. You're clearly one cool person!
Depends where you are. If you're in a big city they're is most likely a group, in a small town you're probably going to have to get some friends interested and stay your own club.

You can DM me where you live and I might be able to point out where to look if you're in a city.
Haha if that was M I'll do it too tbh
well obviously we're going to talk about that now that i know it's a thing
Ok but how do you get *on*?
I love this!
I don’t, I sleep up there
That is the greatest response to anything I've ever asked, ever 🤣🤣 thank you
How do you get back on?
Shit I didn't even notice it wasn't a single speed! That's something else!
That’s so rad.
Ty
Honestly that one question could apply to my entire life and the answer is:

yes
I plan not to, honestly it’d hurt me just as much as whoever I land on
Me too!
Oh and there's also the [Freakbikers Unite](https://www.facebook.com/groups/629140550476950/?ref=share) Facebook group.
r/emuwarflashbacks
If you give the tallbike a stern look, it will be intimidated into to keeping itself upright long enough for me to throw a grappling hook on the seat and scale up the side
How do you get on and off that bike? Do you always have to look for a wall or something from that hight? Or is it possible to somehow jump down and prevent if from falling?
As someone who's been in the hospital for an accident on a regular-height bike, I'd like to say please wear a helmet.

The smoothest pronoun line I've ever seen		"Cha Cha Real Smooth
I would die on the spot if I got this comment
The most satisfying part is that they used the right ""their""😌
Shouldn't it be hers/theirs?
if anyone ever said this to me i would pass out right then and there
holy shit
The world may be on fire, but I am glad I am living through a renaissance of nonbinary comedy.
This is wholesome AF.
Love this, haha!
Don't mind me stealing this to use on myself-
Why is everyone yelling?
This person would earn a coffee date from me just for that lol
I’d die if anyone did that to me-
Oooh I finally get it. Nice :)
👉👈 ☺️ I would die right them and there but I would be happy.
\#wholesome

my heart is healed
but shouln't the second one be her/theirs instead? 

I understand it's not serious event but I'm curious for whenever I encounter she/they pals in a serious situation
[removed]
[removed]
Grammatically, yes. But not for the line. It's a misdirection.
Gimme ur pronouns I wanna use this line on u
Their tag says ""They/ Them"" but I wish I was they/ theirs...
It would be, but for the proposes of the line, its she/theirs. Wouldnt work as well if they put hers/theirs
hers/theirs actually, but as you say this is just a fun play on words situation.
You're in r/nonbinary...

Do you need a hug?
I think your confusion probably comes from thinking of non-binary as a third gender. It's an umbrella term that encompasses any gender outside of the gender binary.

It's different for everyone.

I use he/they, but my non-binary best friend uses a really long list of neopronouns.

Another non-binary friend of mine uses she/they.

We all resonate with non-binary identities.
pronouns =/= gender! anyone of any gender can use any pronouns, so she/her aren’t necessarily “female” pronouns and not all nonbinary people use they/them. i’m nonbinary and i use she/they just because that’s what i’m comfortable with!
F’king marry me-
Thank you :)
Thank you :)
They probably don't deserve hugs
[removed]
[removed]
I'll be at the chapel in 10
You're right
How are neopronouns harmful?
pronouns include words like we, us, I, you, it, none of which indicate gender. the “point” of pronouns are to be used as words to replace nouns to improve sentence flow. i am nonbinary and you can use the pronouns she or they to replace the noun that is my name, but neither of those words has to necessarily indicate my gender.
WAIT WHATS THE DRESS CODE
[removed]
We met in r/nonbinary so hoodies obviously
I'm neurodivergent (I'm autistic specifically, hello), they're pretty easy to learn. I understand the memory issue, but most people are willing to be friendly and patient about reminding people.

I understand that not all neurodivergent people are like me, but most of us can understand different pronouns perfectly fine.

All language is - technically - made up. The words you're reading right now? Made up. ""I love Ryan!! Bee is so sweet"" (for example) shouldn't be too hard to understand

And if someone thinks the trans community is ridiculous, they will think we're ridiculous even without neopronouns.
Great! I’ll see you there
[removed]
I used to go by they/them but now I can't wait to go by you/yours
I,,,,, already said I don't speak for all neurodivergent people.

Also, do you... know anything about the history of neopronouns? Or who mostly uses them?

Did you actually come here to get educated on something or are you just here to argue?
Boi/sir/ma’am/ captain, if you don’t get married I will physically fight someone
[removed]
Haha thanks, mate. I might message u in a couple years to come battle someone.
The only reason we're having this conversation right now is because you asked a question and I wanted to answer it.

Did you want an actual answer to that question or were you asking to argue?"	kwe8jl	NonBinary	5182	1.0	2021-01-13 11:01:43
Take me to your leader... And tell me their pronouns		"Oh my god, I feel this in my bones.
Blending in with the family.
Literally me!!!! I never related to a meme so much
What a mood and a half
Ayyyy I need this image without the text
omg i’ve never seen a meme that has reflected how i feel so much
Gender and aesthetics weirdly co-constitute each other, at least that's my assumption lastly.
Can I have the original image please?
This pretty much encapsulated me at the core level, like I've never really felt any great affinity for either human body plan. I sometimes wonder if what I have is less gender dysphoria and more species dysphoria.

I swear, I sometimes long to have 5 sided radial symmetry.
Sometimes i feel like I'm not androgynous enough but idk
Me, except the skinsuit needs a beard.
I just remembered that my gender is Juno Birch
I mean, you don't NEED to behave, dress and present as very androgynous to be nb, its enough to feel nb :)
This made my day!
This is peak.
Me getting ready to perform femininity at work 😅
Me!!!
Yes, this 😭
god this is good
I'm in this picture and I don't like it XD
Ugh, work drag...
Holy crap that’s accurate.
If you look up ""alien ironing human suit"" it should pop up
what do you mean?

I did it! For the first time I legitimately, confidently came out to someone today. I told them my name, I told them my pronouns, I didn't back down, and I didn't doubt myself. Finn the Human is one happy enby rn!		"Finn is such a great name! And your hair! And your smile! Aaah, everything is so great in the picture it just makes me smile, thanks for that
 What are your pronouns? I’m still struggling with this
OMG I LOVE ADVENTRUE TIME
PRETTY ENBY PRETTY ENBY
Yessss. Well done!! I'm so proud of you
you are really adorable (no romo). and the name Finn really suits you :)
Hi Finn! Well done! :D
Yes!! Good job!!
:D
Get a dog and name it jake
Finn you are so rad
For a minute, my brain blanked and I tried long-pressing the ⬆️ because I was trying to make it into a ♥️! You look so happy and I am 100% Here For This Joy.
Did you choose Finn because of the NB child from She-ra?
Well I’m proud of you, Finn! 
Stick up for yourself, you deserve it ☺️
You look like Shane from The L word! I had such a crush on her 🤣💓
Heck yeah!
Good 👍
Congrats Finn!
Congratulations! It’s really liberating to do so, and helps build real connection with people in my experience. Good for you! 😊
Love the name! And congrats so much!
so happy for you!! your hair and your smile are magnificent, and the name finn really suits you.
Congrats! Also, our names rhyme. Finn and Quinn!!! :)
Hell yeah, Finn! Welcome to the club ❤️
You're so pretty :D
This is awesome. Way to go Finn!! ✨✨✨✨
👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻
Proud of you!! Please reach out if you need anything :)
I remember when that happened to me for the first time. I didn’t even know that much serotonin was possible
Good job Finn!
So proud of you, you go Finn!!
Congratulations! Let me just say that you look so happy, that it makes me smile too.
whoa congrats :) very proud of you :) also Finn is a really cool name :D
Congrats!  I know the feeling. My work recently updated their policy on pronouns. Like just the proper way to put them in emails/for your Zoom name.

I hadn't really told anyone at work I'm non-binary. But visibility matters. So I changed both my email signature and Zoom name to include (They/Them). 

It seems like such a small thing to some. But it felt really confirming to me!
Sorry, I'm a bit late to this post... I saw it on my notifications and clicked so I can look at it later but didn't get a chance yesterday. When I saw this pop up in my notifications I knew I just had to see it and congratulate you! So congratulations! It takes so much courage to do that, something I'm still struggling with. I've only come out to one person, my best friend, so far and I haven't even told them the name I'm thinking of. So I really admire and look up to people like you. Thank you for sharing this to Reddit, seeing this has given me the confidence boost I needed. Have a great day Finn the Human, and good luck with coming out to more people. <3
You're an inspiration ✨
Hiii fellow Finn! 
You have a great taste in choosing names. 

-another enby Finn
Congrats Finn! The first time is always the hardest, you did really well 💜
WAIT UR SO PRETTY XIFJGJGJSHCJXHDH V
Just to make sure. your name is Finn, right?
you're radiant! I'm so happy for you!!
🎵The fun that never ends🎶
I had to correct my pronouns to my dentist when I was under sleepy gas right before an operation probably the weirdest coming out story so far 😅
ahhhhh you're so cute uwu
Finn is absolutely my favorite name of all time!
Never seen someone with irl anime hair
Hi Finn the human!! I'm so proud of you!! Great job on coming out! Many more years of happy non-binary-ing to you, my friend!

Love, Finn*ly* the human
Yesss!!! I’m so proud of you, Finn! Nice to meet you, I’m Kai!💕
Oh my god, you look fricking awesome! Can u tell me some tips on how to be enby and look this way?
Did you come out to ""Jake the Dog?"" by any chance?
Or a vampire lady?
Named after a Cartoon Network character but sort of look like a Disney channel character

I’m so confused

Also opinions on Finn in learning with pibby?
No, thank *you* :)
I prefer they/them but I'm chill with the occasional she/her. I would just say she/they, but when I do that people just ignore the they part haha.
Haha me too! That's not the reason I chose Finn but I gotta say I'm really happy about being Finn the Human
💛🤍💜🖤
Thank you!! :D
Thank you! And that's the first time I've ever seen ""no Romo"" and I love it haha :)
Thank you 😊
Thanks!! :)
Definitely thought about it haha
Haha thanks 😎👉👉
Thank you haha!! 💜🥰
No, I actually don't know that one! I just felt a strong connection to Finley (the meaning felt significant to me and it just felt right y'know?), and I enjoy the whole ""Finn the Human"" thing since I was a big Adventure Time fan haha.
Thanks! I'm so glad I did! ☺️
Haha thank you 😘
Ha, so did I!! 🤘🤘
Thank you! :)
Thank you so much! I do feel so much lighter having finally gotten it out there. I also feel much more seen and understood, it rocks :)
Thank you!!
Aw, thank you so much! ☺️
Oooh I love it!! Finn the Human and Quinn the Person? Just spit-balling, haha.
Thanks! My fav club yet :)
Thank you!! 💛🤍💜🖤
Thanks!!! 🥰
💃🕺💃🕺
You look so wonderfully happy and so beautiful!
Will do 💜
Right?! My brain is sparkling
Thank you!! :)
Aw! I'm so glad :)
Thank you! I like it quite a bit :)
That's huge, I'm so proud of you! Seriously, congratulations on asserting your identity, no matter how big it small the gesture it's a big deal every time!
Aw!! Thank you 🥺
Hey Finn! I love your name, you must be very cool.

-Finn
Thank you so much! It's a big weight off my chest :)
💛🤍💜🖤
Haha yep it is :)
Thanks ☺️
Lol yeah it's still gonna be a long run but hey. First steps are the hardest right? (I hope so lol)
Hahahah I love that! I can see it like a scene in a hilarious enby coming-of-age film. Glorious
Really?? That's awesome! I gotta say, it's definitely one of my favs now too haha
Haha thank you? Maybe?
Hey Kai, nice tie meet you too ☺️
Sure!

I used the angle of the pic to hide me chest, otherwise I wear a binder a lot and am looking into top surgery.

I use Pinterest a lot to pin pictures of hair cut/color inspirations to share with my hair dresser, now she just knows what I like so I always get a cool cut. She loves when I tell her that people say I have ""anime hair"" lol!!

I wear whatever makeup I feel like wearing, usually some eyeliner, because I've always loved makeup and I'm naturally a blonde so without makeup my eyebrows and lashes kind of disappear haha!

I color my hair at home with Arctic Fox (I use Ritual and/or Virgin Pink, but there are tons of awesome colors!) It works well for me since, again, I'm blonde, but if you have darker hair you may want to visit a salon to get it lightened up a couple levels so the color shows up (my natural is only a medium-dark blonde, so it's not like I started with platinum or anything).

And as for clothes, I get almost all my clothes from Target! Their men's section is like, enby heaven, and their women's section has great stuff too! If you dig enough into my profile you'll find tons of pics of outfits I've gotten from there. I also have sensory issues and overall I prefer things that are just simple and basic but have nice colors. Solid color or color blocked tees and hoodies are my fav! 

And that's the story of how I built my ""enby look"" lol!
[deleted]
I just don’t want to be ‘it’. The last time I said to people I was non binary, they just used my biological pronouns anyway. It was pointless.
that’s so cool go Finn the human!! my names ren and it’s from a video game lol
Well, you look just like her! 🤣💓
YES ! I love that!!!
*finger guns*

So do you :) you're probably cool af
YESS I LOVE YOUR HAIR
Well, good for you Finn!
Yes thank you. It was a compliment lmao it looks really good on you
Right?? Just femby problems haha
Yeah I've come across that a lot and I'm sure I'm going to continue to. But for now at least I've got one person making the effort haha
I love that name!!
What video game?
I'm not OP. ☺️

Thank you!! ☺️
Aw well thanks that's really sweet of you to say ☺️

I dig the glasses. You have an awesome aesthetic
You are very handsome and gorgeous :) hope you are feeling happier on the inside.
God so handsome!! I’m happy for you!
you look so badass I love it
Congrats ♥️
So happy for you!! You look really at peace in the second photo- not that you looked tense before, there's just a certain warmth and joy about the more recent photo that radiates through. 

I know revealing new pronouns for the first time feels HUGE to do at work. For me, the fear didn't override a gut feeling that it was all worth it- and a couple years later, my small team has decided that they're both more comfy with fluctuating pronouns in their bio. Your bravery at work might help others take a first step, too.
you look a lot happier!
Yesss. Be proud of yourself. :D
Congratulations!!!
you look so much happier in the second pic just in your eyes! honestly both were great pics tho :))
🔥🔥🔥
You look much happier in the second pic. Like, TRUE happy instead of forcing it for a picture.
yes!!!! So beautiful and handsome!!!
Wow you look awesome!
Wowowowow inspiring!
another she/they enby! hello!
Look amazing! So happy for you
you are very very good looking
Ahhh your glow up made me audibly gasp. You look so good!
I still haven’t had the courage to update my work pronouns

You're so amazing and thank you so much for all you're doing to help the queer community. We're all blessed to have you fighting for all of us 💛
I love your shirt and your hair, never thought pink and green could match so well and look so good
That’s amazing!!! You are such a great example for all young enbies that we can be comfortable in our presentation and still be taken seriously. (Especially since people try to tone down our trans to be more “professional”)
Congratulations! Keep up the good work 💛🤍💜🖤

You keep rocking,  frendo!

Hiya recently came out as Non-Binary going by the name Luna and They/Them pronouns. Unfortunately my family has not been supportive...		"Luna, I absolutely love your aesthetic!

I hope your parents will come around. Stay in there! <3
1) Luna, I absolutely love the clothing and hair colour combo, very close to my aesthetic and it's always rad to see!
2) Hopefully it's only a short term thing and once they get their heads round it they get their s*it together and start being supportive.
3) if they start being terrible try to reach out to someone local immediately so you have backup on the worst case. 
4) Congratulations on coming out! It's hard to do and I'm constantly impressed by people keeping at it!
We’re your family now
Hi Luna! Congratulations on the self exploration and journey. It can take time for family to understand which is BS in my opinion ... It's been 2 years since I came out and my mom is still convinced they/them isn't grammatically correct. I've bluntly said, ""Are you telling ME that you know more about me than I do?""   
She made up some BS excuse and how she ""supports me"" but ... then ... doesn't show ANY support.   


Right now, chosen family will be your best humans. Sadly our society does gender policing of AMAB folks soo much and view it on some sort of attack. You are beautiful and valid and we are here. Definitely reach out to a local pride group, and make sure that you have people who see and validate you. 

Your family is wrong and losing a beautiful opportunity to support and hold space for a beautiful human who is learning and growing to know themself more each day. 

Love your whole look! <3
Look at me, I'm the family now!

Plus, your aesthetic is awesome, as is your name choice! Reminds me of a lot of songs about the Moon: *Luna y sol*, *By the rising of the Moon*, *Mesecina*...
I love the hair, Luna.
Luna, you are EVERYTHING! You look radiant & confident, don't let anyone take that from you! Queer Fierceness 🏳‍🌈🖤✨
Hi Luna! I love your top and vibe so much!
Also you are rocking that hairstyle!
All the positive vibes~!
Hey Luna! 
You know, as a queer person you get to choose your family ☺️
We love you! ♥️
i know how u feel, my mom is transphobic and still refers to me as female. my dad is fine as long as i dont join a cult, and my siblings are to young to understand. i hope thing will be better for you.  also love the hair.
Ahhhh Luna!! You look so awesome :3 keep rocking it
luna suits u!
You are awesome. Never let anyone make you think otherwise.
We support you Luna!
Sorry to hear that Luna, hopefully your family comes around soon. I adore your everything. I WANT TO BE YOU!! Love your hair. Love your clothes. Love your face. You just look incredible.
Luna is a cool name
Luna is a gorgeous name! Can I also just say how much I love your style, omg that shirt...
Yaaaas, Luna! Congrats! Love the blue in your hair.💛
I’m sorry about your family… maybe it will just take time, family Is forever and they probably will come around eventually. Side note you look amazing hun❤️
I support you Luna!🌙💝
I love your look! And what a beautiful name! I'm so sorry that your family isn't being supportive. I hope they will come around.
Luna is a cool name and so is your hair
i absolutely adore your shirt and smile!
We support you Luna! Love your name and your style! I hope you find your people and that your family comes around and loves you for you who are 💙
Luna is such a beautiful person, and they have a lovely smile!! 💖
That’s sad to hear Luna. :(

I absolutely love you style/outfit, you look stunning in it! I hope this brightens your day. :D
I have a pet toad named Luna.
I'm sorry your family won't stand behind you, Luna. Truly their loss if they don't get themselves together and accept who you are. No matter what, a chunk of the internet has your back.

On a lighter note, as others have also said, but I'll echo it: your sense of style is *fantastic.* You really rock *you,* even if your folks refuse to see it.
I love your hairstyle!
What annoys me is that the kind of people that arent supportive also seem to label themselves as like free thinkers and ok with everything, allies, when they arent involved with it. 

Eg my mother supportive of gay friends, not of me being bi. Family being totally fine with me dressing (quite frankly ridiculous as a teen haha but wearing a total mishmash and not having an obvious gender)...differently and being all yeah thats just them they dress weird. But as soon as you put a word to it ‘non binary’ its like hell no thats not ok. 

You CAN get support you need elsewhere. I dont contact any of my 4 parents now im an adult and ive never been so happy
💚💚 family is the worst sometimes 😪 I hope you’re able to be yourself regardless!
And your hair is amazing!
Hang in there Luna! 

Celebrate the win you just had though, you’re finally free and it’s out there now. 

It took my mom a longtime to come around, but she finally did. You got this! Keep shinning!
You are a fabulous person, Luna! Awesome wardrobe and hair! :)
I have no clue how your family could be unsupportive when you look that good
Luna I love your outfit and hair. You also have a great smile. I'm in a similar boat where I simply could not find out to my family. However, I have plenty of close friends who have been amazing.
you look wonderful, I'm sorry your family are bigots
Luna I aspire to be you in the most not weird way possible
Fuck your family, im your family now and i 100% support you!
YOOO POG YOUR AMAZING I’m proud of you:)
Omg that smile in the second picture! You're too freaking cute!! 😍
I hope your family comes around and in the meantime, know you are surrounded by love and family can be chosen, too. I’m happy for you and proud of you. :) btw ur outfit is SO cute
Hey Luna! I must say, I absolutely adore that outfit! And I'm really sorry that your family doesn't accept who you are. It's disappointing that some people consider themselves ""family"" when they don't even accept your identity. Welp, you have us! We'll love and accept you no matter what because you are valid and deserve love and respect! 💖
Luna is a delightful name, it suits you! I'm sorry your parents haven't been supportive, I hope they change their mind because you deserve acceptance~
Luna, you are amazing
Hey, Luna! The name's Bea. Nice to meet you. You look amazing
Love your style!

Sorry about your parents. I hope you have other people in your life who support you.
You look so androgynous!
Firstly, I'm so sorry about your parents, I hope they'll accept you soon!

Secondly: OH MY GOD I am totally envying your gender, a very cis thing for me to do, but nonetheless, your aesthetic is immaculate
do you know anything about Heathers? you look soo much like JD from the movie. I love your style :)
Your vibes are immaculate and I am your family now, if you need support lemme know 😊
Heya Luna! Nice to meet you. Fab hair!
We'll be supportive, btw Luna great choice in name I love to see a fellow Luna & it suits you, also you look cool as hell
I love the name Luna ☺️☺️
I love your sense of style and the fact that you’re embracing and exploring yourself ❤️ also the name Luna is so pretty, such a great choice. I hope you are surrounded by safety and support eventually, and that you have affirming friends 😊
You’re stunning! Don’t forget to remember that
You got the big drip FR FR tho
Sorry to hear about your family I hope your friends are supportive or you can find a support group! You look awesome!
Luna's a badass name though, you're family is nuts to not support you since you have such good tastes
Dear Luna 

When I first saw your image I thought you were wearing one of those robes monks wore in the middle ages

Sincerely, Pax

P.S. Luna is a very nice name.
Luna, I'm so sorry to hear that your family isn't supportive. Please know that you are valid and deserve love and support. If you happen to have tiktok or Instagram Jeffrey Marsh is a huge source of support and information.
Luna, your name is as cool and amazing as your hair!!! Your look is 🔥. Family isn’t always supportive, but a lot of times they end up coming around. And sometimes we find our true families later on. You’re amazing, stay true to yourself
Your outfit is AMAZING.
I'm not out to most of my family because they're bigots, I'm sorry you're going through that. But I'm proud of you!
sorry Luna :( i'm glad that you have the opportunity to understand yourself a bit better and you have nothing but love and support from me and the rest of this community!
Fuck family memebers
Luna, you look awesome!! Love your hair!! I understand having unsupportive family, sorry you have to deal with that too. Try not to let them stop you from being yourself <3
Lord you are freaking GORGEOUS Luna! 😭😍🥺
Look at us Luna. We are your family now :)
I’ll be your mom!! I’m so proud of you!🏳️‍🌈🏳️‍🌈🏳️‍🌈
Luna you seem very cool! Love your hair and outift.
Omg you got some looks!!
I adore your style! Can I steal your hair style?
I love your aesthetic!! And I know it probably doesn’t mean much from a stranger online, but I’m 100% supportive and if you ever wanna text me if you’re not doing too good, I got you. I reckon we’d get along
Let the Queer community be your family😊
Amazing outfit and I love your hair ✌
Can I be you
[removed]
Luna,you gave me a heart attack! Moreover,i adored your hair.Peace out <3
I love your hair! How do you style it like that?
You look absolutely amazing! Welcome to the world of non-binaries Luna!
I fucking love that name, Luna!! And you’re hot af.
Well Luna, I think that is a lovely name and suits you very well ❤️ please feel free to reach out! I’m always looking for enby friends!
Luna I absolutely love your smile, your clothes are super pretty too and your hair looks epic <3
Haii! You're so cute I love your outfit 💕 I'm sorry about your family not supporting you. That's why you've got us!
Luna. WHAT THE FUCK YOU LOOK GREAT. Your hair is amazing, and that shirt is just- AAA
Be you, be happy! You also have a great smile, keep being yourself!
Hi Luna I love your outfit!!❤️❤️
Looking great, Luna! :)💙✨
Hey Luna! I love your style
Hey Luna, I see that you're seeing plenty of this already but you look awesome, you are valid, you seem totally awesome and your family is wrong. :D
Cool shirt. Does this style have a name to search?
So sorry your family hasn’t been supportive! I know the feel. You look amazing! Love the hair and your name totally matches it!
Also this is a compliment but you remind me of Christian slaters JD 👁👁
Great name and gorgeous look! 

I'm sorry your family isn't there for you and hope they will come around. In the meantime, please know I'm sending internet mom hugs if you want them and you can hit me up for mom advice, support, and encouragement any time you want. You are perfect just as you are and I admire your courage and ability to be true to yourself. Stay strong, dear one.
Oh my goodness, Luna, you look amazing! I can't think of a name that fits your vibe better than Luna *and* can I just say that your haircut looks absolutely killer with your face shape?
You almost look like Daniel Thrasher
Congrats on coming out, it’s never easy. You also have the same name as one of my black cats, it really suits you
I’m all about your whole look
Hot dang! Keep rocking it <3
Your hair style is amazing for your face shape 😍
You certainly look as cool as the moon!
bby i will adopt you. 

you’re doing amazing. i’m so proud of you.
Amazing sense of style! I'm sorry you're in a situation that isn't accepting, hope you can find a way out soon.
You are a confident and amazing being and your parents are dicks if they don't support you.
WOAH i love your style!! keep bein you bud!!
I'm sorry your parents weren't supportive but that doesn't make you any less valid!! You are valid and loved and I support you. Love your style too btw
It’s strange that your parents dont support their obviously stylish kid. I’m sure they’ll realize how much cooler you are now eventually
You are absolutely adorable omg 😍😍😍
People, especially older ones, have such a hard time with the non-binary concept, they’re so entrenched in the binary roles.  Hopefully time, love, and seeing you live your most authentic life will turn them around!  Cheers and best wishes!!
You seem like a sweet person! Here's hoping for you to meet a family to love and respect you and give you all the support you ever need! We all can be your far-away family right now!
Also, you look real fine ^_^
Luna you are so adorable, I wish I could pull that off, I’m looking for tips as an amab nb person myself, all the ideas I’ve seen other than you have just made me look like I’m ftm. I really hope your family come round soon, that’s why I’m still in the closet. If ever you wanna talk just ask for my Discord, I’m always on there.
Thanks 😊
I totally agree! I love how their nails match their hair!
Thanks I have am now an opshopping addict ahha, Thanks for the advice will keep that in mind 😁
I'm so glad my family includes not only Luna but also GothCatButt
Yes
Yes. Drink plenty of water and eat your veggies.
Awwwh thankss 🥰
Yeah in the past few months I have bought too many skirts and crop tops ahahah
It sure has 😁🥰😊
Yeah it's crazy because throughout my life I didn't really fit into social norms in terms of personality for being (amab) but it had been locked away because I was never in safe environments always had straight friends who treated me badly because I was different, I just never quite fitted in with most guys. I would of been in my element if I got into a friend circle of gays or girls because I can be quite flamboyant and just because of my gentle friendly nature. But the way things went never allowed for that. But i have grown and feeling amazing about my growth as a person despite my current situation with my family
Awhhh thankssss 😊
I know righttt, I own too many skirts now!!! 🤪
Yeah I have a very good circle of friends, moved into a queer flat at the start of the year where I have been able to explore myself a lot more. I love it here so much.
Yes i have had that before, I used to have black hair and I looked just like him
Awh thanksss sure do 😜
Yeah sure it's nothing fancy
[removed]
[removed]
Like the color or?
Awhh thankss 🥰
Also your outfit you posted the other day was very cute!
I don't know it's just a females sports lace hoodie I believe, found it at an opshop
Yep I have been getting a lot of that, I used to have black hair and the resemblance was pretty good
Thanksss
I obviously can't speak for Luna, but personally, if I'm gonna be surprised by an asshole in my face, I'd rather it be a GothCatButt than a judgmental human.
We're all family here.
You’re welcome. I can’t not complement someone who looks remarkable.
I don't think it's possible to have too many skirts and crop tops...
Yay! 🥰

Luna, I hope live a happy and healthy life where you can dress and express yourself however you want! :D
Lol. It looks great.

My dad sent me this after I told him I prefer they/them pronouns.. I love my dad		"Nothin sweeter than a parent showing their support through bad Facebook memes 🥲
that is the cutest, most Dad shit ive heard today
Big dad energy 10/10
A true ally.
Can I have your dad? 🥺 /hj
This shows lgbt humor is very easy to get when you’re not a bigot
That is genuinely quite funny.
my dad is telling my mom she should be imprisoned for even allowing me to consider bottom surgery :/

if i were afab i don’t think he would
Well in italian even asshole is a gendered word
Interesting fact in one of my first years in high school (about 14yrs old) there was a girl who always said “suck my dick” when she disagreed with someone, she gave no shts whatsoever, it was extremely funny as well.
We should have a sub for gender/trans dad jokes. I'd love to share my humor with my dad who otherwise wouldnt really get it.
I used to work with s very lively man in his 60s who tried to be inclusive. He didnt always get it but made sure he used gender neutral insults. There were a lot of assholes, shitheadd, turdlickers etc. He wanted to make sure he only upset the person he was actively insulting and not accidentally offending anyone else. He is great.
This is great, lol
I'm glad you have such a supportive dad. :) Cute dad meme too.
FR this is me. I started using it instead of gendered epithets like a decade or so ago
I love this…supportive dads are best dads
That and mate
That feels like a Bojack Horseman quote for some reason
Our dad now
Gotta love a dad with good humour.  Thats awesome.
Wish I had parents like this lol
this is such a dad response
this is based, my go to is comrade
True
This may be inappropriate and not entirely related, but i've been thinking about this for the longest time. 

I have to the conclusion that anal sex is the most egalitarian kind of sex. Everyone can do it in the exact same way. Boy pussy, Girl pussy, Boy dick, Girl dick, intersex genitals, nonbinary genitals... It don't matter, the asshole is the great equalizer.  


Thank you for comming to my TED talk.
happy cake day
I think that applies to any type of humour, not just the LGBTQ2S+ community. Comedy falls under farce, burlesque, and satire but people forget that since everyone has their head so far up their asses nowadays and think their feelings trumps the world.
…. Why? Most creatures have an asshole I don’t understand why that word would be gendered even in more Latin based languages
Fuck, that was me.
It should be called Hi trans, I'm Dad
Because even creatures and animals are gendered in Italian!
Wait what!? 

That would be interesting if you were the same person though.   But also interesting that did exactly the same thing.
So is asshole masculine or feminine? Now I’m curious lol
In German that’s the case too, but at least asshole is neutral
I mean, I definitely did that. I'm female, and I didn't have a word for agender at the time, so it could check out. SCHS roughly 2012-2013?
It is masculine (asshole=buco del culo) but if used as an insult, it is a completely different world and it depends on the insuted person’s gender. Asshole= Stronzo (masculine) Asshole= Stronza (Feminine)
Neutral does not exist in italian (except for few nouns) so the enby community here is making a civil war on ""What gender we have to use as neutral"" or ""what letter we have to use besides ""O"" and ""A"" at the end of a word""
Sadly no, this was in 2017 FHS.
Haha that’s interesting

My mom thinks telling people my pronouns at work is unprofessional. I'm pretty sure she's got it backwards.		"Telling people your pronouns is completely professional! I work at a mid sized start up. First day I was asked if I felt comfortable giving my pronouns!! I was so honored to be asked!! They/them is officially in my signature!
Yeah waaaay backwards! Add it to your email signature too so people know before they meet you :)
You're actively stopping people making you uncomfortable in the workplace by using the wrong pronouns for you. Sounds like a very professional thing to do.
I love your hair!
Telling people your pronouns is completely professional and it helps create a comfortable work environment where you don’t feel uncomfortable expressing your gender identity
professional enby status achieved 👌🏻
As Markiplier would say, ""you right.""
Are you a lab technician?! What are you studying?
You look so good ! This pic def is going to my random good looking people folder
Def not unprofessional!!! I personally go by she/they/he, but I worked with a trans girl who had an enamel pin that said she/her (we didn’t have name tags btw) and it helped her not get misgendered as much. Of course there are always assholes 🙄 thankfully where we worked though our coworkers stood up for each other (we’ve banned someone before lol).
I see it all the time in service providers up here for my kid now. Definitely professional.
OMG YOU'RE SO CUTE! And don't listen to her I have my pronouns on my badge too
I guess I’m not the only enby scientist
It’s literally a proper introduction telling people your pronouns on a badge. I literally have mine in my signature for emails because it’s required at my job. Your mom is wild lol
yep, its becoming more common, and I think it's wonderful. I see it showing up in zoom calls too, next to names, which I very much appreciate.
Damn you look professional as fuck
You’re absolutely right—I work for big company, and they have an official template for corporate employees to put their pronouns in their email signature. Can’t get much more professional than that! Someday I’ll be brave enough to add mine, too :) Thank you for paving the way for us all!
Or just like “person”
Personally I think you look quite professional! ~~Now as for whether it's good to look professional, That is a question for the ages, One to which I know not the answer.~~
It’s extremely professional! Everyone at my university and workplace include their pronouns in introductions and emails.
Thank you, this is so inspiring! I just came to Reddit to cool down after losing my head over applying for my first job out as nonbinary. I'm really grateful I found your post \^\^
[removed]
high-key also love this look! Was told I couldn't put my pronouns on my nametag when I worked at (insert corporate coffee shop here), but now that I'm working in a professional capacity, it's fairly common.
wow i love your hair sm ;D
why are u so cute 🥺👉👈
Yo I love your haircut, I've been thinking of getting a similar one after covid. Do you know what it's called or have a reference image I can show a hairdresser or something?
I work for a world-class research institution where posting and asking about pronouns is common-place. Respecting people is professional, and asking for respect is professional.
1. It’s very professional to expect people to address you as you are, dysphoria is no-one’s friend 
2. My god your hair is cute
You know what else is unprofessional then, telling people your name. Should really just make them guess.
So instead of saying like ""she did it"" I say ""them did it""? Also, ""they did it"" sounds confusing cus I usually think of multiple people.
Ohmygoodness, this is a brilliant idea! Can't believe I've never thought of doing this before! 🤩
bravo! you look amazing!
I have a beach mat with the exact same pattern as your mask.


(also using your preferred pronouns is valid, no matter the situation)
She’s got it wrong, bud. You’re valid as heck.
Where do you work?? I have dreams of being a microbiologist, seeing fellow enbies in similar situations is amazing. :,)

You look great by the way, I love your hair!
Any company that values and works towards diversity and inclusion will encourage this behaviour. Your mum is unfortunately behind the times.
I do the exact same thing on my name badge at my work
I found out my new job was super supportive of trans people. I got a big, cute button with 'they/them/theirs' on it.

And promptly worked in the office for 3 days, because it happened at the end of March of this year. Whoops.

Relatedly, I sometimes feel like an asshole for correcting people when we do have Webex meetings or whatever, even though it's just 'Oh hey So-and-So, actually I'm a they/them, not <wrong pronoun>'. Like it feels disruptive and awkward to have to interrupt. Maybe I should be doing it differently, like talking to the people on the side or after the meeting?
Foooooortunately you didn't ask her opinion, so that works out.
Oh my goodness, I absolutely adore your hair!

I guess depends where you're based. I am on LGBTQ + panel at work (UK) and this was discussed there and introduced by the top ppl on the panel to include in the email signature. So although I have she/her in mine, it raises awareness and I hope that others feel free to include theirs too.
Cute!!! I love your hair!
Do you put them beside your name in parenthesis or underneath? I tried once but thought it threw off the look of my signature. And no one I work with has their pronouns in their signature. Also a small company ~45 employees
I was told to remove them from my signature in my last job as they said it was unprofessional and not allowed in the standard email signature.

They also were willing to use she/her for me (I'm amab) but when I asked them to use they/them I was ignored.

Finally, it came to a point where they said my pronoun pins were unprofessional (since I was required to be in a photo at least once a week, great for dysphoria/dysmorphia).

It's nice not working for them anymore.
It isn't really

I love this turn of phrase, but I've never heard it before. What's it referring to?
Here's the reference photo I gave the stylist https://pin.it/5m2GEJs
Lol I kinda did that accidentally when I changed it after working there a month. I told managers and people I worked with daily and just changed my name tag and hoped everyone else would just catch on.
My supervisor doesn't seem to have any issues with it lol. ""They're scheduled for this today. They did this testing"" etc. If anything it just makes it more clear people are talking about me since I'm the only enby there.
""They did it"" would be correct. Singular they is grammatically plural.
Not familiar with Webex specifically, but perhaps putting it on your screen name or status would do the job?
I put them under my name followed by my phone number
So it looks like this (note I do use a pseudonym on reddit)

Glad to hear you have found something better! That really sucks that your company wasn't accepting of you.
Wait hahaha you responded to a comment of mine TWO YEARS after I posted it to be a crybaby? What does that give you?

But also, no. A job, at least with how society fucntions right now, is about making money so you can pay your bills. If you're lucky, it might be something you like. It might even be a direct help to others. But while you're working, essentially putting yourself in the care of your employer, you deserve respect, health, and safety. Part of that is being addressed correctly. No one deserves to be disrespected or made to feel inferior on their shift. Your job is a large part of your life and you're not generally supposed to pretend to be someone else while doing it. You're supposed to be yourself.

Sorry if that hasn't been your experience in the workplace, probably means you deserve better. However, your comment does give the impression that you're the kind of person to be an ass to waitstaff and expect them to be thankful for it because a job is a service to others.
I'm 17 and I want to be an astrophysicist - seeing people like you proves to me that I *can* be gnc and still achieve my dreams. Thanks for putting yourself out there and being an awesome role model!
That’s so sweet! I’m a communications specialist at a freshwater bio lab near Lake Superior. It’s great seeing more of us gender-usurpers getting into the science field.

Oh, hi, fellow enby chemist! I'm an analytical chemist who mainly works in mass spectrometry. Do you mind sharing what your field is?
Aye thats what's up!
I think they're referring to the phrase saying someone lives under a rock to say they're out of touch

"Got called an ""it"" at a concert and didn't mind it. What do y'all think of it/its pronouns? I currently go by they/he 🏳️‍⚧️"		"I've had a complicated history with it/its pronouns. I am currently she/it pronouns, but I spent years in a runaround of those pronouns felt right to me but also were the ones cis people used to my face to dehumanize me, including my own dad. I took nearly a decade to accept that part of me.

If it/its pronouns feel like they fit, use them
For me, I prefer it/its because I feel that it fits me better than they/them. Nothing deeper than that. 

I went on a date the other day and someone told me that I didn't give off a masc or fem energy and I was delighted. Just wanted to share that :-)
I use them sometimes but only with my partner (normally go by they/them). Like if I have to talk about myself in third person ""oh my god it did something stupid again"" i.e. or he will talk about me in third person to me. I like it in that case, but I guess it's also because of our dynamic as a couple and often it's in a teasing way.

I know some write that it is dehumanizing, but I guess that is actually kinda the idea tbh, as I often wish I was more of an entity than a human being.
Unrelated but you and your friend (?) look rlly cool!
You look like you could own the pronoun ""it"" especially in a grunge band.
i use it/they but only because cis people have something against calling me an ""it"" even when i specifically ask
It/its pronouns are pretty cool and i personally don’t mind them but im only commenting to say that you and your friend look sick !
i'm not a fan if it/its because i feel that it dehumanizes, and that's how i've always seen the pronouns used. 

but my lack of experience with folks that prefer it/its pronouns doesn't make them wrong or bad. i'd just have to adjust.
I'm void punk, it/it's is fuckin dope. Love em. I don't use em cause while I want to be a blob of space plasma with eyes, I am unfortunately human & need to be treated as such for safety. Maybe if I lived in a different place or time. But for others I fully support being brave enough to use them
For me it/its are not as good as my actual pronouns they/them, but they're a whole lot better than she/her
I don’t mind it/it’s myself honestly. It disconnects perfectly for me.
I use it/they/he/xe. Also your sense of style is so good
I've had people use they/them to dehumanize me so I took it a step further and just started using it/its
I don't mind the idea of being called it/its by a loved one or a friend. I think they could feel right in a safe setting w/ people I trust, but I wouldn't like ""it"" being used for me in a hateful way. Shrugs
I like them! It's not okay to use it/its for someone who doesn't use those though, my brother-in-law refers to every non-binary as 'it'
I like them, and in a perfect world, I'd use them all the time, buuuutttttt. 

I don't. Because I don't trust cis people not to make it weird and about them somehow.
 ¯\\\_(ツ)_/¯

(Semi-related, i think, i also really like the third person style of speech that khajiit use in Skyrim, and I'd absolutely do that irl if it wouldn't garner me tons of weird looks lmao.)
As I've seen so often them being used to dehumanize and insult others I don't like them at all. If you want to use or reclaim that's on you but I don't like them at all.
Damn that choker tho
I love it/it’s pronouns! I use they/it
i use it/its, makes me happy and f anyone who tries to call me ’it’ as an insult because i like being called it :D (i also use he/him)
To me it’s all in the intent. If it’s rude it’s rude, if it’s cute it’s cute.
i ve recently started questioning my gender identity and i’m so confused. i don’t have any body-related gender dysphoria and i’m basically ok with my “default” (she/her) pronouns but…. idk i sometimes feel like i don’t to have any pronouns or gender at all. because she/her feel too binary (obviously), i definitely do not identify with he/him, they/them still feels not enough for some reason and it/lts feel too dehumanising. omg it’s so hard to explain (speaking in english which is not my native language doesn’t help either). like idk i feel like i don’t want to be perceived through any pronouns at all, be them binary or non-binary, but it/its really doesn’t feel human to me and i definitely feel human (?). does it mean that i’m agender? 
i also am comfortable with being female presenting, i strongly associate myself with femininity and female experience but not 100% of the time. sometimes i want to be perceived as someone who isn’t a girl or a boy but not as a non-binary person either????? like i want to be perceived just as a human being, without any concept of gender identity whatsoever. but it’s not possible in our society anyways so i keep this to myself mostly… does anyone relate..?
Increasingly popular Neopronouns. Okay as long as you are okay with it
It's one of my favorite sets! I can't use it IRL because reasons, but it reminds me that I'm a individual with complex emotions who's allowed to exist💖💕

Some people try to say it's transphobic to use it/its for yourself?? Which is confusing, because it can't be transphobic to asks for your identity and pronouns to be respected...
How do I become this rad?
It/it's/that doesn't bother me at all. Mostly because my first language is Finnish. We don't have gender specific Pronouns anyway. Even the current neutral version of (she/he) hän was first invented to appease Swedish who felt insulted that we call everyone and everything (it) se. It's culturally totally OK and correct to call people ""it"" here. When speaking English I usually go by they/them because having to explain using it/it's would get old very soon. 😅
If someone feels comfortable with it/its, then they should by all means use them. People shouldn't be called an ""it"" to insult them, they should only be called ""it"" if it's one of their pronouns
Some love it!
I got called it once on fb in the comments of our local news station, I really didn't mind it, actually kinda liked it since that meant the person commenting was unsure of my gender and chose to use neutral terms. I was like bwahahaha the gender chaos is working!
It pronouns are nice, I use them myself
Eh...as a BIPOC person in America, I'm not comfortable with it. For centuries, ""it"" was used against non-white people as a way to dehumanize us and justify our oppression (EDIT: And it still is, honestly). ""Oh, that's not a person, that's a monster, because of the color of it's skin. We're right to continue to treat it as such.""

Just writing that out makes my heart hurt.

And I'm probably gonna get flack for this, but almost all the people I've met who have said that their pronouns are it/its are white people. And I'm not comfortable calling them those pronouns because...because to me, it's basically a racial slur. So if someone, particularly a white person, asked me to call them ""it,"" that feels about as, well, *horrifying* as if a white person asked me to call them the n-word, or any other racial slur.
For me I used to go by he/they/it pronouns because I was in a time of my life where I felt more like a ‘thing’ then a person.
I finally started to realize my gender and just started using he/they
But to me it/its pronouns are cool af
Just wanted to say I love your style!
I like it, but I like the Addams family vibes in general.
personally i don't like it/it's but if those are someone's pronouns I have to respect that
The pronoun “it” is used to mean less than human but to me it feels like I’m *more* than human. I am beyond your understanding of what a being can be like an angel or a demon or a ghost. Or insert any other non human entity here. I am beyond your regular pronouns so you must resort to “it”. Makes me feel like a mysterious gremlin in the woods that tricks people into making unfair deals. 

I’m definitely voidpunk
I'm personally of the opinion that it/its pronouns are powerful as hell and the people who use them are not to be trifled with.
Me personally I like using they/he and it, mainly bc it's just kinda funny and my dad would jokingly call me an it as a kid so it kinda grew on me
Just wanted to say love the Chelsea cut :)
I wanna use it/its more outwardly with friends and shit but I have only had the courage to use the set in certain situations outside of my main friend group :,)
It/its has a really cryptid-y vibe which I just think is fun
It/its are my main pronoun set! I find them very pleasing to use due to the completely genderless implications of them, and it takes that weapon out of the transphobes' arsenal because if they use it, it's just validating to me lol. It feels different to everyone, though :\] Do what makes you most comfortable!
Your fashion sense is too powerful and I wish I could dress like that.
I prefer it/its over they/them but I guess it depends on intent. If it’s a good/positive thing I’m happy to be called it, if it’s a phobic thing then not so much. It is a pleasant disconnect. Also you and the other person look really cool😊
I prefer it/its over she or he. They/them is still preferred but I wouldn't be mad if someone said it/its in a non-insulting way.
Salty and funky, like sauerkraut. Small and full of violence, like [a goblin](https://preview.redd.it/cdnb3yjkg5u71.jpg?width=640&crop=smart&auto=webp&s=6bd8af8ad35493b53829ff7baa331e4d146cec9a). I don't think I'd want it/its for myself, but I can absolutely see the appeal.
If you want to use it, then do so, pronouns don't have rule's
the idea of a stranger calling someone “it” without actually knowing that person’s actual pronouns is wild to me? even if you didn’t mind it, that seems a bit ducked up?
Live your truth. I’m uncomfortable with the idea of using those for me, but I’m not the one using them, you are! Try them out with close friends and see how they make you feel.
First of all you look amazing. Secondly I'm considering going by he/they/it as well, so if you like how it makes you feel... Go for it!
I like it/its pronouns. I don’t personally use them myself. As with any pronouns I don’t use them unless I know the person is okay with them first (except they/them, which I use for people I am not sure of).

Also *VERY* inspired by your look!
U LOOK SO FUCIING COOL OMHG
i use it/its! but i know some people are uncomfy with that, because its been used against them (esp BIPOC) so i also use they/them =)
It's fine, just don't let people use it in a derogatory way and all should be good
Hell yeah it gang
I do think you could definitely pull off the it/it’s pronouns, but I think you could pull off just about any pronouns. You do whatever you think suits you best.
I wouldn't personally feel comfortable using them in myself but I'll call other people it/its if thats their preferred pronouns👌
I like it/it's pronouns, make me feel otherworldly, mysterious and it's usually used to describe eldrich creatures, cryptics, monsters and etc. Whitch is a huge bonus for me. 
I technicaly go by he/they/it but didn't have opportunity to use it/it's
In my native language we don't have gendered pronouns at all and most of the time we call everyone it and that anyways. However it does feel kind of weird in English, I prefer they/them, but I don't really mind that much after all.
They make me incredibly uncomfortable and they're hard to use, but if that's someone's pronouns I'll try to refer to it with them. Personally as a queer poc who's had it used against me it's incredibly dehumanizing and disrespectful, but it's not up to me what someone else uses.
You do you.

I wouldn't adopt them for myself, but if that's what makes you feel good then by all means.
They/he/it pronouns are SO much fun. Highly recommend if you feel comfortable reclaiming them
It/its punks are hot as hell, go for it!
I go by he/they I’ve never been called an it yet but I don’t think I’d mind IT (I added they recently because I realized I don’t believe in the concept of gender)
I think you have a beautiful ❤️ face
You can go by whichever pronouns you want, even if it's it/its!

Also, you look super cute! I love that monster punk/goth style of yours!
valid! Personally they make me feel super invalidated/dysphoric when used about me, but if other people like them, that's really cool!
I use he/it pronouns! I was called an it as a kid so it's partially reclamation but they also give me genuine euphoria, I never liked they or neo/xeno pronouns for myself either so theyre my go to for gender neutral pronouns
I like it/its a lot, personally! I mostly use they/them and he/him because they’re seen as more “acceptable” by more people but internally I often think of myself as less of a who, more of a what, and refer to myself with it/its along with my other pronouns.
Unrelated but judging from your earings you have really good music taste👍
I love using it/its pronouns! I think it suits you
I like it because like yes I am a genderless blob awkwardly piloting a meat suit thank u for noticing
My opinion on it pronouns is that it is dehumanizing but I know some people have reclaimed it and I think that if it makes them happy that's good.
I support the reclamation of them (and actually considered them for myself). My only issue is when they are used to dehumanize as part of a wider bigoted effort. But that's a whole nother conversation somewhat related but very different. 

I enjoy them also from an anarchist perspective as a disconnection from not only gender binaries but capitalist hierarchic society.
Tbh I don't mind it/it's, I've used neo pronouns in the past before just not caring what pronouns people use for me (although I still prefer they/them pronouns)

Edit:also you look cool 👍
 I don't hear it often I'm more used with they/them but I like the idea. It/its gives me the impression you look more like an idea which makes you cool =D
Btw you're so gorgeous <3
I've known plenty of people with those pronouns.  If you like it, go for it.  Though, expect a lot of people to have issues with the syntax and with the dehumanizing aspects of that pronoun.  Everyone reacts to it differently, so who knows what those around you will do
Omg the makeup makes your eyes look so big and pretty---. Also I think it depends on the person but as for me personally, I think it's funny when someone tries to annoy me by calling me it instead of he/they because I'm also trans XD
I love your look! And I think those pronouns are epic if ya wanna go by em .w.
I don’t know if I’d ever use them personally but I do find it/its pronouns really intriguing and I’ve been curious about how they would feel. I guess I’ve never thought too hard about it or experimented because they are so socially taboo
Where did you get that choker in the first pic, if you don’t mind me asking? It looks amazing!

It/its pronouns are also super valid!
As a black person, being called it just seems extremely dehumanizing but if that's what someone wants to be called okay
I personally think it's dehumanizing but I understand some ppl prefer it so I won't call someone that unless they tell me to.
I'm goth & genderqueer, and very into transgressive acts as social protest (so long as it's ethical), so there's certainly an appeal to me for ""it"" pronouns. But i don't use it for myself because I'm sure the haters will just feel validated, and that's the last thing I want. I always tell people ""idc, my pronouns are whatever you like, just don't be a dick"" and that's precisely what I'm referring to.

But really I wish I could use ""it"" for myself without that bigoted history in the background.

But as long as you're comfortable and it pisses off the bigots in your life, that's great! You make a fuckin awesome it. *A fuckin awesome it.*
I don't like them myself, but I've always said ""I don't need someone else's permission to be myself"" so if you're comfortable with it then go for it!

Also, holy shit you look so cool 😁
I like it/its pronouns. Mine are currently they/he/it :3
I personally love and use it/it’s pronouns. Throughout the expansion of my identity, I cycled through a lot before I came to those pronouns. They often get a bad rap, but I particularly find them to hold a lot of power (not that any other pronouns don’t hold power for people, but for me it did give me that sense of authentic existence and resilience). Often times I feel as though it’s a reclamation from the cruelty of our oppressors, I find that experiencing euphoria from the words put to us, and being able to deconstruct why and how people use them, gives us the ability to find true resilience while honoring ourselves without the confines of others opinions of us. Sorry if any of my wording is garbage or not articulated well, high key got a super bad concussion at my job and haven’t been able to think straight 😅
i only allow close friends and trusted family members to call me it. usually, i introduce myself as they / them, but if i get closer to someone i might tell them they/he/it/she, with he/it/she being ""sometimes foods""

my specific guidelines for my pronouns are: use he / him if you have to use binary pronouns,  or when im just one of the boys; it / its when im a lil silly, lil goofy, cryptid; she / her when i could be mistaken for a deity
I’ve seen people of color express discomfort over white folks using pronouns. It/it’s pronouns have been used to dehumanize BIPOC people for a very long time. For folks who say they use it/it’s pronouns because they’re trying to separate themselves from their humanity, I’ve seen the point made that it’s weird that some people want to dehumanize themselves for fun, when it’s been used as a tool of oppression and is a source of trauma for a lot of people. Not everyone feels this way but a perspective worth considering
my friend can’t mentally understand they/them because it’s seen as plural. it’s hard for him to get around it so he just calls me it. i don’t mind either tbh.
Well you certainly looked more like a supernatural phenomenom than a person, at least how I feel about it/its pronouns. They say pronouns don't have a look, but for it/its you do kinda have to go outside of what's conventionally accepted outfits.
i still primarily use she/her, but whenever someone uses it/its pronouns for me i feel especially good. it's like a secret pronoun that is mostly only used by my close friends. it feels almost sacred.
Not a fan. Too dehumanizing, and in this... society, I can't help but be vigilant to dogwhistle words.
They/Them with english speaking friends, but ""sie/ihr"" (she/her) in german. The german language sadly does not have an established stand-in for ""they""...
I think it’s pretty dehumanizing, but you do you.
I don't mind ""it""! I haven't really asked anyone to call me it yet. But I liked it when someone called me ""it"" too.
I really don't like them and would be offended if someone called me that but I don't care if other people use it
[deleted]
At first glance it sounds kinda dehumanizing but if you’re happy with it, it would be cool to give it a cool vibe.
I fuck with it
I don’t mind all. Prefer feminine pronouns though.
I don't really like it/it's pronouns most of the time, but gender is not the only thing that's fluid in me lol, so sometimes it/it's pronouns feels like the best thing ever

On a unrelated note, both of you look amazing!!!
I don't mind it/its but not used for me. So long as that set of pronouns is used for someone WITH those pronouns, all good.

I have also heard that in queer circles before they/them was more widespread, it/its was perfectly fine for willing individuals.
I go by he/they but I kinda just use any pronouns that aren't feminine I would rather somebody call me it rather than she or her
Kinda in love with it/its pronouns, mostly for the reason that they actually work in my native language while they/them doesn't..
If the person wants to use em, that's great!! It/it's is like another form of they/them(to me anyway).
Honestly, IMO, they’re one of those things where if you don’t *know* the person you’re calling it you’re an asshole.
I don’t prefer it/its pronouns for myself, but I think they’re a really cool set of pronouns! I might warm up to using them for myself someday.
Thar eye makeup though 😍
completely unrelated, but you and your significant other (?) look cool!
I love your blood choker! 

And I say that if those pronouns feel right, then why not? I’ve heard some people prefer it/its pronouns because people will often use it to refer to animals.
Love em ❤️ ur so beautiful
it and they/them just seem to capture the internal confusion that i constantly feel
If you’re comfortable with it that’s fine but know the difference when someone’s insulting you or calling properly. If you don’t care makes it all better
oh my god your VIBES i’m deceased
Well don't tell the cishets but I'd actually prefer it/its to they/them, I just don't like the implication that I am an object. Also, you look fucking great, well done! 👏👏
Cool choker! 😃👍  Never seen one like that, but it works!

The whole look has a ""freshly risen from the grave"" vibe, but in a good way. 👍 (man, that's a weird compliment 🤔)
this provokes my fucking envy so bad 😭😭😭😭
You both look super cool and like you can fight 😂 can you? Also it ftw if it works for you!
i really like the pronoun it, no one ever uses it for me but I don’t really feel like gender is apart of me just something i possess and so like i don’t really mind being seen as not human. idk man but if i suddenly became an alien or something i genuinely wouldn’t care. It’s just comfortable but so it he/they.
I don't mind going by ""it"", traditionally that was the singular non binary pronoun. As long as it's not used to cause harm and IF the person wants to be called it that's ok w me! But I don't speak for every trans person
If you like it than use it!
I like using ""it/it's"" a lot
I use it as a pronoun, though not many people I know use them for me. Honestly for me it's for empowerment purposes, but also... it as a pronoun just fits for me.

Also you and your partner look so fucking cool! 🤩
i use it/its and its delightful! good for when you want a neutral pronouns besides they thats commonly known and/or if you just feel like a little creature sometimes (like me)
I use them !! Off topic WHERE is the funky blood choker from? Did you make that??
If someone wants to be called it then I'll try my best to respect that. Personally, it's not the pronoun for me. But if you like being called it then that's totally cool. Ain't nothing wrong with it.
Okay but like I have so much gender envy, I love your style :))
I don’t have have problem with it :), also great look 🔪🩸
Imo, using it pronouns is a power move
if you like them id say go for it.

i go by it/its and they/them, most people will only use they as it is often seen as dehumanizing, but as someone who wishes to be a nonhuman entity i have no problem with it/its and actually prefer them over they/them. i am also agender and feel that they give off the right vibe for referring to someone with no gender by.
Your eyes. And your jawline. MUCH GENDER. AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
I am a They/it, so I love em
I've never minded them, I just don't say so because I'm afraid of judgement lmao
Those are two of the coolest haircuts I've ever seen
tbh anything would be better than my agab
Sure👍🏻
i prefer ""it"" compared to he/she. also shouts out the used, i used to fucking love them, haven't listened to em in a while i think im gonna go do that.
I’m sorry i just have to say that you look so fucking awesome 🤘🏻
Use what you feel comfortable with. I present male but am actually genderless so basically everyone I know uses he/him. It/its pronouns would feel wonderful if used respectfully at the wish of the person using those pronouns.
I use it/it! If you wanna use it, use it!
I'd view it as dehumanizing for myself, but you do you. You're the only one who knows how you feel.
I use it/it’s!! Makes me feel completely void of gender and all it’s implications
""It"" would make me very very sad if used for me due to middle school bullying and subsequent trauma, but I absolutely love my it/its friends and I think if those r your pronouns too that's rad! (ofc I use my friend's pronouns!)
Looking cool : ) That's a neat necklace. 

As far as it pronouns I think it's a very personal thing and should only be used if people like it but I can absolutely see the appeal. Some voidpunk people definitely appreciate them.
Personally, if someone were to call me it, I find it kind of dehumanizing. But some people don’t think it’s dehumanizing for them so if they like it then that’s okay :D
I've called people and animals ""its/it"" since I was able to talk, my mom used to hate it and would correct my usage of ""proper"" Grammer and pronouns. I use he/she/it/they personally, but I know several people who abhore the use of ""it"" as a pronoun. so it really depends on preference. ""it"" comes very naturally to me (pun intended) but I'll always respect those who choose not to use those words for themselves
I am fine with it/its pronouns if they are already established. I feel when strangers (presuming it was a stranger) uses them they mean it as an insult, as if you are less than human, vs compliment. I feel if you go by It/its pronouns at work please let HR know, that way people don't think other coworkers are insulting you, lol
Off topic but you are absolutely stunning/handsome/attractive
Cute!
I think of it/its like a cat. If it fits, it sits
i think it/its pronouns are so cool and rad
I have a history of SA, and I always referred to the person who assaulted me as ""it"" because I didn't consider them a person. 

Now, having come across people who use it/its pronouns, I not longer use ""it"" to describe my assailant. I never want to disrespect a person's identity.

I personally don't identify with it/its at all and don't necessarily understand why someone might, but I also know that I don't have to understand something in order to accept and respect it. Plenty of people don't understand me using they/she/he, they don't get how I can be fine with all of them, but that's how I feel. 

So, if you identify with it/its pronouns, use them! Plenty of people will fully support you. Use whatever pronouns you feel most comfy with! I love and support you no matter what ❤️
huge fan of it/it’s on me
YOU LOOK SO COOL
I use it/its pronouns but I'm scared to use them with people I'm not comfortable with since I don't know when people are genuinely being mean :[
I'm actually fine with ""it"".  That word is certainly more accurate than either ""he"" or ""she"", as I seem to be a weirdly balanced blend of both.  We need better words.  Until we have them this will suffice.
I enjoy being an it sometimes :)
you look so so cool. you give me gender inspiration cause i wanna look like you lol
I personally love ""it""! I think it creates a great opportunity to reclaim an attempt to hurt and insult you, so you can just come back at them like ""Thanks for using my preferred pronoun!""
theyre so cool and i wish people would call me those too (i use it/he/they). at the same time its a super consent-based thing, definitely not something to call someone who hasn’t asked. i love it though. also your style.. yall look awesome!!
""Are you a man are a woman?"" Bitch I'm a HARBINGER OF THE FALL OF MANKIND
It/its pronouns are cool! Then again, I might be biased as I'm a he/it myself \^_^
Unrelated but you two look like you came straight up from the 80’s and i love it
I prefer they them simply becuase it lacks gender. If it/its fits better than they/he then you found something better than I have. Also what's great is you can use your pronouns to fit your mood. I want to meet more people that use it/its, especially those that have a real connection.
I will say you give off it/its pronouns in your picture. I think I give off they/them more, simply becuase I feel like the non binary person your grandma might like 😅
i love being called it by other nonbinary and/or trans ppl not so big on them being used by cis people

unrelated but the used and the three cheers shirts... nice lol
I've always referred to babies (less than 6 months) as it. My family and close friends know this. Outsiders get furious with me. I just laughed. They've zero personality (or are yet to be born even) and it suits them. It suits me as well. It also makes more sense in my head than they/them. But I go with the flow. Whatever the majority decides is fine.
For me it's xier/dey. I am german and always using Englisch Pronunce while speaking german makes me cringe somehow. They don't really work in my language 😅🤔 but in english I use They/Them. It/its feels kinda like someone is degrading me from being human
I like it and I use they/it as someone agender. Puts me on par with animals and how we aren't separate from them and nature generally. But at the same time living in a society that already dehumanizes us I don't tell everyone that ""it"" is an option. Because although I see it as empowering it might invite (unreasonable) disrespect to me. And I want it to be different but I dont want to be disreapected more by people to make that happen :/
One it/it's pronouns are fine. I just use they/them but am still figuring out my own identity. 
Two where did you get your earnings I need them
For me personally, I hate that with a passion. I’m not going to judge anyone who wants to use it and will respect their right to to call them by what they want.
I have actually been thinking about using it/its pronouns in addition to he/they. At first, I was not too fond of the idea, but it's growing on me to the point where I am starting to want to use them.  
Btw, that choker is the coolest! You and your partner look so cool!
As someone who HEAVILY debated using it/it’s  pronouns, I think it’s fantastic. Do you boo
I want to use It/Its but I'm worried about making people uncomfortable because I know lots of people see it as dehumanizing
I have a friend who uses it/its pronouns, and I'm really happy for it. If you feel most comfortable with those pronouns, go for it!!
I have a friend who uses it/its pronouns, and I'm really happy for it. If you feel most comfortable with those pronouns, go for it!!
I use it/it's pronouns! I love them they fit me most and I wished people would use them more. Everyone around me excluding a select few think it's disrespectful to call me an it even though I've asked.
I go by they/it/he, and have for a while. It/It’s has always felt comfortable for me, and by going by it pronouns, I take power away from nbphobes who call me it to be rude.
I think they're good pronouns for reclaiming, but I don't believe in/support spiritual bullshit as a concept (antitheist) so if someone wants to be called ""it"" bc people use that pronoun for dogs and they think they were a dog in their past life or something crazy I'm just using they/them because that's the default I use for everyone and I'm not respecting that kind of woo.
You're cute. N I like using it pronouns. Cuz why not? Shorter than he-she or whatever.

J
I don't meet a lot of people with it/it's pronouns, but the ones I do tend to have issues because everyone tells it they feel like it/it's sounds derogatory or insulting
I personally hate it, I find it dehumanising, but if that's what someone feels comfortable with I'm all for it
I find it/its completely dehumanising, and it has a long history of use in denying us our rights and humanity. I will flat out refuse to use them if someone ask. 

I will ask if they have alternate pronouns or I’ll just use their name.
It’s degrading but white people love it!
I love it as a pronoun. I go by they/it. I like that it kinda makes me less human
Not a fan of ""it"", too dehumanizing.
""It"", in my experience, is *deeply* dehumanizing and makes me uncomfortable. I dislike hearing people referred to as an ""it."" Not to mention how it's been used against people of color and those who aren't straight to justify inhumane behavior toward them. Especially as someone who isn't white, I absolutely loathe ""it"" and I wish more people would think more about that.
in my opinion in my case it feels a little dehumanising but I understand why people resonate with it so well
This is the abridged version, but even if using it/its makes you comfortable, those pronouns have been used to dehumanize targets of genocide for centuries, so find better ones until we don’t live in a world where marginalized persons are referred to with it in an attempt to dehumanize/lessen them
I like it and I use they/it as someone agender. Puts me on par with animals and how we aren't separate from them and nature generally. But at the same time living in a society that already dehumanizes us I don't tell everyone that ""it"" is an option. Because although I see it as empowering it might invite (unreasonable) disrespect to me. And I want it to be different but I dont want to be disreapected more by people to make that happen
it/it’s are actually my top preference but i don’t want random cishets calling me it so i just tell everyone my pronouns are he/they and it/it’s is reserved for friends
I try to use anything else before it/its because I feel it makes the person seem less of a person and more of a thing but if that’s the pronouns someone chooses that’s their pronouns
genuine question, and forgive me if i’m just dumb, but I don’t understand how it/it’s can be a pronoun? like in my head that’s solely used for referring to objects, not people. wouldn’t they/them be a gender neutral option if that’s your goal,
Hate it/its pronouns because it's been used as an insult and is extremely triggering for me. I'm not an object.
people shouldn’t use them imo….it’s not really “reclaiming” what is basically a slur if cis people are just going to call random people they think are trans “it” as an insult because they can say they saw an actual trans person say it/its are their pronouns
Can we chat in private
Don't especially like it...but maybe better than ""THEY!!!""
""It"" isnt transphobic, but a compromise.. there you go.
You do you but I ain't a fucking thing, I'm a human
I am not sure but not a fan. I am rather proud of who I am.
I’d like a taste of you !!
I'm fine with them. Whatever pronoun someone wants, they get. I usually say I'm she/they but I'm more of a she/they/it. Well, anything but he/him.

As someone with lifelong medical issues, as well as being non-het, non-cis, and non-allo, I've experienced a lot of dehumanisation. Communities that are dehumanised often have members who lean into it as a way of taking back control. That's why so many queer, bame/poc, disabled etc people identify with what is currently being called Voidpunk. When I was a teen, it was called Monstur.

There are only so many times someone tries to insult you by saying 'you're X' before you start saying 'yes, I am X, so what?' For a lot of us, using it/its is part of reclaiming our own identities.
I think it can be insulting but if YOU prefer it that's cool
For me, they're about 6/10. Not bad, but not mine. But if they work for you, go for it😋
Personally, I don't get why people wanna use these pronounce, cause it feels like degrading someone into an object or a creature, rather than referring to an actual person.
I mean, if that is what feels right for you, go for it.
But using those pronounce in a conversation would simply make me shudder, cause I don't want to sound rude.
I’m non binary trans masc. been on low dose hormones since 2018 and got top surgery in 2019. 

So I’m finally at that place where I’m comfortable with my body as it is and have started to actually like the slightly more feminine clothes I used to feel too awkward in. 

A lot of this happened during the pandemic. I’d get every gender maybe 50/50 and now I’ll typically get “he’d” on first glance. I really don’t care anymore even though I 100% feel like “they” suits me best. 

Maybe it’s because I’m super jaded and also a realist but basically every time I go out somewhere I expect to be misgendered. Or maybe just “gendered” is a better way to put it. 

I know people will only unlearn if they actually want to and those people are usually the most embarrassed when I hand them my id or do something that makes them think they misgendered me. 

That used to be one of my biggest sources of anxiety, that embarrassing moment followed by apologies and me automatically responding with a “no worries all good.”

But after a few years of wishing I was binary because it would be easier interacting with others, I just realized. That’s not me. And I don’t care if that cashier I’ll never see again misgenders me. I do care if it’s someone that actually knows me, because it exposes their indifference. I used to be the one getting embarrassed for them and me, now I actually like getting “misgendered”, as in when someone calls me sir, sees my id, and then profusely apologizes and you can tell they feel like shit (usually). Even if they don’t reflect on that moment, it challenges their views in one way or another. 

Now that I think of it, it was always my goal to basically be confusing. I wanted no pronouns, “they or whatever, I know it’s hard, I had to learn too.” Making their excuse for them right off the bat. Also noticed that being so “chill” about pronouns enabled people to be more “chill (didn’t care)” about binary peoples pronouns. 

So I’ll say they/them and answer to whatever at the moment. Reason being, I now feel good in my body. That’s what matters. The pronouns someone else uses is a reflection of their perception. I know my identity and that’s what matters. I’ve always been an extremely quiet kid and didn’t have many friends growing up. I think this helped me in the sense I never relied on social validation. 

Which, yes, it IS very important. And that moment you realize you may never be perceived as you feel. There is a certain period of mourning in that. But on the other side, it’s a lot easier to not have that cringe reaction. I now expect anything. 

I honestly see words like girl, boy, man, woman… as adjectives. When I was first figuring my identity I had doubts because I didn’t feel like a “WOMAN” but not a “MAN” either. We all have different connotations to different language (not saying people can say whatever they want). It was always hard for me to put in words. But now if I get misgendered by a stranger, ok? They guessed wrong about what I have in my pants (how I’m thinking they see it) and why does that matter. 

If it’s someone close to me, if they haven’t gotten it by now, they won’t. And to expect someone like that to change is just setting yourself up for disappointment. Not saying this is now it should be, but it just feels like a sort of weight off my shoulders. I just had to accept, they don’t see me how I see me. And they can’t. It’s not ok, it hurts some people don’t care enough to try but they’ve had years. I don’t need to waste more energy. 

But back to the language thing. With seeing man, woman, girl, boy, it, as adjectives. For me, the longer it’s been on hrt etc, the less fixated on gender I am. Now that that’s sorted, what other adjectives am I? If someone asks you to describe your best friend, you say they’re nice, funny, etc right? Do you mention gender? Idk. All rhetorical. 

Not saying everyone has to feel this way, and that I am also so privileged to feel comfortable in my body. So it’s much easier in my situation than that of others. 

I’m the end, I’m just tired of dealing with pronouns in general.
I call everyone bud or dude, regardless of gender. He’s a dude, she’s a dude, we’re all dude’s.
If people like using it pronouns fine by me I will use them but they shouldn't be a blanket pronoun like they them due to its history of being dehumanizing
I actually only understood that it/its pronouns aren't dehumanising, when I met someone who had them in their set of pronouns, irl. Though I still don't know anyone who goes by it/its specifically (they mainly go by they/them), I am now able to use them without feeling weird. Before that, I would totally use it/its if someone asked me for it, but I'd feel really strange for it, and even now, it'd probably take a lot of mistakes before I'd get used to it and could use it without actively thinking about what pronoun to use.
I find it to be demeaning and insulting but if you like go ahead
The pronoun it was used to bully me as a kid. Sometimes I use it now by choice. It's complicated.
To me, it gives me ""A Child Called 'It'"" vibes to have one's pronoun(s) include ""it"". To be fair, one of my preferred pronouns is ""asshole"". He/they/asshole.
Well, you are a snac, so that makes ""it"" accurate...
As a non-binary person I feel like it/it's is the most disrespectful way a human being can refer to another human being.

In my mind, the word 'it' is reserved for inanimate objects.
Personally, I would feel weird calling someone ""it"" because that person is a human being not a thing. But if that person wants to be addressed as such then I would do it out of respect but that's just me
In general? There just pronouns like any other pronouns, using them is totally valid.

For me? Personally (of course that isn't the universal thruth, just my feelings) it makes me feel less human, like I'm objectefied.

I think it might be bc in my country it's a very typical insult to call Trans folks ""Es"" (it), in order to deny them their humanity. I don't think I could overcome this for myself.

Calling someone else it, if they want me to do so, isn't a problem at all tho.
I honestly don't understand them. Like I'd like someone to teach me about them. I've always associated 'it/its' with objects/animals. I'd still respect someone's pronouns if it told me it used 'it/its' pronouns.
Before I was out, I heard my dad refer to transgender people as ""its"" a few times and found it EXTREMELY disrespectful and transphobic. Now that it's something I would be deciding for myself, I love the idea of how horrified he would be at me *enjoying* using it :)
>If it/its pronouns feel like they fit, use them

Interesting wording here!! ""Use them"" haha
That's so cool! That's always so nice to hear <3
Omg teach me your ways 😈
Oh ya, had a friend say they go after gender non conforming people. Heavily implying that was one of their interests in me. And I was so pleased. Put me at ease that the thing I want the most dose come across. It's just rare for binary people to comment on it in an enjoyable way.
Yessss I love feeling like a couple of nonbinary little gremlins with my partner 💕
Have you read Donna Haraway's work? Your username tells me you would love her writing. Kind of similar to xenofeminism.
Aww thank you, my partner Jade (she/they) is hella cool 😎 💖
Thank you, I want to start a grunge band so bad 💀
Thank you! I'm rather fond of them :)
I'd definitely suggest spending some time in it/its spaces and interacting with people who use those pronouns. It becomes easier to use them the more you practice, and it's always good to have the practice in case you meet someone who does use them :)
Oh to be a blob of space plasma 💙
Ugh yeah, I'd prefer just about anything to she/her
I enjoy the disconnection for sure, I would love to just be a genderless creature of the forest 🐹
Thank you! We both made our pants and cut our own hair n shit :)
Power moves
Yeah, definitely only w/ people you trust
For sure, there's a HUGE difference. The person at the concert was probably trying to be rude as well, but I just found it oddly validating!
Hell yeah the khajiit are so cool! And cis ppl will find a way to make everything about themselves, it's an art form really
YESSSS I wish it would be remotely acceptable to use ""this one/that one"" as a preferred pronoun. As it is I don't have a preference (because it's secretly Khajiit)
It's my absolute favorite, I will be devastated when it inevitably breaks
The ultimate ""joke's on you I'm into that shit"" 😂
For sure, that's what matters most.
a few labels that came to my mind are [agender](https://www.lgbtqia.wiki/wiki/Agender), [demigirl](https://www.lgbtqia.wiki/wiki/Demigirl), [paragirl](https://www.lgbtqia.wiki/wiki/Paragirl),  [girlflux](https://www.lgbtqia.wiki/wiki/Girlflux) or [demiagender](https://www.lgbtqia.wiki/wiki/Demiagender)? tho those are just my thoughts and you decide what labels (if any) you use! also pronouns dont equal gender, you can use whatever pronouns with whatever gender identity! also you absolutely dont need dysphoria to be trans!! 

hope i could maybe help a little :3
You may want to see if you relate to Gendervoid people, who don't feel gender at all and just identify as a person! And remember you can use any pronouns you're comfortable with, no matter how you identify. If you don't mind she/her, you can absolutely keep them and still be gendervoid, agender, or even just questioning :)
I actually feel similar to what you express. In my case, I wish noone would ever need to use pronouns to refer to me. I dont think I am agender tho, but i spent a long season the last years not even ""noticing"" my gender. I think you can just ask people to use your name or similar and skip your pronouns. I'm not out there so I just let people use whatever they think fits idk.
Yesss ""it"" gives the feeling of being an individual above gender and humanity, and opens up a world of possibilities of what it could mean! Am I a ghost? A cryptid? An ancient diety? You'll never know and neither do I haha!
DIY yourself into how you wanted to look when you were a kid 😂
I feel like every day I learn another fact that makes Sweden the COOLEST PLACE EVER. I've been super tempted to start learning Finnish in order to maybe move there someday when my partner and I get married!
Definitely, it's all about respect and choice 💜
Right? It's like hey at least you didn't assume a gender! Chaos for the win
Ty, I was trying to work out what made me feel so uncomfortable about it/its pronouns and this is it exactly
How do you feel about a non-american person asking for it as a pronoun? In my native language everyone calls everyone else either by a gender neutral pronoun, or in more casual speech, it. I personally use they/them in english, but I can totally see why some people from my country would prefer it/its, since it's so natural over here.
You have finally put to words why it/its makes me deeply uncomfortable. I'm Caucasian but I'm also Jewish, and I learned about the violence against my people at a young age and how dehumanizing language was the first step towards that violence. I feel so conflicted when I meet folks that use it/its because I absolutely want to respect everyone's pronouns (even if I don't understand them), but at the same time I am uncomfortable using dehumanizing language for a person because of the power of that language. The queer community faces so much as is, I don't want to give another weapon to our oppressors, I don't want them to have another excuse to view me as less than human
Understandable, but I'm also all for respecting people's pronouns and doing my best to use them regardless of my feelings about them, because at the end of the day that's what they've chosen for themselves. However, I do think a lot of people who use ""it"" are probably extremely lucky and privileged to not have experienced the degradation and dehumanization that turns other people off of the term, and I understand why some really hate it.
Yeah same here it’s gross to me. Abusers also say “it” to dehumanize their victims, and as a survivor and a brown trans masc person…no mawma. if someone asked me to refer to them as “it” I would probably avoid them for the rest of my life, not because I’m judging them but because I got my own shit I can’t separate from this pronoun preference.
It honestly just feels like white entitlement and white privilege to use ""it"" pronouns and not see an issue and to even feel empowered and subversive for it. 
Use it pronouns if you must, but also give people, especially poc the option to just use your name because wow is that offensive.
Sometimes I just feel like an experience 👁👄👁
Thank you!
My partner exclusively uses he/him pronouns, but he told me tonight that if he ever had to pick new ones he would choose it/its because that would make him feel like Pennywise.  I can't remember the last time I laughed so hard... horror folks are just a different breed.  But I mean, apart from the whole eating and terrorizing children thing, being a shapeshifting space spider *is* kinda gender goals.
Absolutely!! It makes me feel like an entity 💫👁🎭
Haha trifle. Trifle trifle trifle I love words
Aww that sounds wholesome af and hey we might have matching pronouns now! XD
Thanks! It's more of a ratty mullet with a Chelsea front, I'm not quite brave enough to shave the top completely 😅
Yeah that's gonna be me, and I'm already so bad about correcting ppl 😳
Same!
Couldn't have said it better myself :)
Go thrifting! Steal from Goodwill, they're corrupt! Rip up your shirts and add safety pins! Paint and sew patches onto your pants! Say fuck it and give yourself a funky haircut! You are a customizable character, go apeshit!! 💕
It's nice to feel like a cute frog or a soft bee or an UNFATHOMABLE ELDRITCH GOD. And thank you! ☺
I read this comment like 50 times and died laughing 😂 also yessss tumblr gold
For context, it was a group of girls at a concert who were a bit drunk and quite rude, but they genuine look of confusion when one of them referred to me as ""it"" made me feel like I was passing as gender-neutral. Whether or not they meant for it to be insulting, I found it very validating! However, if they had said the same thing to my partner (she/they) and she was offended by it, I would've felt very uncomfortable and would've corrected them immediately. It's all about context and the situation and how much it affects the individual. I just happened to enjoy it 🤷🏻
THANK U
Absolutely 100% vibe with this 💖
Is it really that hard to use? You talk about things and use the it pronoun every day.  You even used it as a pronoun in this comment. If we can look at a tree, a living breathing reproducing life form and be fine calling that tree an it, we should be capable of using it/it’s for a human too. I always tell people I’m it/it’s in the same sense as we say “it’s a boy!” Or “it’s a girl!” When babies are born. That baby is an it until we look at it and force upon it a gendered ideal.

Edit: This comment isn’t at all to take away from your experience, just to hopefully help make the concept a little easier to understand
Aww thank you! My style is very eclectic but always punk at heart 🖤
Wow yeah i feel exactly the same!
Haha thanks! We just saw The Used and Rise Against and we're seeing MCR this fall!!
Haha yesssssss
For sure. I see a big difference in using them for people when they prefer it and using them to be transphobic, and while some feel the line is too blurred, I feel like the more people use them, the more power is taken out of it as an insult. Also gender isn't real and society is madness and I am just a funky little soul in a meatsack :D
Thank you!
Yess I like this. I want to be perceived as something that *looks* human, but is much more complex and abstract 🎭
Aww thanks <3
Haha thanks! And it definitely depends on the person, there are a few ppl I'd probably deck for saying it, and some people i would literally hug so hard
I try not to support fast fashion, but Romwe has some very inexpensive accessories, including this which I got for only a couple of dollars! I also have some rings and a couple of chokers from there that are very cool that I will wear until they fall apart <3
When it's a person i trust using the term, i find the separation from feeling human kind of nice and endearing, as in feeling like a cute animal or bug. I absolutely agree that it's extremely disrespectful and inexcusable for people to use it in a derogatory sense.
Thank you! And yeah, I get you. Also I like your username! :)
Most of the “haters” are BIPOC people expressing discomfort that something that’s been used historically to oppress and dehumanize them is now a cute fun pronoun for white people to use. People aren’t saying “they feel dehumanizing” because they’re gatekeeping, they’re saying it because it/it’s has a lot of trauma behind them. People can use them if the want, it’s their pronouns, but don’t try and dismiss the legitimate concerns people have as being “haters”
A good way to look at it! And thank you!
It's articulated very well! And I agree wholeheartedly, especially about feeling that sense of authentic existence 😊
Iconic
Eyyyyyy 👈👈
Thank you! And fluid people are so cool!
Yeah lowkey same, it's like anything is fine as long as it's not feminine.
That's a good point, a lot of languages are very binary and finding validating pronouns can be hard. I'm glad you like it/its!
Oh for sure, I would never use them for someone who didn't explicitly say it was okay, and I would consider it very rude. But if someone enjoys a set of pronouns I am happy to try my very best!
Thank you! We're just 2 punks in luv 🥰
Thank you! And I agree, I feel more like an animal or creature than a human, and it/its encompasses that feeling perfectly
Hi deceased, I'm dad.
The cishets don't have clearance to use those pronouns lmao, and thank you! 😋
Thank you! My Chemical Romance really said ""I'm not dead I only dress that way"" and this little gremlin took it to heart
I can mosh! Does that count?? 😂
Thank you! And I'm happy you resonate so well with it!
all i want is to be a little creature at a little creature tea party in the woods 🌿
It's from Romwe! I've seen tutorials though on how to make similar ones :)
Tysm!! :))))
Being a nonhuman entity sounds so nice, like i just wanna *exist* as a being
Haha thank you, I'm the house barber 😈
Thank you! 🤘🏻
Haha my coworkers are way too borderline transphobic to get clearance to those pronouns, I would just be using them with trusted friends:)
Aww thanks ☺
Hahaha i love that
THANK YOU 💙
It's totally okay to only let certain people use them! Like people you love and trust to have your best interests in mind.
Haha thank you! Now don't tell anyone else we're time travelers or I'll make it look like a bloody accident 🥸
I'd probably be going by they/he/it, catch me over here collecting pronouns like they're pokemon 🤪
Also my grandma would hate crime both of us but there are a lot of nice grandmas out there who I'm sure would like you! 😂
Thanks! We were on our way to see The Used ♥️
Oh my God hahahaha i do the exact same thing, also doesn't help that i don't really like babies 😅 i don't know how to tell them i see their baby the same way i see animals or plants without being rude

Xier/dey has a very cool sound!! Very gender euphoric
Understandable. I like the reconnection with animals and nature and the idea of being more at one with the universe. I think all gender neutral pronouns have that wonderful vibe.
I surprisingly found these on Romwe! I altered them a little because the original ear pieces were mismatched and ugly but it was a 30 second fix!
Thank you! And go for it! Ask a friend to try em out!
I think you should worry about making yourself comfortable unless you're hurting anyone. Pronouns don't hurt anyone.
your pfp 😂😭😂😭😂
Haha I haven't heard that one yet but it's very amusing. I'll try to respect any pronouns but yeah if you tell me it's cause you were a dog I miiiight look at you like this 👀 like do you also wanna play fetch? 😂
Just bc you find it dehumanizing doesn’t mean other ppl do, you shouldn’t dismiss their chosen pronouns, regardless of what they are.
i'm saddened that people are ignoring your trauma here. i fully understand where you're coming from and while i don't have a traumatic history with the pronouns, they do rub me wrong. i'd still be able to respect a person who prefers it/its pronouns, but i think that it's also important to respect the person you're making demands of with regard to your own pronouns. as such it's reasonable to be ready and willing to accommodate someone in your shoes. 

i'm thrilled for folks who identify with it/its, but i can't stand by while i see people say 'relive your trauma to accommodate me'. we need to have real compassion for people, and i'm not seeing it in the thread below. 

granted, coming from a person who feels more gender fluid and wants to bounce around and in and out of the binary, this is probably much easier for me to say than some folks.
You know trans people belong in the marginalized groups and have the right to choose for themselves, right?
Yeah, it's definitely a pronoun I'd only tell other queer people they could use for me, just to be comfortable.
It/its is also a gender neutral term used for animals, alien/otherwordly beings, cryptids, entities, stuff like that. I also use they/them but it/its makes me feel that i am more than just a human, which i like and find very validating.
It/its is a pronoun, same as there/here or me/I or you are pronouns. So by its definition it is a pronoun.
Trans people shouldn't have to change themselves because of cis people.
This post ain't about you, tho. Nobody respectful is gonna refer to you as it if you don't want to be referred to as such.
Just keep in mind some people, especially transfeminine people, may be uncomfortable with being called dude. I consider it a gender neutral term but always be mindful and respectful :)
No pronoun would ideally be automatic, I personally only use he/him and it/it’s and actually don’t like it with people just default to they them for me.
That's my worry, it's that it/its could be seen as disrespectful. But the other hand, choosing it yourself could be empowering
Hehe yes, i’m very much into both Haraway and Hester!!
couple goals right there!!
Yeah, I get that, I like it too! Probably because I'm agender
Got to wear a chocker like that one time when I volenteered for a practice fashion shoot at media-school. I have never looked that cool since and aspire to one day reach that level of style again. You and your partner absolutely rule! Have a badass, awesome day.
thank you so much!! this type of acceptance is new to me cause i haven’t really talked about this with anyone
As a gendervoid person (alongside Maverique because I kind of bounce between the two) I love the representation!
💕💖💕💕💖💕💕💖!!! Exactly!!!!!💖💕💖💖💕
I get it, cuz there’s places like Finland where’ it’ is okay to use on a person

But in a white American context….idk there’s a certain type of privileged person who wants to use their pronouns to make other people (in their minds, cishets) uncomfortable. Oftentimes, though, it ends up making poc, trans, disabled, and other frequently historically dehumanized  minorities uncomfortable in the process.
Yeah, I guess it kind of depends? If they were in America, I would probably have a conversation with this person and tell them how a lot of BIPOC people here are really uncomfortable with those pronouns, and explain why. And I would ask them, out of respect for the people who live in this country that they're visiting, would it be OK if I use ""they/them"" instead of ""it/its?"" If they said no, I'm not sure what I would do, probably just keep talking to them about it.

If I was in your country, I'd probably explain the same thing, except add something like, ""Because I'm visiting you, I will *try* to use 'it/its', but I will probably slip up a lot and use 'they/them' because, where I'm from, 'it/its' carries *a lot* of trauma and baggage. And I ask that you allow me some grace, and know I'm not coming from a place of malice, I'm coming from...like, hundreds of years of systemic racism, lol."" 

I mean, at the end of the day, we never use words without context, right? ""It,"" as a pronoun, by itself, isn't good or bad. It depends on how it's used. In your country, everyone calls everyone ""it"" and it sounds like that's been the norm for quite some time, so it's not a big deal. In America, ""it"" was used by those in power to dehumanize and subjugate entire groups of people, so it *is* a big deal.
Hahaha, I agree!
Trifle is a good one.  Also, archipelago, hullabaloo, and foible.
Lolzz that'd be coolll
It is, it’s like a ratty 60’s Chelsea before the skin cut. Very nice however you arrived there, your friends hair too.

That's a Rip, but I managed to come out to my friends about it yesterday. If I can do it, you can :)
Why is ""You are a customizable character, go apeshit!!"" Such an inspirational line
ah that makes sense!
Yes, if your cultural and ancestral history involves subjugation and genocide predicated on oppressors seeing your ancestors as an unhuman ""it"", less deserving of empathy than a tree or other ""things"", then yes, it is really that hard. When property is considered to be of a higher value than certain groups of people, ""it"" as a pronoun doesn't seem quite as neutral as you're making it seem.
I actually tend to refer to babies as they, and a tree isn't a person. Yes, it is hard to me, because when I refer to an object or a concept or a plant as it it's because whatever the thing is is not a thinking agent. It may not have been meant to be rude or taking away from my experience but it feels very rude to me and doing exactly that for you to make assumptions and ask patronizing questions about how I ""really"" feel about something to ""help me understand' when I tell you that I do understand and how it makes me feel. I used it as a pronoun in the comment because the scenario *was referring to someone with it/its pronouns.* I had to consciously stop myself from referring to it as them, because I want to respect people's pronouns no matter how they make me feel. That doesn't make it any less hard to get over emotionally because of how it's been used against me or mentally because that's not how language typically works in my head.
I agree that's why I wanted to be clear I am in favour of reclamation of the term. 

I was watching the Good Place and I love the way Michael refers to humans, asking if he could kill them, saying that humans are goop and juice, all you gotta do is remove the juice and they're dead. Reminded of that from your meatsack comment. In the end barring any metaphysical alternative, we only get one shot at this thing called life, so we should all just live our best lives, respect each others autonomy, and be our true selves norms be damned. Shits to short for anything else.
As a spiritualist enby I support this :3
Exactly!!
I think there is a misunderstanding, so I apologize that I wasn't more clear. What I meant by that was (for example) Redneck Jimmy (the hater) going around calling non-binary & trans people ""it"" to make sure they feel disrespected and dehumanized. I hope that clears it up, but if I'm still wrong I apologize.
I think it’s just sometimes difficult to put these pronouns in place, especially with how some of the Trans community views them (much like a lot of things). Unfortunately the language we reclaim is often used in cruelty to harm us, and thus others see it as succumbing to that cruelty 😔✊🏽 but I hope you’re journey in learning about yourself and living and loving within that journey, proves fruitful and fulfilling 💜 our joy is our resilience, and we change the people around us by living as such
Nope, they sure don't! \*roars at the cishets cowering in their cages\*
🤣🤣🤣
I’ll take it lol. I got accidentally punched in the face during a mosh pit 🥲
you get it :)
Nice! I might try and make my own :0
exactly
gotcha!!!! Yeah than that makes sense! Go for it if you feel it suites you best!
Aaaaaalright 😰
yup those are the official unofficial gender neutral pronouns in my country🤗
Thanks imma go look that up
It's called otherkin, they also use ""kinself/nounself"" pronouns a lot. (Ex. ""fox/foxs/foxself"" because they want to frame their spiritual belief as a gender.) Like, I'm not gonna call people foxes and stars (another popular otherkin focus is ""powerful"" or ""pretty"" inanimate objects) when all people on Earth are humans, that's dumb.
I will always dismiss it pronouns, I didn’t say I’d misgender the person. I said I would blanket refuse to, and ask for either an alternate set(if that person has them), or just use their name. 

Having trauma associated with being called “an it”, means I won’t dehumanise anyone by sinking to use them. Regardless of situation.
That’s why I would always ask if they had alternative pronouns, or in that case I’d use their name, I don’t understand how that’s so “disrespectful”

What I will say is that in an in person interaction I wouldn’t be aggressive or demanding, I’d at least try to be understanding of the person, and make them know of my issues with the pronouns as a rule. I’d also ask that person if my use of their name instead of pronouns facilitates only using my name and not my pronouns, I’d happily agree.
I’m saying this with good intentions, though yes I do know people ultimately have the right to choose on things like this
It asked what people thought about the pronouns.
The question is in the title???????????????
On top of this reminder, don’t force trans people to tell you they’re uncomfortable with dude, please be sure to ask if it’s okay you call someone dude :/
Totally agree when I said they are a blanket pronoun I mean when you don't know the pronouns of the person
Almost like reclaiming a slur but it's not necessarily a slur
it shouldnt be, you absolutely deserve acceptance!! but glad i could help :3
I think I misunderstood what you meant by “hard”, I thought you meant it was difficult in the way that it’s hard because it doesn’t make sense, not it’s hard because it is painful. I apologize for my misunderstanding.
Well said! And I love the Good Place, such a great show with great representation!!
Oh shit! Hope you made a speedy recovery 😳
Hell yeah, go for it!!
I know a bunch of otherkin/therians and this just isn’t true for the most part. They know they are human and most also go by at least one “typical” pronoun set, the other neopronouns are generally optional so that people (who act like you) won’t harass them online like transphobes already do. 

You’re in the NONbinary sub and treating people who don’t act the way you want and use the pronouns you like, just like cis people would. Yikes.
and instead you'll invalidate their identities by refusing to use their pronouns? I don't see how that's very different from intentional misgendering. and even if you disagree with this comparison, it is still incredibly disrespectful.
""So find better ones"" sounded kinda condescending to me, ngl.
Yes, I know that is what you meant. My point is tho that even blanket they/theming can be misgendering.
r/voidpunk?
Yeah he was about a foot taller than me and had crazy reach, so I felt it the next day but it wore off pretty quickly. He was a nice mosher and apologetic. It’s funny because I’m not a mosher and have no desire to do so, but I played myself because I really didn’t think they’d mosh at an AFI show so I had a general admission/pit spot. In my defense I was a baby (13-14)  when this happened and didn’t know better lmao. Now I always buy designated seats not in the pit for rock shows 🤣
The only reason I don't use nounself neos is that a fox isn't a gender. As an antitheist I refuse to respect spiritual titles and stuff similar to that. I don't call Catholic priests ""father"" either, because they aren't my dad. That's just how it is. If they don’t like it they can stop being religious and caring so much about fake stuff.
Said hypothetical person would have a name wouldn’t they? 

I’m sorry but I’m not regurgitating my own trauma onto myself by dehumanising another person. End of fucking story.
Omg AFI mosh pit 😂 at least moshers are usually pretty nice and quick to help you on your feet, esp if you're a kid or small. I've gotten yoinked out of the way when I was younger so i didn't get trampled 😂
As a queer person who has to constantly hear how ""queer is a slur"" and people refusing to engage with my identity, I'm sorry but you don't get to use your trauma as a shield while you disrespect another person's identity. You don't have to use it for yourself, but you do have to use people's correct pronouns. That's non-negotiable.
how would you like it if I just refused to use any pronouns for you? if someone did that to me (even tho I have a name) I would find that incredibly disrespectful and would stop associating with that person.
Yeah I was easily the smallest in the pit and he was one of the tallest if not the tallest 😂🙃 I went with my mom and grandma who knew nothing about the band or moshing and sat in the nearby seats, so nobody was gonna snatch me out of mosh danger and into safety 🤣
I mean queer is a slur though. It's cool that you've embraced it for yourself and feel empowered by it, but to deny it's origins and also it's very current usage as a slur is also wrong.
How would you feel if you’ve been called a fucking it all your life, and genuinely get sick whenever it’s used to refer to people?

Get fucked the fuckin lot ae ye.
Literally every single word for non-cishet people has been used as a slur. When I was growing up, gay was just as much a slur as queer, lesbian was just as much a slur as dyke. According to you, I should go around telling every gay and lesbian person that it's fine if they want to call themselves that, but I will never refer to them as such, because those words are slurs.
Like the other people have said: your trauma isn’t an excuse to prevent people from IDing the way they prefer. 

Considering we’ve been using queer, as in “we’re here, we’re queer,” since at least the 80s… it’s not a slur to everyone and it’s awfully self centered to act like it is.
I feel like you need to try therapy. Get over yourself.
1) That's not accurate.
2) Can you cite where I said literally any of that? You can't just make up stuff I said because you don't have a defense against my actual argument, which is quite simply, that you can't pretend that queer wasn't a widely used actual slur. Acknowledging that queer was a slur and has been largely (BUT NOT TOTALLY) reclaimed is not the same as whatever that last sentence you wrote says. 
Keep up.
I don't know what that has to do with queer being a slur. Your entitlement around an identity isn't an excuse to deny its actual, harmful histories and the effect that has on people today. 
Queer is literally a slur. This is not up for debate. It is just a simple fact. It's a slur that's been reclaimed by huge amounts of people. So have many slurs. It doesn't change the origin or the fact that it is and always was a slur. Your personal relationship to the slur doesn't make you special just because you have the privilege to have never been harmed by it.
I feel like you need to shut the fuck up. 
 
Already been discussed up thread and down thread. Will not ever use those pronouns to refer to a human.
I'm not pretending queer hasn't been used as a slur. I am rejecting the notion that words that were once slurs are off limits forever. YOU said that you won't use someone's pronouns because you consider them a slur. That was how you started this conversation. I am telling you that it makes as much sense as me refusing to say the word ""gay"" because it was once a slur.

If someone's pronouns are it/it's, you use them. Period. The history doesn't matter. Your feelings about the word don't matter. You respect people's identities.  The end.
It just reminds me heavily of the weird group of gay men who say “homosexual, no gay, it’s a slur”, like… huh???

And to assume that I’ve never been subjected to it as a slur is rich, I can reclaim something that’s been used against me just fine. Not everyone who uses “slurs” in their identity has “been privileged” and that’s just weird of you to jump to.
I beg you to please read, if you can, slowly.
I never said anything like that. Go back and reread the comments and this time, pay attention to usernames. My first comment to you was when I said not to pretend that queer isn't a slur, but it's cool and fine if you have embraced it for yourself. This is not a hard conversation to follow, but for some reason you seem incapable of it.

You're so angry, and so incredibly wrong I don't know whether to laugh or cry.

Also, if someone has trauma around ""it"" pronouns, and lots of marginalized groups do, the considerate thing is to just use names. But that's not what we're arguing about currently. Please, again, keep up or tap out.
The ""you"" and ""your"" in my comment wasn't directed at you specifically, it was a general you, like addressing an unknown group or person. Just like the ""you"" and ""your"" in your comment wasn't directed at me, at least I hope it wasn't because I never said I did or didn't have trauma around the word queer and it also wasn't my point so you  would have made up an entire point about me just to have something to argue against.

Also, your entire argument is that it's not a slur to everyone and people are self centered for being negatively affected by it. If it was never a slur and not a slur now, how can you reclaim it and what are you reclaiming exactly since it wasn't and isn't a slur? Or if it's never been used against you as the slur that it was intended to be, how do you have the right to reclaim it? And then speak over people who it has been hurled against in hatred? You can't have it both ways. 
And I still don't know why we're putting slur in quotation marks. This is just basic lgtb history. 

Also, while I wouldn't say homosexual or gay when referring to men is a slur, I also wasn't alive when it was quite literally illegal and life threateningly dangerous to be gay and watched all of my friends and chosen family effectively be murdered by societal and government indifference. I assume the word has fallen out of favor with certain groups just as so many others do and now it feels hurtful. Your argument is that we should be sensitive and open and accepting without question to people who want to be called queer, a literal slur, reclaimed or not,  but not towards people who don't want to be called something that they consider a slur or at least hurtful and should instead call them weird and judge them? Very weird and inconsistent stance."	wg2967	NonBinary	2570	0.99	2022-08-04 14:10:53
Hey, I’m Nobody; I use they/them pronouns 🙂		"ok but the real question is, when are you gonna poke a cyclops in the eye with a hot stick
Nobody uses they/them pronouns

like they actually use them.
*I'm Nobody! Who are you?*

*Are you – Nobody – too?*

*Then there's a pair of us!*

*Don't tell! they'd advertise – you know!*



*How dreary – to be – Somebody!*

*How public – like a Frog –*

*To tell one's name – the livelong June –*

*To an admiring Bog!*

OP: >:)
That is such a cool name!
My parents said you like me.
YOU HAIR IS SO AAAAAAAA✨✨✨
Hey, I think you're Somebody. Congrats on being yourself!
WAIT NOBODY IS YOUR NAME THAT IS SO COOL
That time when a dad joke is technically correct:

-Who are you?

-I'm nobody

-Hello Nobody!

(Edit: spacing)
Oh no I want your hair
its a cool name, but it seems a bit sad... are you okay?
Beautiful.
Like the name Odysseus told the cyclops was his for his escape and plan in the Odyssey? That’s fucking dope my them!

(Would it be rude to say “my guy”?)
oooohh planning on fooling a certain cyclops? I love greek mythology ahha
Your name is cool! It really got me thinking of Nobody Owens, a character in the book by Neil Gaiman.
I guess all those silly people saying nobody uses they/them were right after all
Made me think of My Name Is Nobody, one of my favourite Italo Westerns.
I’m technically not supposed to be in non-binary anymore but are you okay? I get the thing behind the name nobody but If it’s a mental thing please talk to somebody. Anyways, nice name, nice to meet you.
Love the name
Excellent name!

I found a pin that suits

https://thegrumpyunicorn.co/products/the-odyssey
Hi Nobody! Your hair reminds me of League of Legends' Jinx, love it!
Hi nobody, I am Dad!
Well, I guess everyone was right. Nobody is perfect.
The once was a story about everybody, anybody, somebody, and nobody. There was a job to be done and  Everybody was sure that Somebody would do it. Anybody could have done it, but Nobody did it. Somebody got angry about that because it was Everybody's job. Everybody thought Anybody could do it, but Nobody realized that Everybody wouldn't. It ended up that Everybody blamed Somebody when Nobody did what Anybody could have done.

So thanks for standing up and taking responsibility.
LOVE your hair!
(Insert Percy Jackson joke here)
you my friends are the hight of androgyny
Getting hella gender envy rn friend
Hi nobody
-from fellow nobody
I really love your hair colour, it suits you very well!

I find you insanely attractive had to say it . :)
Lovely.
Cant take my eyes off you.. so beautiful.
You name reminds me of a little motivational thing my aunt used to say:

“If you ever feel like nobody loves you, remember that I am Nobody.”

Feel like you can legit say this 🥰
Is your name actually nobody
You look like you stepped out of a comic book. I love it!
How long did it take to get your hair like that? 🥺 it’s stunning

Wow. You look like my friend but older! No you have the exact same face
Cute hair 🥰
You look amazeing, Nice to meetcha Nobody!
I love your hair!
So you are named Nobody? Or are you calling yourself a Nobody? Gosh I hope it is your Name. Since Then you got references to so many things like the Odyssey and even kingdom hearts. And while you are Nobody you are always somebody awesome to us!
But if you're nobody, wouldn't your pronouns just be
nobody is the coolest goddamn name in the entire world. kudos to you, nobody
Nobody can beat Goku!

People named Nobody: 😈
Whoa, you look so good it's no wonder Mitski wrote a song about you!
Ah finally, I found the person who asked all these questions
ooh, you should listen to the song ""My Name is No-One' by the Mechanisms! actually, their whole album 'Ulysses Dies At Dawn' is great, and their main character, Ulysses, doesn't have a canon gender! lots of fun! but anyways, it's nice to meet you, Nobody!
Gonna be awkward when an angry cyclops comes knocking.
hi me too
Hi Nobody I am simping very hard I love your hair and your everything 🥺🥺🥺
Nice try, Odysseus
You remind me of canyon from adventure time!
my first thought was Nobody from Sesame Street; very cool name choice. Love your hair btw!!!
I love your hair :)
Hello Nobody! In addition to the odyssey there is a character named Nobody in the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles comics, most prominently featured in the IDW comics that started in 2011.
we have the same haircut but mines pink!! it looks so good on u lol
Nonbinary Odysseus headcanon accepted! You look super sick!
Wow ya’ll, I was not expecting to be so well received - thank you all for your warm and loving messages! Hope you all have a nice rest of your weekend and that the cool breezes reach you where you are. 🍂

Hey Nobody, your hair is fucking awesome!

I fricking love your hair!
You are the most handsome, most beautiful nobody I have ever seen.
You've got a ton of comments so I'm not expecting you to respond (Reddit can get overwhelming when posts do nicely), but you look awesome, the name is great, and I wish you the absolute best, nobody!
Dang I want like that hair exactly
That hair is gorgeous
Omg yes love the Odyssey reference! I actually lifted the name from My Name is Nobody (1973 international western that I watched as a kid), but I LOVE this reference too 🤩
Ithaca represent!
I thought you knew, They have to gain the cyclops' trust in a sense.
I fully missed the first pun cuz I read the setup as their name and not the other meaning 😂


(For anyone who doesn’t get it: the first pun is a common phrase or sentiment among folks who don’t understand nonbinary people or gender neutral pronouns, and the second pun/the punchline is that it’s actually referring to the OP)
I had never heard of this poem before! I’ll have to delve into Emily Dickinson more - thank you! 😊
Hey, me too!
Thank you! 😍 it’s been a labor of love, with a dash of insanity to give it that pop 😜
Oh, sorry. I may be a little drunk. Proud 9f you whatever your name is <3
I’m alright, thank you for the concern! Covid def did a number on my friend group and caused some self reflection in all aspects of life; but I’ve lived through it and am now ready to face the world!!… digitally at least 😏
And handsome.

I love “my them”! And thank you! I had originally pulled it from My Name is Nobody (intl spaghetti western) but I’m digging the Odyssey reference too.
Ohhhh which book? I dig Neil but have only read Sandman and Coraline (and some pieces of poetry here and there putting books away when I worked at a bookstore 😅)
🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟
You're always welcome here.
Nobody’s fool more like 😉 thank you though! ☺️
Not you touching on all my emotional baggage - I legit needed to hear that today; thank you so much 🥰🥰
Have some fake gold for real 🏅
(…which is really just a reused Odyssey joke)
Nobody says hello
Thank you! Going lilac next 😝
kinda depends where you're starting from, hair apparently grows about half an inch per month on average
This make me cry evertim 😭 in a good way 🥰😭🥺
Not legally, but I go by it colloquially 🙃
Thanks! Color wise I went to a stylist to have it lightened to silver and then I decided that I could do it and fried my hair pure white 😅 took about a week to get it white. Then it was just pick my fav colors and blend em together, which took nothing but the 1 hour to pick, apply and dry. Now it’s just touching up roots, which is about 30 mins. Soon I shall teach myself how to cut my longer locks, but I’m letting it grow a bit before I start the chop 😅
🙌
Ohhhhh I love the idea of all those colors! Mind if I test em while you grow your hair out? I can post here so you can see as reference!
That is legit the sweetest compliment, thank yew!
Oh you just gave me a costume idea! Thank you!! 😍

The Graveyard Book. You seriously have to read that!
(Which is really just a joke a bored old man named Homer came up with)
Goes to the bottom of my ear now… so probably a few years still :”(
Very nice, so your [hypothetical] partner says that nobody loves them
I would absolutely adore that, I have darker hair so im going to have to use something strong to get the color I want, what product do you use to get that fierce coloring if you don't mind my asking?
Oh i knew that i smert really smert!
Indeed - it was the pinnacle of film when I was a kid and all spaghetti westerns have been compared to it since 🤣
Ok cool, added to my TBR - been a bit since I’ve read fiction; that’ll be a welcome change of pace!
So I was just under the ears about a year ago and I’m at the shoulders now. You shouldn’t be too far off now! It’s really about keeping up with the undershave - that I’m cutting once a month 😅
Hm, darker hair - is it un-bleached/virgin hair? You might need to bleach the ends to get a light enough base for vibrancy (I use the Ion brand for all my lightening/permanent hair color). You may be able to get the base color you want with a lightener, which is what I use on my roots (I have med-dark blond hair), but because I don’t quite know how dark your hair is, it may come out yellow/coppery. Thankfully purple and blue shampoos are easy to get at any Sally’s/beauty salon, so if it’s really yellow or coppery, you can tone it out. Once I do that, I add in whatever color combo of Arctic Fox I like. No special shampoos (outside of sulfate free) needed, just rinse with cold water 🥶

Pretty sure that’s more than what you asked, but I hope it was helpful!
Cool…:0
I don’t have a razor for it, so I have to go to get a haircut still (and last time thy cut off some of the hair on the other side too :c)
Maybe when I have money again, I’ll go and buy one

"Best rant on my pronouns I've seen. I think ""shitlord"" is my favorite insult now"		"Also, singular ""they"" is older than singular ""you""
I explain this to people all the time and it just... they just blank it. It's amazing.
The good thing about shitlord is its a genderless pronoun too
> People use they when **they** should use he, she, or it

How can a person be this dense, my god??? 

Edit: I'm the dense one lol. ""People"" is plural
People that don’t study language fail to realize that languages change, because people who use them change, societies change. Languages evolve with their users needs. We have a lot of new words related to technology (or new uses for old words, like “mouse” for a clicking hardware that is not an animal). Anyone who actually studies grammar knows that. I’m Brazilian and I used to study languages in college some 20 years ago, and that’s like the subject of our first class in the first year. I’m really upset about this kind of stupid argument (and we are facing it A LOT with our current 💩 of a government trying to legally stop gender neutral language from spreading, which is absolute nonsense and waste of time, because language exists according to its users needs, and we non-binary folks exist, even though Portuguese and all Latin-derived languages are strongly gendered!). Languages change and it’s impossible to stop it. You have to be an absolute idiot to say you are “defending” grammar if you are trying to keep a language from evolving according to the real world that surrounds it!
\>well... actually... no...

god, the melodramaticism here is noxious enough to wipe out a small village all in one go.
""Someone dropped their keychain, I will take it to the security guard for them to find."" Duh.
An oldie, but a goodie. Dicknut is my personal favourite.
To say that my mom is a ""Word Wizard"" as she calls herself, she will literally throw a fit when I tell her that ""they"" has been used as a singular since elementary school. They taught us this in primary. Why as soon as I tell her a friend of mine goes by they/them, she degrades them to people who have ""multiple personalities""? If you were a grammar queen or whatever you call yourself, you would know that they has been used as a singular before.
As an enby this shit pisses me off. 

As a linguistics nerd, this shit makes me wanna start a crusade. 


These people act like they care about grammar, but in reality they don’t give a shit about linguistics. Almost all linguists talk about being “descriptivists”. 

Prescriptivists prescribe how language *should* be spoken, whereas descriptivists simply describe how language is used. 

These are the same people to complain about “libary” and “aks” despite the fact that a lot of them say things like “perscription” “ar(g)ue”. 

What people don’t realize is that there’s variation in language and it’s all valid. If you don’t like it, it’s because of racism, sexism, classism, homophobia, or transphobia. 

Simple. 

I’m not even sorry if it hurts your feelings anymore. 


Facts don’t care about your feelings.
> People use they when THEY should use...

We are gathered here today to explicitly _not_ mourn the loss of another foolish grammar nazi that can't even follow their own rules because their own rules are dumb.
“Dense motherfucker” 🤣🤣🤣
We all need to start using the wonderful word ""pantaloons"" more.
Should send this to my dad
I hate when people use dictionaries as an argument, and then when you show them an in depth article by Oxford explaining singular They and its origins, they decide dictionaries aren't right anymore
The first evidence of singular they goes all the way back to the 1800s, doesn't it? Like, this is very much not a new thing.

When I was in elementary school (ugh, over a decade ago now, goodness gracious...) we were taught that if you don't know whether someone is a boy or girl, you use they. The teacher gave examples like, ""if you find someone's glasses and you don't know who owns them, you'd say 'someone lost their glasses' because it's less complicated than saying 'his or hers' every time.""

The only reason people have a problem with singular they/them now is because individual persons who experience gender as something other than 100% man or 100% woman have specifically asked that people use the gender neutral pronoun instead of he/she.

These people aren't actually concerned with grammar, it is literally JUST transphobia.

These people refuse to acknowledge that not only is singular they/them not a new thing, but that language changes constantly. We're not still saying ""nifty"" as common vernacular to say that something is interesting, we aren't still using thee/thy/thine/thou in every day speech. And actually, if they are so insistent that they/them can only ever be plural, they need to stop using singular ""you"" and go back to thee/thy/thine/thou. ""You"" was originally plural, so if the function of a word cannot ever ever change, ""you"" is for a group of people, ""cool"" can only mean slightly cold (not ""good"") and awesome is only allowed to be used if something strikes you with a fearful amazement.
My Mom should read this.  🥴
You could argue Shakespeare using it doesn't count for anything because he was prone to making shit up. But I don't think Chaucer was.
In the realm of gender neutral insults, ""chucklefuck"" is one of my favorites.

Edit to add, on the subject of plural pronouns: https://imgur.com/a/wa4BYoR

Doesn’t except “them” as a pronoun but lists “it”
""I care more about my first grade understanding of grammar than I do about being respectful to human beings"".

Cool.
""well... actually... no... they is plural. people use they when **they** should use he, she, or it."" bloody brilliant
My favorite is the miguel comment literally reading ""people use they when **they** should use"" xyz
I heard this from my partner, whom I met through [TS Dates](https://datingadvocate.com/ts-dates), and we had discussions regarding these pronouns.

Many people still don't understand them, but soon they will!
And if that whole argument doesn’t work you can just tell them that language is all made up noises and we can say whatever the fuck we want
They literally used it in that comment

This takes the whole grammar Nazi thing to another level of stupidity.
And this is why I love Tumblr

I'm with Camille Paglia on this.  I hate having to list my own preferred pronouns on my correspondence and have pointed out that there is a perfectly useful non-gendered pronoun in our language, ""it.""  I don't think that would be acceptable, though I'd be comfortable being referred to by that pronoun because the multiplicity of options is nonsensical.
Right? I’m still fucking salty about losing thou. Do you know how much meaning you can get by when you used ‘thou’ vs ‘you’ for a single person? Bitches can take singular they when they give me my fucking thou back.
My favorite fact is that it's older than using the letters ""th"" to make that sound, in some werewolf book that I don't remember the name of, they spelled it with the letter thorn
What sucks for older people is that we were humiliated growing up by teachers who did not let us refer to singular entities as they. It’s not hard to use a preferred pronoun though.
People usually blank it for me when i bring up that ""you"" is both used as singular and plural
Shitlaird actually. Shitlord is for men. Shitlady is for women.
not a pronoun and not genderless... but pretty good anyway
I noticed this. I want to print it out, decoupage it to a brick, then beat Miguel wirh it.

Edit:spelling
They said people, not person, so not that I want to defend them but they were using it as a plural.
My non-binary boyfriend told me I should add that ""Grammar exists to serve us, not the other way around"". There’s a Brazilian writer called Luis Fernando Verissimo, and he once wrote that we should slap language every once in a while so it knows who’s the boss, or something like it 😂

Is second person singular 'you' ever paired with a verb that doesn't match third person plural?? 🤔

What do you want / What do those folks want
You go / They go
You jump / They jump

... o.o The fact that 'you' is both singular and plural is not new to me, but I think it ALSO always pluralizes verbs...

And what's crazy is it could have still been used in the singular in that sentence. I don't know if they did that specifically to prove a point or if they actually don't know it can be used as singular.

I get that, but in everyday speak, it's okay. And anytime I tell her this she gets so pissed with me, saying that we (gen z specifically) are all crazy
Thanks lol. 

I just upsets me and I’m tired of trying to explain it to people “nicely”. 

The only reason they care about it is they either just hate a certain group that does something linguistically (and so it’s easier to attack the linguistics than the group) 

Or they simply have a linguistic prejudice (which is also bigotry) and they’ve just never examined it because linguistics isn’t taught. 

Ugh socio-linguistics should be a required course in HS or something.
Yep. It’s so frustrating. 

Or when people start to care that scientifically Ariel lives under the ocean and having dark skin wouldn’t make sense. 

Or whatever else conservatives are scared of lately.
Interesting... I think my brain read it as ""[individual] people use..."" which seems, it's hard to describe, but less like the subject is plural and more like the whole sentence is plural (many actions) where each instance of the action described would have a singular subject.

Then again, replacing the ""offending"" 'they' with 'he/she' doesn't sound right to my ears, which means the pronoun should grammatically be plural regardless of the semantics.

Ah well, you win some you lose some. Now I know to slow down and verify the search for a 'they' with a check on the referent!
So, yeah. Extremely NOT a new thing.

Tiny rant	"Bella Ramsey came out as enbi, right?

They said any pronoun is fine and it might be just me being stupid, but this article written by the Independent keeps referring to them as she/her throughout the ENTIRE article like dudes dudettes persons come on.

Can you not erase something that you literally mention in your headline?"	"Locked due to a profusion of rule-breaking comments. 

Yes, any pronoun is acceptable for people who use ""any pronouns"". But that's different from using multiple pronouns. For people who do either of those, their preference should be respected. (And when folk who use multiples say that the binary ones get used almost exclusively, don't argue with them about it?)

It's definitely some kind of dogwhistle to *only* ever use she or he for people who've expressed that they use a variety. 

For what little it's worth: If you expect people to switch it around, *you are almost certainly going to have to tell people precisely that*. ""Any pronoun"" will often lead to people just finding one that it seems like you're okay with, and using the same one for you going forth. If using any single pronoun consistently is something you're NOT okay with, though, you'll have to communicate that. The thing is, media outlets have a responsibility in journalism to ask you things like that in a way that any random person meeting you does not, so even if this celebrity didn't clearly state that they prefer rotation in pronouns, the interviewer should have clarified.
The articles second paragraph says they explicitly opted for she/her in the original interview
It is not erasure to use she/her for someone that uses any pronouns, that is not what those words mean.
The responses here are interesting to me because at least when someone has he/they or she/they pronouns, I take that to mean they'd be happiest with the use of both those pronouns in conversation: ""This is my friend Taylor, and she's nonbinary. They are really into rock climbing.""

I am she/they, and this is how I feel. But the majority of the time, I just get she/her unless in company with my other queer friends, and it can be annoying. I could speak up more, sure, but I've also dealt with people mispronouncing my name my whole life. It's tiresome.
I am also an any pronouns kind of enby, but what I have found is that the only way to get a real mix of pronouns is to look androgenous and request they/them.
I can understand where you're coming from. But it sounds to me like it's more important for you that the Independent use they/them than for Bella Ramsey?
As someone who prefers any pronouns too its honestly dehumanizing seeing another nonbinary person like bella only be referred to as ""they"" by other trans people. The insistence that bella use ""they"" now really invalidates nonbinary people that use gendered pronouns. If there was a mix of he/she/they that would be cool, but from what I've seen trans and nb people refuse to use any but ""they"" and act like you're misgendering to use she.
I thought they were gender fluid
I don't necessarily trust the Independent myself.
Non-binary. My parents, boyfriend, and his family still call me by my birth name and I’m 100% okay with it. I go by any pronouns, but I mostly get she/her as an AFAB, and I’m also 100% okay with that. 

Bella said to use she/her in the interview. Pronouns =/= gender
r/facepalm
Can't edit the post anymore so I'd just like to add:

Cesus Jhrist people, please for the love of shim (if you know, you know) be civil to each other. Hate on me for all I care if you don't just want to say I'm wrong and move on, but for the love of everything be civil.

Thank you.

Edit because I keep forgetting things I actually want to add: One of the commenters already corrected my mistake several hours ago. I thanked the user and acknowledged my mistake. End of story.
I had this discussion with my mom. I just had her read Kaleidoscopic Grangers. In it there is an NB who uses any pronouns, and the author switches their pronouns every time they are referred to. Even for me it was quite jarring and tough to get used to. However this is how I learned how to switch pronouns up for people with multiple pronouns. It is also what gave me the courage to accept multiple pronouns myself.

My mom just finished the book. So I asked her how she felt about it. She went on too explain that it was jarring and difficult to keep track of who was being talked about, while maintaining she/her pronouns for it.  Which was my initial thought, when discussing multiple subjects, it can be difficult to track who is being spoken of.  

I explained to her that the most respectful way to refer to someone with multiple pronouns is to regularly switch which ones you use.  That it can cause discomfort to even here a pronoun you identify with if it is to the exclusion of others as well. I told her that the over use of she/her for me was making me consider dropping it from my list of preferred, even if it is still ok.

I think to binary gendered people this concept is difficult. They struggle with the idea of multiple pronouns. So they choose one to use throughout to to keep things clear, so they think.  Though since they also struggle with neutral pronouns they just get stuck on using binary one, and will default to AGAB.  I don't think it was malicious, but it is a good learnable moment. If say, Ramsey, the subject of the article where to reach out to them. An update to the article could explain/teach that any pronoun doesn't mean free reign on how you refer to someone.
I think what OP is trying to express is that the article went out of their way to explicitly use the pronouns identified with the participants AGAB which can be quite frustrating at times, even if someone uses all pronouns as to me, even just throwing in a they or he at some point or expressing their use of said pronouns is more respectful than simply using the pronouns societal construct would deem fit. Unless the participant has specifically asked for those pronouns of course, whatever they are most comfortable with.
It's fine if it were just the headline. if he uses any pronouns, using she once in a while is hardly an issue. But if they truly used only ""she/ her""for her the entire interview, then that's not using ""any pronouns"". That's just she/ her.  I say this as someone who is never gendered with varied pronouns, but desperately wants to be.
“Meet my friend, she’s non-binary” vibes
if, what the poster say is true: ... this is as sad as allways.
[deleted]
Bella Ramsey is genderfluid. It’s a nonbinary identity, but mostly like cis? Like, only sometimes nb. She uses both she/her and they/them, so it’s not erasure.
Bella seems like a smart person so I think they made the choice to accept any pronouns because she is a famous actor and kinda of a rolemodel too. Like some people are confused about Non-Binary and gnc identities and might use a assumed pronoun on accident or purpose.

Like I have to be in boy-mode in public so I kinda have to accept that people assume that I am a man and might use masculine pronouns about me.
Hijacking top comment to point out that listing multiple pronouns doesn't tell people how you want those pronouns used. If someone says they go by He/They, they could mean:

* I prefer He, but They is okay
* Either He or They are fine, and I don't care if you stick to 1
* I prefer a mix of He and They, and I care if you stick to 1

Unless you specify, people aren't going to know what you want.
Then I can't comprehend English anymore or missed that part, welp. Thank you for clarification!
Also it makes sense to keep with one set of pronouns, so people don't think they're talking about multiple different people.
Thank you for pointing this out. I didn't notice it either.
I mean, ehh. I use He/They, but rarely anyone uses the second one, unprompted. Many, even the more inclusive folks, just see ""He"" and ""She"" as defaults, anything else is white noise to them. So, I've noticed that unless a person strictly uses They/Them, many people will opt to use the other two (""He"" or ""She""), like when referring to me.

Obviously, this is just anecdotal evidence by me, but I think you get my general point. And while I personally don't mind either pronoun, it is a little annoying that the people who know I'm NB default to the masculine one. So, in a way, it does erase stuff, just a bit, because they're ignoring the bit of me that doesn't fully identify with being a guy. Which is the reason why I'm Non Binary in the first place.

Just for the record, I will say that I don't generally bring this up in person. Or even online. I'm don't really a ""wave maker"", in that regard. And I'm really only bringing it up here, because it seems to be relevant to the topic, so I'm just sharing my experience with it.
It can be? Depends on the person honestly and specific situation, but for me personally, I use any/all pronouns with preference to she/he/they and some people Im out to always just use she and fem terms for me. I dont necessarily mind the pronoun or those terms, but it kind of feels like they are completely ignoring the fact that Im nb and use all pronouns.
Any pronouns generally means to use a mix of all pronouns. If you are consistently only gendering someone with one set of pronouns, that’s not cool. If she wanted to be referred to with only she/her, they would’ve kept their pronouns as that. It’s not that using those pronouns is a problem in isolation— it’s only problematic when it’s the literal only one used. 

The issue is mainly that some people choose to interpret someone saying that they’re okay with all pronouns to mean that they don’t have to change the way they think about or refer to that person’s gender. 

It does vary by person though, so this specific situation is very dependent on whether or not they agreed on the pronouns used in the article beforehand. It wouldn’t be problematic as long as Bella Ramsey explicitly said it would be okay to only use she/her. If they told the reporter to use “any pronouns” and THEN the reporter just used she/her, it would be.
Yeah, as someone who uses any pronouns, any does mean any to me (as long as it's not something bad of course), mostly because I don't really care so would rather go with what others find simple so if someone only ever referred to me using he/him or she/her that would be fine and probably expected.
Fair enough, especially in that case where the person of interest is okay with it, but like, we know what they're doing by sticking to one set of binary pronouns that happen to coincide with the binary gender the nonbinary person in question is mostly perceived as and presented as before coming out. We know why nonbinary celebrities who don't require the public to change anything about the way they talk are the most visible, and we know why any nonbinary celebrity might want to publicly state that they use any pronouns even if they might not actually be that comfortable with that, because if they don't they'll be misgendered anyway. 

I'm not saying it's abominable exorsexism and we shout riot, but even though we can't point at one specific instance and call it erasure, as a whole that's what it is. That's what the word means. It's super convenient to sweep nonbinary people's nonbinarity under the rug so they're just kinda cool lefteist vaguely GNC people that we don't have to use icky complicated pronouns for.
i disagree. it’s not misgendering, but it is erasure, because it’s basically ignoring the other pronouns that the person also goes by, especially if you’re only using their AGAB pronoun. using only one set of pronouns instead of all of them at different times was a deliberate choice by the author, and can definitely be seen as disrespectful.
I've seen articles on them before and the authors usually switch around pronouns. This is what annoyed me, Independent sticking to only one.
yes it can be??
I think it changes based on the individual. I'd rather someone stick to the same pronoun in a conversation for myself
Exactly, all this. Jesus fucking Christ, someone finally gets it. Thank you!

Also, the top part, my ex understood that after one conversation, and I didn't even phrase it like you did or flat out say it (mainly, because I didn't think to, at the time).

So, I came here, trying to bring up the same thing you did, and holy shit did piss rain from the sky. You swear I was speaking in a Martian language to some of these people. And then they come at me with their bs, when all I'm just trying to do is give my perspective on all this. Holy fuck.

**Either way, just thank you for the comment. I appreciate it. Greatly. Like, seriously.**
So true 😔
I'm living the any pronouns dream of getting a consistent mix of they, she, and he, the only issue is my pronouns are they/them and ze/zim 🫠
well, we can’t really say for sure how bella would feel about this so that’s not necessarily true. as someone who uses more than one set of pronouns, if this happened to me i would be annoyed. it’s very possible that bella would be too
Gender fluid is under the NB umbrella
They are
You know non-binary people can still go by she/her pronouns right?
Except Bella uses any pronouns, so this sentence is completely accurate and non-offensive in this context.
Bella is much more promsing than either of them, at this point so I'd say no for now.
His career is DEFINITELY not stagnant
Well, shit. Seems I was incorrect about this. Sorry, everyone.
honestly that’s a great way to phrase that. thanks for the tip :)

i always try to ask people i’m just meeting how they feel about their pronouns if they have multiple sets of pronouns
* I prefer They, but I'm used to He so w/e
For me, it means “you see it on my profile as multiple pronouns. I have left a default because it is not a particular form of dysphoria for me and I have more fear for keeping my job than taking the energy to enforce my identity, but if you get it, you’ll probably invite the conversation.”
That's exactly why I've switched my listed pronouns on everything from he/they to they/he even though I think the former sounds nicer, hopefully indicating that I prefer they/them pronouns over he/they, but still like to be referred to with masculine language, without needing to type all that
I always consider the first in the list to be more important. That is how it is for me. though I suppose some could have them at equal prominence.  


I prefer Fae. She is acceptable. I dropped they after a few months testing. It won't bother me if it is used, but it also isn't preferably.
Thats a great point thanks for hijacking :)
yeah like my friend uses he/they/she and doesn’t care if people stick to one but most people use she for him because it fits their perceptions of his gender identity
And there is yet another option. I use they/she but I’m only comfortable with close friends and family using she/her pronouns. So I just tell everyone to use they/them and don’t get upset when certain people slip and use she/her.
As someone who watches streamers who goes by multiple set of pronouns, I can say that generally, the fans balance out the pronoun usage fairly well (it's also a thing for fans to ONLY use they/them, but that's a whole other can of worms), however, it should be noted that the majority of said streamer's fanbase ARE LGBTQ+ themselves, so that probably explains a lot.
I get this. To me, saying They/He doesn't mean either works, it means I like both pronouns, but people default to what is most comfortable for them
I feel you. But I also feel the difficulty in the language. 

I remember when I first had a close friend come out as trans. Switching from he to she was practically insurmountable. It didn't matter to me, it's just... How I was used to talking about my friend.

Then I had my first nonbinary friend who was explicitly they/them, and it's even *harder.* It just doesn't feel easy to do singular they when you are referring to a specific person without putting intentional effort.

So in both cases... I put in intentional effort. It's totally a pain in the ass, but I feel like it's totally worth it. In my case, I think it's because I realized I'm agender. My sex/body is just a chassis for the consciousness within. Pronouns are just words. I genuinely do not care. But other people do, so I show that I care about *them* by putting effort into their words. 

*That's* why it hurts. Everyone who doesn't at least try to put in the effort is showing that they don't care enough as we cared to learn to use the language that makes us and our loved ones more comfortable. It's not that they hate us or don't want to be friends or they're bad people, there's just a tangible, undeniable disparity between who cares and who doesn't.
I guess it depends who. I notice people use they for me often because I don’t look entirely masculine to them and they “aren’t sure” but some ppl use he/ and some switch it up and use both in one sentence. That’s my favorite
It sounds like you're not actually comfortable with the ""he"" pronoun, and you would prefer ""they."" If you tell people your preferred pronouns are he/they, and then they refer to as ""he"" because it's easier for them, why would you be mad? They're listening to what *you* told them. 

No one is ""defaulting"" or ""erasing"" by using one of your preferred pronouns. If you're not comfortable being called ""he,"" then make that clear and *then* you can start to be mad at people for calling you ""he.""

If I go by a new name, but I tell people I'm also comfortable being called by my old name, I don't get to be mad at people when they use my old name. I told them they could use it.
All of this. All of it. 

I appreciate comments like yours, it makes me feel like I'm not losing my sanity, here. Thank you.
Yeah, any pronouns usually means a mix of pronouns, switching it up from time to time. And while that can work while you’re hanging out with a friend, or whatever, this is a *written article*. It would make for awkward and confusing reading of the writers kept switching around pronouns for the same person. 

And yes, as someone else mentions, the article itself references the fact that Bella has actively elected to use she/her pronouns, and she doesn’t care what other people refer to her as. So OP getting upset about Independent using the pronouns Bella WANTS people to use is just weird, misplaced anger, and seems more like they’re projecting their own issues onto this article.
I think you need to stop policing the pronouns of fellow trans people. She uses any pronouns. Calling her ""she"" and ""her"" is non-offensive to both her and other non-binary folk who use any pronouns. This is not the fight anyone needs to be focused on and it only serves to create division in the community.

Being queer is about free expression. Its not about weird, arbitrary rules you want to put on the way *other people* identify themselves.
It *could* be, but isn't inherently so. Especially when the person in question greenlights it.

I can feel that. But that's you. From what I can find about Bella from Bella, Bella feels different.

>Ramsey identifies as non-binary and is indifferent to which pronouns are used for her, telling The New York Times, ""I'm very much just a person. Being gendered isn't something that I particularly like, but in terms of pronouns, I really couldn't care less.""

Earlier NYT interview via [Wikipedia](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bella_Ramsey#Personal_life)
Yea think the meme was ""No thats wrong, she uses they/them pronouns"" or something along those lines when clueless allies correct eachother etc.
Oh I do, it just rubs me the wrong way when someone seemingly assumes she/her for a fem-presenting nb. It gives the “spicy woman” vibes. But I guess people clarified that Bella goes by she/her pronouns, so my spidey-senses tickled incorrectly
I really hope so. I just tend to be skeptical of celebrities coming out. A lot of the time it just seems disingenuous and for brownie points with Enbies and Trans folks..
Right, and I mean, if you/people in general are only going to use one, what's the point of me even listing two or more, you know?

**EDIT**

It kind of feels like one of those questions where someone goes:

""If you could only have one kind of soda for the rest of your life, what would you pick?""

And, I'm just over here like:

""Well, I enjoy more than just one, so why do I have to pick just one?""

Because when I do the He/They thing, that's what it feels like I'm doing. I'm not doing it in my own head, but others seem to perceive it that way, like you've mentioned.
i use they/she and completely relate on how peeps use my pronouns. 

if it’s safe, i’m going to clarify that i like a mix of she/her AND they/them. hopefully it helps. best of luck <3
""I'm comfortable using a mix of X and Y"" is a different sentence than ""I'm comfortable using either X or Y""
1. I told you what I use, don't assume things for me
2. ""Easier"" is subjective. This stuff is really only as hard as people make it
3. I don't remember saying I was ""mad"" about this. I even looked over my comment again to make sure, and all I said was a bit annoyed. Two different things. Don't put words in my mouth.
4. I really only brought this stuff up as I thought my feelings on the matter were relevant to the conversation. I even made a note in my post saying as such. So, I don't understand why you're making it sounds like I'm getting bent out of shape over this, when I'm merely just expressing my thoughts and experiences with it.
5. I will grant you one point, I don't push the ""They"" thing that much. So, you could argue some of this is on me. That's fair.
6. All in all, though, I really don't know how to take your comment. If you're being genuine, or some type of a troll. Because, most of what you said is you either: making assumptions about me, twisting my words, or making shit up. So, it's really not a good look for you. But, hey, I had some free time to kill, so here we are.

Have the day you deserve 👍
Look that that, someone who actually gets it.
These complaints remind me of the age-old dialogue:

Person 1: What do you want for dinner?
Person 2: Maybe pizza or a burger.

*P1 gets pizza*

P2: Oh, I don’t want this :/

In both cases, Person 2 should just ask for what they *actually* want if they’re going to be upset/bothered by any other choice. DON’T GIVE PEOPLE OPTIONS YOU DON’T WANT THEM TO CHOOSE!!
As I said above, it’s not a problem if she explicitly said that was fine. That information wasn’t included in the comment I was replying to. 

I don’t think the confusion thing is a great argument though. I used two different pronouns to refer to Bella in my comment in a way that wasn’t unclear. 

You can swap between she and they no problem. If you’re using he, just make it explicit in the sentence. You can do that quite easily by referring to Bella directly before swapping to an explicitly gendered pronoun. It may sound *jarring* to someone who isn’t used to it, but it would not impact a reader’s ability to infer who the pronoun refers to. 

Eg. “Bella Ramsey has just announced that he is non-binary. They have elected to use all pronouns, and have indicated that they do not have a preference for one particular pronoun. When asked, Bella said that she doesn’t care, and elected to use she/her for this interview.”
That’s kinda hypocritical of you to say after putting words in someone else’s mouth on how they identify on another comment.

Edit: ok block
It isn't inherently so, but it is true a lot of people tend to opt exclusively for agab pronouns when talking about someone who uses all pronouns in ways that feel almost misgendery, so I'm not surprised it rubs some people the wrong way. I don't think talking about how something makes us slightly uncomfortable should be seen as trying to establish a general rule.
I’m sorry, are we not allowed to prefer a mix of pronouns rather than just one set? We HAVE to choose?
You're getting downvoted for trying to make a valid point.

Reddit, man, it's something else.

*Sigh*
Sounds like an opportunity to be more explicit when introducing your pronouns to new people.  ""Please mix the use of he and they in reference to me"" may be more awkward, but it doesn't leave as much room for others to make their own assumptions.
Then one should specify. A ""/"" in pronouns or the phrase ""any"" doesn't imply preference.
Basically I think you're just saying that it would be nice if some people selected they/them when you give them a choice between that and he/him. Like if 10-20% referred to you with they/them completely on their own, it would feel like a breath of fresh air, as if more of your identity is being recognized instead of just the masculine part.
Fortunately, my feelings regenerate at twice the speed of a normal man's.

My post was more like: 

Person 1: ""What kind of pizza would you like me to get you?""

Person 2: ""Well, I like Pepperoni pizza as well as Sausage pizza. So, either is fine, in general""

P1: *Gets Pepperoni pizza. Every. Single. Time*

P2: ""Hey, you know, I like Sausage as well, right? Maybe you could get that some time?""

P1: *uncomfortable silence and awkward stares*

But, sure, just whip up some bullshit to make yourself look good, I guess. 🤷
>As I said above, it’s not a problem if she explicitly said that was fine. That information wasn’t included in the comment I was replying to.

True, that’s why I’m clarifying that Bella chose those pronouns. Just thought it would help understand where the differing opinion stems from. 

>I don’t think the confusion thing is a great argument though. I used two different pronouns to refer to Bella in my comment in a way that wasn’t unclear…. It may sound jarring to someone who isn’t used to it, but it would not impact a reader’s ability to infer who the pronoun refers to.

That’s a good point. “Confusion” may not have been the best word to use, jarring is better. But we also have to consider that not everyone who reads this article is going to be caught up on all the details inherent with talking about a gender-nonconforming person. It’s already hard enough getting the general public to accept us, so I think it’s easy to alienate them by switching pronouns around like that. You know how they like to complain.

>Eg. “Bella Ramsey has just announced that he is non-binary. They have elected to use all pronouns, and have indicated that they do not have a preference for one particular pronoun. When asked, Bella said that she doesn’t care, and elected to use she/her for this interview.”

Yes, this totally makes sense, and it could absolutely be done, but why would they do that? Why switch around between all options before finally saying “but she wants this one, though”? If she’s already chosen her preferred pronoun, then just use that from the beginning. Writing it as you did just seems like extra steps to really drive home the point that she’s non-binary, but that’s what the article is for. That’s where Bella refers to her younger self as a “little dude” and stating that when it comes to her pronouns she “couldn’t care less.” So my (rhetorical) question is: why does OP care?

P.S. Thank you for replying with your differing point of view in a relaxed, conversational manner rather than making insinuations and insults. It’s so refreshing to have an actual adult conversation on the internet for once. Even if we still don’t agree with each other at the end, this has been a nice interaction. Have a great rest of your day :)
This. This is exactly what I was trying to say. Granted I only use two of the ""main"" ones.
You’re allowed to prefer whatever you want, but you need to vocalize that. Don’t tell someone “my pronouns are she/they” And then when they refer to you as “she”, say that its upsetting. That just makes your claim sound false. Seems like “She” is not a pronoun you care to be referred to as if its sparked a negative feeling. Instead, why not just tell people “I prefer a mix of she/her and they/them”?
Nah, I don’t think I was, I saw “non-binary” and “her” in one sentence and my fight-or-flight kicked in, completely unnecessarily
Doesn't specify the opposite either. In fact I would argue that a slash would usually imply more ""both"" than ""either"" based on other usages. You hear whatever you want to hear, don't complain when people specify.
Essentially, yeah.

To try and put it like I did in the other comment, it's kind of like when you enjoy two different flavors of something. Let's say, vanilla and chocolate ice cream, for example.

Well, whenever someone gets you ice cream, if they always get you vanilla, sometimes youre just like: 

""you know, I like chocolate as well, right?""

And when it seems like people don't actively care about it, or acknowledge it, or do anything about it, it kind of sucks. I sometimes just get sick of vanilla all the time, you know?

And sure, I guess I could ""push"" for chocolate more. But, that doesn't feel great either. Because it can come off like I'm pressuring the other person, nor do I want them to think I want chocolate all the time, etc.

So, it kind of puts me between a rock and a hard place with the whole thing. Even with people that are generally more inclusive and nice about the whole thing.
""get over yourself""

Dude, you're the one that replied to my comment, unprompted, saying inaccurate shit about me. But somehow I'm the bad guy? What the fuck?
The parent comment of this comment thread does specify that she prefers a mix though. Like, they LITERALLY say that in the initial comment, and the comment you responded to is agreeing, implying that the second person also prefers a mix. Considering they’re both willing to indicate their preferences on the internet, I’d assume they’ve both also specified their preferences in real life, which makes it come off like you’re trying to police people’s pronouns. Being upset that people only use one pronoun set for you when you’ve specified that you prefer a mix is perfectly valid. It doesn’t mean they don’t like that particular pronoun, it just means they don’t like ONLY that pronoun.
Even implying ""both"" or ""either"" isn't what we're talking about. This specific situation is that a person would like their pronouns interchanged as often as every other, if not the same sentence. That's fine and all, but that's not how people speak and, beyond that, is incredibly confusing. Because of that fact, you'll have to specify to people that you want that.
That's a perfect way to describe it
[removed]
They’re saying here that they prefer a mix, but also stated that they don’t vocalize the issue they have when people do only refer to them as one. With that information, i don’t think they are taking the time to announce to people that they want a mix of both and feels more likely that they just say she/they.

I’m not trying to police anything. I was asking a question. My question apparently made you feel some kinda way. Yall can prefer and go by whatever you want, but since you are looking to be understood by others in conversation, maybe you want to specify things to those that don’t get wrapped up in pronoun conversations as much as you do. Y’all frequent these pronoun conversations, most of the world does not. This is why you find yourself having to correct people in the first place. 

My feelings are not hurt or affected by being called any pronoun. They just don’t mean much to me, but for someone that does(this original comment), i was just asking a question that maybe they could enlighten me and have a conversation more on instead of assuming I’m trying to police them and getting annoyed by it. But that’s fine. You’re right, I’m wrong. Carry on with your day.
Saying ""I use he/they"" is specifying it though. I've sincerely never met a nonbinary person who uses multiple pronouns and doesn't want them to be somewhat mixed up who doesn't either 1. introduces themselves with different unique sets to different people or places so that the separation happens by itself, or 2. make it abundantly clear from the get go what their preferences are. Not saying they don't exist but so far most people I know would assume multiple pronouns separated by a slash to mean ""all of these mixed up regularly"".

Plus we all know that when cis people pick the binary pronoun and stick with it 100% of the time it's not out of a deep desire to respect nonbinary people's identity.
I already made my points known about why I disliked your original reply. Take it or leave it. But, I'm not doing this with you, anymore. Go bother someone else.
Literally neither of the top two comments in this comment thread specify that they’ve never clarified their pronoun preferences. The initial commenter states that she assumes most people with multiple pronoun sets share their preference, but does NOT state that she isn’t clear with others about their preference. The second states that they didn’t have to clarify with their ex, not that they never clarify for anyone.

“Sounds like you don’t actually like she/her pronouns. Have you considered switching to just they/them?” Isn’t a question, it is unsolicited advice. It comes off as condescending (“I know your identity better than you do” vibes). I don’t know if you truely intended to have a conversation, but your original (now deleted) comment was not conducive to conversation. Your continued assumption that people using mixed pronoun don’t communicate this fact with others also does not make it seem like you want a conversation. It just makes it sound like you look down on us. Also, to clarify, I said you were coming off like you were policing others pronouns, not that you definitely were.

I answered your question earlier, but I’ll rephrase it here in more detail: the problem with being referred to by one pronoun set when you prefer multiple to be mixed is that people are ignoring your preference, and it is just as misgendering as being called “she” or “he” when you only use “they”. Switching to just “they/them” when you prefer a mix feels just as wrong as people referring to you as just “she/her” or “he/him,” and some people do that AFTER clear explanations about pronoun preferences. We are allowed to be upset by that.
Then what are we talking about here? If we're talking about a situation where someone has made their preference abundantly clear, like the situation you describe, and someone doesn't respect that, of course, that's shitty. 

My point is that if someone uses ""any pronouns"" and doesn't otherwise state that have a specific combination they'd prefer, I take that to mean, any pronoun I'm comfortable with is cool with them. If they secretly don't want you to use one of those pronouns or only want it used in tandom with others but they don't express that to you, I don't think its your fault for not knowing that. Using explicitly one pronoun or another doesn't define someone's gender. 

We are literally setting the rules on how we're spoken to and about. We don't get to be upset when other people respect that, but not in the way we secretly hope. If we're already in the position of explaining our identity to others, why not give the full picture? And if there's a reason not to give the full picture, it's hard to hold someone else accountable for not getting it right. They're not working with all the info. Kind of a NAH situation.

I understand the nuance of ""when cis people or even other queer people exclusively use one pronoun versus the others you also prefer, it can be with conscious or subconscious transphobia,"" but that wasn't the point I was trying to argue against. I dont really see the point in worrying what cis people think of me, subconsciously or otherwise. I decide my identity, not them.

Edit: also /NM. Just autistic.
I haven’t deleted any of my comments, so idk where you’re getting that from. My original and the 2 replies i made are all still here. Either way… You’re right, I’m wrong. Have a great day
Because it's not a secret hope. Saying ""I use he/they"" is already saying ""I use he and they"" and strongly implying if no other info that they should be mixed up to some extent. Not necessarily as far as twice a sentence, but it doesn't mean ""pick one and stick to it, some other people will pick the other probably"" unless it is explicitely said. Because if I want some people to only use he/him when talking about me, I tell them ""Hey I use he/him pronouns"", and I tell the people I want to use they/them with ""hey I use they/them pronouns"". 

There's kind of a social context to the way we share our pronouns, and just because you might happen to not hear it, which is fine, that can be talked out easily, doesn't mean it's not there for many people.

The thing with cis people who stick to the he of he/they or the she of she/they is that we know why they're doing it. Whether it's malicious or just because they picked the already beaten path to make the least effort possible, it's still a symptom of how nonbinary identities are seen. It's not exactly the same but kinda similar to a trans person using one set of binary pronouns and a new name. If a cis person suspiciously only ever uses the name and avoids pronouns, or on the contrary, avoids any name and uses only pronouns and pointing and ""the one over there"", we can see that there is some transphobia at play, however malicious or well-intended. 

I agree that as trans people, and especially nonbinary people, there is no choice but to be patient and slowly teach both people in our lives and the general public how we talk among ourselves. But that doesn't mean we shouldn't hold people accountable or be sad when, for example, the reason not to give someone the full picture is that they would be very exorsexist to our faces when we specify. Or that we shouldn't be sad that we have to dumb down and accept concessions made to our identity because people can't follow. It's inevitable but it's a pretty sad reality for many people. 

/nm either, I just like debating. Though I think we're missing each other's point here, it feels like you're responding to something to the left of what I've said, and I can only assume vice-versa. 

To clarify, my point is that he/they or she/they communicates the use of both pronouns equally, and that everyone should use both, not necessarily every sentence, but at least every once in a while. It's usually people who use multiple sets deviating from this tendency who specify so, or who just take matter into their hands and introduce themselves as different single sets in different places (for example, he/him at home, they/them at work, he/she/they with friends). Specifying is cool, but that's already what saying ""I use he/they"" is doing. 

Additionally, I agree that other people, especially cis people, aren't always gonna know what's the communication standards in the nonbinary community are, and misunderstanding can still happen. However, we have to recognize that it's not a coincidence that so many people default to using solely the binary pronouns despite both being cited. It's a result of ambiant exorsexism (once again, not necessarily malicious). We're allowed to be sad to be misunderstood and have a whole part of our identity sweeped under the rug because someone is too lazy to make the slightest change to their habits. We're allowed to be mad in the privacy of our own heads when soemone willfully misinterprets our words. Especially when we can't specify further because bothering them would push them to be exorsexist. Especially when generally when you come out with new pronouns to cis people and you're mildly safe, you don't say ""he/they now lol"", you have a normal conversation with words that say, for example, ""I use both he and they"", or ""If you could start using he and they for me I would appreciate it"".

And yeah, I mean, you can't really blame people for not wanting to fight about being nonbinary every living second of every day. You do that because you don't care what cis people think about you, some just don't do that because it's exhausting. Exorsexism is everywhere and it sucks, you can't blame people for being sad and mad in the privacy of their own heads about it.

Sometimes it feels like my brain forgets there are pronouns other than they/them...		"The good news is that English just does this. They/them is our default personal pronoun for people we don't know or for when we don't want to think about which pronoun to use. Everyone familiar with English will be okay with it, though they might not realize that fact consciously.
I call everyone they until otherwise specified, and for all the bluster about pronouns being ridiculous from the cissies nobody has ever even noticed lol
I personally think that they/them pronouns are the most respectful, if you dont know the other person's pronouns
Y'ALL

THEY IS A GENDER NEUTRAL PRONOUN

IT REFERS TO ANYONE

THAT'S THE REASON IT WORKS FOR DIFFERENT NON-BINARY PEOPLE

Of course there's good reasons many trans people who don't use it are uncomfortable with it being used for them.
when I came out to my sibling, in order to prevent using the dreaded he, they completely eradicated that pronoun from their brain and now they call our dad ""they"" constantly
I've met some cis folks who are fine with they/them. Honestly, while I fully agree neopronouns are valid, I hope to never meet someone who exclusively uses those. IDK how to pronounce the pronouns or grammatically correctly use them.
Just don't call an enby they/them if we don't use it please!
yup, not as much time around enbees as i would like, but just saying they so i dont out trans friends.
I do that lol. Sometimes I forget one of my friends uses she/her bc all my other friends are some flavor of nonbinary
I'm the one enby in a group of cis friends and they practised my pronouns so much in private that they sometimes slip up and call each other they/them 😂 we always have a good laugh when that happens!
Me although they/them is not my pronouns lmao
[deleted]
I’m gender-blind. I use they/them for everyone since it lets me see their traits more than their gender
But-but, using he or she makes me uncomfortable! /s
I just default to they/them if I don't know someone's pronouns.
using “they” until otherwise specified because presentation =/= identity >>>
See, this has actually happened to me. I seem to work with and see NB people everywhere where I live and my brain has started automatically just using they/them. 

Seriously, two former coworkers, two current coworkers, myself, a friend from back home who just came out, and more than a couple of customers a week. It’s no wonder I default to they more often than not nowadays. 

Someone actually they’d me without being asked to yesterday and it felt really good.
Been there a lot lately. I'm trying to refer to people I meet as they/them until indicated otherwise, but now it's hard to stop! I am correcting myself frequently because I can't stop calling people they/them.
My friend has a few learning disabilities and also mostly hangs out with enbies so her default pronoun used is they because she understands it better grammatically and using a singular pronoun for everyone makes it a lot easier for her when she's writing AND handily 90% of the people she interacts with regularly use they/them so she only gets pronouns ""wrong"" 10% of the time
Hey Sappho, I’m really sorry. About what I said regarding racial slurs. Life’s rough right now, and sometimes I feel like no word in the English language, no oath in any human language ever that could possibly describe how much I hate people that hurt others. People that have hurt me. A word that carries the emotional weight of knowing that no amount of agony perceivable to the human mind would come close to repaying what they’ve done, but at the same time, uncocking and lowering the gun you had pointed at their skull because… you can’t perpetuate the cycle of abuse. You can’t bring yourself to harm or even discipline… anything.

I… I just want to talk, I guess… and I don’t really have anyone I can talk to about this.
My wife and daughter end up being she/they because my nonbinary child and myself are both they/he.
Hello yes i am number 2, but only when i speak English instead of my native language.
Have the same problem LMAO.
I do the second part LOL
Why would you need other pronouns?
I had this crisis when I first came out.
No cap my dad used they/them for one of our dogs one time cause he got so used to it for me. So now I keep saying that Abby's pronouns are she/they
Where's the panel for about getting called ""they/them"" even though you're a non-binary person who doesn't use those ""they/them"" pronouns and being like, ""oh whatever, meant no harm, whatevs.""
calling anyone you dont know by they/ them till someone corrects you
I find myself trying to use gendered language around people because I'm much more comfortable with they/them, but a lot of people in this conservative area will be so anti-pronoun(that sounds so insane) that you will get weird looks if not gendering people.

&#x200B;

like wtf is wrong with y'all, it doesn't really matter what gender anyone is when I'm telling a story.
I relate way too hard to this.
Yeah I do this too.
Probably for the better
I use they/them as to not disrespect poeple ( beacause I don't know how they identify as ) but then some people when I use they/them on them, they look at me with that look of use \_\_\_\_\_ I'm a \_\_\_\_ and I just end up disrepecting them
Nah cuz I’ll call my best friend of 8 years (who is cis+het and uses she/her) they/them accidentally ***right next to her*** but she never notices. I do this to everyone too, even transphobes and homophobes! It’s a habit but at least it’s not a bad habit (unless someone hates being called they/them like I do)
I wish portuguese was like this
Nope. Nobody ever notices unless you have already set them up to harass you about pronouns.
That second clause is important tho - if you *do* know their pronouns it's not respectful anymore unless those actually are explicitly stated to be the correct pronouns
i got to be the person to make your upvote count nice
also if you’re bad at remembering pronouns for whatever reason (no practice or poor memory for such things) they is a good default
Lmao I read that as saying “ya’ll” was a gender neutral singular pronoun, so that’s what my deleted comment was saying, whoops
Haha, yeah, I've never known a cis person to be offended by this irl. More just poking fun at my own brain.
This is delightful
Dovahkiin! :D
I understand feeling that way, but honestly I don't think it would be that hard. They would definitely help you out with those things at first and I think it would become normal before too long.

Never known anyone who uses neos either though, so I'm not speaking from experience.
[removed]
Ummm... yeah, I will continue to do my best to not misgender people...

Sorry, I just don't see how that is relevant to a meme that specifies it is only referring to enbys who do use they/them?
It’s normative to use they when you don’t know a person’s identity or pronouns in enby spaces. Once you’re used to it it feels different to go back to trying to gender people.
I mean, I included a clause in brackets to indicate I was specifically referring to people who's pronouns are they/them and only they/them. Doesn't that implicitly acknowledge what you are saying?

Also It's pretty hard to forget that some enbys use she/her and he/him pronouns when I am one.
Literally in the post it clarifies enbys who ONLY use they/them
Unless they said not to?
Well existing is grounds for harassment for some of these people
yep, that would be misgendering
lmao
I had a friend from the south tell me “y’all” was singular and “all y’all” was plural, i don’t remember what region tho, but we can start using it that way
Originally, yes. I also love D&D.
Unfortunately, I am not exactly the easiest to teach. I have significant brain damage so learning new stuff is a Herculean task for me.
You clearly have an actual point to make, but you don't need to call anyone's choices dumb. I'm sorry if you feel like other NBs make you look bad or something, but we're all just trying to figure this out
I was more referencing your title.  Because maybe you are doing your best with those of us who don't use it, but there's a lot of people who really do just call everybody they/them and expect us to be okay with it :/
As someone who feels dysphoric when people call me they/them, I make a point to avoid pronouns and just use names for strangers, and I don't think that's too much to ask.
It was a misunderstanding. My apologies.
That can be read in more than one way. it's ambiguous.
Yep
Full disclosure: I pass in boymode, so my experience is colored. Anyone who has never seen me in a skirt has never given me shit about calling people ""they"".
afaik this is the prescribed usage in Texas specifically, as well as a lot of the south u.s.
[removed]
Oh, haha sorry. So all of the enbys in my irl life exclusively use they/them. I can see how the title would come across that way. But it's talking about a lived experience.

I'm sorry some people act that way, that's really lazy and insensitive.
It kind of is too much to ask. Pronouns are literally ingrained in our languages, and extremely few people use neopronouns. You cant expect everyone to just avoid pronouns for you at first meeting because most people use pronouns. If the built in gender neutral pronoun doesnt work for you then thats fine, but its a very small problem and the world is not going to change the way our language works for you.
My wife has an issue with using pronouns for things without specifying what they're referring to first, so I've developed this habit as well. *bangs ladle on counter* **No pronouns for you!**
They/them grammatically is acceptable as a way to refer to the a singular person using she/he. It also has become acceptable as anything under the umbrella of gender non-conforming. 

So as a Trans Woman that is slightly NB I am fine with They, ideally prefer She, but can't stand he/him because that is a projection of a whole masculine perception and cultural backdrop onto me which I am not. Thus, it causes dysphoria. There's a slew of connotations and meaning behind calling ne a him, in addition to anti-LGBTQIAA and Transphobic sentiment. 

So I am just curious in what way do neo-pronouns avoid causing dysphoria while the linguistically acceptable gender neutral ones do? I'm not trying to be mean I am just confused. The reason for this is on the flip side neo-pronouns, aside from a few more standard ones, by their nature can be made up to be unique for everyone: at which point I ask what differentiates neo-pronouns from names?
Not really. I’m not sure what you think the word “only” means but the first box was clearly referring to non-binary people who ONLY use they/them pronouns disliking being called she/him pronouns. The addition in the parentheses was clearly added to indicate people who exclusively use they/them so as not to infer that all non-binary people use they/them. I think you were just looking for a reason to be offended by this post.
Then cant understand the downvotes yeah, I do the same cause it simpler if the person minds not the all gender inclusive they/them pronoun
Wtf you need therapy
If their actions aren't tied to you why do you care...

Respect pronouns, bruh		"Do we have to have pronouns?
Some people don’t have pronouns, they’re pretty rad too
Yes respect people's pronouns, but some people don't, so also respect those people's lack of pronouns too.
Thank you all for the education you are providing! I have only recently come out as nb and I have a lot to learn, I am so glad I am able to have access to a forum on which I can further educate myself ❤
Say that to the French language 🤧 (and to every other language that has no gender neutral variants)
Yes, can confirm. Although please be patient with some of us we were taught they/them is plural so when we refer to a single person our brain explodes.
[deleted]
Not me. I have no pronouns. Do not refer to me. Do not observe me.
I just avoid this by using people’s names.
Has anyone tried this strategy? Every time someone misgenders you, respond by misgendering them back. Especially for cis men I think they would really dislike being referred to as she. But I don’t know if it’s a good strategy, haven’t tried it
I like the sentiment but not everyone likes being referred to by any pronoun. I've met people who prefer to just be called by their name.
Yasss thank you!
How do you respond to people who tell you to stop forcing your beliefs on them when you ask to be referred to as they/them? Because I don’t think that’s necessarily forcing beliefs on anyone...
*cough cough* dad. *cough cough* stepdad. assholes.
When trasphobes realize they also have preferred pronouns 👀
Let's misgender transphobes on purpose :)
Objection! I Don't Have Pronouns! Well, I Had Some, But I Lost Them... I Think They're Somewhere In My House, But I Can't For The Life Of Me Find Out Where.... Any O' Y'all Care To Help Me Look For Them?
Not necessarily, but if an individual has preferred pronouns then they should be used.
Nope! I know people who don't use any pronouns, in which case you just use the person's name.
French has 'ça' I guess but it's pretty demeaning.
I wish french wasn't so gendered 😭 I have to misgender myself every time I speak/write and I ✨hate it✨
Yes. Me too. It's a super stupid and totally unnecessary grammatical feature and it makes not being cis so much more complicated. 

I blame the Proto-Indo-Europeans.
[deleted]
I fucked up and called a friend by their deadname. Her response was to call me ""Trevor"". My name isn't Trevor, I immediately got her point.

I think it just depends on who you do it to. I realized my mistake on my own and understood why she was saying it, I was willing to apologise for my fuck up. Some people wouldn't react that way tho, errybody different
Pronouns are a bit weird tbh. I get the idea is that you should respect other people, but fundamentally speaking it seems to imply that each person should have a certain level of control over how they are referred to by other people, which honestly doesn’t sit very well with me. 

I mean I certainly don’t feel entitled to force people to think of me or talk about me in a certain way when it comes to non-pronoun contexts, and well, it’s a bit hard to see why pronouns are different.

I speak languages where there is a single third-person pronoun that works for everyone, and honestly, it just makes so much more sense to me. I feel like the gendered nature of traditional English pronouns have made people a bit too worked up about pronouns in general.
I don't want to contribute to normalising misgendering people out of spite...
Lmaooo bet
Ofc where should we look first
I mean, yes, but one of my adopted children doesn't want pronouns, which make it difficult to refer to this individual without giving away the identity of this person, but no pronouns means no pronouns.
Lmaooo that's the equivalent of calling someone ""it"" and i'd slap the person who calls me that
But I was talking abt how every noun and adjective is gendered and I'm not abt to start using the masculine variants of words cuz technically, gender neutral in french is the masculine variants but no, male isn't the default gender
Iel tho
Spanish is a highly gendered language too. Having to end every word in a specific male or female ending, and pretty sure they also gender inanimate objects too, like the sun, moon, chairs, etc. Very strange to gender an object to me. It’s as if they’re purposefully trying to lay claim to vast swaths of activities, ideas, clothing, colors, and celestial bodies..
Or if not ‘laying claim’ at least trying to limit what people are “supposed” to like/dislike do/not do.
That’s true, i think it would have to be a situation of repeated disrespect
True!
True. Almost every day I see people online fighting about the singular they.
I Dunno, Maybe In The Living Room? I Think I Was Using Them In There.
That is actually fairly common ([10% of nb folks)](https://gendercensus.com/post/177314368855/gender-census-2018-the-pronouns-question/amp). 

Little note: some pronounless folks will take on a short nickname to replace all pronouns. Ex: Jonathan becomes J/Jay. So that the phrase “Jonathan left Jonathan’s book at Jonathan’s house” becomes “J left, J’s book at J’s house”. Makes it a bit faster if you’ve got a longer name.
I'm inclined in that direction myself but don't love my name enough to make people repeat it a million times, and so waffle around not quite happy with anything. My own non-binary kid chose they/them but tolerates ""no pronouns,"" and weirdly some people have a harder time with that even though it seems easier to me.
You could try they/them pronouns, which removes the gender from the pronouns? I personally go by they/them pronouns and it has been a lot easier to avoid dysphoria that way.
Has this child tried using it/its pronouns? My partner from high school uses it/it's or she/her pronouns.
I know, like I said it's demeaning lol. I guess the closest serious suggestion might be to use 'eux' as the French version of they but it might sound weird. It kinda sounds French Canadian now that I think about it.

Edit nvm eux is also gendered. Uhhh.
Oh, yeah, lots of languages have genders for inanimate objects. I wouldn't read too much into that, most of the time it's just weirdly random and it doesn't reliably match the things we know people associate with men and women. 

Like Spanish has two words for 'computer', one is masculine and one is feminine. The French word for 'vagina' is masculine. German seems to have one feminine and three masculine words for 'uterus', while their word for 'testicle' is feminine. The German and Dutch words for 'girl' have a diminutive suffix that makes them neuter. In German, 'baby' is neuter, but 'infant' is masculine. 'Masculinity' is a feminine word in German, Dutch, French *and* Spanish. It's just kinda all over the place. 

I think everyone who speaks these languages knows grammatical gender is just arbitrary nonsense.
>Spanish is a highly gendered language too. Having to end every word in a specific male or female ending, and pretty sure they also gender inanimate objects too, like the sun, moon, chairs, etc. Very strange to gender an object to me.

The linguistics gender has very little relationship to human sex or gender identity. Similar nouns were placed into similar groups. You could just as easily call them group A and group B nouns. We just call them masculine and feminine because male things happen to be in that group. Some languages even have several or even hundreds of genders/noun cases. It's just a system of organization. Similar sounding or appearing nouns are placed in similar groups. 




Thinks that society considers masculine aren't masculine by default, same goes with feminine. 




For example:  El maquillaje (makeup), El clítoris (cl*toris), los tacones (high heals) and El vestido (dress) are all masculine while la verga (d*ck) , la hacha (axe) la espalda (sword) and las botas (boots) are all feminine. 



Also La gente (the people) and  las personas (the people) are feminine regardless of the gender of the group of people. And while you would use the corresponding article El or La, the word for sports player is femenine, deportista, deportistas.
I'll have to talk to the person in question about that.
I think it's not about gender or genderless, it's more of a lack of any identity at all. All I know is that this individual is a human being deserving of respect and dignity and does not want pronouns.
I'm the one who uses it/its, but that part comes later.
Exactlyyy it's a big rip
I think gender neutral pronouns should become more common place Xe/Xir, Ze/Zer, E/Em and my personal favorite, E/Er
Then I think you are doing a wonderful job referring to this person as ""this person"" To avoid any missteps
If the human you are speaking of wants to have no pronouns, then so be it
The intention of my post was to remind those that use pronouns to respect their peers pronouns as well. ❤ I hope u have been some help at least, your situation is one I have never heard of before today.
To clarify, does this person also avoid ""I"", ""you"", ""we"", ""us"" etc?
If I don’t know the persons pronouns for sure, I just call them by their name. Works like a charm.
Not that I've noticed.
Okay. I was curious because those are all pronouns as well, they just aren't gendered ones."	j6un6g	NonBinary	2241	1.0	2020-10-07 17:00:13
Successfully told my boss to use my new pronouns today ✨ (they/them)		"Hell yeah! Congrats on doing the hard thing 💪💪 also your outfit is so cute !! ☺️

You look like Luis from GTA Ballad of Gay Tony.
Thank you!! As a new enby, I'm learning how hard it really is to come out. Now my parents are next!
It went really well! We were collaborating on a google doc and they saw me changing all the ""he's"" that referred to me into ""they's"", and that ended up being a nice little segue to asking them to use my new pronouns :)

We Need More Black & Queer Anime Characters (Preferably With HeShe Pronouns, Like Me LOL)		"YES!!!!!!! My partner is a black trans woman, we need that REPRESENTATION!!!!!
Yeah we do! Is that an iron maiden t-shirt?
You are that anime character 🙌
Yes!!!!!!
Ooh, I’m interested in the pronouns, haven’t heard of these before. Are they HeShe/HimHer?
Preach🥳🥳🥰✨✨
What's the story with the kickass scar?
I can draw you as an anime character if you want to☺️
Oh my gosh yesss!!!  You should check out this anime company/studio (if you haven’t already)  [D’ART Shtajio](https://instagram.com/dartshtajio?igshid=1ufworr0c80gq)
Yes yes yes! Anybody writing these stories/characters? Hello, I’m a creative producer currently working on a few film projects and I’m interested so DM me 😌
Hells YES 👏 WE 👏 DO 👏 👏 👏
I’m curious, how would you use he/she pronouns?
Already creating a character in my head
 They're handled kinda not great at first, but the character [Fire Emblem](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/tigerbunny/images/5/5d/TIGERandBUNNY2-Nathan.png/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/340?cb=20200501150912) from Tiger & Bunny is canonically a black nonbinary superhero! My main problem(s) mostly are them being comic relief/kinda an archetypical 'funny queer person', but the movie had a pretty realistic, in-depth plotline about their gender and them being uncomfortable presenting as exclusively masculine or feminine. [Some GIFs regarding it](https://kotetsu-san.tumblr.com/post/127990398257/you-dont-know-anything-about-him-never-talk)/kinda spoilery, but still.
Yes 💯
I’m not that good yet at drawing anime, but could I try drawing you as an anime protag?
Maiden!
Agreed! 💜
[like this?](http://imgur.com/a/CAeChSY)
I was genuinely surprised, and happy, about how many black characters were in the anime on Netflix ""Carole and Tuesday"".

Also there's a black acapella group that sings a hilarious song and, I think, they're trans or maybe just gender non conforming. Either way would recommend the anime if you haven't seen it, very wholesome, uplifting, and sweet.
nice beard
Agreed!
You actually loo like an anime character super cool!
Girl yes I would love to see that also you look great today
YES. If any animators are interested I like writing stories
I'm now wondering if I've ever seen any black, queer anime characters and it's really bothering me that I can't think of any. What the actual ultra depressing fuck.
I'm black/queer and identify as an anime character (I use he/she/they pronouns ⭐)
Yes!!!!!
Not a colored character but i know haruhi from ouran highschool host club is a nonbinary icon . i think they were one of the things that sparked me to consider maybe i wasnt male or female lol. We need more of that stuff lol
REPRESENTATION is RESISTANCE 💖
yes its Eddie ! (and i stole him from my ex 🤣)
*aw shucks* maybe thats why Japan is my top country 😏
YES YOU GOT IT 🥰
I believe that is hair my friend
😱😱😱 if you do, ill buy it and make it my album cover, or i will at least share it everywhere and promote your art!
oops, i just jizzed my pants from all this beautiful black art 😭 you need to warn people !!!
i meannnnn i DO have some black enby animated characters designs... you wanna see ?
as one word! Heshe, brosis, and sirma'am are all acceptable!
Maybe a switch back and forth situation? Or combining them like he-she being one word? Idk I'm a they but I'm curious.
who's my love interest ? 😘
wow another artist 😱 if you do ill buy it and make it my album cover (this might turn into a whooole anime themed series) or if thats too much i will still share it all over the internet to promote your art 💖
i just realized im a heavy metal rocking, anime watching, black and queer hot assed mess 😭
hahaha soooo masc of you, but to be fair, this is pretty masc presenting. you do this often ?
im not a girl... im a girlyboy 😛
maybe due to the lack of black queer people on production teams ?
just say you're a godexx, cause thats what it sounds like 🙄
Nice! Eddie's better off with you 😜
Heck to the yeah, I’m going to add that to my mental file of cool shit I know about now!
no wait i like the scar theory, that sounds more Anime 😂 

*hurry make a back story*
What??! I totally thought it was a scar too! XD
Haha I'm just an amateur, I'll draw it for free😅
But you are flattering me! 
As long as you say where it's from you can post it anywhere you like

If you want to I can DM you my Instagram name so I can send you the picture (probably be done this week) because I have no idea how imgur works.
We all want to see!!
Yes yes and yes
I’m also curious since Heshe is one word, you know like how pronouns have he/him, she/her they/them etc, would yours be heshe/hesir or something like that
me personally, i prefer the combo. but ive also experimented with switching mid sentence or using whichever felt fitting for the energy im bringing. but thats maybe more appropriate for genderfluids and bigenders 😗
Ooh a new prompt haha
Omg thank you I don’t really do commissions but that would be amazing
This was my first impromptu anime portrait, but I have posted on and off on redditgetsdrawn for a while.  

I am trying to get a handle on gendered presentation across styles, what details would make this portrait more in line with your ideal presentation?
Hehe
I'm betting so, yeah. Still really distressing to think about, and I'm a little angry at myself it never occurred to me before.
That's the dopest  thing I've heard all week and I'm going to use it forever ✨
i think the backstory is obvious, you got it beating the shit out of a transphobe anime villain. i’m jealous 💪💪
send it to @LapiThatBitch (uh oh, the enby redditors know i switched instagrams now 😂)
basically if there are a male and female version of a word, put it together as one. i have also used x in place of certain vowels, similar to the Latinx community.  x is moreso gender neutral, however it is also the third gender identifier on passports/IDs that allow third gender identity. all non binary genders are third gender, according to the binary sys(cis)tem
dm me on Instagram @LapiThatBitch or email me at LapiOnTheBeat@gmail.com
well my hair really feminizes me (in my eyes) in the way its curled and swings. more details on that! and my lips/cheeks could be pouted a bit more 🥰
eurocentric people usually dont notice that all of the characters look like themselves, because 90% of the media out there is eurocentric, but thats not 90% of the people watching, and thats the problem
Your insta name is amazing. Love the energy.

If I don't have it done by Sunday then just yell at me or something. I'm forgetful.
Interesting! That’s really fascinating. I have my gender down as X on my ID
Will do! Thanks!!
I can definitely see what you are talking about in your selfie.  Thank you for the notes.
lololol i wont yell but ill send a very LOUD message 😆
keep going!

Can someone use my pronouns (they/them)		"This person in this pic right here? They are cute as hell
I haven’t had anyone who validates my gender identity. I don’t mind he/him but I prefer they/them

Edit: This is the sweetest sub ever! I’ve never received so many compliments before. My heart is so full
Op here, they have good style.
Just at their smile. And that outfit looks so good on them. I hope they have a good day!
That's the homie over there. They got some of the flyers taste I've come across.
The earrings!
The watch!
The jacket/shirt combo!
They have such a good fashion sense. I'm jealous
OP looks so good in this pic! I love their earrings
They have such a lovely smile :)
Damn they look stellar in that jacket, I can’t believe how stylish they are! And a real cutie too!
Wow :00!! This person is so cute!! They have a very cute smile :0
Damn they have a cool jacket on
Don’t they look stunning?
Who Are They™ they look like a whole friend
Omg OP is GORGEOUS! They’re so captivating in this pic. Love their style & love their smile!!
Have you seen Nadaness' new jacket?! They look absolutely incredible in it! I'm so jealous!
They are beautiful. Looking at their smile makes me feel happy 😊
Their style is on point 🔥
I don't know who they are but I am entranced and intrigued!
They've got a great smile and sense of fashion. I want to steal their wardrobe!
Damn homie, you seen this fly as hell person! I love their look so much!

They look so rad wearing that zebra(??) print jacket.

Damn they are killing it in that zebra print, wow!
Damn, they have such a cool jacket.
Nadaness is an amazing person, they're super cool and an amazing friend!!!

Also TransTryouts is a good place to do this as well, they accept enby people!
Psst, over there in the jacket, look at them! You think they'd be okay with me talking to them? They just look so cool, it's almost intimidating. Maybe I should ask who their style comes from.

(Fr you look so good! Very snazzy!)
Omg where did OP get their jacket it is a VIBE
Use your pronouns? Absolutely. Since they said so I'm just going to tell them I'm fitting as many they/thems into a sentence for them since I'm also a them and I bet they are just as tired as me LMAO. I also feel like I should mentioned something funny to them, one of my Manager's has a friend that tattooed ""They"" all the way down one of their arms and ""them"" all the way down their other arm. It's a vibe.
Yo they are cool as heck!
they have a wonderful smile, and a great fashion sense. they also have very swag earrings <33
*looks at you* Damn, they got swag~
Honestly I really want their jacket. That fit is really good on them
This person looks like an awesome person. They have such cool style, a warm smile, and kind eyes.
I'm jealous of their style. They have nice earrings.
you see this pic? i want it framed in my wall. the subject of the picture, well, they are very cute and they have the most amazing face on them. they are the mona lisa of nonbinaryism, so much so that they put leonardo davinci to shame with such little effort on their behalf.
What a handsome gentlethem we got here!
Oh holy fuck, they are so fabulous I'm gonna die-
Their jacket? STUNNING.
they have such a nice outfit
Oh my god!!! I love their zebra print jacket, they are so cute!!!

Wow, check out this post from nadaness! They have such a great vibe! I love the look in this photo and think their sense of style really suits them. I hope they have a great day and that over time more people can understand, respect, and validate their identity and their pronouns.
they have a beautiful smile!
No one is talking about their amazing earrings??
They are literally the cutest! Look at their bright fuckin smile oh my g o d
excuse me, they’re hot as f*ck and i’d like to be their friend

They got a sweet jacket. 😎👍
Ooh my goodness, look at the gorgeous Melanin on them. Yas. Loving all of the vibes they give off, so much positivity and strength. Keep being you, we need more wonderful people in the world being their wonderful selves.

Ooh, who are they? 👀👀👀
They are killing it!!! Welcome home sweetie. ❤️🧡💛💚💙💜
so i get email notifs for reddit forums and the first thing i said when looking at this pic was “they look good, goddamn!” in case youre wondering :-)
they're looking fresher than a turkey on Thanksgiving 😳
I just met them. Yeah, they’re cool to be around with.
Damn, they're looking nice. I wonder where they got their outfit, I'd wear that every single day if I could, but they pull it off better than I ever could.
This is my friend they are my friend. It's always a good time when I'm with them

Have you seen them? They are so cool and they are a really good person
They look so cute, love their style. They also seem like a nice person, probably a sweet friend. I wish the best for them! 💕
This human? oh, their pronouns are valid too.
OP has got the most INSANE FIT!! Their smile is absolutely adorable and you can tell that they’re a lil shy in front of the camera, but they still make up for it in ABSOLUTE GORGEOUSNESS
Was just passing by and I saw this beautiful smile and just had to know who they were. Thank you for bringing a little sunshine to my day.
How do they do it? Always looking amazing, I love their earrings
everything abt them is absolutely perfect:)
Look at OP! They have such a gorgeous smile and sparkly eyes.
I love OP’s jacket, they seem like a really nice and sweet person. I wish them a lovely rest of their day!

Always
This person is so cute they look so kind and I love their earrings
They have a really sweet smile
Wow this person has serious style; they look incredible! And their smile is so sweet and lights up their face!
I don't think they really get it. They can't just ask for pronouns, they need to buy a lot of boxes of Captain Crunch and look in the bottom of the cereal box for them. I had to go through two dozen boxes before I found a working she/her and my blood sugar is still recovering.

Be well
See that person in the picture? They look fly as hell! I love everything about this picture they took!
OK. \*takes your pronoun and uses them\*

Hi, my pronouns are they/them.

(This is just a lighthearted joke btw. My pronouns are actually they/them too!)

Anyway, the person in this pic is very valid and deserves having their pronouns respected!
Ooooh, look at OP's earrings! Their whole outfit looks so good! Their smile is radiant and they're absolutely glowing!! I hope OP knows that they are loved and valid, and has a great day ❤
HAVE YOU SEEN THEM!?!? They're just stunning 🤩
Their smile is infectious!  Just look at their cute, happy expression!

Finally going on a date in a feminine presentation with someone that knows my pronouns, kinda excited.		"That is super exciting! Have a great time!! ❤️
WOW what a look!!! Hope your date goes well 🥰

Lucky them. Have fun!

You look cute! Hope you have a good time!
Your gorgeous babe!!
Gotta say, you nailed that look. Hope the date went well!
I thought that was a filter until I read the title!
YOUR EYELASHES AND EYELINER ARE SO PRETTY. I'm liked mesmerized by them LOLLL
Those wings are sharppppp... You look amazing!
Hi I wanted to comment, please don't take this as hate, but you eye make up looks an awful lot like the fox eye make up and it's not the most appropriate for those who aren't of asian culture.
Makeup game so strong, good luck!!
Congrats
You look so amazing! I hope your date goes well!
you *should* be excited i was too!!!! have fun!!
I hate this.

Your makeup looks too good. ;) I hope your date went well!!!

Good luck. Let us know how it went
So excited for you!!
Ahhh, cute! So pretty 🥺
You look great. Hope it goed well!!!❤
Thank you!
Thank youuu
Hi! No worries thank you for the concern. I do just have quite naturally narrow eyes and hooded brows from being amab which could lead to it looking like that but it is just eyeliner done normally and with no intention of being fox eye. Hope that helps.
Are you Velma in you profile pic? Too cute!
The eyeliner isn't my problem whatsoever, it's looks quite nice, but the eyelash looks upturned and it kind of looks like it was placed of the eyeliner instead of your Naruto eye.
Yeah I am, I've started cosplaying more now that I'm openly feminine.

If you’re attracted to me you’re gay (genderfluid any pronouns)		"*gay intensifies*♡
I use all pronouns too I'm attracted to you.

Would that make me more or less gay?
Omg, your earrings are so adorable! You look stunning
I'm so fucking gay
Me: *sees the upvote button* Ooh I wonder what this does!

Also me: Oh I'm gay now. Huh.
Very gay (bi) here.
Guess I’m gay because you do be looking hecka cute
Your eyes are breathtaking 😍
Well *I* know that how do *you* know that
So does it also* make me gay I'm some kind of fluid (i think, still figuring it out) and am pan (also still figuring it out)?


*I say also cause i think you're hot
this is genuinely motivational, I want to embody this energy
Lol excuse me but* omnisexual* still adorbs
I'm gay! 🙋
and happy to be gay (or at least bi)
Yes
*sigh* no need to remind me.
*laughs in pansexuality*
(And don't make the frying pan joke!)
I guess I'm gay then.
same ( ͡• ͜ʖ ͡• )
jokes on you I already am gay😱😎
I think as genderfluids we get the unique position of calling every relationship gay :P
Me, a Bisexual: I don't have such weaknesses!
You're not wrong
Uh yeah duh. Of course I am 🌈
That title is amazing and youre right i totally am 😂🤣
what a great day to be gay
**gay:tm:**
Well you have another gay here. Your earrings are so cute oh my god. Where did you get them?
oh phew finally i know for sure
Actually Pan ;)
Oh no, but you look v young??? 🙇🙇😅😅
Oh shit I'm gay
I suppose I’m gay now.
I guess I’m ~checks notes~ pretty dang gay. 😉
I am attracted to you.
You are very cute. Yes, I’m queer af lol
Fantastic day to be gay, bah gawd
That's a yes on both counts.
Guess I'm double gay now ¯\_༼ᴼل͜ᴼ༽_/¯
Gay af I am
I think you're aesthetically pleasing tbh (asexual)
*checks*
yup. so gay.

Haha jokes on you, I'm bisexual! 👉👈
Holy shit I’m gay af
ya got me
Yes, but what’s new
damn im gay af!!!
Well then, spank my ass and call me Nancy cuz you are looking great!
That's some pretty strong motivation to gay it up
Oops, guess I’m gay
As a gender fluid myself too, wouldn't that make us extra gay 😳😏?
the vibes i'm getting off the first pic are just remarkably similar to a certain dnd tiktoker

(after finding them again in yet another compilation video it's @sarahiscoffee)
Well shit, I guess I'm gay.

Also, it's really nice to find other people who use any/all pronouns!
Akhchually I'm pansexual   


And also you're stunning!
Shit im gay
Does that make me double gay as a fellow gender fluid
This is the happiest confirmation of my gayness I’ve ever seen
Why do you must call me out like that
You have pretty eyes
I use they/them and am definitely attracted to you
Don't like the title. It's the thought-process behind ""are traps gay?"". You are not gay if you are attracted to trans-women. You are gay if you are attracted to ""regular cis-men"".
So even if someone was attracted to a drag-queen, they might still not be gay.
(Same for women attracted to trans-men, they are not lesbian because of it)

Otherwise you can just cross the words gay, hetero and lesbian out of the language as it makes them meaningless - ""everyone is bi"".
Are you a guy?
Check, and mate...
yo you have gorgeous eyes!

also I'm curious, what's the tat on your shoulder?
Oh nooooo. Too bad I'm agender. Literally the opposite. Dang the one time I'm not gay
Lol same
I get that it’s a meme, but...

Yes you’re hot and no I’m not gay and I’m mildly annoyed at the assumption but whatever it doesn’t matter it’s a meme
I’m super attracted to you and I’m not at all worried what that might mean ❤️
TIL
I think it just evens out to “pretty gay”
You are most gay, you have defeated the final Boss and achieved the gay epitome, congratulations. Also it's very upsetting that there is no award for most gay. :(
Asdf movie?
NOT “LEAST” U ARE EVERYTHING BB (this is was a brief moment of aggressive bi palship brought to you by viewers like you, thank you 💫)
Technically I’m pansexual but I just call myself gay at this point because being genderfluid just adds a twist to it lol
Etsy!
I’m 23!
Wow thanks!
Lol
It makes you all the gay!
I’m not a trap I’m genderfluid
I’m genderfluid so yeah I’m a guy sometimes! In this pic I identified as he/they
It’s a Polaroid photo of a campfire! There are little trad flowers around the border
Yeah lol
Oh wow! I see that, though now that you say. Cool style!! 😊

Edit: I'm 27, so the other end of 20s. 😮
I knew I was gay since middle school, well Pan actually also why is your username tacovillan
I know. The point is that what you currently identify as doesn't matter to the attraction felt by the other person. People are neither attracted to ovaries/testes nor to identities. The only thing that can be relevant is gender expression & performance, that is what is visible, how you are perceived by the given person. 

Some lesbians & straight men might be attracted to you, some straight women & gay men might be attracted to you. Being attracted to you doesn't suffice to determine their sexuality, you need to check to whom they are generally attracted: cis-men, cis-women or both.
Oh gotcha. But if I (M) was attracted to you, I don’t think I’d be considered gay. I think that’s a sex thing and not a gender thing.
It’s an anogram of my birth name lol

An anagram?

People have been respecting my pronouns(they/them) even if I present myself quite feminine <3		"We love to see it 🤍
I absolutely love your hair, and those earrings 🖤
Aaa your whole look is great! Where'd you get that cardigan? I love it.
That is so awesome! I'd love to experience that someday :) I'm so happy for you hun & you are Adorable!
I’ve been dealing with the whole gender dysphoria thing for awhile. The thought of transitioning and little steps towards it caused me so much anxiety and I was miserable. Non binary seems to be working better for me, putting less pressure on what strangers think of me. 

The hope is if I have a relationship or make a good friend that I would let them know and if they care about me they will respect it. I’m glad people are respecting your pronouns and how you want to be addressed!
Looking good! 

I like your boob lamp, btw ;)
people aren’t respecting my pronouns bc i’m amab, present masc bc of dad issues, and have a deep voice
That’s awesome. I hope to one day have that 🤞🏾
I love it when fellow feminine/masculine (as apposed to androgynous) presenting non-binary people can live their lives with respectful peers. I'm a lil envious, but happy for you!! I hope that one day this will be the norm :P
Being enby is an identity not a clothing style so good for you. And good to hear ppl use the correct pronouns for you! Also u look very good!
Thank you. 💙 I present feminine as well (except colorful things im a goth at heart lol) and have been afraid of fully coming out as non binary solely because i present feminine and i am afraid someone isn't going to respect my pronouns. I have severe social anxiety so its just hard. but this makes me feel seen, so thank you and you look great 🧡
YOURE REALLY PRETTY!!!
i love your cardigan!!
OH MY GOD I HAVE ALMOST THE EXACT SAME SWEATER! WHERE'D YOU GET IT?
And omg another ceiling titty
Gorgeous
I see the feminine look not staying for long with the patterns.
Very attractive style ❤❤ Thanks for representing!
You’re such a vibe I love your hair
Your hair is amazing!
That's awesome friend, I'm so happy for you!
I love this for you! 💕
I love that for you! I love when people respect others so much! It makes my heart happy!
Cute!! Where'd you get those earrings?
That’s so awesome to hear \^\^💚
Aww I'm super glad :D
yay!
You look so happy. 

Slay that day. <3
Dam thats nice. 
Don't take it for granted
That's great! So happy for you!
Where do you live?  Maybe I need to move there.  People call me Sir constantly where I live.
Omg really??? You win
Omg your so pretty!
Super happy for you, I wish people did that for me
Awesome 😁💞😎
thats awesome!! (also sorry if this is weird but i have the exact same hair but curly and i’m also fem presenting with they/them and i thought thats interesting lol)
Glad people have been respecting your pronouns! I wish more people in the world would.
you're so pretty omfg
Beautiful
Hi there. I am very interested in learning more about non binary identity as I still struggle to have a full rounded understanding of it...would you mind if I asked about how/why you both identify as non binary as well as present yourself as feminine?   
Not at all because I disagree or take objection to it, but purely because I'm interested in learning more and becoming fully informed around it. I am fully aware that it's not your job to help cis people gain more knowledge/acceptance, but it would be great to learn more if you felt you wanted to.
What's up with boob lights getting so popular these days lmao, or am I seeing them just now?
:)
Thank youuu :)
same!!!
Thank you 🥺.... its from shein
Thank you so much 💓 and I promise you will feel it someday
>I’ve been dealing with the whole gender dysphoria thing for awhile. The thought of transitioning and little steps towards it caused me so much anxiety and I was miserable.

There is absolutely NO pressure to change your body at all, to transition, to do whatever you don't feel comfortable with. I'm AMAB and present myself quite masculine and still we're 100% valid. It's fun once in a while to dress up or wax my legs or put on makeup or something but we have absolutely no requirements to be the gender we are.

If transitioning makes you feel worse than not, remember you are 100% valid and don't have to do anything that makes you uncomfortable. Our gender and gender expression should be what makes us feel *less* dysphoria and *more* comfortable. Live the life you want, and love yourself
Thanks 😊
You will I promise 🤞
THIS REPLY !!!!! I also really hope that it becomes the norm one day :)
Thank youuu 🥺❤
YES BABE I was also afraid to come out as none binary for that reason but I did it and I had a lot of positive feedback and also I'm glad you feel seen ❤
THANK YOUUU 😊
Thank you :)
It's from shein
I KNOW
Thank you 🥺
Thank youuu ❤
Thank you 🥺
Thanks 😊
Thank you❤
They are from a Canadian and native owed business
Canada, but I can tell you it ain't everyone that respects them
It's not weird at all, I love meeting people with similaties
Awwwwe thank youuuu
Thank youuuuu ❤
Of course I can explain, I actually started questioning myself genderwise when I was very young as a child I'd always wear dresses I was very feminine but I never really felt connected  to the female sexe It just never really felt right I don't really know how to explain it it just felt off identifying as female. After some friends introduced me to the term Non binary and as soon as I got a very good explanation and a good grasp around the concept I realized that that was me. Also the fact that I present myself very feminine is because as most people know clothes doesn't have a gender anyone can wear whatever they want. I like presenting myself more feminine, wearing dresses and skirts is how I feel comfortable and is how I feel connected to who I really am. I don't know if this helped you but feel free to ask my questions I'd love to help you out.
Your just seeing them now iv had boob lights in my house for ages
Well I take HRT meds cause it makes me hate my life less, l was constantly suicidal before I figured out I felt the way I did. I still struggle with depression but I’m still able to sorta function in life currently. Idk how to approach it tho with people. Like I have small boobs now, and I try to wear large shirts and hoodies but it’s still noticeable now, idk no ones asked yet lol. I’m rambling
i got mine from ross, kinda cool how they look really similar
Reminds me of the vine ... And I figured... You left it in quite visibly
Hi there. Thanks so much for your answer, it's really appreciated. Yes this has absolutely helped! I couldn't have really gotten much of a clearer explanation, actually.   
And this is where the problem is in my head and with so many others, I assume...is that appearing 'feminine'...it's just our interpretation of what it means to where, say, long dangly earrings whereas it's actually the case that some people will wear long dangly earrings because they just want to wear long dangly earrings, and not because they want to give off the appearance of 'femininity'. We have that historical definition of what it means to wear certain clothes/makeup/hair, so we have trouble in separating those items from the gender that we've grown up associating them with. And with non binary folks (and others who choose to do so too, of course), it matters nothing to them what genders those items are associated with, they'll just wear them if they like them. Is that correct?   
Overall, the main reason for identifying as non binary is because there is a disconnection with your body/assigned gender, but this has nothing to do with your appearance in what you wear/how you style yourself etc?   
Have I got that right?  
Thanks again for your help and patience.
You understood perfectly everyone's situation is different but this fits perfectly with mine.
I completely void gender assigned things and do want I want. Thank you for not being afraid of asking questions ❤
Absolutely, this makes complete sense to me now. Thanks so much for your time and patience, I'm extremely grateful.
No problem ❤

Wearing my pronouns today, because unfortunately customers feel the need to gender me		"Those earrings are kickass. Are you Ace?
The whole look is on point and if people still don't get it they are donkey doo-doo.
I'm sorry people feel the need to gender you. Its amazing how blind others can be to experiences outside of their own. I can't imagine most wanted to hurt your feelings though. I imagine most are just not very educated about gender identity.
I'm considering getting a pronoun pin to wear at work - did you find that it worked at all? I get called ""lady"" constantly and just want it to stop 😭
❤️
Omg I love the shirt! From where did you get it?
I'm super shy and introverted so if someone gets my pronouns wrong I'm like welp whatever it is it is. I legit hate correcting people on these things.
I hope it works at least for a few of the customers

Looks great
Gender? No… I’m about to show you *something beyond that*
In my experience, it doesn’t really help. Hope your experience is different, friend.
When people gender me, I just don't blame them. They don't know me well so I just correct them
That is an awesome shirt!
Would it be weird to get a pronoun pin for the club or nights out?
Omg, where did you get this shirt!?!?!? Edit: Your dreads look AMAZING!
I hate when people throw in unnecessary gendered terms…
Uggh… I’m starting back into customer service next week and I’m dreading this.  How hard is it to just say hi and ask for what you want without bringing up gender?

You look awesome by the way.
I'll just say I love the use of gender as a verb. You did not have a gender till they game you one in their heads. Let them live the fairytale land of ""gender"". You are existing simply as a person, which is something they don't get to experience
You look stunning!
Thank you! I am ace and i love these earrings so much.
They never get it. I have multiple shirts, a sweatshirt, and pins. They dont even try and it hurts sometimes
Yeah most people are very ignorant about the subject and thats why the majority of the time i dont let it get to me. But sometimes it just feels like my identity itself gets erased. Ya know?
I get dear and darling a lot. But the worst one lately..  




Ma'am 😫
☺️
I found it on etsy. I buy all my amazing stuff from etsy, like my ace earrings!😆
Its really hard to do, and you dont know how they will react. Some people are so fearful of stuff that they dont understand that they might verbally assault you. Also it takes a lot of energy to correct someone when you are shy and introverted. I know from experience
This makes me think of the scene from teen titans when Raven dragged dr. Light into darkness 😈 great scene
Oh it doesnt work 🥲 but it makes me feel better to at least have the shirt. The majority of people are still ignorant about the subject
Ive thought about correcting people but the issue is that it happens with to many people. Ya know? At some point it would get tiring.
Thank you!
So I don’t personally identify as NB but I joined this sub because a few of my friends are and honestly pins, shirts or colored jewelry makes me feel a lot better when addressing my friends or people I don’t know very well. I always feel like such a sleeze when I misgender people even if it’s an accident.
Love the shirt idea though :)
I dont think it would be weird
It would be weird to go to a club in a pandemic but it’s always cool to wear a pin with your pronouns.
I got the shirt from etsy, i get a lot of stuff from there, and it supports small business 😁 and thank you!☺️
Its absolutely annoying, and unnecessary. People think its being respectful but its really not
Thank you! ☺️

Unfortunately it seems to very difficult for people to not bring up gender. Its mostly older folks. Younger guys like to say ""thanks bro"" and im perfectly fine with that. But when someone says ""sir"" or ""young man"" i get annoyed
Thank you! ❤️☺️
I will fight people if they keep harassing you.
I have a shirt like this that I wear to work along with knee-length trans flag socks and the security guys still misgender me - which would be bad enough if it weren't the security guards, but that just adds a whole extra layer of shitty on it.
Some people are blind to sweat shirts pins and graphic T-Shirts but damn a pronoun is such an easy word to see that your eye should catch it anyway! It’s not like a name that is mispelt beyond repair, its three or four letters.

People gotta do better, else they risk misgendering a cis person on a bad day… I’ve seen the wrath of a middle aged lady being called sir.
I can only imagine how grating it would be to be misidentified day in and day out, regardless of intent. We grew up in a world where everyone was supposed to fit in prescribed boxes, and thus anyone who we couldn't accurately categorize was dismissed as weird or at worst ostracized. The concept that some people do not identify with either of the two ""accepted"" gender identities has not yet reached the global consciousness. I believe your situation will remain unfortunately common until the future. But I also believe things will change for the better in that respect. Good luck to you, and don't give up if others wear down your resolve. You have every right to be properly addressed.
Thanks for this. I’ve started going out again (since covid vaccinations avail) and it’s been annoying because it’s like ppl go out of their way to get my attention and then misgender me (I don’t think it’s malicious; just less understood/conservative area). 

I think I’m going to get a rubber id they/them bracelet thing for casual daily wear, a few nice shirts for first meetups and some different pins and pendants to switch it up (I wonder if they would even notice this). I also worry even with all that, they still won’t get it 🤦🏾
I dont use pronouns when talking to people unless i really need to get someone’s attention (like a customer) and i usually dont feel bad at that point because its usually an older person and they are usually cis.
Thanks. You inspired me to check out some shirts on Etsy 😎
There are plenty of ppl going out and doing things now with vaccinations and precautions (and many before) but after almost two years of not going out, I’m going out to “clubs” or whatever I want with acceptable risks.
I should really be checkin out etsy! They have the coolest stuff! Thank you!
Thats sweet of you! Thank you☺️
Im sorry. It really sucks how hard it is to get people to acknowledge your identity, people dont even try.
People really seem to understand gender when you use the wrong pronouns for their dogs lmao.
Right! And my thing is that why do people have to add 'sir' or 'ma'am' when speaking to you or someone saying ""thank you young man/lady"" like its unnecessary to do that. Some days it makes me sad that i get gendered over and over again. And sometimes i get happy when they get it wrong lol
Thank you! I have high hopes that in the future it will be more normal to not just label people based on gender. It does wear me down but i have some great friends that go to great lengths to remind me that they see me for who i am, and it helps a lot
Hey imo the only people who matter are the ones who notice and respect it. You can’t be a very interesting human if you can’t respect such a simple request. Have fun and be safe!
Your welcome!😆
Np I have pent up anger to spare when it comes to ignorance.
People misgender my dog all the time, then PROFUSELY APPOLOGIZE when I say ""yeah she-"" like... I don't even correct them... it uh... reminds me of when people do the same for humans... it is an uncomfy thing to be a part of
I worked at a semi-formal job… my “egg” has many many many cracks in it now, the amount of misgendering seriously affected me, but I still can’t seem to come out to anyone I am around cause they have not figured it out yet… my hints are not strong enough. 

Lucky for me though, I live in the south, and I adore southern pet names cause they are inherently non-gendered, so at least a handfull of people that I used to interact with last year never misgendered anyone, cause everyone became “baby, love, sweetheart” regardless of how they looked.
Same. I've got a dog that's goofy looking and a dog that's pretty. People misgender them all time. Same reaction.

Edit: [Can't resist posting dog pictures ](https://i.imgur.com/bk2lpLb.jpg)
I feel like i would be fine with pet names, unfortunately i cant get that. Even though a lot of older people come into the store i work at, they adhere to the ""sir/ma'am"" or the ""young man/lady""
Yeah it’s uncommon sadly. I hope the older we get the less we do this to other people trying to just get through their shifts."	pl0cm5	NonBinary	2036	1.0	2021-09-09 15:45:05

hello!! :)
as much as I wish it was my real hair it's actually a wig, although my real hair is cool too
YEESSSS
The wig is actually one of the ones I use when I cosplay as todoroki, I couldn't decide between being myself, Todoroki or Harry Potter which is why I have on the glasses and I look like a tired teenager
:)!!!!!
Reading this comment gives me so much happiness and it absolutely made my day so thank you✨✨✨
I agree so badly!
Ahh whoops, it is a nice wig though. I'll take your word that your real hair looks cool as well!

LMAO love that for you
science can’t explain me 😳
goodwill!! sorry 😭 theres no tag
I've just heard variations on it from lots of other enbies and it suits so i repeat it XD I can't attribute it to a specific person, unfortunately, but I only refined it myself

My pronoun pin finally came in!! I'm kind of excited to be able to use it! Excite!!		"im happy for you!! :D i have the same pin and love it too!!
A few years ago, I'd be mildly confused seeing someone on the bus with a they/them pronoun pin, and now I'm considering buying one of my own. Funny how that works!
Awesome pin!
Ooh! I have a pin like that (but different pronouns) they make great Pins!
Yup that's the one Ive been stalking forever. Maybe you convinced me to get it. Congratulations!!
I read the top part as “RELEASE US” and thought this was some cursed ancient non-binary artifact
:O I ordered that exact one a couple of days ago!!
why the fuck would you get one that says please??? it's not a request it's a demand. 

it's a very nice pin though, very pog
WHERED U GET IT
Where do I buy this
Oooo I have that exact same pin too!! Congrats!!
I love this. It looks tough.
My child would really like that. Thanks for the link.
this is so pretty! i was thinking of getting the same pin for he/him but the shipping is too expensive to europe… i hope it serves you well!
I wish there was a She/They pin in this style but I'll absolutely still use this! Also, thank you!
I never in my life thought about it myself until, slowly but surely, I started feeling more and more comfortable being called that, even if by accident.
Right! I'm so happy with this!
 Glad to have helped!
ACTUALLY!! That's so funny!!
What are the odds!!
As a Canadian and someone who's just recently (this last year) experimenting with pronouns, please gets you places!

Also, thank you~
I got mine off of eBay but you can find them floating around Etsy and Wish.
I got the same one a week ago! I've been tromping around town with it on :)
GamutPins on Etsy is where I got mine

https://etsy.me/2UOAALV
I bought this off of eBay, but you can get it off Wish and Etsy. I've seen it floating around there before.
Thank you!
I got this off eBay and the shipping was free! (I live in eastern Europe)

I just got one too!! ☺️
Tbh, it probably will be sometime in the future lmaooo
I'm also Canadian! I will admit saying you're pleases is good but when it comes to basic respect it shouldn't be a question it should be a demand, imo
No worries!!
oh, that’s great! i live in the balkans so that’s really convenient. i wanted to buy them off etsy to support the artist but i’ll check on eBay as well…🤔
AHHH!! THANK YOU!!
Bet!
Well, I'm not comfortable with demanding something from strangers that I'm only JUST getting used to.
Someone else from the Balkans?? Why, hello!
fair enough. comfort is important as well
haha, hello neighbour! it’s always good to see other balkaners in queer spaces :]
Maybe when I get more comfortable with using They/Them pronouns, I'll correct strangers. But, for now, it's She/They.
Oh absolutely! It's nice to see other people like me!"	o9k83h	NonBinary	1959	1.0	2021-06-28 13:25:56

“Oh hey! This is female! I’m leaving you”

Ive been thinking a lot on dream jobs and how having  an ideal form of labor was always weird to me.

I'm not as critical of gender as I am labor so these thoughts dont translate well for me, but I like the idea of 'gender is not as necissary as many assume it is'
Love this 💖
No but this is so so perfect!
this is suuuch a good way to put it, lol. maybe this will help me get it through cis people’s heads in a fun and nice way, haha.
In Finnish, there’s no gender for third person. It’s the same no matter what the person—hän

Same 👍

RATZ		"I use they/them to honor the 3 raccoons that pilot my meat suit
I hate this argument purely because it's just wrong, but bigots don't care that all knowledge is against them
""I am indeed one person, so why dost thou use plural pronouns in thine speech when talking to me?""
I am a fuckton of neurons, all trapped in a prison of calcium. I think it's fair to say i am many.
me, who is actually thousands of bees
rats, rats, we're the rats
Mine may or may not be filled with a dozen otters....
They/them had been used to refer to a single person ad far back as 1300s.
> when someone turns out to actually be plural
I was expecting this to be r/TheRatEmpire lol
Rats! (Ah-whooahhh)
As a person who has rats, I approve. I'm probably really just a rat too. Or multiple.
I'm actually a bunch of snakes in a trenchcoat
Filthy man things don't understand pronouns yes yes
Not rats, but close
I’m just 5 possums stacked in a trench coat and each of them has a different executive functioning disorder
As you can see by my name, I am made up of an infinite amount of spinal columns
this is literally my response when people say that
Wdym i can't use they/them pronouns.
I'm literally 27 rats in a clown suit???
5 Queers and a Dragon in a meat-suit.  Also have a couple headmates who use they/them exclusively.
My braincells are plural, your's are singular that's why people refer to me using they and to you using she 😎
I should try that lol
Art, car, at.....wait what are we doing?
Fuck fact : ""Les Ratz"" is a famous cartoon (for millennials at least) in France
This but squid
People can not seem to respect the fact that I would prefer they acknowledge the trillions of cells, bacteria and other microorganisms that collectively are me? It really gets on our nerves! LITERALLY!!



(In all seriousness, I treat this with the same eyeroll as I do anyone who complains about language being “incorrect”; while many pint out that we use “they/them” to refer to singular people all the time, even if it were “incorrect”, languages are organic, and change and develop ALL THE TIME! 

There were likely people in the 1600s-1800s complaining about how we switched from “thou/thee” to “you”, which I’ll add was to save time and money on printing presses; languages will always change based on the needs of the people using them, and “they/them” is just another example of that)
Rats, rats, we are the rats...
Joke's on you, I'm just three ducks in a human suit.
strangers: you're a single person!  


me: actually i am, in fact, six pigeons and a crow, thank you very much.
heyyy I'm three raccoons in a trench coat! 

or a spirit piloting a meat mech, but that visual doesn't help people remember my pronouns lol
Grammar just doesn’t exist for some ✨
NB actually stands for **N**umerous **B**ees
Angry or calm bees?
do you perchance prey at night and/or stalk at night?
Seriously, where is Ron?
YES! this
Four kobolds in a meat mech! We all use they/them and it/its, as well as some other headmate-specific pronouns
both, they vibrate regardless
YES someone got it thank GOODNESS

My name is Eli, I go by he/they pronouns! Growing my hair out to achieve an androgynous look ☺️	I go to a Mississippi farming college and I make it my mission to stand out every day and show people here that you don't have to look one particular way.  I want people here to understand that life is more fulfilling when you just exist authentically :)	"You look like you are straight out of the 80s in the best way. Already looking very androgynous.
Your sense of fashion is incredible
you look fantastic, good on you
That iridescent shirt is .. actually— both shirts are gorgeous! Where do you look for clothes? I struggle to find androgynous stuff around where I am. 

Hope you’re feeling the euphoria :)
I thought you were Tom hiddleston for a second
We’ll, your killing it.
Oh my god you look gorgeous! I’m jealous
You give off the most wonderful vibes.
You look like a beautiful Legolas
You look like MCU Loki if he travelled back to the 80s.
I love your style--playful and elegant! I'm jealous that you're attending a farming college. I spent many years studying things other than ag before finding my place as a farmhand! So I'm just learning as I go.

Anyway, here is my favorite cow and favorite tractor on the farm where I work

YOU LOOK SO GOOD
Your look evoked a verbal, ""Oh my god..""  
You're Beautiful!
Style and hair aside, it's the look in your eyes (that I honestly see more of in this community than anywhere else) that just broadcast ""being at peace in your own skin"".  

Don't let anyone's cruelty dim your light.
I gasped. Absolutely stunning. All of it!
love your style!! do you know where you got your crop top from
I want your gender!
ooh lookin good! 👌🏻 have a wonderful day/night Eli!

Holy hell Eli, you are absolutely rocking both of these looks! Gorge!
I'm in Louisiana. No one in my daily life knows I'm non-binary. I'd be so happy to see someone dressed like you. It gets lonely being the only rainbow fish.
Your fashion is so cute!! Especially love that purple top.
God your whole vibe is everything. Keep leaning into yourself bc you're rocking it love 😍🙏😩💜
Your hair looks really nice 😊 I also really like your outfit 🥰 you just have an amazing vibe about you that makes me smile 😊❤️

Eli! I was wondering if you could share where you got your amazing top (in the first pic)!
Transition goals tbh
All power to you! The world needs more people like you in it :D
Love your outfits, that reflective shirt is everything!

Sadly I can't give you advice on looking more androgynous, that's not my forte :/

enby pals, you owe no one androgyny :) I felt femme for once today, but that makes me no less worthy of they/them pronouns!		"[deleted]
Idk if that's a dress or a top, but I love it!
Posts like these are more helpful than many realize.  I struggled with this so much when I first came out as enby.   I'm AMAB, and I outwardly present as masculine.  I would like someday to try to experiment with femme, but it's not extremely important to me.  What's important to me is not restricting myself based on expectations of masculinity.  I have a femme side and I want to be able to express that sometimes without people judging me or being suddenly shocked that that side of me wants to come out every once in a while.  But it's easier for me to present as masculine to avoid making waves with my family, co-workers, etc, so I present masculine 99% of the time because it doesn't matter.  I don't feel victimized or anything, it's just something I don't feel the need to deal with.  

It's complicated, but posts like these are enormously helpful to someone who is new to this, still exploring, but wants to do so slowly and experiences impostor syndrome because of that.
May be biased but skulls make all clothes better, love it
This is enormously comforting to read.

I struggle with body dysphoria on and off, and on days where I feel at home in my body, I feel less valid and like I’ve made a mistake - am i cis after all and I just hate my body like most girls?!

Every femme them I see makes me feel more and more like I’m okay, too. Presentation is all dress ups, so why is it only acceptable for an afab enby to dress masc? It’s all drag either way.
Your eyes are gorgeous. Also that top is rad.
You look amazing! Your hair frames your face so well. 💕
Lovely! And what an awesome message
I honestly needed that. You look amazing!
aaaah I’ve been kinda stressed about this because I look so feminine, so I need these reminders 😣    
You look so pretty here! You remind me of [Misa Amane](https://www.ecosia.org/images?q=misa%20amane#id=828F035793521657A96EA831CBD1EEEA6AC04D7B) :3
Ok this is very random but for some reason it looks like you have tiny anime-style fangs and it's adorable
OMGGG UR SO CUTE IT LEGIT MADE ME CRYYY
These kinds of posts are empowering even tho I still don't feel ""enough""
I often fear in the back of my mind that people might think I'm invalid if I dress too feminine, and people who don't know my gender assuming I'm also faking if I dress too masculine while having a fem voice and acting cute... but those are really ridiculous thoughts.. I don't owe androgyny! I have to remind myself again and again. I can dress however I feel! Clothing doesn't have gender, anyway!
cheers to that one
Days where you feel at home in your body are precious and to be treasured, and they make you no less non-binary or genderqueer.
you look hot!!!
Excellent point!! Good for you being you 😁
Oh yes👌🌈
Heck yeah preach
hot person alert 👀👀
Wow!!
Holy crap slay baby
Cool :]
Thank you for the reminder, I needed it today <3 also you look great!
Love ❤
You look so good!!
Thank you🙏
❤️
*huggles cute friendo* Hai! :3
Thank you so much. I needed this because I present as feminine much of the time.
I know how you feel! But you know yourself best, you know who you are. That's what I tell myself at least haha.
Same I want one!
Thank you for posting this. I'm AFAB and definitely feel like I don't deserve the enby identity because I look low key femme most days. But dressing overtly femme or masc makes me feel like I'm in bad drag and makes me SUPER uncomfortable. But I don't necessarily want to look androgynous either. Definitely makes me feel not valid sometimes.
You are okay. I am okay. We are okay.

Presentation is not gender identity
This is me too!! I don't want to dress in button ups and boat shorts and have a really short cut, but I am not super drawn to some femme looks that feel loud. Like a like subtle balance and some days I just want to wear pants some days I want to wear a flowy dress other days I look at dresses and I know today I can't think about wearing them but they're just clothes yet who knows lol"	lxomp3	NonBinary	1814	1.0	2021-03-04 16:29:24

Ive never posted here before but I'm Kris my pronouns are they/them I'm a closeted enby I'm scared to tell my parents but anyways I'm kinda new to being nb I hope I can fit in:) I hope you all have lovely days		"Hey Kris, I suggest taking small steps in regards to outward expression, unless you feel you are in an unsafe environment to do so. Coming out to family is scary, and may not always be something that happens. (I disconnected from my entire family before coming out as trans)
It is ok to take your time. I hope this reddit community helps you feel validated every day, and maybe even help you gain the courage to come out.
hello! i love your look!!
you look fantastic my friend! i hope you too have a lovely day 💚
Hi Kris, that's a really cool hat!
*Awww*, I hope that *you* have a lovely day! You look great, and I hope to see you more on here. **🤗❤️**
Hi Kris! Welcome to the sub :)
Hey, Kris! First of all, I love your hat. I’m in a similar boat. My pronouns are she/they, and I also identify as a lesbian. I’ve already been told by my family that I can “try men later” so... I don’t really want to tell them that I identify outside of the binary. I’m here if you need a place to talk, and you’re 100% valid and definitely not alone! <3
Kris u absolute gem, welcome!
hi kris! welcome to the community, i hope you feel safe here
I love your hat Kris!!!
you'll fit in great!
you look great!!!
Wassup Kris, you look amazing
You’ll definitely fit in! This is a welcoming community, welcome!
Hi Kris! I’m Chris too! I’ve never posted either and I’m new to the whole thing also at 34 so you’re in good company! You look amazing! ✨
Nice hat
kris you are drop dead gorgeous, welcome to the sub!!!! dont be too worried about fitting in, cuz we all fit a little out around here, and thats what makes us so great
I’m new too! there are lots of awesome people on here
Hi Kris!
I’m Niimo. I’m also a closeted enby so I feel your pain. You are still valid though. 💜💜💜
Dude! Cute!
Welcome! 😊
you fit in just fine! we love u already:-)
Hi kris :)
Hiya nice to meet you! Hope you have a lovely day as well😁
hello kris!!! honestly im also scared to tell my parents
We are SO GLAD TO HAVE YOU HERE KRIS. Everyone is welcome in our community and I’m pretty sure you’ll fit in. And You look a little down so I made you this cake❤️🍰❤️. Have a good ass day
We love you!!!
hello! you look great!! you got this <33
Where, when, how, and to whom you come out is completely up to you.  Take your time, no pressure, and tons of love.  You. Look. Fabulous.
AAAAH HELLO! we are happy you are here and we will remind you that you are valid !!!
Love that look, dude. And I had a hard time coming out to my parents, too, but I worked up the courage and now they support me. I hope the same happens to you! Good luck :)
I get it’s scary telling family, but hopefully you got understanding parents! I know everyone here is accepting:)
hey Kris! LOVE the hat:) have a great day!!
Hey, welcome to the subreddit! I hope you feel safe and accepted here, and I’ll certainly do anything I can to help you feel that way. You can chat with me if you’d like!
Have a lovely day too!!
That hat is everything!!
I came out to my family and my mom tracked new down and harassed me.. then continued harassing me over text for days. She was transphobic af and just straight up abusive. I don’t say this to scare you, I say to let you know it’s ok if you don’t feel safe letting them in (I prefer that terminology rather than “coming out”). And if they don’t accept you, you have every right to not associate with them. I came out over a month ago to my parents, and my daughters 1 year bday is oct 3rd and My mother/ possibly my whole family won’t be there. That’s just the kind of shit we deal with. The stuff no one would ask for. You are who you are and I wish you so much luck and love and perseverance on your journey to letting the word in on who you really are. If you like check me out @stanelectra69, I’d love to chat more / follow your journey
I love how everyone on here is welcoming and supportive. I'm not NB myself but I'm trying to learn more so I can be a better friend to NBs :) And you are all quite incredible, it's great to see such support.   
Kris, you are brave to even open up to this community. Which also shows me you are further with accepting yourself, and perhaps even coming out, than you think.   
All the best to you!!
You pass so well kris!
We love you Kris! I hope your parents end up supporting you!
Kris is an absolutely lovely name, it suits you so well <3 sending good vibes your way Kris!
welcome!!
this is such a good picture omg, you look adorable and I love the boater hat. I feel you there, I’m still half closeted cause I’m just coming to terms with everything about my gender fluidity. I hope you have a fantastic day as well and feel comfortable enough to come out to ppl soon
You're so beautiful!! I hope you gain the courage to be yourself regardless of what outdated ideals your parents have 🖤🙏🏾 I know it's not easy but it's defo worth it!
I like your hat
Hey Kris!

Wishing you lovely days, too. Fitting in is always a concern, but I think you'll find this a super welcoming group.
I'm honestly not sure if they will be understanding I told them I'm bisexual but they think it's a phase including my brother thinks that too
Thank you so much!
Thank you! It's my dad's hat I always like stealing them from him this one is my fave tho
Thank you so much it took me so long to find a name that suited me until I thought of the name Kris! It's makes me happy when someone tells me how it suits me lol
Thank you I hope so too
Dang bro, that sucks, just keep being you though, it’s your decision, not your families
Of course!

Just recently switched from they/them to he/they pronouns, and it feels really good. Happy Sunday!		"Nice bronouns 👉👉
love this look! where did you get that shirt? 👀
Congratulations! Really considering changing mine but we'll see

Edit: I haven't commented for ages and apparently my flair said she/they demigirl. Wow I've come a long way in the last year!
Wish I looked like you
Wow, I'm so proud of you man!
Yayyyy congrats!!! Also this shirt is fantastic
Love your look!  Rolled up sleeves with Ray-Bans and the Kleins peeking out ;;)
Nice shirt
yo i did the same thing a few weeks ago! we can be pronoun buddies lmao
Lol my brain read that as hoy boy 

Which i guess could make sense still... either way hell ya on the new pronouns
Oh wow, you look so cool!
yooo congrats! You are super valid
Is that a typo? Did you mean you went from they/them to he/***him***?

If you do mean he/they, how does that work in a sentence?

*""He is my friend, therefore I lent they my playstation controller?""*
That ominous look on your face
Congrats my dude!! Considering doing the same someday
Mans is handsome as hell🥺🥺
Thank you!! I actually just made it this morning 😊
Hi! It's not a typo, I just put my preferred pronoun first. Instead of typing out he/him and they/them, I say he/they so that it's clear I'm okay with either sets of pronouns. Basically what I'm saying is that I'd prefer to be refered to as he/him, but if they/them is used, that is okay as well.
that’s awesome!!!
omg if u ever make any to sell I would 100% purchase one!! so cute!!

What do I do with this response to my email signature pronouns (she/they) from a company I reached out to as a freelancer?!		"So free thinking they want to ban a few words..
That categorically is NOT more free thinking. Giving unsolicited advice on something is a dick move. Judgement is clearly implied. Conclusion: What a wanker
Thank you so much for the supportive comments and advice, it really helps a lot 💜
It’s worth noting that this company’s most recent project they posted on LinkedIn is in support of Pride, with the slogan ‘My gender, my pride’ which really steams me even more and makes me feel like I should call them out. But then that probably won’t do my own career much good 🤷
Pragmatically - depends how badly you want to work with them. You could send a polite and professional rebuttal thanking them for their input but also saying that as a creator and professional you find it useful to set client's expectations up front. You give them a name, you give them your pronouns, you are clear about your abilities and price. It's a respectful and honest interaction to set the scene between you and someone you'll be working with.

Honestly - if you don't want or need to work with them tell them to fuck off. Pronouns are yours to set. If someone sees that and choses not only to ignore that but to shame you, then they're going to be godawful dicks to work with. Ghost 'em or tell them to get to fuck.

Bôn chance fellow nb. Strength.
Wtf is this nonsense. That is transphobia clear and simple. I am sorry that happened to you. If you can afford to pass on the work I would call them out on their transphobia and walk away.
It's simple politeness to respect pronouns. 

They are telling you that they will not be polite to you and will not show you respect.

A business relationship that is not based on respect is not going to end well.
""No judgement,"" they said, judgily. 

""We're free thinking,"" they said narrow-mindedly. 

Honestly, if this person represents the rest of their work environment, it sounds like a wonderful recipe for a pit of passive-aggressive interactions, unhelpful feedback, and general unpleasantness. Might not be worth it.

Or maybe it's just this guy being an asshole and the company is fine. Maybe it could end up being a [Daryl Davis (black guy who got 200+ Klan members to quit)](https://www.npr.org/2017/08/20/544861933/how-one-man-convinced-200-ku-klux-klan-members-to-give-up-their-robes) moment where you turn out to be a lovely and competent person to work with and they learn that the ability to respect others was in them the whole time.

Personally, my instinct would be to walk away and politely let them know why, but sometimes money/experience comes first--I know it can be tough to break in and at the beginning you sometimes have to work with people you don't like a ton. Personally, I'm 100% freelance and I don't hide my queerness, but my pronoun comfort is luckily pretty broad so they just assume when they meet me and I don't care enough to enlighten them unless they ask or our relationship ends up getting friendlier than ""I work for you and you send me money"".   


In most of my business interactions, my preferred pronouns are ""helpful nerd/only one who knows how this works"" and my clients' are ""request haver/money delivery system"" :D
Wow. Fuck them! That's just fucking stupid. Seriously. Hiding transphobia under the term ""free thinking"" is ridiculous.
Conversely at least it'll reflect badly on them when you talk about them in the small community now too!
i don’t think it’s unprofessional to say “due to the nature and tone of the last email interaction i will be passing on this opportunity” and nothing more.

now if you want to be petty i would give them a lesson on what a pronoun is like it’s 5th grade and that everyone uses them, not just the lgbt community. and how long singular they pronouns have been around and been used since almost ancient times.
If you wanted to be petty and didn't mind probably irreparably burning bridges, you could point out that they used 6 personal pronouns in that short paragraph. Which is a bit weird for someone who's ""not keen on the pronouns stuff""
Hey I know you’ve got a lot of comments about like how shitty this is, but it’s also very illegal, and you need to talk to a lawyer. 

It is illegal for an employer to discriminate against a job applicant because of his or her race, color, religion, sex (including gender identity, sexual orientation, and pregnancy), national origin, age (40 or older), disability or genetic information.

Like it’s so cut and dry.
The transphobia 😶😶😶

People r threaten by pronons like for real...
Ah yes, nothing like casual transphobia masked as advice.
I would respond politely, but assertively. Maybe something like this?

""In the interest of returning transparency, I do not need you to be 'keen' on my pronouns. I shared them in order to open dialogue so that it is easier for you to respect my identity within this working relationship. If you are unwilling to give this respect - to me or any other person - then I am not a good fit to work for your organisation.""

Sometimes taking the high-ground can be a 'fuck you' on its own count
Tell them

""Oh then I won't work with you and I'll let everyone I know, know that you don't have any respect for the LGBT. Thank you for your consideration but I've done just fine without your advice

Regards, blank""
Yikes. So they don’t want you to tie yourself down to pronouns? Because.. they.. think you are a transcendental being, or… Just, what??

 Sorry, I’ve wandered in here randomly, but had to comment because I cannot make any sense of what they’re trying to say, yet at the same time it feels yikes.

 I get that some people might subscribe to a “definitions are too much” point of view, but this… it honestly just sounds like someone who thinks they’re more enlightened than they really are.

 I agree that you don’t need to respond/rebuttal. Simple, “Thank you for the insight into your company’s outlook,” if you want to reply. Or just ignore it. They did say it’s just a side piece of advice, so, gives you the right to ignore it. If your field is small, definitely be smart and don’t burn bridges, even if you decide to go somewhere else. GL
“No judgement” my ass.
HA. That's a lot of words for ""This is a company for bigots and you don't want to work here.""
That sounds like a huge hostile work environment red flag to me. Because of course they ARE keen on pronouns. No doubt they USE pronouns for themselves. What they're saying is: they are happy to invalidate Trans and Non-Binary experiences under the cover of toxic politeness. Drawing you into a conversation about it where they can ""just ask questions"" is surely their next step. I wouldn't give into that. If the check is good, I'd just respond to anything having to do with work, and leave your pronouns right where they are, in your signature. If the check isn't worth it, I'd find a place that will embrace your talent and yourself.
""Just a friendly piece of advice, no judgement"" \*proceeds to be violently judgemental\*
Literally what are you ""prescribing""?!  This makes no sense.

I guess if you're replying to other content from the message, could you say something like ""personally I'm fine with others knowing how to refer to me but thanks for sharing your views so openly""???
This is so shitty, I'm so sorry you have to deal with this BS! Unfortunately as a freelancer you don't have any legal recourse (as far as I'm aware), however I would definitely communicate this to others in the community on the down low if possible. It's good for others to know what they're dealing with. If this company has an HR department, you may also want to forward the email to them if it feels okay for you.

In terms of a response, I would keep it professional but boundaried. Something like ""My pronouns are included in my email signature to ensure that they are respected in my work environment. As you have indicated that this would not be the case at (company), it's clear that our values do not align and we would not be a good fit. I would like to withdraw my expression of interest and wish you the best.""

You could also include a link to a page explaining the use of they/them pronouns if you want to be a little professional-spicy about it.

Hope you connect with much better people soon!
That isn’t friendly or advice…
Like, damn dude, your prejudice is showing, how embarrassing
Go r/maliciouscompliance !

“Thank you for letting me know. I’ve taken into account that You and your team do not use pronouns, and I will do my best to accommodate in the future. That said, I do not take advice from coworkers or clients as a general rule. 

Thanks!

OP”
I would say well I’m not really keen on working with a company that supports illegally discriminating against LGBT people and that from my POV that is backwards thinking not free thinking. I’d add that I’ll be letting other people know not to work with them.
Ahahaha free thinking...

I would respond that it's my preference, just as each of you has your preference. It's no skin off my back if your wildly deep free thinking that is incredibly cutting edge and completely different than the last 2,000 years of western tradition prevents you from respecting someone's preference. In fact, perhaps the way forward is for all of us to have no preferences at all and use the term 'they', instead of preferring these ""silly"" extra specific pronouns like he or fae or ze or she...

In my opinion what they really mean to say is ""we are smarter than the woke mob and will not respect anyone's requests for a more comfortable and inclusive work environment. We have already passed this email around and you will be stigmatized for even asking that we respect our employees identities, we prefer to enforce our subjective opinions based on looks and our assumptions of your genitals upon you. Feel free to take this job if you really need it but I can tell you already you ain't gonna fit in here with us.""

If you really need the work, I'd suck it up till you can find somewhere better. Jobs suck, co-workers suck, bosses suck. You just gotta keep moving and progressing till you find somewhere actually comfortable. But if you have other options I say fuck em.
""We're not keen on the pronouns stuff"" then why are you using the royal we? FUCKING LOL people are unreal.
Why the fuck would anyone put something like that in writing? Has no one learned to keep their thoughts like that to themselves? I am assuming that is a male responding to you. It has the cishet bite of a white guy with low T. (Maybe I should keep THAT to myself lol but fuck it - do as I say not as I do)
Red flag. Don't work for them unless you're like, super desperate. If they're this shitty about something as simple as pronouns, they probably don't treat their employees/freelancers well in general.
Run away as fast as you can.
So free thinking their brain fell from their heads, tell them to take a hike!
Pronouns are part of any language in this world, the only difference is now a few of us are deciding which one we would like to be addressed by. It's not rocket science. I swear transphobic people are mortified when someone misgenders a baby but when you wanna specify your pronouns they act like you just asked them to chop of their leg.
They’re “free thinking” but can’t be bothered to use the pronouns someone prefers and are annoyed by them? Are they also annoyed when they see “names” in signature blocks “I prefer to call you whatever comes to mind instead of using the name you provided me” smh.
they seem to do just fine repeatedly using pronouns in their response.
Kinda reads to me like they just opened themselves up for a discrimination lawsuit.

 No part of gender based discrimination is legal. And that includes discriminating against someone for the use of their correct pronouns.
If you are (more) free thinking then respect the wishes of others if it doesn’t restrict your rights. This is not f*****g rocket-science for heaven’s sake!!
Call them out! The person answering you is very likely spewing their own ignorance, instead of company policy, so either they'll get reprimanded, or the company will face some accountability
here's six lines of text judging you... no judgement.
A) Don't work for them.

B) Name and shame.
That discrimination bias and illegal, I'd report them. Their response was unprofessional and improper.

If they were uncomfortable they could have responded politely by say they aren't interested no thank you at this time and you could have moved on, but they instead when out of their way to say that? 

Nuh no, they need a lesson in professionalism.
Not worth taking the gig. They already made their intentions clear; it will be AWFUL working for them in any capacity and if it’s a creative job (writer/graphic designer) their brand voice and identity most likely does not align with your values. RUN.
Talk to a higher up.  If they don’t apologize promptly then Leave negative reviews on their Glassdoor explaining what transphobia is.
If they’re so free thinking that they don’t need pronouns do they never assume gender then? Wtf. People are so backwards. So sorry you had to encounter this.
Calling themselves more freethinking than you is a judgement; they’re just discriminatory. Clearer word than judgement, apparently. You are informing them on how you wish to be addressed via email and you say it in the email. That’s it.
HARD pass. That screams employer red flag to me.
You simply ignore it. They clearly aren’t the right company for you because:

1. they went out of their way to attack your email signature (petty and aggressive IMO)
2. they attempted to invalidate the way you identify yourself (BIG no-no IMO)
3. they’re either being shitty, completely dense, or are on some holier-than-thou bullshit

You’re biggest power move is to forget they exist and not dedicate another thought to them besides reviewing them somewhere so other potential workers know the red flags to watch out for.
you definitely shouldn't work with them. just send them another email that you're not interested anymore in a company that acts like this
Perhaps you could say something along the lines of “while I can certainly appreciate free thought, I prefer to put my pronouns in my signature due to the fact that the language with which people refer to me is a key factor in affirming my own gender; in addition to this, putting my own pronouns in my signature can help remove the stigma of using nontraditional pronouns or multiple pronouns and may make someone else feel more comfortable with their own identity, too”
And the gender binary isn’t prescriptive? Lmao. What a hypocrite…
I'd read it as ""I, the person responding to your email, feel uncomfortable with the concept of nonbinary genders"" and...do whatever you want to do with that information? I see nothing in this statement that suggests a willingness to listen, so if you want to argue I'd recommend having modest expectations and not investing too much time and energy into it. Sorry. If it makes you feel better, there's been a lot of social progress on the pronoun thing in the last decade and it's becoming mainstream for people to accept pronouns as part of an introduction along with names. This person, whoever they are, is on the wrong side of history.

The ""free thinking"" stuff is just noise. It doesn't *mean* anything. It's ""I don't want to think of myself as a bad person, so I'm going to frame my shitty decision in positive terms"".

On the bright side, I wouldn't automatically assume that the person who replied to you does in fact speak for the entire company, could easily just be one person going off. Sure doesn't sound like a piece of writing that got run past an HR person or committee or whatever at any point.
You probably dodged a bullet.
Start misgenderimg the person who sent the email as much as possible if you don't need the customer
I mean hot damn, I think that’s hella weird. If you want to be referred to by something then by their own logic they should accept that, it’s when you start trying to attach pronouns to other people that aren’t yourself where it becomes way to “prescriptive.” Nobody should be able to tell a nobody that they don’t “fit a pronouns” or that they can’t identify. There’s a lot of this over in my femboy community where people literally freak if anything besides a cis-feminine boy makes a post. It’s like, if they identify as Femboy then let them hollyjeesums
Expose them
“I will keep that in mind. 
Thanks!
(She/they)”
""FREE THINKING"" OH THE IRONY. Based on their tone, them saying ""friendly advice"" is insulting. They don't deserve you.
Lmao I had a similar thing with a Bumble match who, when I asked that he stop misgendering me as a woman & reminded him that my bio plainly said ""NB (they/them)"", he went on a tirade about how much he doesn't believe in labels & that it's small minded to box yourself in by using them.

I had to point out that he'd been 100% fine with gendered labels up until that point, just as long as they were female, and that he really only seemed to take issue with them when it involved an identity he found weird.

Of all the shit to go all ""ACTUALLY I DONT BELIEVE IN LABELS 😏"" about, you're gonna throw a fit over the  term that means ""*I find the gender binary limiting, so I refer to myself with this broad term that simply conveys the fact that I do not fit into our society's narrow, restrictive parameters of gender'""??

Like, if anything, you'd think they'd be on board with that!

But no, because it's not actually about ~labels~, it's about transphobes being assholes, as per uje
This to me is a big red flag. If it’s something they won’t make a big deal about it are bothered with, they literally won’t mention it. I hate that companies and businesses are trying to get by with the whole cover of being “more open than that” or “trying not to be political” (🙄). Why would it ever be bad to add pronouns? If you didn’t people would just assume and that’s what most of us are trying to avoid so their logic is so backwards
Everyone that says they're a ""free thinker"" just copies off of everyone else that also says they're a ""free thinker"".

It does not make you a sheep to put your pronouns. You are doing it a) to get gendered correctly, or b) to make it more normal so people who have to worry about getting gendered correctly can put theirs with less judgement. If you just put them because everyone else is putting them however that is still harmless. And also nobody is forcing anyone to put them. Personally even though I am cis(?) i don't feel comfortable putting my pronouns anywhere and nobody has given me shit for it. Like, as long as you respect others it's all good

> from your pov i can't really see what you have to gain...  

it looks like someone isn't capable of any thought much less free thought besides being contrarian and hateful for no reason

I genuinely want to call the person who sent you that a not nice word but i will not do that because i don't want to get banned👍
They’re “not keen on the pronouns stuff,” but used I, it, we, you, and your. 🤔
Dob them into HR
We're so ""free thinking"" that we can't possibly conceptualize using pronouns other than what you were assigned at birth, or having them respected by your colleagues 🙄
I think my first reaction is, can you comment/rate a company anonymously on Glassdoor? Maybe later, though, so they don't link the comment directly to you. They seem pretty negative and hypocritical to me. (i.e., one of those companies that only care about Pride month for good PR)
No judgment, but I'm judging you
Run away
""go fnuck yourself, I don't work with bigots in disguise.""
Man, I WISH this happened to me. Lemme go grab my Karen bob wig
We're free thinkers. We pick our own names and pronouns for you. Only sheep use the names they're told to call you.
Misgender him as a woman and I bet he’d suddenly care about pronouns 🙄
Red Flag, a bunch of bigots work there. Avoid the Christo-Fascists.
don’t be shy, what’s the company name…
>I really can't see what you have to gain by being so prescriptive, you won't gain anything from it but could lose out.

This is such a blatantly ignorant statement. They don't even realize how this reads as a threat to the lack of respect they have for trans and non binary folks.
""Im a free thinker because I only respect pronouns that uphold the status quo""
I suppose telling them to ""eat shit and die"" wouldn't be very professional, but it would be very satisfying
“Not keen on the pronouns stuff” but uses at least 7 on a quick glancing count… So… yeah, red flag. I’d want to know who just to not support them.
This is absolutely horrible I am so sorry they said this absolute bullshit to you. He's probably a single, balding incel of a man who pouts and throws tantrums when he can't pick up women
I'm thinking they like human rights commission complaints (depending where you're from this is pretty illegal and reveals discriminatory hiring/staffing practices)
So prescriptive. Gave them a second pronoun choice for yourself instead of the standard one. Sounds like you found a great way to filter out unsuitable work spaces.
I don’t think you need to work with them. Wish them a farewell
it's incredibly invalidating. they're saying that your experience is invalid just because they haven't experienced that disphoria themselves. stay strong ♥️
Take this as the major red flag that it is and don't work with them. It's just a round about way of saying they're very transphobic
Just a friendly piece of advice, Your company is piece of shit, NO JUDGEMENT THOUGH!! XD
Run.
You know, if all the assholes voluntarily walk around waving red flags, it isn't necessarily a bad thing. It makes it easier to avoid them. Just sayin'.

I mean, if this is in the US that company is probably doing something illegal under the Civil Rights Act (Bostock v. Clayton County go brrrr lol) at least until the Supreme Court gets around to eviscerating the Civil Rights Act (Justice Kavanaugh eats *stare decisis* for breakfast, and washes it down with copious amounts of beer). But that's probably not a fight you want to have. Just don't take that job. Your life will be more pleasant as a result.
“No benefits”

Well yeah except for feeling accepted, comfortable and not like being insulted every time someone uses a pronoun to refer to you.

No benefits at all. I completely agree, you should’ve just kept quiet about it and let everyone use what they assume.
My state’s employment discrimination laws forbid discrimination based on gender expression. Check your area’s laws and report them when you get turned down. Personally I’d also spread this info around as much as possible, including company name, but obviously don’t do anything that would jeopardize your livelihood. You could also report the job opening to linked in or other job boards where it’s listed, I did that with a job at an anti gay marriage org sent to me by linked in.
This is some of the weirdest sh*t I've ever read how tf r they gonna ban pronouns 😭
So vaguely threatening. And if they were really 'free thinkers' I'd think they would be more accepting of new ideas, like listing one's pronouns.
We'Re MOrE frEE tHInKiNg THaN tHAt
Dang, glad you dodged a bullet on that. Just be happy that you found out they're crap beforehand.
I would not work for that company under any circumstances. That may also be grounds to report them to the better business bureau or a similar organization.
...so that's definitely judgement.
I've received that kind of 'advice' before from colleagues when I do something out of the ordinary, like asking to work part time.

It's one of those weird things that doesn't make sense up front. It is judgemental, despite what they say. And they aren't open minded, despite what they say. And it's definitely not friendly.

I think it amounts to: ""please don't be weird around us. We don't like it.""
Thank you for all of the brilliant advice and support! This is what I’ve written back to them and I’m about to press send... is it too spicy? 😆

“Thank you for clarifying your company's stance on using a person's correct pronouns.

In the interest of returning transparency, my pronouns are included in my email signature to ensure that someone knows how to refer to me instead of always having to use my name. It is a growing practice to express one's pronouns in person or via email, so if you respond this way to each person who does so, you may be the one who loses out.

If you are interested in learning more on this topic, below is some reading material you may find beneficial:

Strategies for inclusion in the workplace

I would like to withdraw my expression of interest in working with your company, but I wish you all the best.

Regards,
Name (she/they)”
I can only tell you what I would do, which is ghost them and leave them negative reviews that highlight their commitment to bigotry and that reproduce the email. I am not known for making the most stress free and low conflict choices in this area though
I'd report them for harassment tbh
not give them any more of your time, what the fuck is this response
No judgement? That's like gay lovers saying ""no homo my love"" as they pound each other. 

Depends on your state laws but that is considered discrimination and you can sue over it. Woot!
r/antiwork would probably come up with some rlly good responses, this is bordering on a discriminatory tone and a big red flag
Respond to them with the wrong pronoun for them, bc you're free thinking
With a response like that, you aren't missing out on anything they had to offer.

Never sacrifice who you are for people like this.
I think you should go to this persons boss and show them this email. If the company doesn’t do anything about it. Then I say maybe even just start blasting them on the internet. Go to that post on LinkedIn and comment underneath it that they have people that are transphobic working there and didn’t anything about it.
Free thinking- by judging what someone needs to live? And feel accepted? 

Honestly I'd ignore it, or send a snarky email when I've stayed up too late and I'm mad about it. 

That's shitty. Your gender presentation has nothing to do with your quality of work.
Assholes.
Start misgendering them, since they’re free thinking I’m sure it won’t bother them!
I'd disregard it entirely tbh. Umless you asked them how they felt abt pronouns which... kinda doubt. 

Maybe reach out to a higher up to confirm if this is a company wide stance or if this person was just talking outta their ass if you want.
Tell them to shove it 🥰 your pronouns are valid and if this company isn’t on the side of progression, your talents are better served elsewhere 🥰
What... Does That Even Mean? Like It Feels Like That Response Is Rude, But At The Same Time I Can Hardly Understand A Word Of It.
HOWhowHOW did anyone think ending this immature, embarrassing VERY JUDGY note with “no judgement” is even close to being in the realm of logic?! And calling it “friendly” ??!!?!? ON OUR DAMN INTERNATIONAL DAY OF RECOGNITION???
Whewwww sorry this isn’t helpful but damn I’m so mad on yr behalf!!
I never get how people say ""we are freethinking freedom free free folks. So you aren't allowed to be who you are bc I'm such an out of the box thinker""
Sounds like they’re not very “free thinking” if they feel threatened by someone putting their pronouns in their signature. I’m open about mine (they/them) and have never been criticized for including them in my signature. It’s in any company’s best interest to support people who share their pronouns. The ones who don’t are simply not culturally or socially competent. What we gain is the peace of mind to occupy space in whatever way we feel inclined. I don’t feel like you would lose out on any opportunity worth your time by sharing your pronouns. Their comments come across as transphobic to me; I would look for another company to work with if possible.
Do not work for them.
I always find it so funny when people say things like “not keen on the pronoun stuff”. Pronouns are a very important part of language and pronouns aren’t just limed to she, her, he, him, they, and them. You likely use them everyday without even realizing it. In fact, I just used a pronoun in the prior sentence.
That just makes no sense. Are they suggesting that they’re so ‘free thinking’ that their stance on ‘the pronoun stuff’ is that everyone should use any/all pronouns? Also, hmm, I can think of something to lose by not specifying your pronouns: getting misgendered. This comment is so annoying to me!
I'm really surprised that most people aren't commenting on the legality of this. That seems to be the email in which they denied you the job, in which case they are blatantly stating that they're refusing to hire you because of your gender. I'd recommend that you start looking for a lawyer
I would send a fucking ROAST lol.

Like, with everything in this thread.

You’re trying to ban someone else’s gender from your company you twit!
You dodged a bullet. If I were you I wouldn't work with that company and I would warn others in your field that they are not a trans friendly company.
If this person is not HR pass this on to HR. This is a potential law suit for that company.
""no judgement"" seems pretty judging.
“No judgment” - proceeds to judge you hahahah. Take it as a blessing in disguise, they don’t sound like a company you would want to work for anyway
Yo that the fuck I would go HAM on a motorcycle. What a 0assive way of being like.... I'm judging u for being NB
""I support free thinking""

""I don't like that you have a different perspective""
Write them back using no pronouns in your writing then
Completely unprofessional and definitely a red flag. You’re better off without this company. I’m pretty sure that could be considered illegal in some territories due to discrimination.
""Sorry, I have reconsidered my offer. I dont need *your* money.""
“Not keen on the pronoun stuff” - oh so like you don’t use them at all ever, good to know…I will only refer to people by names.
I feel like this could be discrimination
Talk to the company through there complains/hr,press whatever and tell them if they don’t do anything you will let people know you will name and shame the company.
This made me so mad, no advice just hope things get better
Hold up…they’re so freethinking they restrict entirely unoffense language because it’s new to them?

But for real, as a freelancer don’t fall into the trap of seeing clients as jobs. Your job is your freelancing and they’re just a single customer. Good for mentioning the pronouns but don’t be scared to reinforce it in the future.

For this specifically I’d reply and let them know professionally that respecting your pronouns is a necessity not a request. Also, maybe consider adding a contract clause to allow you to separate from transphobic or abusive clients.
I'd call them a few choice words but rhats cuz i got an attitude lol
That’s when you grab those suckers, shoot them an email back, and say, “I hope you learn how dickish it is to turn someone down just because they’ve got preferences. Good luck finding someone new! <3”

Leave it at that, usually gets them thinking
""Just a friendly piece of advice"" is probably *the* biggest passive aggressive phrase in the known world. Like, just come out and say your a POS and at least be honest about it.

But no, let's mask it with faux consideration and caring for another. Nevermind that you have the absolutely right to be addressed in a way that's both respectful *to* you and representatively *of* you. I understand that this can be challenging for even the most noble-minded of people -- hell, even for myself. I grew up in a household that was very ""Yes, ma'am. No, sir,"" and even to this day I find myself slipping up. 40 years is a horrible habit streak to break, but I always apologize if I goof up and correct myself. What this person wrote to you, however, was just plain disrespectful.
What a fucking asshole
“nO jUdGeMeNt”
""No judgment"" after being very judgmental about simple pronouns. NEXT!
Hard to parse if this is one bad apple who thought their opinion was worth sharing or if this is someone genuinely speaking for their company's views. If it's the former, it's not a great sign that they'd let one of their employees in charge of fielding freelancers speak so off the cuff and create unnecessary friction. If it's the latter, then the company is satisfied with taking money from queer people while dispensing unwarranted ""advice"" like this to actual queer people.  In light of that uncertainty, I'd side with others here and say don't work with them unless it's absolutely necessary. That all being said, I can understand needing to work with displeasing clients to make ends meet as a freelancer. I've worked as a freelance writer and if I turned down every soul-crushing project thrown my way, I'd have never made rent.

Also, on a different note, who freaking asked for this person's opinion? ""Not keen on pronouns?"" This yokel must have a great time referring to everyone solely by their given name. The way they say ""could lose out"" sounds like a threat, too, even if you did choose to work with them. It reads as ""knock off the queer stuff or we'll give you less preferential treatment."" Another reason to steer clear if you can at all avoid it. And let others in your work community know, too.
“We’re more free thinking than that” fuck right off forever dude, this made me see red
I would post this everywhere with the name of the company attatched
Is this Tesla or a space X?
If there is more to share, go public!
Okay, just playing devil's advocate for a moment: When are you going to be around to here someone refer to you in the third person? I say let it go. People with Latin accents mispronounce my name all the time, but it would drive me nuts to spend my day correcting all of my coworkers and neighbors. Plus, I'd just come off as an uptight b*tch.
Throw it into the trash where it belongs and move on.

It's not worth your time to respond, and if that's how they react to pronouns, I can tell you they're probably not a great client to work for either.
This is so gross. Don't let it make you second guess yourself. the only positive thing out of it is that they've saved you the trouble dealing with their foulness early on. 
I'd wanna tell them to fuck off too. Or at least send something very passively aggressive back. Like ""thanks so much but actually you don't need to pass it on because I wouldn't want to put my name or pronouns to any work for your company, I'm more free thinking than that. No judgement tho.""
Sorry you had to receive that. 
Happy nonbinary person's day from one to another. 💜
""We are on such a galaxy-brain level of free thinking, that we restrict ourselves to only two genders."". Asshats. I'm sorry you have to go through this, OP
They don't want you to be ""so prescriptive,"" which means they reserve the right to misgender you, guilt-free.
Whoever wrote this email watches Jordan Peterson. I can almost guarantee it.
Tell them that you are no longer interested in their services, whatever they might be, due to their bigotry.
Send it back with all the pronouns they used in that message highlighted
I would ask if they’re okay??? It’s just your pronouns????
Stop working with them. They just told you they are transphobic and won’t respect you
Trash it and move on. They’re clearly not worth your time.
dont respond. if their transparency is subtle transphobia by not acknowledging your pronouns, you dont want to work with them. 

i mean, unless you *really* need that specific job
YIKES
you put it in the trash and stop looking at this company
""we're more free-thinking than that""?? 

what?! did they mean more ""backward-thinking""

pass up this ""opportunity"" not worth it.
I would respond the same as for when one's name is seen as a problem (due to racism usually or, for me - a 2 letter name that many forms don't accept) but like, with a stronger response cause transphobia has quite the worse history than antiname stuff, if I had to keep in contact I would probably lash out and disrespect their (within an example) name, beliefs, body issues etc - many things are self determined and are not empirical like height so my best shot is to hope the hypocrisy isn't too high that showing them that they care as well about self identified traits would grant an apology otherwise they are basically a goner mutual respect wise.
They’re libertarian
Wow the 'no judgement' after a message of solely judging you lol.
not work there.
So I guess freethinking in their view basically means they have the right to misgender people? It isn’t prescriptive to ask for basic respect. Whoever this is sounds like a complete asshole and I would avoid working with them if possible.
""At our company we believe that people shouldn't chose their own pronouns because we value everyone's opinions especially if they are opinions about people they have never met""
What does this even mean. Maybe too many margs on my part but this guy clearly is missing the point
Ew. I’d just respond like you don’t understand. Like respond then be like wait “what do you mean about the pronoun stuff?” I feel like usually when people say gross stuff like this and you pretend to not get it, and they need to explain the joke, or whatever point they’re trying to make it just sounds stupid and SOMETIMES they’ll realize as they’re trying and just be like never mind. 

I’m trans masc nb and use they pronouns and whenever I work somewhere new (freelance) I wish I was binary bc that’s just so much easier for other people. But that’s the thing, don’t compromise yourself for the sake of other people
It means that this company wants to be able to communicate freely, and not have to worry being bogged down with micro-details. Mistakes happen, communication gets hindered with   
 minor corrections, people on both sides take offense to the other party and lose focus of the task.  For instance, in the USAF i emailed a ""TSgt Ashley McSomething"" and while i was within regulation to greet with ""ma'am"" they spent an entire email chain correcting me and arguing that i should have just said ""sergeant"", and focus was lost on the issue the email was regarding in the first place. So...6 emails and a phone call later, we got back on track.
they're making absolutely no sense are are probably high and/or on drugs.
""I admire your flexibility! In that case, i'll be using (whichever neopronouns you think they'll hate the most)  for you since I've been meaning to practice those.""
nobody:

me: heheh

# Transparent

&#x200B;

also me: heheh

# no judgements

hehehehehehehehheehjeheheh
this kind of thing is ilegal in the us, so sue them for... eh whatever you got
Right?! I can’t think what he could possibly mean by that. It’s absurd and nonsensical.
They see themselves as ""not being influenced by leftist propaganda"" and therefore free thinkers 100%
My brain made a record-scratch sound when I read it. I had to reread it twice to make sure I actually saw what I thought I did.
Sometimes you just want to scream ""Make it make sense!""
Inigo Montoya popped right into my head when I read that line.

  
""Thinking...you keep using this word. I do not think it means what you think it means.""
You could try asking them to explain more clearly. ""I'm not sure I understand, particularly in light of your company's stated support for transgender individuals: could you say more?""
Wait, what the fuck? They literally claim public support of the queer community and *specifically* gender non-conforming individuals, and then they pull this? That's bananas. Honestly I don't mind rainbow capitalism that much but this is straight-up exploiting the rainbow to score marketing points and then doing literally the exact opposite in their actual day-to-day. 

That's like telling everyone you recycle conscientiously when in fact you dispose of your plastics by wrapping them around the neck of the nearest sea turtle. Nobody asked them to support queer folks, but they made the extra effort to display their support anyway. Then this person makes the absolutely unnecessary decision to spend extra effort on being an asshole about something they could literally have just not mentioned. 

If the company is big enough and it seems like some of them might actually stand behind their marketing, it honestly might be worth finding someone higher up and seeing what they have to say about this situation. This seems like PR they wouldn't want.
If you’re willing, I’d post a screenshot of this email and a screenshot of their LinkedIn post, and tag them in it on LinkedIn.
In that case I think it’s even more important that you share in the queer community (as far as you feel able) what they’ve said to you. They can’t be allowed to so easily get away with that double standard!
What the actual?! Their email to you is SO tone deaf. Their apparent attempt at being hip is manifesting as physical pain in my body. Yeah…… I agree with u/thonStoan’s reply. You don’t wanna get into a disagreement them, but this hypocritical BS needs to be called out. Absolute wankery and very disrespectful.
This makes me think maybe the hiring personell are putting in criteria that management/HR would not be happy about...
They should be named and shamed so that others in the industry know exactly where they stand, in my opinion. Especially since they are making a money grab towards our community while clearly being bigots. But you should think about your own career and well being first. It's ok if you're not comfortable calling them out at this time. It can be difficult to find a way to respectfully and publicly do so.
What's the company? I want to be sure I stay well from those douche-canoes
The person who made that social media post is probably less transphobic than the person who emailed you about the job. I'm sorry you ran into this prejudice.
Tell them that “my” is a pronoun
Sounds like something you need to name and shame on, then, for the safety of the community
I would link that and ask if it’s evidence against them being “free-thinking.” This is too embarassing on their end for them to ever seriously be able to put you on blast.
Its possible this is just whoever responded to you and *not* actually the company policy. Id ask hr and provide the email sent to you
wow i would absolutely publicize this email in light of that. obviously only do that if it doesn't put you in immediate danger but it would be really good for people to know this
For real? I understand your fear for your career but someone should really share that information publicly, it’s insane!!!
Personally, I’d want to call them out publicly so that others know the pride thing is just for show. It’s a front to attract the very people they will turn away out of prejudice. 

… but also, I’m at my wits end with the “my freedoms say you aren’t entitled to yours” crowd and petty about it lol
I don't know if this is an option, but if possible I would just tell them that you won't with with them. Perhaps echo some of their own unprofessional language just to rub their noses in their own bullshit.
Thank you so much for this response. It’s really helpful! I DID want to work for them, but definitely not now. My partner is suggesting I simply never ever respond instead of getting into it with them, which is hard because I really really wanna tell them to fuck off, or at least lose my CV, but then it’s a small community here so it could end up reflecting badly on me if they were to mention me to others. I’m just mostly in shock tbh!
Thank you. I’m so disheartened because I’ve only recently gone freelance and this was the first response to a tonne of emails I sent out! It makes me second guess my approach and including pronouns in my signature, which sucks. But it helps to be supported here by yous, thank you!
At first I thought you said “it’s simply pointless to respect pronouns” i was in shock LOL
I feel like people see politeness as optional. It's simple respect to use pronouns!
Yassssss!!
Exactly what I was thinking
Except he didn't say they wouldn't hire OP because of the pronouns. He basically said ""you can work with us but we won't use your pronouns."" He didn't say they wouldn't get the job because of their pronouns. It's shitty to misgender someone intentionally, but it's not illegal. Bigots thrive in the benefit of the doubt. They word things like this to make *you* back out so they don't have to turn you down, thus they never have to get in trouble for discrimination. They can claim ""Oh, we would've hired her but she decided not to pursue the project after all."" 

This message by itself is not enough to go to a lawyer with, so OP, don't spend any of your tight freelancer budget on that now. BUT if you want to press it, reply and ask him to clarify what he means by his last message, especially when the company outwardly implies that they are cool with nonstandard genders. Coax his true meaning into more blatant language, until he admits that your gender would exclude you from the job. THEN go to the lawyer. Or at the very least, you can contact someone above him in the company and ask if this is really what the company stands for. They might be horrified.

But you're also totally within your right to politely and professionally turn down the project and walk away.
‘You’ is a pronoun.
The only appropriate response would be to use a different name and pronoun for them each time, in a very messed up way, so it gets so unbearable that they will have to put a stop to it and impose respect
I have said that to someone and someone else pointed me that misgendering someone is never ok. I don’t know how I feel about it, because the violence of the oppressor is not the same as the violence of the oppressed as response, but an eye for an eye and we will all be blind. So food for thought
Also like... discussions must be really obnoxious there if they dont use pronouns. Id hate to repeat peoples names every consecutive time i need to reference them.
Agreed! Just send them a link to this thread.
[NEXT JOKE ORIGIN](https://www.reddit.com/r/ChoosingBeggars/comments/7kr5as/i_need_a_free_100mile_bus_trip_for_20_people_and/)
You’d probably get sued then 😕
Both are actually pretty open, unlike what you might think
And I just can’t get over their “advice”. I had to read a few times trying to make sense of it. If you want to be petty I’d say something about seeing their flag and being really excited then seeing that email and pointing out it’s the exact antithesis of how they’re promoting themselves. I’d think best cast scenario is just whoever is writing these emails is old and clueless with good intentions but… I’d at the very least deny the offer and say because you’re confused, thinking you wouldn’t be discriminated against with their “policy” but your first or one of your first interactions proved to be the opposite. 

Even if the person writing that misunderstood….. they didn’t. If they have a policy about gender written somewhere it’s part of their job to educate themselves and follow policy. Like bring this to the higher ups. Not sure where you are but if this email got out where I live (nyc) it wouldn’t hurt your reputation as much as theirs. Like the least they can do is pretend to be accepting. At this point, if anyone doesn’t “understand” it’s because they’re ignorant and don’t want to
""Based on your comments, our values do not align and have reconsidered working with your company. I wish you all the best.""
I think it means ""we allow bigotry""
Please send this to HR if there is one, and BOLI if you are in the states. This is discrimination and it's illegal
>absurd and nonsensical

*don't sing it don't sing it don't sin-* FANTASTICAL AND DAFT, ALL THAT IS LEFT TO DO IS SIT RIGHT DOWN AND LAUGH
Based on your pronouns, you suck and you're fucking fired \*gets blowtorch\*
This. And it's pure bullshit. They are so free thinking that they want to tell parents what to do with their trans kids, women what to do after they have sex, and half of them still want to re elect Orange Guy. The other half want the dickhead that takes on Disney.

Christ Jesus when the Democrats look this good something is terribly, terribly wrong.

(USA biased post; realized after I typed it. Fuck it.)
Ironically the right is significantly far more brainwashing then the left.
I wish I could afford awards for this.
similar to this u/notlorraine you could also send a message to their HR about it. They might not care about losing you in particular, but they may care about the risk of alienating other partners for similar behavior.
I love this reply.
Yes! Goading bigots into being more blatant about it so you can later have proof of just how they really think next time they try to claim they're queer friendly.
100% agree. Unfortunately this came straight from the Managing Director so nobody higher up. Obviously an older gentlemen, from checking LinkedIn.
>That's like telling everyone you recycle conscientiously when in fact you dispose of your plastics by wrapping them around the neck of the nearest sea turtle.


Off topic, but this cracked me up
I agree. Destroy them! I mean at least call them out.
yeah, i would want to lash out too, but here it may be best to quietly hate them from afar. but also i tell everyone in your field that you meet about these assholes maybe that will cost them down the line?
""Thank you for clarifying your stance on this issue. Your choice to reframe a simple gesture of respect (using someone's correct pronouns) as somehow antithetical to ""free thinking"" has made it clear that our values are not in alignment. In light of that, I retract any bid or offer to work with your organization, now or in the future.""

Polite, professional, but very definite.
“Thank you very much for your response and your advice. Since my name *and* my pronouns, being part of me, are important to me, I would kindly pass this opportunity and wish you and your company all the best for the future.

Kindly

<my name>, <pronouns>
“
Respond politely and point out they’re actually being really closed minded by rejecting how other people choose to present themselves.
Never responding can also be seen as unprofessional and get around in a small community. It might be best to send a respectful, professional response simply stating that it has become apparent to you that your values and expectations do not align with theirs and it would be best to end the working relationship. This would, however, also likely mean you have no chance of working with them in the future. If you’d like to leave it more open-ended then just decline this one job.
Yeah, this is clearly a person who does not want to learn, and trying to educate them would be a waste of your time and mental/emotional labor.
Ghosting is unprofessional (IMO), as is lashing out. Of course, it makes sense why you would want to do it, but it could hurt you professionally. I wouldn't try to argue or educate them. I would just say, ""I've decided that we would not be a good fit."" Yes, they could still find a way to be offended by that, but you are being completely honest while not kissing their asses.
Tell them their response is actually very closed-minded, using someone's correct pronouns are a matter of respect, and that the conversation has entirely turned you off of applying. And then block their email because unfortunately their response will be disgusting.
Hey I know you’ve got a lot of comments about like how shitty this is, but it’s also very illegal, and you need to talk to a lawyer. 

It is illegal for an employer to discriminate against a job applicant because of his or her race, color, religion, sex (including gender identity, sexual orientation, and pregnancy), national origin, age (40 or older), disability or genetic information.

Like it’s so cut and dry.
I would just not respond, or, instead of trying to correct them I would simply just say that their response has vastly changed your opinion of them and you no longer wish to be considered for any work.
Definitely keep your pronouns in your email. It’s no reflection on you as a person or as a professional. If anyone has a problem, it reflects badly on them.
I mean...a lot of people *are* transphobic (not necessarily that they go out of their way to be transphobic, but also that they won't make an effort to be trans friendly) and most of them are going to be much quieter about it than this. It's a bit like having a Chinese name or something and having to decide whether to go by a different name professionally or not, it's not *right* but it is often pragmatic. (This doesn't mean progress is impossible or whatever -- often being out socially outside of work is ""safer"", and the more people get used to this sort of thing outside of work the more it's going to become not that big a deal professionally.) So, it comes down to how important it is for you that people use the right pronouns for you in professional contexts and/or how much you're willing to take some degree of professional hit to normalize being openly trans at work. There is also the intermediate position of not *introducing* yourself as trans but bringing it up with people you know professionally once you've had some time to make a connection.  


The main advantage of being upfront with pronouns (besides helping normalize it) is that if it's completely a dealbreaker for you to work with people who aren't good on trans stuff, being up front about your pronouns is going to weed out most people you don't want to work with. Likewise if your appearance is such that people who are going to be weird about trans people aren't going to work with you based on how you look, better to know sooner than later. For some people it's worth putting prounouns out there right away, for others it isn't. If you happen to know other trans/nonbinary people who have a similar work situation to you (same field, also freelancers, in your area, or all three) you can get a better sense from them of how many potential clients you're likely to lose by being upfront with pronouns.

Personally, I'm bigender and use she/he pronouns, but I *look* like a somewhat gender non-conforming cis woman and I generally don't come out to people I don't know well, and definitely wouldn't professionally unless I absolutely had to. But that's also coming from a position of, you know, it doesn't feel *bad* to me when people assume I'm a cis woman or use female terms for me. If I couldn't stand being talked about as though I was my birth gender, I'd probably make different decisions.

It's OK to, you know, do what works for you professionally even if it isn't maximally authentic. You don't owe it to the trans/nonbinary community. This is a situation where it's ok to put what's best for you *first*, and what's most authentic or most progressive for the wider community *later*. Your financial security matters.  


Of course if you know other freelancers (nonbinary or otherwise) that might seek work with this company it is 100% reasonable to let them know about this. I would recommend anonymously/privately rather than publicly under your name -- you *can* slam businesses for bigotry on social media, but you can't do it very often without ruining your own reputation, so you really want to pick your battles and if you're new to freelancing you probably don't have a good sense of which battles are worth it yet. And again, I think this is probably just one person's reaction and the company as a whole might not be like that.
he(i’m assuming a he) responded to put you down, that was what he wanted to do. he could have sat on it or ignored you but he reached out to cause harm
Don’t take them out! They’re part of who you are and if someone doesn’t want to hire you based on the fact you have them in your email signature is doing you a favor. 

For a few months now I’ve been working at a place where my cis boss still has pronouns in her signature, and there’s even pronoun buttons you can put on your ID card. 

My pronouns are they/them and I’ll still get misgendered every now and then. At the end of the day all pronouns are fine with me, but I know ‘they’ best suits me. 

It’s probably bc I’ve had top surgery and been on low dose hormones and the fact that while I’m getting misgendered it’s still the better binary option for me. Working in freelance, it’s been generally pretty hard to get people to use they pronouns since I’m constantly working with new people. 

I’m starting to ramble but basically my point is that even with this job that is actively asking for pronouns, putting them on everyone’s ID, at the end of the day the people who are transphobic will be transphobic and most likely not realize (or don’t care) no matter what company policy is.

I know for me, I need to start being harsher and correcting people when they don’t use “they/them” because I’ll always give them a pass, especially if they’re older than me, because it’s something I had to learn too. 

The key is WANTING to understand. This email show me they just want to give the impression they do
But you understand your mistake now, right?
Oh god it’s freaking me out more people didn’t give op this advice like I scrolled to the bottom and didn’t see it.
True. I guess you’d have to go with their first names and nameself.
I’d never personally misgender someone (on purpose). Just pointing out the hypocrisy of the emailer.
Why would they sue over a friendly piece of advice? If they say something like this they shouldn't be scared to have it shared around
Well that is something.  I love engineering and rocketry and space exploration.  It's really disappointing that Elon is at the head of it right now.
THIS reply right here. 

While I need work, I don’t want to work for a company that doesn’t value who I am. I’m not working for a company that is gonna devalue me over something so very simple. 

Amazing how 2 words can cause people to out their beliefs so quickly.
I think this is the best course of action, honestly. This is a good time to quickly and professionally part ways. You are lucky to find out the client culture before entering into a contract. You'll find the path forward that sits well with you, and hits the right balance. There's great advice and language in this thread. I'd want to burn this dude's reputation down, but I also have a strong self-preservation instinct, and there is a middle ground to be found between rampage and grace.

That said, their response is out of touch with current professional norms, and maybe this is just one person who is out of touch with their own company's norms, or maybe it's the whole company (other than their social media manager), but that's not your fish to fry. 

My boomer father recently asked about pronouns in signatures, not understanding why anyone would need to specify ""he/him/his"", and we had a great discussion about allyship and normalizing the option of including pronouns and how it will signal to trans/non-conforming community to know they are in safe space with that person. It took a while, but he got that it's really just become a professional norm that is optional, not compulsory, and overall a neutral gesture. It's just a new concept, and in my experience, it's the close-minded and intolerant who infuse it with controversy. 

The rest of us just want to know how you'd like to be addressed, please.
Or “we endorse and promote bigotry”
Grandstanding  
Obstruction  
Projection <—
Please save your money and considering donating to a charity instead, reddit doesn't need your money
It's literally true too! My absolutely most benevolent reading of it is that they completely misunderstand what listing pronouns means and think the OP only wants to work with folks who use she and/or they?? It'd be bizarre but at least fits with ""you're limiting yourself"" and ""we're more free-thinking than that."" Otherwise, uh... they hate trans women/transfemme people and assume the OP is one, and wish to retain the ""right"" to call them he/him?
Managing directors can and are fired, especially when they don't follow the company's goals
Ah, then your only recourse would be going public, but totally understand if that's not something you want to deal with! Sorry this happened to you <3
Name and shame!
I would go to HR anyway, and if they blow you off (don't take any calls from them, make sure they do it in writing) then go public with it.
Haha I feel like similes hit harder when they're at least a little clever so I try to maintain the presence of mind to make good ones even when I'm pissed off :D
Yeah, you don’t even really need to say much if anything while make the post. Just point out some very blatant discrepancies in their public posting versus their actual actions.
THIS 

 🙌
I’m not sure in this particular case never responding is bad. How does that get around “yeah, they had pronouns in their signature and I called them out on it and they never responded”. Anyone who is going to bring up that story, was going to regardless. Especially if they were upfront enough to put it in writing.
If this were a job application, then yes, but I got the impression from the OP that they're an independent contractor, and that relationship doesn't generally benefit from the same protections as an employment relationship. It might still violate antidiscrimination statutes, but it wouldn't be under EEOC employment protections.
Thank you 🏳️‍🌈
This is a really thoughtful response, thank you so much ✌️
Yes, i only though that for a second
It was genuinely stressing me out that no one was mentioning the company is straight up breaking the law. We have to remember our rights in times like this, or else we’ll just keep getting trampled on.
What they wrote doesn't actually make grammatical sense. They were trying to avoid saying this explicitly.
Someone else mentioned if you are in the US yes this is illegal, company has the obligation to keep customers, all employees, management, guests, literally anyone that may interact with anyone from the company (delivery people, HVAC person, 3rd party cleaning crew, lawn care specialists) free from harassment and discrimination, which they certainly did not. 

Now I'm no lawyer, but there are plenty of labor lawyers who work on contingency that would see this loss of income based on company being discriminatory and recognize that it's illegal 🤷‍♀️🤷‍♀️🤷‍♀️
You're projecting that we are projecting. Brain washing is a very specific thing, often done in religious communities. Education isn't brain washing. Explaining how other people think and experience the world isn't brain washing. 

Telling a child 2+2=4 isn't brain washing. And I know it's popular thing for the right to claim it is. 

They even go so far as claiming they want to tech real history by leaving out the majority of what actually happened in history. What do they mean by real history? Sounds like they prefer the brain washed version they where taught.
I only think it could be bad in the sense that if someone talked to this company about working with you they could say you ghosted them. I wouldn’t hire someone who suddenly stopped responding.
Well it does appear you’re right on that, but that doesn’t make it right. That just seems like a loophole for discrimination. I would also still talk to a lawyer.
OTOH protect yourself and be safe. Sometimes it's safer to be closeted and financially succeed than it is to stand up for each other by sticking to our pronouns. If it ever means a risk of not paying rent or a mortgage... Just protect yourself and make a decision based on what you can afford to do and how important it is to you.

The world fucking sucks. I work remote with a bunch of people in a red state and it's already almost too much that I paint my nails. You do you, but personally I can't afford to cause enough drama to lose my job and I'd rather be closeted at work at the moment just for financial safety. If I could be me it would be wonderful but the world doesn't accept us yet and I'm not ready to face that challenge at work. In laws are enough for now.

Wish you the best ❤️
Then why post about it and possibly confuse others?
The sad thing is it’s pretty disincentivized to fight for so- not to be a Debbie downer but taking legal action in this case wouldn’t be worth it 😞
I’m with you. It’s infuriating what the right wing has managed to destroy here in America. I live in Texas, so I see it firsthand.
In this scenario you also aren’t hiring someone because of pronouns. It’s also not “suddenly” barred on the message that was sent
Oh I'm not saying it's right. It's fuckt and the company deserves to be publicly shamed to hell and back for it. Just saying that this wouldn't be covered under that specific statute. I'm in HR so I have the habit of responding to things like that, sorry.
? I thought i made it clear that I thought you said that, not that you did say that? Nothing confusing about that, I just thought it was a silly mistake made by me lol
Eh, it really depends on each specific case. I'm currently suing a former employer, I'll only pay the lawyer if we win. A friend of mine is also suing their former employer for similar  reasons. There's no reason not to at least try. 

Further, even if you don't sue, you can file a complaint with the EEOC. Even if nothing comes of it, that will help provide documentation for the next person that sues them. Help demonstrate a history of discrimination ya know?
Lol sorry, I went on defense cause I hear so many right wingers accuse us of projecting. Like some sort of Escher fractal of insanity.
Right, but that’s now necessarily how it gets presented by the other party.

“Hey, have you ever worked with X, Y, or Z?”

“No, but we were in communications with X, until they ghosted us.”

Remember that in small communities when it comes to hiring and references, it’s not so much ‘Your word vs theirs’ as much as ‘Their perception of the truth’.
Aye no problem thanks for the education. I’m just more upset that it doesn’t. I’m just upset it doesn’t.
Ye ofc ofc I didn’t realize the reporting part n I feel silly for it LOL ty ❤️
You’re good!
But it wasn’t “Until they ghosted us”. It was “we were in communication with X until we told them we weren’t internet because they had pronouns in their signature block”. Or more than likely “No”, or slightly more likely “no, we considered them but ended up going with someone else for various reasons”. 

They’re likely not going to admit it was due to the pronouns (although they might because they were stupid enough to put it in writing). But they’re also the ones who ended communication. It’s not like they said “if you get rid of this pronoun business, we’ll consider you.”

They straight up said “I’ll pass”. They ended the convo

Edit: and if we’re being really honest, a company like this might bad mouth you anyway if someone asks about you, because they don’t like you on principle.
You’ve misunderstood the original. The person said “I’ll pass it on.” Referring to passing along/repeating something said previously to someone who wasn’t there to hear it.  Then they bring up pronouns as an aside, saying ‘just so you know, we don’t like your pronouns’
Oh yup, got me there 😅. I’d probably reply kindly and tell them to fuck off."	vyssas	NonBinary	1698	1.0	2022-07-14 10:39:03
Got asked if I was dressed like this on purpose. Also rudely asked ‘so I guess u have pronouns or something ‘ but I’ve never felt more comfortable. Afab and panromantic and trying to find my true self in my 30s!		"Also didn’t mind being asked pronouns that would be great but it was the tone the guy said it to me was so horrendous 
But I just laughed and said I guess I do as do you and carried on sipping my cocktail feeling fabulous
Sorry if this doesn’t fit.
I’m a lurker on this sub still trying to figure a lot out. Very scared to post this. Still feel so new and unsure in my journey to myself.
You look great!!! And I totally understood the tone you were going for. It sounds like this person made a lot of assumptions, and engaged in a convo with you with no desire to respect or understand you. Keep it up, and I think it’s a great look!
Wait wait wait….hold on…..you were wearing that and they instantly thought “pRoNoUnS!!!??!?”?? What kind of boring life does that person have?? This is regular normal fashion where I live 😂😂 no one would bat an eye
Can I just say I’ve never felt as much love as I have on this one post. Thankyou every one who has liked and commented my heart feels so wonderful right now and I feel so validated and I never thought I could Fit in as someone who was hiding in a cis het relationship and life for so long would ever finally feel comfortable and accepted. You are all very kind wonderful people.
‘I guess you have pronouns’, so does everything. What a hot take from an idiot.

Anyway you look like Adele and I adore you so great job of being awesome and very gorgeous OP.
you’re slaying the game either way
I don't get why anyone would object to your outfit? It's a little eclectic but it all comes together and you look great! I'm AMAB and in boymode I've definitely dressed more out-there! Dumb people will say dumb things. Stay awesome and Illegitimi non carborundum!
You look freaking amazing.  

You know, people can just not say a word. That way they won't show the world how stupid they are. They can go about their day and not be jerks. It's easy. Sorry this happened to you. 
And we all have pronouns? What's their point other than to be a bigot? 

Glad you have found your true self. 💜
Only a fool says the things that were said to you! You look amazing, interesting, sexy, and fabulous! Exploring who you are and what you want to become is a joy that you should be experiencing with happiness!
You do you, and you look gorgeous!
You look amazing and I'm jealous of that outfit! 
And forget those aholes they're gonna just hate.
Sometimes we find ourselves later than we'd expected! I'm still trying to get confidence to dress like that, and learn how to apply makeup 😅, but I always love seeing people realize their true selves and want to at least share the love and a few kind words.
You look amazing! Love that outfit 🥰
Stunner!
You look lovely! 

Also ""I guess you have pronouns or something?"" Like lol, doesn't everyone have pronouns?
You look amazing!!
You look wonderful
""so i guess u have pronouns or something""

...yes.
You look absolutely fabulous 😍
""(almost) everyone has pronouns...""

Sorry this happened. Key thing is you look fantastic and happy being your authentic self!
you look fabulous! screw the haters!
Gorgeous!
You look amazing!
judging by the bus stop, its just another british knuckle dragger, ignore them you look so cool
you look FAB!
You look amazing!! I’m getting some classic singer vibes, though I can’t put my finger on who
I don't get what's wrong with your outfit, you look terrific!
You look like an updated Richard O'Brien in  Crystal Maze and I love it
Fuck them you look fabulous af
I don't understand. If I'm seeing properly, you have on a leather corset top, long flowy & sheer skirt, some type of leg covering, an animal print coat that looks really warm(as it is December), and your gold shoes make the accents on your hand bag. It all goes together and is a vibe
Fabulous outfit. You look great!

Not me whose immediate thought was “everyone has pronouns, dingus” 😜
I’m just echoing what everyone else has said, but what a moronic thing for that guy to say. “I guess you have pronouns” yeah dude, guess somebody failed English class.

ETA: You look fabulous! If they can’t handle it then fuck em.
Being that hot can get you haters!
this outfit is amazing
Love the fit!!! And the smile 💜
You look stunning!
Can I just say….the SHOES😍😍
I think you look cute!
You look so happy in the picture. It's not even that out there, it's pretty normal with some extra frills. How cookie cutter are most people that guy has seen to warrant such a comment, so sad. Be yourself!
You look fabulous darling! Sorry you ran into some arse who tried to dim your light. Keep shining! The jacket and top are to die for but what I really want to know is if you have an ID/brand for the bag??
Pffft who... how can someone ask if ""youre dressed like this on purpose"" and not feel like an idiot?

Like. Nah, i just tripped and fell into this dope getup, why?
You're so beautiful and gorgeous 😍
You look amazing!!!
Fuck whoever that was, you look like you're living your best life and at the best, maybe he learned something
Excuse me you are extremely hot
This is SO CUTE and looks unbelievable cozy!!
I need details for this entire outfit. You look amazing!!
What? You look awesome, slay friendo
""I don't have pro nouns. They're still in the minor leagues but we're hopin to turn that around after this season""
I don't know why they would ask you about what you are wearing... You look INCREDIBLE!!
looking powerful and gorgeous. Did you explain them everybody has pronouns
imagine having pronounce🙄🙄🙄🙄 /j
>so I guess u have pronouns or something

Yeah, just like everyone else in creation.
You look stunning
people who are against us are so jumpy nowadays. they think nearly every gnc person they see is a trans woman, because they often forget the rest exist.
I'm  a senior grandmother and I think you look lovely. I'm  very sorry that people feel as if it's  OK to be rude to you and I feel sorry for people that are so close-minded.
i love that outfit!! those shoes are a dreamm
You look fucking magnificent. 

I like the phrase ""wow, what a thing to say outloud"" and then ignore them.
Omg once again Thankyou everyone I have never felt this surrounded by so much love and positivity it’s a little overwhelming. You are all incredible wonderful people!
Thank every one there was so many comments I got so overwhelmed and had to disappear for a bit. I was in a bad place when I posted this and I cannot believe how wonderful the world is because
Of people like you!!! Sorry if I didn’t respond personally. You are all exceptional kind and beautiful beings!!! I told my mum about this and we had a huge chat (yes even at 30 me and my mum are still learning ) and she was so wonderful. She new I was asexual but we had a big gender talk and it went so well!!! 
I cannot thank you all enough x
wtf?? you look great. people are bitter because they don't feel comfortable with themselves.
You look so good love your style
Yeh, i get that. Judgy prats.

 you didn’t let it affect your mood tho. Still smiling right?!
You look absolutely fabulous. Keep being you.
I'm in love with your style and expression
Rude wth? I love your outfit, it's unique (like in the absolute best way possible)!!
I just have to laugh every time I hear about someone saying something like ""I bet you have pronouns"" like-- they just outed themself as being dumb af, literally everyone and everything has pronouns 🤦
Bruh you don’t even look overly extra. I’ve seen women in their 40’s on a Saturday night dress more eccentrically. Wtf was he chatting?
Honestly, if you offended him just for being yourself, you did the world a favor. Upsetting the status quo by simply representing our culture is the best thing we can do for the future trans kids who deserve to skip the prejudice entirely.
You totally fit, and you look gorgeous!

This person was extremely rude and I'm sorry that you had such an experience.

Great, that you didn't let it drag you down :)
The post is valid, you’re valid. Hope you’re having a good day :)
You’re wonderful and your outfit is fucking DOPE.
Thankyou so much. Lurking in this sub taught me embracing my femininity doesn’t make me less valid. Non binary doesn’t have a look. I hated dressing feminine when I felt I had to present as a women now I just dress with whatever feels me. Now I don’t see myself in a binary I found love again in myself. I still hate my boobs and I hate being sexualised. Still I hate my feminine side less now I don’t think I have to look like what people expect me to. It’s so refreshing learning this after so many years of confusion.
I thought the same thing, they look completely normal and fashionable for where I live
Right!?
Thankyou so much x
I bloody won’t!!! They can’t hurt us!! 

And Thankyou this definitely is a tame outfit imo too!! 
 but I guess Yorkshire just isn’t ready for all the frillls baby!! 😊
Exactly. I wasn’t with him or his friends why he felt the need to intrude and then get pissed off because I was just there is beyond me. I have good friends tho who have my back otherwise it can be quite scary meeting people who get so angry that you exist. I find everyone is nice until I don’t wanna go home with them and then the change and aggression is so quick. I’m quite tall and have some masculine features and I often got followed home by guys ones I turned them down shouting obscene things. 

Anything that hurts a fragile ego. 

How they don’t even understand they also have a pronoun and an identity. Well some people are beyond logic it seems.
Thankyou so very much. It is strange and difficult but my word so wonderful to learn who I really am!!
Thankyou so much really!!
You tube is my best friend for makeup 
(I love tricked budget uk vids I know it’s a read but it helps my drugstore budget 😂)

And Thankyou. Took me a lot of years to learn not to give a shit. Still feels scary sometimes but it’s all about your company. I dress up for local pub dirty bingo like a drag queen ( I don’t have a life and it’s my social event for the week lol) and all locals love it so it makes me feel so nice but couldn’t do it at any other pub. 

And Thankyou for the nice comment.
Ahhh Thankyou my mum hates them 😂 but she agrees they are so me!!
I am saving that !! beautiful!!! Such a perfect response.
And Thankyou so much!!
Thankyou so much.
Thankyou!!! I really like my look now it means so much to hear that
At the time I was confident enough to just laugh it off. 

It hit me later though a lot of doubt and shame like I shouldn’t have even gone out in public but overall I came back to realising he was the asshole 
I remembered how much my friends bigged me up

I often feel shame just being around people but turned out they had a wife and kid and I just feel sorry for them that this asshole was just out chasing hole then projecting his own insecurities on everyone who didn’t want to worship him. 

I’m smiling because I get to experience wonderful people despite folks like them.
Thankyou so much!!
Thankyou so much. I feel my style has grown since i became single realised I wasn’t straight at all and got deep into charity shops (thrift shopping)
You wanna feel good about yourself meet the lovely old ladies in the Red Cross charity shop watching you do a fashion show in the changing room cupboard. They often know good sewing tips too and love a natter! 😊
Thankyou so much. I proper scrapped it together from Zara and charity shops!!! (Love the charity shops!)

Yeah it was an obnoxious place like a popular bar. But weirdly my local Yorkshire pub always has such lovely things to say to everyone. Guess they are just kind people!!!
Serious it was so ridiculous. And he was flirting around before I said hey I like a flirty chat but I’m not interested I’m here with friends and his tone changed so much.  He was so defensive and pissed. Just outed himself as an asshole. Then he would t leave it alone. Luckily I was with good friends and we laughed him away otherwise could have been a lot more scary.
As if they don’t have pronouns themselves…💀 “‘I’ bet you have pronouns”…
Thankyou! I have never felt more valid than I have today!!!   It’s made my day!!!
Hell yeah! I completely agree, there is no “look” it’s just about setting your own rules and feeing comfortable in your own skin. Keep doin you my friend!!!
Yknow, in many states non-binary folks have access to gender affirming care (like top surgery) thats even covered by state insurance. If you’re feeling dysphoric about your chest, you can ask a doctor what options you have.
this is so awesome and i am so happy for you
this helps me to read. I am AFAB, pansexual and genderqueer, and have struggled with my femininity, as you say, my whole life. Mid 30s now and still unpacking the shame & homophobia.
Saaame gender crisis hit me hard at 30 and I’m also figuring it all out now. It gave me such a big smile to read your post. Your outfit looks amazing and also comfy! In the same boat with my chest, it’s a very complex relationship for me :D
I saw the word ""bloody"" and concluded that you were either British or antipodean (like me) then I saw ""Yorkshire"" and decided I wanted a pudding!

Stay safe friend! I have no idea what Yorkshire is like I hope the jerk was an oddity!
You are very welcome, Remember the joy is in the journey of discovery, and you seem to be well on your way!
Ahhh the modern answer on how to do anything lol (I learned my hobbies from yt), and that sounds amazing! At least it's a safe space!
Yep, thats a pretty helthy outlook to have on it
And you do look stunning, i really like the outfit, i wish i could wear something that cool. 

Its wonderful that you have friends to back you up. These a-holes dont even deserve the time of day, like you said, they want attention and the best thing u can do is laugh in their face or just ignore them completely.

Like it would make so much difference if we just had some positive attention. A compliment like, you have nice hair or something.

Instead i hear people saying “oh look at that mess” or you get the other kind if unwanted attention from the creeps.

If only they knew how damaging it is. I cry about the way people treat me and i really make an effort. Feels so helpless.
Posting my pics online helped because i had never been told nice things about the way i looked.
Popular spots attract blow ins from out of town.

Where as local is just locals... Still, depends on what demographic hangs there but less likely to have total fools showing up to be rude
You can find such good stuff at charity shops!! There's some charity based thrift stores in an area not too far, I love looking for stuff there once in a while.
“Just outed himself as an asshole”
Good talk, lol
Way to completely incidentally Matrix-style-bullet-dodge by just being frank, lol.
Sounds like someone who found u attractive, tried it on and then lashed out when you rejected them. Classic and nothing to be taken personally :)
Thankyou so much!!! 
Isn’t it weird how letting people be themselves for themselves and not society brings happiness!!?? 😊  
I’m so glad I found this space!
Swear down didn’t realise foundation didn’t belong in my eyebrows before YouTube. I envy how good the kids look now! 😂 all I had was maybelline matte mouse, ghds and hopes and prayers
Very true. I can see this difference in the way people act compared to where I live (smaller, more rural area) vs the bigger city area.
 No doubt!!!! I’m glad for the solidarity and I’m happy to hear you are too

very valid! also, excellent style! hope youre thriving!
Of course you are dear 😊 (my partner is amab he/they ) Edit- not that you need to be partnered to be valid, Community care is for everyone lgbt even if the t is lowercase 😊… I’m trying to make a cute joke out of my point. I’m not sure if it’s landing. My point is you’re valid 🥺
Oh so valid.

I dig your style.

Valid as heck, and elegant as always ❤️
I love your style
Cute fits
Of course darling, and on top of that you are STUNNING
Ah, I see you're branching out and sharing your awesomeness with a bigger audience!

Hi, Mx Vintage! Fancy seeing you out here in the wild!
I don't see what's not valid about that, as that's sorta how I am. Non-binary, but I'll agree with ""he/him"" and I don't necessarily look super masculine OR feminine. Great style, everyone who identifies as other than cisgendered ought to be welcomed here.
Regardless of agab, the fit just screams 'cisn't'
valid? always! also where did you get your top and jacket?! looks amazing!!
David Bowie vibes. Sick asf
10/10 valid 😌💅
Absolutely! I’m AFAB and I use she/her pronouns but I present mostly masc. There are no rules to being nonbinary.
I really thought your first pic was a BDG cosplay for a second
Of course my friend! I'm a they/he and I present masc a lot of the time! We are totally valid. PS, you look gorgeous
Okay but wow I love your style! Very valid. Kinda get a bit of a Bowie and East Berlin vibe. You look really good<3
I absolutely am in love with your style!!
The second picture gives me Tilda Swinton vibes.
No one gets to decide your validity but you!
Of course you are valid
You are more than valid <33 Also may I just add you look STUNNING!!
That 70s style is looking amazing on you!
Also you're definitely valid

you are and fuck anyone who says otherwise <3
Fucking KILLING IT!!! I literally am in the same boat as you and I WANT THAT AESTHETIC AAAAA
I recognise that place! You look awesome:)
Very great style, but also nonbinary people don't owe anyone androgyny. He/him lumberjack looking AMAB nonbinary person? Just as valid as anyone else
David Bowie is looking on and smiling.  Flawless.
hells yeah you’re valid and literally killing it
Beautiful :) <3
the vibes are immaculate ❤️
You look very snazzy
So valid. You are equally as valid as almost every other nonbinary person
Of course you are valid and also absolutely gorgeous. Your sense of fashion is excellent
Omg those leopard heels r a SERVE
You look amazing in those outfits! I'm AFAB and mostly present as female but I learned here that it still makes me valid so you definitely are too!
God I wish we saw more AMAB NBs. AGAB doesn't mean shit obviously, but the amount of people who only seem to validate or care about Enbies who are only AFAB is disgustingly high. Really overlooks the concept of being Non-Binary but an unfortunate thing I've observed :/
VALID? B**CH OFCCCC
So magical! Also nice hat collection ☺️
woah, you look gorgeous in anything! I hope I can look this good one day!
Of course you are valid love.And you have stunning legs💜
That second photo is everything. I love your aesthetic!
I love that outfit!
of course you’re valid!! also holy shit those heels are amazing wtf
YOUR STYLE!!!!!! I NEED to know where you shop lol. These fits are EVERYTHING
Hell yes you look so cool dude

I don’t have a sword but i’m ready to fight anyone who doesn’t respect pronouns!! (btw, I may not look non-binary but i’m a genderfluid demigirl and today was a very feminine day😊)		"> I may not look non-binary

No such thing!  We can look like whatever we want whenever we want :)
Non binary =/= Androgyny. You're super valid 💜 And you look stunning ✨✨

Just wanted to toss out another comment about androgyny. I’m also genderfluid but I present hella masc. Sometimes I like that, sometimes I cry myself to sleep! Lol
Arrows mean you can attack from a farther distance :)
:0000 fellow nonbinary archer! I have the same bow but orange :)
Heck yeah! Cool bow :)
Thanks for posting this. I feel insecure like that sometimes too and somehow seeing you like me makes me feel more valid. Also you are super valid too! 😊
The bow is just as hot, change my mind!
Did this wonderful human just start a trend of enbys holding bows? 

*Tries to find my bow*
I will totally join you with my bow!
I have no sword. I have no bow. But i can join with a medkit
you look amazing, and non-binary doesn't have a look! androgyny is not a requirement.
You look non-binary because you are non-binary and you look like yourself! Never let anyone tell you different.
For some reason I think the particular combination of sweater + bob is very cute! The sweater is my favourite shade of purple.
Hehe... Non-Bownary...
Dooesn't matter how you look or what weapon you have, you are here we all see you and love you and are ready to fight next to you.  I got the shieldline, you can help me push by making them pay for every step they take against us.
As the fluid originator of the sword trend, I love this! You're looking awesome, and as an archer, respect for the bow. You're rockin' it, cutie!
My femme days do not negate the fact I am enby. Regardless of the fact my factory setting genitals are innie, not outtie. And the same goes for you and any other enby, regardless of innies or outties (factory setting or after market mods)
I'm also genderfluid and get the ""oof, I don't look androgynous enough"" feeling all the time.  But don't sweat it, you look great!  And you can wear and present however you think is best--that doesn't change who you are.  

Also, that pink bow?  Magnificent.  I have done a little archery, but with much less stylish equipment.
There’s no right way to look non-binary! Go enby go!
oh my gosh y’all are so sweet I’m so happy today bc of you guys comments thank you so much ☺️
non-binairy katniss everdeen
Theres never 1 eight way to look envy! Your look rockin with that bow and arrows
If there is a non binary look, they're usually the ones carrying swords and axes and stuff, so I suppose your bow is your non binary look. Also I hope it'll catch on because that's pretty cool
Ooh an archer too! Awesome!
Good, now we don’t have to get personal every time we want to do some damage!
Genesis bow!! Mine is red! I was captain of my archery team, non-binary archers unite
I have a sword from comiccon I'll fight them with you
yes!! another non-binary archer :)
I'm genderfluid too 😊
You still valid. I'm also gender-fluid, but the people on this sub are very friendly and accepting. That's what I love about the lgbtq+ community, they almost always accept each other. Wish the whole world was like that. Stay proud! ❤🧡💛💚💙💜
Now all we need is a wizard and a rogue and the party is complete
You look very non-binary to me
Yooo I've got that same bow
Much love id join if I had bow experience.
Nice, me and @_-SLAYER have a little army starting, care to join. @_-SLAYER shall be using a sword, I shall be using a war axe and you can join us with your bow. We shall be unstoppable
Your bow is amazing and your look is as non-binary as you wish it to be at any given moment. Do you feel non-binary? You are. Also again I LOVE the bow. Now I want one.
I can't believe there are so many archers here! 
Count me in!
And yeah, looking good!
I love your bow

Reminds me of Robin Hood
Does that bow have a name i wanna get one and that's so coooool :]
“looking nonbinary” isn’t a thing because nonbinary is not only an umbrella term but everyone experiences being nonbinary differently!! you’re looking great!
You look happy... and dangerous.😀
You look so non-binary because you look like yourself and thats all you need! 😁

Also archery is a very nb look lol🤘
Excellent. We have our swords, now our archers. Where’s the non-binary cavalry?
HELLZ YA ARCHERY!!!
you look VERY non binary we love u
Cute! Your bow has training wheels!
(Also, you look cool as hell)
You look nonbinary to me.🤷🏾
I want to learn archery so bad! That bow is so cute 😱
Ah. A fellow Demigirl. Your presence is appreciated and you look fabulous today. 
And there is no need to “look non-binary”. You are what you are, screw people who say otherwise. :)
there is no such thing as not looking non-binary! you can look however and still identify as non-binary!
So long as you are nonbinary, you look nonbinary! ☺️
Expression =/= gender! Thank you for fighting for our pronouns, kind comrade.
Bows are lit af
Now I want a bow that hides 2 swords
Yaaaaaaas! The enby army grows! We shall smite with love and tolerance!! 😄
Wait how are you genderfluid AND a demigirl? Seriously asking not trying to hate
Can someone explain the sword thing to me? 🙈 I see it on this sub all the time and I feel like I'm missing part of my subculture as an enby 😬😂
I use a bow like that in the game Rise Of The Tomb Raider.
I was gonna add a pick of my cosplay sword but you got the weapons covered
thank you so much 😊
awwww thank you ☺️
this is perfect 😂
hello fellow masc genderfluid person!!
I feel this so hard bc feminine
yes!
Archery is just socially distanced fighting :3
awesome! archery is the best!
thanks!
you’re welcome, and you are super valid! and thank you so much 💕
Bow is super dope
I refuse 😜
thank you! I would love to see a bow trend 😂
yesss! we always need medics for us idiots who run into battle 😂
Now I want to do LARP of only non-binaries after the pandemic as a world wide event.....
hell yes!! thank you!!
this comment wins 😂
wow this is absolutely amazing! yes, we will make them pay.
thank you so much ☺️ you’re probably like a legend if you originated the sword trend
You won the internet! :D

I swear I will enlist in the enby army one day, just gotta have a day when I'm feelin heckin cute 😅
Also, archers are hot AF. (When gaming I always prefer ranged weapons over melee)
thank you so much! yes I love my pink bow, it’s fabulous
thank you! 😊
one of the best compliments thank you 😊
wow, I would love to be on an archery team. also, yes, genesis bows are awesome
yay!
I do have a calvary sword... No horse though 😅
no, no hate at all. so I might not actually be genderfluid but I am a demigirl and I go by both she/her and they/them but depending on the day I like one over the other. so I kind of assume that’s genderfluid but perhaps i’m wrong
no you should add it! we always need more swordsnonbinarypeoples!
You don't owe anybody androgyny, but if you want it then go for it!
Hello!
Thank fuck for “cis days” or whatever they’re called.
I want to try it, but I've never had a chance :(
Either that or fencing
I've got it in yellow with the string yellow and purple! I shot NASP for several years when I was still in highschool.
Get that bow arm ready young warrior; your generation has command.  We will form the phalanx and push it forward.
You’re already enlisted due to insane amounts of awesomeness!
Being genderfluid means that you feel as if you change genders, having your gender go hyper or fem is valid for example but you just need to find whatever terms that work for you (I used the gender list u/VinecentSauce has posted lately to identify as genderstrange-imperi-femgender) so although two of my labels do not change, the most of my gender is

Living my water type trainer fantasy 💧💙 wanted to share (any pronouns)		"Daaamn. You are gorgeous.
Love that!! I need to rebleach my hair soon and dye it bright yellow, I strive to look like a jolteon and/or pikachu 💛 what's your fav mon btw? :)
You're giving me secret mer-person vibes!

For scientific and research reasons, who does your water team consist of? 👀
Your drag look is great too. I have no idea how to do more femme makeup. Not drag, not my style, but just light goth femme for the days I'm feeling more feminine.
Fuck, you look so cool 😍
You are so beautiful.
Very very cool!
you're beautiful, like wow i.. yes.
Well you have very pronounced angles which i think suits your drag look very well.
You do look like a water type trainer! I love your hair
This is a great  picture!!
I feel like those stunning eyes are looking right into my soul 😍
Bulma vibes
I have a friend with earrings just like the one on your left ear.
🔥💯
Whoa, you have gorgeous eyes. 

Also, water-type forever!
how could you look so damn beautiful?!
Dang! I'm an earth type trainer. That's supereffective!
I just dyed my hair pretty much the exact same colour after coming out to my parents the other day lol
WOW that color of hair makes your eyes pop!
Ohh yes girl! You look super cute, love the hair
Damn what's your hair routine. I fucking wish I could get my curls to be as defined WOW.
Beautiful 💙
Fabulous! 💙
Beautiful 😻
Jesus you are so attractive I gasped XD
Stunning.  Your eyes and hair and aesthetic? *chef’s kiss*
That hair color really goes well with your eyes, you look absolutely beautiful!
Date I even say - gym leader vibes?
 So gorgeousssss!
Cool 👌🏼
That is a stunning blue💙
Mermista’s has a brother
Oh, thank you so much 🙈💕
That would be so stinkin' cute!! And oooh, it's a toss up between Swampert and Gardevoir.
I will take that! 🐟

And only a couple of water types on my team, tbh.

Swampert 
Gardevoir
Toxtricity
Vileplume
Drifblim 
Centiskorch 
Slowking 

But water is for sure my favorite type 🙊 and always the starter I choose.
I totally feel that. For me, it's either drag...or nothing 😅 can't find the middle ground
Thank you so muchhh 😽😽
Thank you so much 😭
Wellllll, thank you 🙈 so much
Hiya, thank you 💙
I'll take that 🙊
It's my current favorite 😁
Thank you so muchhh 💙 also, hell yeah 🤘
😭 you are too kind 😭
Whoopsiee 💧 them's the breaks 💙
Aww, yay!! So happy and proud of you for living your truth in both ways 💙
That's what I was hoping for 🙈 what color should I do next?
Thank you, babyyy 🥺🙊💙
Touch them as little as possible! And embrace them! I shower in the morning and scrunch them in place - but embrace where they wanna go, really only using a curl defining creme.
I only condition once a week, and use a restorative conditioning mask once week. Only shampoo like...twice a month 💕

I hope this helps 🤗
😽💙🤘
Thank you, boo 😽💕🤘
Thank you so much 😽💕🤘
Oh, whoopsie 🙊 over here catching breaths 😳

Heheee..no, thank you so much, though 🥺💕
Thank you so much, boo 😭💕
Thank you so very, very much 🥺💕
Ayeee. I will absolutely take that 😏💧
Thank you, love 💙
Thank youuu 🤗💕
Uhmm, yes 😭 love She-Ra
Yeah! Good choices :D
Swampert is one of my favorites! I think that's a good team you have there 😊
im just saying the truth :D
Try doing a silver with a blue tint! I definitely think you should stay in the blue part of the color wheel; it looks great on ya :)
I use gel in it as well as leave in conditioner. It's possible I put too much pressure on them. I should look into curl defining creme tho. Do you comb through them while wet ?
What are your favorite? 😽
Oooh, what's your team? 😽
Ooh, that's a great suggestion! Might be the winter vibe.
It's possible! Everyone's hair is different, of course. But I've found it's best for me to use as little product as possible. And the less interaction, the better. Get the general shape I'm going for, then let them do their own thing.
I actually only ever comb it when it's necessary 🙊 like if I feel tangles when I run my hands through in the shower. But even then, I hardly ever do.
Im so bad at choosinggg, but I love vaporeon and suicune!
No specific types (they're just some of my favorites to have), but Swampert, Aggron, Luxray, Arcanine, Toxicroak, and Gengar
At the end of the day, it's so hard tbh 🙊 but yesss. When Pokémon 4 Ever came out 👏👏 Suicune and Celibi were everything to me.
Love, love, love. That's a great, well-balanced team.
Same!! Honestly thats my fav pokemon movie, next to the first movie (of course lol) and in general I just love eeveelutions and the 3 beasts so much, the backstory with the burned tower is one of my fav lore bits
Tysm!
Uhmm, abso-fucking-lutely. Best film, hands down. It was in that prime time of animation, too - Iron Giant, Treasure Planet, all the Ghibli films. All of Johto is so dope."	pet4qe	NonBinary	1595	1.0	2021-08-30 22:47:39

I didn’t know other people felt pretty much the same way I do wow.
Daily conversations in my head for $200 please, Alex.
I think the obsession with validity is overrated. My focus is on rights etc, Even if I am just a boy who likes makeup and fancy shoes sometimes
Double Trouble, our lord and savior
Did you just reach into my brain and pull that first paragraph straight from there can we TALK ABOUT SHARED EXPERIENCES PLEASE
Relatable, but my ADHD makes me point out that was and were are not pronouns!
I want to steal their gender so bad
Good pic for the meme. Double Trouble always chooses chaos 😂

But yeah…. All too true.
Hehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehe I'm in this picture and I don't know how to feel about it.
Double trouble was literally the cause of my realization that I'm non-binary they're the frickin best.
Literally me ever day even since I came as nonbinary.
Oh look, the most relatable character from a show I've never seen.
Only I get to say I'm not valid.
Me as genderfae 😭
Oh my god, this is so on the nose. Can I use it as my profile pic please?
I'm just starting to just Michael Jackson ""HEE HEE!"" when my friends hard ""he"" me LOL
In Double Trouble we trust 🫡
I was about to make a post that was going to be a really long version of what this meme summed up. 😂
Needed to see this, ty OP ❤️
aaargh  my brain
Feel that very much....especially the upper one
what animated series is that meme from? :o

looks interesting.
Jeez this is too relatable lmao
Was is also part tence 💔💔💔😭😭😭
Test
Fun isn't it.
Looks like I've stuck a chord with a ton of people, lol!

For everyone who's commenting and saying the self-doubt part of the meme mirrors their own inner turmoil, know that none of that makes you invalid. Just take a look at these comments - a *ton* of non-binary people experience impostor syndrome as well.

I think a lot of this is a symptom of existing in a transphobic society. If you have to filter your authentic self whenever you go out in public, and live as an identity that's not your own, then that's going to rub off on you, whether you want it to or not. The same goes for when other people ""sir"" or ""ma'am"" you all the time. If nobody takes you seriously, then it makes you question yourself, even if you ultimately know that you're valid. For me, when I have to be in boymode for a long time (like when I'm at work), that makes the self-doubting start. But when I'm around my queer friends, and can be my authentic, unfiltered self, then I feel non-binary as *fuck*.

So what can we do about all of this? First, I'd say try to find as many queer friends as you can. If you surround yourself with people who accept you as you are, it does wonders for your mental health. Find your local queer events/meetups, and go to them! If there aren't any, then start one (if you feel safe enough, of course)! Strike up a conversation with someone wearing queer pins, and maybe you'll gain an accepting friend!

And while that's a decent coping mechanism, we also have to solve the problem of experiencing transphobia in the first place. If it's safe for you, start being more assertive about your identity. Practice saying, ""Oh, I'm not a man/woman"", ""Actually, my pronouns are they/them,"" and so on in the mirror, until you feel confident enough to say it for real. Or, if you're not out yet, figure out where your friends/family/colleagues are on their journey towards accepting trans people. Start pushing them in the right direction, step by step. Not everyone will change, so don't waste your time on the backwards ones, but do try to help along those who are willing to listen.

If you're just complaining about things online, but you're not actively trying to make them better, then it's time to fix that. It's like having a giant pile of shit in your room, and saying, ""Gee, I sure wish someone would clean that shit up."" If nobody's cleaning it up, then you're going to keep smelling it until *you* clean it up. And if there is someone cleaning it up, well, it is a pretty big pile of shit - it's not fair for them to have to clean it up all on their own. They could definitely use your help with it, so why not help them, and lighten their load? Why not get a group of people to pitch in, so it's easier for all of you?

Our society is a giant pile of shit right now. We all have to do our part to make it better, so it's time to start doing yours. Start or join a queer advocacy group, if it's safe. If it's *not* safe, think about what you can do to get things to the point where it is. And it's not just about queer rights, of course - it's also about racial justice, womens' rights, workers' rights, environmental justice, animal liberation, and so on. A better world is not going to come about on its own, like an apple that falls from the tree when it is ripe - you have to **make** it fall. So get off reddit, go outside, and start making things better!

(This isn't aimed at you personally, I'm just replying here so everyone can see it)
dont forget that non binary doesnt mean you cant exist with part of the binary, you can still associate with being a man/woman while also not associating with it. gender is a made up construct and the way you experience it is solely defined by purely that. how you experience it. you can enjoy boymode while not feeling like you're a boy. non binie is simply existing outside of the binary in any way❤
With 8+ billion people in the world, it's pretty unlikely for any one person to have a completely unique struggle.
you are so right .  i am eternally fluctuating & have accepted that there's no resolution just one hell of a ride .  and if I am breathing,  I'm valid .  i always think of a parking pass ""do you validate parking?""  haha  Validated !
Both are important, imo. We need to tend to the mental health of our community, while also getting out in the streets and fighting for rights.
I love them so much.
Lmao, looks like I struck a chord with everyone. I don't check reddit very often, but sure, my DMs are open if you want to talk about the non-binary experience!
They will be, if the transphobes don't shut the hell up though.
well, that's not necessarily true. there's nothing stopping anyone from using them as xenopronouns or nounself pronouns
Of course, you don't even have to ask.
She-Ra and the Princesses of Power (2018). **Highly** recommend it, it's a fantastic show with tons of queer rep.
Like a merry-go-round of misery.
absolutely .  it's not necessarily ' neither' ...  for me it is BOTH
This is true... it's just sad that most of us will never meet our counterparts. It would be real nice not to be so alone in rl in these struggles...
I guess I should start looking at It that way
>She-Ra and the Princesses of Power

thanksies :)
I have a love hate relationship with my gender fluidity.
for me its man yes man no woman absolutely not none sure masculinity yes femininity yes 😂😂
hello .  nice to meet you .  .  it's a privilege to know other victorious enbys .   we are everywhere
If you have any local queer events or meetups, those are a good way to meet other people!
Victorious??? LOL. What gave you that idea? I am just existing, that's all. Far cry from ""success"". It's a weird world out there, and well... most people just make assumptions one way or the other. It's so weird because 99% of the population is just wrong on first glance, even the allys. Allys immediately assume I'm a transwoman and enemies immediately use everything to attack the male side. But what's weird is noone ever asks. Like I don't think even my pronouns have ever been asked before, they just make assumptions.
There isn't. And I don't like the term ""queer"" because I'm ace. There's a sexuality-related connotation. There used to be an LGBT+ group at my clinic but they closed because of COVID never to return. So once a year there's pride and last year was the first one I ever went to, and might be the last. I was so out of place...
even just surviving for me is a victory .  means I made it another day without punching my own ticket . so there's that
Biiig oof, you don't know how relatable that statement is. The fact that I always think that way is why I don't feel like a success, y'know? Which makes it so interesting that we came to different conclusions of what it meant lol. But I'm glad you are able to take a more positive approach than I am!"	12dndrh	NonBinary	1564	1.0	2023-04-06 15:15:25

My wife has designed these metal pronoun pins and I think they look great!		"Hope it’s ok to promote things on here, you can get them on her website or Etsy.

Wow - I love them! Just looked at her shop and there's so much awesome stuff I now want!
My favorite thing about them is that all the colors are mixed up so it’s not necessarily stereotypical with the pronouns and the colors 

Did that make sense 

I have no clue
They totally do look great! They're not quite my style or I would straight up buy one, but I'll totally keep them in mind when recommending indie pronoun pins to people. Really clean, bright designs. Excellent work on your wife's part!
omfg these are sick! they remind me of like 90's tv and that kids tv show ZOOM, i dont know why, but I love them!!!

edit: just checked out her store and i'm obsessed !!! her art is so lovely :)
Well she make neopronoun ones too? :D
I think I saw a classmate with the she/her pin! They look great!
Just ordered a they/them pronoun pin!
i loooove the 90's aesthetic these have! gonna have to get myself one!
I love u
I need all of them. To change with my pronouns.

But they're amazing.
love it !!!! they look awesome
Hey! I love these.

A suggestion for future sales would be to add 'she/they' or 'he/they' or even 'any pronouns' because I identify with anything and have such a tough time finding those pin representations. Whenever I do I snatch them up!
These are epic!
awesome!! tried to get some from Amazon and they sucked and kept falling off, Etsy is defo the way to go
Oh my god, I love these so much
Give me all of em
Cool. I favorited the shop. I'm working on my own shop on Etsy. Trying to get enough good pics up so everyone can get a good idea of each item. I don't have the best lighting but I did try. I sell pride bracelets. Should put the link in my profile I think. 🤔

Here is my Etsy shop: https://www.etsy.com/shop/ElliesPrideCreations
Aww thanks!
Yes that was deliberate!
I'm sure she will if there's demand! It costs a bit to get them made so she's starting with the most common pronouns
It’s fantastic? Makes me very happy!

i made a meme, it’s probably been done fore		"A sliver of compassion, a shred of pride (consumed) and a drop of common decency
Idk why but this seems fitting to also go on r/antimeme
""preferred"" is transphobic, we just say ""pronouns"" now. I don't ""prefer"" to be NB, I am NB.
For real though. It’s really not that hard and I’m tired of seeing bigots act like it’s so difficult to choose your words. I grew up in one of the most racist, sexist, homophobic, etc households. We didn’t use terms like black people, POC, Mexicans, women, mentally disabled, etc. We didn’t call Brazil nuts Brazil nuts. Slurs were the norm for me, living in a small predominantly white town and everyone else basically spoke the same way. I was smacked back to reality (oop there goes gravity) once I got to college. I gained the knowledge of actual appropriate wording and I applied it. Pronouns were no problem for me. I most struggled with not saying the N word, because my gamer friends who I lived with used it ALL the time and it kinda just came out of me before I realized. But I kept catching myself, stopping in the middle of the word, and eventually it left my vocabulary altogether. But honestly, really not that hard. All I had to do is try. It’s sad when people either don’t care enough, or don’t think they’re capable of change. All you have to do is try. Eventually it becomes any other normal part of speaking.
True but this might not be the case for those of us who use a variation of pronouns. I personally use they/them pronouns as a preference for work/academics but am also comfortable when people use she/her pronouns depending on the context (I’m a transfemme demi-girl)
No it's not. It's almost like everyone is different and some people do have preferences that may change. I have a preferred pronoun, but I'm not offended if someone uses a different pronoun that still matches my identity. Context and intention matters, there are many situations where I'm comfortable using one pronoun but not others. As an NB person, my preferred pronouns may change depending on the day. NB by itself is not a pronoun, I'm still NB at the end of the day. 

I ""prefer"" she/they most of the time but would not be upset if someone only used she/her or they/them. I would be upset if someone intentionally misgendered me using any of the above. Context and nuance matters.
not really, my preferred pronouns are they them but i’m fine if strangers and old ppl who don’t understand they them call me he 

also ‘did you use someone’s pronouns’ doesn’t work as well for the meme
So then your pronouns are they/them and she/her 

They aren't preferred, that how you are referred to.
So then your pronouns are she/they, she/her, and they/them 

You can have multiple sets, it's cool. 

But most of us with pronouns don't get a preference. We are who we are. For those transitioning, it can be incredibly invalidating to hear ""preferred pronouns"" when someone is in such a fragile state of their identity.
“Correct pronouns”- easy fix.
Well I prefer one over the other based on the context, so yes they are preferred. Not going to be too technical on the language.
Ooh I like this.
Yes because preferred pronouns is transphobic. Use something else.
And I just gave you an example where it would not be seen as transphobic to specify that a pronoun is preferred in a context. But if that’s the hill you wish to die on, then go for it 💁🏼‍♀️
I don't tolerate transphobic language and I won't use it for one person so they can harm the rest of the community because they're stubborn and selfish.
Looks like more people agree with my take than your’s here anyways, so I highly doubt that I am the only person who is okay with the terminology. I feel as though you’re the one trying to dictate what terms people within the trans community can use to refer to themselves and are being too stubborn to understand that language is nuanced. Regardless, I fail to see what makes having a pronoun preference transphobic. You have added nothing to support your argument.
Nobody prefers to be nonbinary and implying choice is transphobic

I'm not apologizing for defending my integrity as an NB with no choice and defending the integrity of the community from haters that claim we take on and take off our identity like clothing. A lot of us actually identify as trans and experience dysphoria and turning our backs on us when we've advocated for your rights for over a decade is incredibly selfish.
You’re also equating pronouns with gender identity when the association is not as clear cut as that. Gender can be divided into identity, expression, and presentation. Someone can be comfortable using certain pronouns around some people and use different pronouns around others. That doesn’t make it transphobic. I’m not implying that gender identity is a choice; rather, I am acknowledging that there are many social factors that may lead someone to prefer the use of one pronoun over others. Context is what matters.
But all of those are pronouns, not preferred pronouns."	zhm0vd	NonBinary	1482	1.0	2022-12-10 07:26:54

Kayson
Fern
When I was trying to decide on a new name, I read it helps to pick something that starts with a similar sound to your old one. I used it as a starting place and it helped the picking process a lot, plus it was an easier transition for people who knew me by my old name.
My first thought was Reese/Rys
Ripley
Xan
You look like a Vixen
Blake.
Sam? Mable, Ross, roe, Maple, or Sasa?
Chase?
I’m with others here, Cutie McCuteface is a very appropriate name 🖤
Bruh this comment section is down bad💀
Symphony. Symp for short 😌
You are very cute, and this pic of you has a certain vague mystical feel to it so my first thought was Rowan. I feel like Raven, Micah, Willow, or Arwyn would work really well for you (I say this not actually knowing you IRL lol)
Olive, Hazel, Ash, Fawn, Maple (I saw this one in the comments but it really suits you)
Eli
Riley
Spider was the immediate word that came to me
Maple or Billy
Cutie would be a good one, but I think Riley would come in second place

Phoenix 

Jace

Val
Hazel, Avery, Emory, Addison
I kinda see aiden
Jesse or Charlie!!
Cue Tea Pie

Or just Q
Gemma
If you're conflicted about names. You can know that I went by Kyle until recently I switched. My name to Finn.
My first thought was something that starts with Ash, Like Asher, Ashlyn, Ashton or just Ash
Getting big Aster vibes? But also maybe something more fae-like? Something woodsy/nature/elven oriented
Ren
Alex or Adrian.
Fynn
Sky was like the first name that poped into my head
Autumn June
Sam?
some sort of herb/foodish name, like sage, maple and basil are all good ones :)
Aviry
Maeve? Idk after The Boys I’ve had that name on my mind
It seems pretty gender neutral

Is it short for Sally or is it short for Salvador? Neither? Nothing? Keep them guessing :P

Idk I just like short, ambiguous names a lot
Ari or Spencer!
Blue? Idk that's just the first name I thought of
Dawn
Mars
I don’t know why but I looked at you and just thought “Alex”
Idk why but I got an ""Astor"" vibe from you
Nic? 😊
I don't believe if something so beautiful also exist
Nothing is as beautiful as you..
Idk why but you look like a Symphony to me
You seem like a Vee or a Teddy. Also you look like Elodie from trinkets.
You def look like a Charlie, I saw someone else saying that too lolol. Or maybe some names that are connected to the forest?
How about Jamie?
Emery.
I think Jasper would be nice
Syd
I'm feeling ray
Maine??
Aspen, Alder, or Aeris. Big A energy. You're adorable.
I feel like a constellation name would really suit you, but a lot of them are gendered... I was thinking Andy as a more gender neutral reference to Andromeda!
Why not just go with Shadow?
You really strike me as a Megatron 3000
Ash, Charlie, Jesse
Here's a water name: Verna or Vern from vernal pools, which are seasonally flooded ponds that are important habitat
….prebdy..
Sappho
To me you kinda look like an Ember, but you said you wanted a name to do with water. Are you more of a blushy giggle, dominating smirk, or gremlin grin type of person?

Side note: you cute as FUCK 10/10 would cuddle
Archie!
The first name that does come to my mind id Silvester, don't ask me why. But you are hella cute!!
Wren or Fox?
Arlo
Jamie
What about Nik?
I've always really liked the name pioline, and it suits u too
I immediately thought of Ask (a-sound pronounced like in 'stash'), but idk - lithium or helium would be super cool too though! Also i think Apollo, Genie or Jupiter would fit you :)
Robin 🐦🐦🐦
charlie or milo :-)
I saw you and one word popped: ASTRA.
What kinda name are you searching for? A noun? Just a genderless name? A word with a meaning?

Emery, Emerson, Isha, Alex,
Marsh, Fen?
Cute

Shade
Ash, Flame, Ember, Fire, Rain, or Arson
Jamie
Acelin maybe?
Quite honestly- Atticus seems to fit you (got this name from an awful person, hoping to pass it onto a potentially good one :D)
Eagan?
Gertrude, perhaps?
Am i only the one that's thinking Fox? 😅
Phoenix
Something that starts with M
If u think so then sure

I actually found that name too! And wrote it down cuz i liked it! 🥰 there are so many names i like but don’t love
Ash is so pretty :)
Ash is a really cute name, and it reminds me of the singer Ashe that I really like
Came here to say Ash or Asher as well :3
Thank you so much for the suggestion
I like it but its not it sorry
Thankss 🥰
I was thinking Ash too
I decided a few months ago that my preferred name is Ashes :)
I WAS THINKING THIS YAY
I immediately thought Aster
Same
My fav Sam* name is Samara. It has a few meanings/references but it's the scientific name for the winged seed of maple trees (helicopter, whirlybird, whirlygig) 🌱🍃

nn Sam, Sammy, Sama, Mara or Mars
Hello, I’m Bay :)

>Arson

Ummmm, pretty sure that's a crime
I just got to ur comment havent read anything down bad yet.

Preferably genderless and with a meaning. I love water and swimming. Im also fond of gaming but idk if that helps lol
Smooth! I like it 🥰
Nvm saw your username
I'm glad you like it! And it's ok that you're conflicted, these sorts of big decisions are gonna take time. But you'll find something, whether it's Maple or not. And whatever name you decide, it'll be great.
I'm happy to hear that! 

Also I'm probably being dumb but what do you mean by a May name?
Np
Water ideas:

Shore, Sound, Cove, Cascade, Lake, Laken, Loch, Bay
water in norweigan is Vanne

also i love ur hair! it’s my ideal length, will keep a look out if u post any more pics for my salon 😂
what about Kendra
Foxx is really cool! I named myself Fenn after fennec foxes 😁
I love that name!
I'm pretty sure the moon controls the tide, so it could go perfectly with your water theme!
I hope you find something that works
Hahaha meant it to be a list... but as a full name it's pretty badass 😂🤣😂
Doesn't mean it can't be a name 😈🤣🥰
You are just an icon of beauty that picture is worth a million words
Everybody deals with insecurity from time to time
Ooh ash is a good one too.
Well, water is Aqua, which I find a very sweet name. otherwise I honestly don't know too much, I'd recommend searching on tiktok (ik it has a bad reputation) but if you search for ""non binary names with meaning"" I'm sure you'd find at least some Ideas :) best of luck <3
Thank you so much! Im writing down some names rn. But nothing pops yet lol
Oh, I meant one that starts with the sound “May” or sounds like it!
Awh thanks! I shaved my head a few months ago and im letting it grow again
If u want u can message me for my discord and i can send u some pics of my hair
Thanks 😎
Ur so kind 🥰 thank you
I wish you luck and hope something does pop soon!
Ohh ok, that makes sense!

doing some paperwork for a new job and they have this option ❤️❤️❤️		"[deleted]
ITT some saying they need to have ""Sex"" and ""Gender Designation"". No. They need to have only ""Gender Designation"" and nothing else.
How can these people be aware enough to include gender designation and pronouns but still confuse ""GENDER"" AND ""SEX"" like wtf this is supposed to be the first distinction people learn
what are the other options for “gender”?
I hope this paperwork was sent to you after a job offer. I’m not sure so forgive me if this is alarmist: 

If they ask for this information before determining whether you get the job (specifically asking marital status), is that not breaking labor laws?

Edit to add (USA info) [https://www.eeoc.gov/pre-employment-inquiries-and-marital-status-or-number-children](https://www.eeoc.gov/pre-employment-inquiries-and-marital-status-or-number-children)
friendly reminder to everyone who says it should say ""sex"" instead of gender, if it's for legal reasons or insurance reasons, it should be ""legal sex"". not biological sex or agab or any of that. people forget we can change our legal documents and change our sex through transitioning.
Dude my job now - I just started 2 months ago after moving to a new city - they are so respectful of pronouns and everyone asks each other’s pronouns when introducing each other. I’ve never had this before. Im also not the only non binary person! Progressiveness like this is exactly why I moved from a small town 🤩 I hope your job is as good about pronouns and gender identity!!
""Gender designation"" what a nice way to tell others how you express.
 heard places do this to avoid hiring trans employees… not that you shouldn’t just I personally would be nervous abt it
Why did the word sex go out of favour for gender? It irritates me to no end.
Why do they need to know that, and wtf is “gender” and “gender designation”
Wouldn't it be sex rather than gender?
How is ""female"" a gender? Is this anonymous? If not I'd be very worried.
YEAAA
My company needs this.  It's based in Texas but we've always been known for not caving into conservatives and being very pro-LGBTQ
They always fuck up sex
Why do they need to know your marital status for a job
So much nicer to see than “Male/Female/Other” on the gender options, there’s so much encompassed in the label of “other” and it rarely has great connotations
What's the difference between ""gender"" and ""gender designation""?
Why do they need to know what you were assigned at birth anyway? Surely it doesn't matter?
ahhh that's so great
Edit: on second thought I don't trust mods to not ban me because they don't understand sarcasm

The way less funny version of my comment: this is actually really offensive and shows just how much cis people cling to birth-assigned binary gender as the only thing that matters
I wish they would put a he/she or him/her. Because sometimes you feel more masc, other times more fem.
This, like i get the intent, and they seem to be trying. Someone just added to a premade programs forms I guess, not actually editing the form so much as adding to it
I think some of them use it for insurance shit rather than internal documentation. So, insurance companies need to get on it
I think they do that because just so so many people (myself) would say yes please. ABG for assigned birth gender could work though
They also have no business knowing my sex. I don't know went this is required in any sense.
Agreed but I would also argue that sex isn't binary
***Assuming this is in the US*** - as long as there is Affirmative Action, sex (and race) are significant. It's a bit of a double-edged sword.
Unless you're in medical, and or need to have surgeries and or other things associated with doctoring because that's important. Other than that just gender designation should be only thing
random question: what do you define under ""everyone""?  (definitly not science i think)
There are reasons why Sex and with that sex characteristics is a thing. Some medications for example do indeed work differently on Humans with more Female sex characteristics than in men because it is mostly only tested on Humans with most Male sex characteristics which is still causing a lot of problems but that's another topic.
Isn't gender designation agab?
In the US, it's usually a mix of ignorance and weird legal requirements that demand stupid things like ""applicant's biological gender"". That leads to workarounds like this. The remaining times are corporate bureaucracy (the process to add a field might be easier than removing one) and malicious compliance by genuine bad actors who are only doing the minimum to avoid being sued.
*corporate ""inclusivity""* 👏
i think there was female, male, non binary, and trans
Not quite. Check out Affirmative Action. It makes one's race, sex, etc. relevant to the hiring process in an attempt to ensure that one's race, sex, etc. aren't used for discrimination. It makes sense when you don't think about it.
Sorry but you might want to rethink this position from the perspective of trans or nonbinary people who are under assault in these states. Unless you can guarantee anonymity this carries extreme risk.
insurance
I mean, if you split gender and sex there's still a problem that unless you put ""other"" your form will never be inclusive no matter what other options are
I think it’s meant to mean “sex” and “gender” but someone was unsure of what terms to use and so put “gender” for “sex” and then “gender designation” instead of just “gender”
I thought that too, I’d get if it was a medical form where that would be important, but for a job placement it seems arbitrary. Are there many jobs where AGAB would matter? I thought maybe a PE teacher if the school has split sex PE classes
tbh i don’t even get the intent of keeping both for a work form. my legal gender is “x” and my body is biologically “both” so i don’t know what answer they think i’m gonna give for “gender” lol
Then it should be ""Legal sex (as on your passport)"" and ""gender designation""
I edited it to clarify.
It's not relevant to a job.
Doctors don't assign ""non-binary""
ohhhh so gender is your identity and “gender designation” is your legal designation
From my understanding, affirmative action does not permit setting quotas or anything like that. It's just analyzing statistics about the hiring outcomes, and building strategies to perform more outreach for specified communities who are underrepresented in the field than expected. So basically any two applicants will have the same rigorous process to go through, be treated exactly the same, and have an accurate chance relative to their skillset and performance to receive the job. It does not make it easier for anybody to make it through after applying, it makes the employer try to get more applicants from underrepresented groups.

For example: an engineering company has a list of job openings, but they don't advertise them online, they only put up application info in a select few bars around the city, where people with similar race or sex or gender or economic background tend to flock to, but not much of anyone else. They might use affirmative action to set goals to advertise in more pubs which are more diverse in customer base, or begin recruiting online or at college events. That way more people even have an opportunity to go for the job, not that they'll have it any easier at all, that is not allowed.
This is actually part of why I grit my teeth and bear it when it comes to doing anything like changing my name on my license or birth certificate.  

Half Price Books tho is incredible from the corporate level when it comes to supporting LGBTQ people.
I’m gonna be honest, that doesn’t clear it up for me lol
I get that, I feel like there’s a big difference between the options “other” and “other, please specify”, one feels like it’s just lumping everything outside of the binary into one while the other seems more like it’s making an effort to be inclusive and allow people to inform of their self-identification. I’d get if people would think that it’s a bit of an intrusive question which could be rectified by a “prefer not to disclose” option
Bruh
I assume it ties into legal stuff, especially at a state or federal level. I can imagine certain things like SSN are tied to a binary identity still, so even if your work respects it, they still need to report the correct thing to the right agencies.
Not every place recognizes x, and this could also go for things like company insurance policies and such. Sex, as far as what is needed, is simply data here for one reason or another.

The only issue I have with this form, is how often these are actually just disguised ""Look at us! We are inclusive."". My work started polling data and really pushing inclusivity...while basically every supervisor is a bigot.  My direct supervisor went on a rant that could be summed up as keep your beliefs out of sight out-of mind
It should be ""legal gender"" and ""crime gender""
Well yes, that was established. I'm just saying that the continued existence of the question is a result of some haphazard requirements.
yes ofc!. It shouldn't be and that i say ""It shouldn't be"" instead of: ""it is not"", it's sad.

You wanna work here... hmmmm what does your Genitials looks like? do you even have one? like.. fuck off dude...
They do assign sex, and sometimes they'll use x
Here you go - a lot of complex history of Affirmative Action in the US is in the [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Affirmative_action_in_the_United_States) article. 


* In 1965, an executive order was signed that mandated federal contractors focused on equal opportunity employment - ie hiring minorities, in part, because they are minorities    
* In 1986, it was ruled by the US Supreme Court that race-based quotas were acceptable    
* In 1987, it was rules that sex and/or race were acceptable factors for job qualification   


Also read about [Gratz vs Bollinger](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gratz_v._Bollinger) - essentially, a point system was giving bonus points to minorities, which pushed out people who were more qualified, otherwise. This was in 2003, which is *somewhat* recent, in the grand scheme of things - this could have significantly affected the lives of us and our parents.

**BUT** Affirmative Action has gone through a lot of changes to make it more fair for everyone. So my info is outdated - it's not as bad as it was - but the fact that we treat people differently based on irrelevant physical characteristics still exists and it's still pretty fucked.

Edit: And to my original response, I was explaining why it's okay to ask one's biological sex, but not whether they want to have kids - because we've mandated it.
when you're married most people share insurance benefits
Then specifying should be optional too...
Yeah I know, feels like the “he a little confused but he got the spirit” with them realising there’s a difference but getting the terminology for it wrong
yeah i’m legally X, it’s just taking a while for all systems to catch up.
So I recently changed my name legally, and unlike my license, which numbers changed, the SS card didn’t. I guess it’s on a basis of truth. I did have issues when I put in my legal sex as F when I started my new job because it wasn’t legally that yet but that’s what I know on this
Yeah, I says it's for an I-9 form so it has to follow some unfortunate legal designations
gah i'm sorry your work is like that :( that really sucks. 

and yeah i definitely have a privilege where i live of being legally non-binary, and i've encountered systems where that's still not an option and then i legit don't know what i'm supposed to put.
Nerd gender and cool gender.
That's good! Now do it for everyone please! :)
It sucks that it's gotta be this way I'll say.
Ahhhhh now I getcha, thank you!
Wouldn’t it be made optional by a “prefer not to specify” option though? Or are you including that as a way of specifying itself?
Yeah but still, a quick Google search would've solved it
Are you from Argentina by any chance?
Ideally, the hiring process wouldn't ask for any irrelevant info until as late as possible because of the human condition and its biases.

Even someone's name can illicit prejudice, while ^obviously it has no effect on whether they can do a job.
Yes, I want an option of picking ""other"" without getting into details. Labels are really arbitrary
nah, usa
Yep
Ahhh I didn't know they had the X there too as we have here in our DNI."	zmudhp	NonBinary	1437	1.0	2022-12-15 19:55:41

the issue is that they're either a. a fucking dumbass or b. a fucking prick

Is it just me or is this dismissive? Email headline I saw the other day		"The whole tone of this email is yikes.
how to say you're creating a toxic workplace without saying you're creating a toxic workplace
[removed]
Sounds like an ad for one of those scam motivational courses. The headline is more stupid and ignorant than dismissive to me.
disci can go fuck plineself
Someone’s got a superiority complex!
Yikes. Big yikes.
Change the header to ""...wildly/inappropriate"" and before you send the reply
Honestly, that goes beyond dismissive. I would even call it just outright transphobia. That person seems just awful all around
[removed]
Yup r/onejoke
I hate the email
That's extremely insensitive, and there's literally no way that would make sense in any context. It's just bad. And the content of the email is also giving of ""I will not like working with this person"" vibes.

However, since this person sounds like someone I'd hate working with, I'd actually give them a big ole wallop of aggressive compliance. The person wants me to be disciplined? I'll make a point of it to use disci and pline as their pronouns in every single situation I can. You want to say something insensitive and nonsensical? Prepare for the consequences of your actions
When people say my pronouns are Disci/pline that just means they make fun of the concept of using pronouns and sound blatantly transphobic
Headline: Screw off.

Content: So even death is no barrier? Even the apocalypse? Well so much for asking what the sick day policy is.
Managing to be transphobic and ableist in the same message!
Honestly disci sounds like a person who doesn't understand that life happens. Fuck pline, maybe disci should get a letter from HR...
/r/MaliciousCompliance
Only refer to them as DISCI
Yiiiikes
I totally agree that joking like this about pronouns is dismissive or worse. I have heard of someone using nor/mal pronouns to make fun of how people say their pronouns. Nor seems like a jerk; I don't really like mal.
Hate when I see people making light of pronoun usage.
This email makes me salty.
It’s not you. It’s him. What a dick.
The sasspot in me wants to address the sender as such purely to see what happens. I see why people may feel the subject line is insensitive and it is, but I don't think there was any malice behind it. At least I hope not
Wow, my pronouns are toxic/work/environment/please/report/to/hr (/j pls don’t hurt me)
Repost this in r/WorkReform --they'll love it.
I mean, I don't inherently assume this is bigotry, but it's at *least* worrying levels of ignorance. But all of this sort of marketing is based on shocking people so I'm hardly surprised.
What in the cis nonsense
i don’t agree with joking about pronouns idk
Sounds like a tate enjoyer ngl
Didn’t even see the transphobic header at first I just thought that the email was extremely passive-aggressive and I hope you tell them that your problem is their disgusting attitude creating a hostile environment.
The whole email is garbage
Sounds like a Karen.
disci can fuck plineself
Everything is a massive red flag.
Stupid mocking tone of pronouns and the promotion of toxic workplaces. It's just bad all around
Dude report to HR if you can, this is disgusting and indicative of future behavior.
This is just transphobic honestly. It gives me the same vibes as people ""joking"", which means mocking trans people apparently, that ""they identify as a plant"" or an ""attack helicopter"". If this is a  colleague or boss or whatever, I think it would be wise to report this.
OP, please be careful of the coaching / self-help movement, it can be very detrimental to one's mental health.
The whole thing sped right past Dismissive, LLC and took a left at Yikes St on its way to downtown Grossville.
I thought this was on an ADHD thread but it's still angering even without it being on an ADHD subreddit
This person wants corporate slaves.  Let's not encourage these types of workplaces
Honestly that’s so bad it might even be discriminatory. That’s the worst email headline I’ve ever seen.
Ummmm yeah no, that’s very inappropriate
Call me a bigot, but I am not respecting their pronouns
🚩🚩🚩 Red flags everywhere! 🚩🚩🚩
I hate the recent trends in people just putting random words with a / and joking it’s pronouns
I hope you don’t know this person in real life
RUNNNN
What a limp dick
Ass/Hole
I hate when people do that and it happens ALL THE TIME
Am I the only that noticed it says it was sent by Tom Bilyeu?
It's stupid and ignorant, and sounds like it must be the beginning of a marketing email targeting the stupid and ignorant. 

I hope it's from a lifestyle brand that's really a vehicle to sell dodgy supplements and is secretly owned by deeply cynical lesbians who use the ugly marketing messages to make sure only ignorant jerks waste money on their useless and unhealthy products.

Yea disci is an actual fucking knob of rock wax, and I personally would appreciate it, seeing pline getting a basic understanding of respect for anyone that isn’t pline in the flesh. What a literal POS, oh wait nvm, because that would mean that disci is actually useful at something other than breathing
It's tacky for sure, the email as a whole is a bit cringy
Also, OP, you should blur the name of the sender.
""If you aren't a 10/10, you have a problem."" Oh? Such as you not paying me but expecting me to work anyway? Yes that is a big problem.
A galaxy of yikes
I’m the kind of person who fucks around, enjoys my time, and tries to be nice to everyone, and there’s nothing wrong with me.
Someone doesn't (want to) know what a pronoun is
That's disgusting. Anyway, now I'm trying to figure out how to use disci and pline as pronouns.

disci is over there. I saw pline earlier.
Hey Emailer... 2011 called. It wants it's dated joke back
This seems like a very toxic organization/person *seriously wtf is this shit*
Don’t even walk away, run far away from this company
“No matter what”

Yeah I don’t trust this person
When disci starts complaining about OP's reaction to pline's new policy: >:(
What is the context even?
You could try telling pline that disci might not understand pronouns probably. On the other hand that might offend pline and you should just start referring to pline by plines new pronouns as disci announced them per this email.

I'd start calling disci by disci's new pronouns. Gotta be respectful, right? /s
This whole email made me wanna puke
No.
Just no.
This is bad vibe.
My pronouns are they/them and I would say I’m at about a 5. If they want to fire me for that, that’s their problem.
ableist therefore also classist
The ""no matter what"" part is the problem. You must be willing to die. Naw dawg, no deal.
Ew
How nice of them to display so many red flags right upfront like that.

Not Sure I'd Say Dismissive, But It Definitely Sounds Stupid.
Write a long petty response where you refer to Pline as Disci/Pline
honestly, this whole e-mail is a soup sandwich
tom bilyeu fucking sucks, unsubscribe

That’s a double-barreled survey question
Yeah…. That no matter what part is what gave me workplace oriented PTSD and took my panic disorder from anxious but totally functional to permanently disabled. And that subject line? Just straight up disrespectful. Maybe you should start looking for another job.
Wow, toxic coaching/productivity mindset all the way!

I definitely read it as dismissive. Intentionally misusing the ""my pronouns are..."" format subtly invalidates it.

The most fun approach to challenge this that I've seen is to take people at their word. So if you have a reason to mention the author of the email, make sure to refer to pline by the correct pronouns!

As an aside, the core problem I see with people use the word ""discipline"" this way is that they've confused discipline with punishment. In many ways they're opposites. Discipline shares a word origin with ""disciple"". It's much more healthy to think about discipline as a devotional practice.
666th upvote B)
That definitely all came off as snarky and rude, especially the pronouns part at the top. Completely unecessary to the email.
Dude I hate people who say ""my pronouns are...*chops word in half*"" that's not how pronouns work.  I would literally use that when talking with Pline lmao. Disa is so rude saying that! That's what I would shoot back and if Pline ask why those words are being used like that say ""I'm just respecting your pronouns"". (See what I did there? Since I can't use real pronouns Disa didn't give any)
Tony bileu is definitely cringe and believes in all sorts of woo and pseudo science.

Pronouns are clearly Red/Flag
not just you
That's a really pretentious email from pline. Dici will have a hard time finding someone with THAT attitude.
Some people just suck. I, quite honestly, am not the most offended by faux pronoun jokes. It forces people who don't care about lbgtq people to learn enough to be in on the joke, while the 110% effort or you're trash mentality is irredeemably toxic in all forms.
There are red flags, and then there is a whole crimson parade of flags.  No-Prize to whomever guessed the answer here.
No, it’s not just you. This is gross.
It sounds like one of those people or companies who try way too hard to sound ""hip"" and ""young"" by making references that don't make any sense.
I thought we were on r/WorkReform to be honest.
How about a ""go fuck yourself, Tom"" followed by a 🚫
it gives me the vibes of a teacher trying to be cool by putting a minion meme in their google slides presentation. 
seems like they were trying to have some witty headline that related to the topic and this was the result
Today, I was reminded that I ""have a problem"" and it’s definitely helping getting me more motivated !
Lol, my name is Laura, but yeah that headline lacks... tact.
ehh yeah no
The letter itself, even without the questionable title, raises so many red flags. Like DISCI seems like the very kind of person to assume an overworked and exhausted worker is ideal for business so long as the money goes to PLINE.

Also, DISCI can just suck PLINES own ass if DISCI want to act like shit to you for pronouns.
A whole vat of yikes.
It has big ""Being a Life Coach is My New Bullying"" energy.
It's disgusting people are still like this. The header is gross and obnoxious but it's the email itself that's like literally EVERYWHERE in America.
Yuuuup. It's that textbook kind of smarmy over-familiar negging. OP, who is this creep and why are you getting his emails?
Yes, it's from Tom Bilyeu, who is a scammy business/life coach/guru.
Lol
Best comment 👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾
I’m too petty I would just reply with “lol”
Or ""not/impressed"", ""disa/ppointed""
Augh you’re right!!
Agreed. OP, if this person is at your workplace, you need to report them to HR - if someone sent an email like that at my workplace, they'd risk being terminated.
Yeah report them to HR so they can get what they want. Their pronouns may become Disci/plined
Transphobia and ableism! A twoferone!
I think a fun concept is to honor the claimed pronouns until they're forced to outright state that they do not actually use those neo-pronouns
Exactly. Use of inclusionary pronouns is not a joke, it’s not for someone to repurpose as humorous, and it contributes to the notion that non-gendered pronouns are not to be taken seriously.
I think you mean only refer to PLINE as DISCI. Tsk tsk
hey now, you just misgendered pline, disci doesn't use them

not cool /j
It's pline*
Or don't, that's a terrible sub.
I agree with it when its an actual joke made by people who understand how they work like the transfem chocolate joke or the enby samurai joke. This is just someone appropriating the transphobic ""pronouns are nor/mal"" ""identify as an attack helicopter""-esque ""jokes"" to make a stupid point for their dumb motivational email (or toxic work email, not sure which).
(I know this email contains those pronouns that aren’t pronouns, but I still think seeing people, that are….. not exactly gifted in anything other than the barest of bare bones, learn to respect people)

**You mean pline emails
I think there actually *are* people who use those kinds of pronouns, but I don't know for certain.
The ones that say “my pronouns are bro/dude” really piss me off because I’ve usually only seen it from assholes as a bullshit self defense comment when they get called out on misgendering someone else or being told someone’s pronouns
Probably because all their goals are still liberal-capitalist ones, just ones that are slightly nicer to workers
I don't have anything against work reform. I have something against /r/WorkReform (which is only slightly better than /r/antiwork).
I'd say, a universe of yikes.
God, I wish.
technically we have the subject and object forms of the email sender's pronouns, but we don't know the possessive form, which is what we're after here.

We could extrapolate a bit from what disci has said, and guess that the whole theme is that of being self-disciplined, meaning that the full layout of pronouns could be ""disci/pline/d"". In that case, d emails would be referred to as ""d emails"".

What do you have against it?

It's there, I promise, keep going . . .
Oo, I like this argument.
Some neopronouns are nouns. One example: meow/mew/meowself. Actual neopronouns that some people use.
Whether or not pronouns are a subtype of noun (""all pronouns are nouns, but not all nouns are pronouns"") is perhaps my favorite pedantic debate.  

For example, a personal pronoun can be substituted for a noun and a noun for a personal pronoun.  The case for a pronoun being a type of noun is quite strong.  By contrast a demonstrative pronoun (this, that, these, and those) is substituted for an entire noun phase (e.g. ""**This** shirt might drop the pronoun by writing it as ""**The black shirt**."")  In any event, a pronoun performs the function of a noun *or* a noun phase, so I don't see any reason why one could not yoke a noun into service as a pronoun.  After all, English is happy to turn the noun table into the verb tabled.

The only catch to such a use is that it might lead to confusion.  The noun *king* might a regular noun (a male monarch) or a proper noun (a person *named* King).  Here confusion is headed off rather easily when writing.  ""Go and see the king,"" would be directing a person to a specific male monarch.   ""Go and see King,"" would be directing a person *named* King, a fact made obvious with capitalization.  ""Kelly went to the store, and king bought a loaf of bread"" is using the word king as a personal pronoun, but I don't think that it would be obvious outside the context of this post.  I think the average reader would first think that king is used as the noun in a clumsy and incorrect way.  A *listener* might interpret such a sentence as ""Kelly went to the store and King bought bread.""  

So I suppose the point I seem to be trying to make (I did not intend to do so when I set out) is that using a noun as a pronoun likely *is* problematic.  While I think the rules of the language allow for such a thing, it would be too likely to confuse to be of practical use.  A neopronoun such as *hir* at least looks and sounds very similar to an existing pronoun, which would help inform people of the use.  (Which itself could be a problem.  After all, a person hearing the word hir might think they are hearing the word *her* because they are so close in pronunciation!)
Liberal capitalism isn't leftism. At all.
I'd say maybe a multi-verse of multi-yikes
The setup. The execution of the joke. Fucking phenomenal.

17/10
HAHAHAHAHA that was excellent ❤️❤️❤️
Thank you! Alternate possessive forms might include ""ary"" or ""arian"" but would require changes to the object form of the pronoun to ""plin"".

Nobody cares, that's just semantics.
That is very clever :)
Both are neo pronouns, it’s just that meow/mew and others are neo pronouns based on xenogenders. Xenogenders are based on concepts not typically associated with gender, like animals, plants, abstract things like weather and color. 

I agree that they’re shocking to hear, I have trouble understanding them but it’s not my business to understand. If it makes them feel good, why not?
I think neo-pronouns are somewhat inevitable. Like as we expand our ideas of what gender is that must mean that we expand the way that we talk about it. 

That being said, I feel kinda similar.
>Well it's really only problematic because the world at large won't take you seriously

I'd disagree, actually.  People who argue that they/them is incorrect are obviously mistaken, but that is because they are improperly expressing their objection.  (To be clear:  I am being charitable by supposing that the objector is doing so for pedantic rather than bigoted reasons.)  Singular they and them are ancient, but they are often used in an impersonal case where they refer to a known that we know little about.  Using it in the personal case where we *do* know stuff about the noun is allowed, but uncommon.  Most people aren't sitting here dissecting sentences and so when considering whether grammar is correct or incorrect will tend to rely on nothing more than familiarity.  Most of the grammar we read or hear *is* more or less correct, so when something sounds odd, there is a good chance that it is *incorrect*.  ""Steve went to the store and bought his self a bottle of milk,"" is an example of a sentence that sounds odd and yet...is it in error?  

A word being unfamiliar or being used in an unfamiliar way has a legitimate problem when it comes to *comprehending the idea they are meant to express*.  Such words have difficulty fulfilling their essential function of conveying information.  ""Susan went to the store and slabash bought bread,"" is an example.  I made up the word slabash (pronounced ""Slh-AH-bsh"").  Written here, you can suppose it is not a proper noun, but if I spoke the line you'd not even have that much to go on.  If you dissected the sentence, you would note that it appears to be performing the function of a noun, so it could be that *or* a pronoun.  Even if great care is taken, I've not given you enough information to conclusively determine the word's meaning!  Alternatively, ""Kelly went to the store and king bought bread,"" is similarly confusing.  Again, we can determine that king is not a proper noun but is performing the function *of* a noun.  What's more, we know that the word king in this case means ""male monarch"".  And yet ""Kelly went to the store and male monarch bought bread"" is clearly incorrect because we lack the article required to complete the noun phrase.  Again, no one is likely going to dissect a sentence like this and would instead note that it *seems weird* and conclude that I've made a mistake.  A person might suppose that slabash is a proper noun - someone's name - if hearing the previous sentence, and could very readily suppose the same in written form, guessing I've simply committed a typo.

Of course such challenges are hardly insurmountable.  All words were unfamiliar at some point in their history.  But this process takes time.  Email has existed as a concept for more than half a century now and in that time has been called electronic mail, e-mail, and email.  Even now all three are acceptable.  Language when considered across the entire speaking population evolves *slowly*.  So *we* aren't confused by they/them and are much less likely to be confused by many neopronouns, but that is because we are immersed in a community that uses these words in new and novel ways.  The world at large does not.  

tl;dr - there are reasons beyond bigotry that cause issues with pronouns.
I suppose centuries of political theory could be called ""semantics""
Arguing about what is or isn't capitalism or leftism or whatever is semantics. Arguing about the ramifications of phenomenons associated with those concepts is not. You are only doing the former, which is pointless, while political theory does the latter, which is actually useful (and only uses semantics to illustrate a point, not to be the point itself)."	11afhx7	NonBinary	1376	0.99	2023-02-24 02:00:04
Just a quick psa for you peeps		"In support of the english language, but also myself, please use ""neither he nor she"" to refer to me.
Roses are red,  
Violets are blue,  
Singular they  
Predates singular you.

Seriously. Chaucer used singular they in The Canterbury Tales way back in the 1300s, and it was presumably in use for longer that that. Back in those days, ""you"" was actually strictly plural; it was directed at a specific group of people. If you wanted to refer to a single person directly, you'd say ""thou"". Or ""they"", if you were speaking of an individual to someone else.
They are wrong, as the Oxford English Dictionary explains in https://public.oed.com/blog/a-brief-history-of-singular-they/. Besides the historical usage, use of singular they for non-binary people has become a part of the evolving language. As the article concludes: “Even people who object to singular *they* as a grammatical error use it themselves when they’re not looking, a sure sign that anyone who objects to singular *they* is, if not a fool or an idiot, at least hopelessly out of date.”
When someone says something like that to me, I say something like this and then sit back and wait for the penny to drop…

I know a teacher like that. They never use the correct pronouns and they always say to me, “if I met a person claiming to be non-binary, I’d never be able to use their correct pronouns because they can’t expect me to use ‘they/them’. They would just have to put up with that because they are wrong - ‘they/them’ are not singular pronouns.”
😂 In junior high people called me ""hesh"" from ""he/she"" (because the teachers had objected to their first choice of ""it"") and I knew it was supposed to be bad but couldn't even mind.
such an annoying non-debate
So many teachers are wrong about this. It's fucking pathetic, honestly. It's terribly sad, too, but it's more infuriating than sad. These people shouldn't be teachers. It is forgivable to be grammatically incorrect sometimes, but those who refuse to look into this particular issue and admit fault are bigots who just want a reason to invalidate non-binary people.
Despite the fact that the rules of grammar are presented as if they were as real and rigid as forge-hardened steel, they are merely *conventions*.  For example, one should never end a sentence in a preposition - or so the rule goes.  And yet one can break this rule by saying ""welcome aboard"".  Aboard *what*, though?  That uncertainty is frail logic supporting the rule.  ""Welcome aboard the ship"" removes this uncertainty.  After all, the function of a preposition is to describe the relationship between a noun and some other word or phrase.  And yet this amended sentence still breaks another rule since it lacks a subject.  ""Welcome aboard the ship, Carl"" resolves that difficulty.

But here's the thing:  if Carl is boarding a ship and steward third-class Aspen looks directly at them and jauntily belts out ""welcome aboard!"", Carl isn't going to be confused at all.  The subject and pesky noun that we're supposed to be yoking that to with a preposition are handily handled by context.  If Aspen instead said ""welcome aboard the ship"", it'd feel a little odd.  What the hell else was Carl boarding?  And to tack Carl's name on the end just makes it *weird*.  Supposing that Carl has never met steward third-class Aspen - a fair guess since we have no reason to suspect that Carl is on the crew of a ship large enough to require *multiple tiers* of stewards - Carl is likely to spend at least a few minutes puzzling over how Aspen knew his name.  

Ignoring the oddity of how Aspen knows Carl's name - something that'd likely occupy Carl's mind for at least a few minutes as he makes his way to his room among the thousands of other people boarding the cruise liner - we find that Aspen actually managed to break yet another rule by using more words than were required to get the idea across.    ""Welcome aboard"" conveys the idea with perfect efficiency. 

Using ""he or she"" is a case of spending three words when a single word would do the trick.  The singular form of they is positively *ancient* after all.  What's more, using ""they"" in place of ""he or she"" covers the most common use case of singular they:  when the singular noun-bearer in question is indeterminate.  ""A person boarded a ship and they were warmly greeted by one of its many stewards,"" is a fine example.  But if I rewrite it as ""A person boarded a ship and he or she was warmly greeted by one of its many stewards,"" you'll likely note that it feels *wrong* somehow.  This is likely you stumbling over that oddly complex ""he or she"".  You are likely to do this *even if you don't know about the rule*. 

And that brings us to the wider point.  Singular they, much like plural they, is so common that it is nearly invisible.  There literally isn't a rule that says ""Sara went to the pier where they boarded a ship"" is incorrect.  A great many readers are inclined to argue otherwise.  The reason is simple enough:  Sara is traditionally a feminine name and so we *expect* a feminine pronoun.  *99% of people named Sara* would want you to use a she in that sentence, much like 99% of people named John would prefer that we use he instead.  Most people prefer to use *gendered language*.  Sara being a they isn't against the rules - we've followed all of them to the letter - but it will still tend to sound *wrong* for no other reason than the fact that it is an uncommon use case.

The rules of writing are built from *convention*, usually with the aim of improving clarity.  Convention is just the common-case.  As such it is really no surprise to me that people argue that using they in the singular and specific case breaks a rule because it is *uncommon* - that is to say that it is *unconventional*.  It will sound *wrong* despite being perfectly, precisely correct given that Sara is *agender*.  And so here is the actual important bit:  language exists to communicate ideas, and sometimes that means that you have to use it in *unconventional* ways.
""He or she"" has TWO WHOLE SYLLABLES more than a singular ""they."" I will not stand for this.
Wow, that’s so much more convenient!
In support of the English language I’m going to say that language is fluid and personal and if somebody tells me that I’m supposed to say something a certain way because that’s the way the English language works, as a person with two English degrees I would tell them to fuck off
[deleted]
BA in Linguistics here and can confirm singular they is not new or grammatically incorrect. And even if it was incorrect, that doesn’t mean it always will be. Language has and always will evolve with time. “Correct/incorrect” language is completely arbitrary. The function of language is to convey meaning. If you’re doing that, then you’re using it correctly.
i just found someones wallet on the floor they must have dropped it ill go put it in the lost and found

THEY MUST HAVE DROPPED ITTT 

TTHHHHEEEEEYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYY
These stories always take me back to an afternoon when I was in university. I was walking across campus with my linguistics professor when we encountered a group of people savagely beating a prescriptivist. Alarmed, I cried, “Oh my god, we have to help!”. My professor calmly observed the scene for a few moments before concluding, “Nah, six should be enough.”
As an English Lit student… I’m here for all you lot grammatically correcting the incorrect grammar 😂
This is blatantly not true and *so incredibly easy* to disproved it’s ridiculous. But here’s a gem for y’all: thon.

Linked below:
https://www.merriam-webster.com/words-at-play/third-person-gender-neutral-pronoun-thon

“Thon is thought to be a contracted form of ""that one,"" and was coined in 1858 by Charles Crozat Converse. An attorney and composer, Converse invented more than words; he submitted a claim in 1863 to Scientific American that he had designed a new sort of mangle (“a machine for ironing laundry by passing it between heated rollers”). Converse is remembered more these days for his linguistic contributions than for his laundering ones.

The initial reason that thon caught on was that one or more of the editors at Funk and Wagnalls took a shine to the word, and around the turn of the 19th and 20th century it was included in their dictionary.

thon. Pronoun of the 3rd person, common gender, meaning “that one, he she, or it”: a neoterism proposed by Charles Crozat Converse, and apparently complying with the neoteristic canons, since it supplies an antecedent blank, obeys a simple and obvious analogy, and is euphonious.
—Funk and Wagnalls, Supplement to A Standard Dictionary of the English Language, 1903

The word remained in various Funk and Wagnalls publications for much of the 20th century, and also saw inclusion in another dictionary, Merriam-Webster’s Second New International Dictionary (1934), although it was defined slightly less fulsomely (“A proposed genderless pronoun of the third person”). The genderless pronoun sense of thon did not last as long in Merriam-Webster’s dictionaries as it had in Funk and Wagnalls, and the entry was dropped for the third edition of our Unabridged dictionary, published in 1961.” Etc. Etc. Read on!

The whole article is great though, and thon was only dropped from lacking common use. So use it!

I would also like to purpose the formal “ser’am” for addressing people. Sir+ma’am but with an “e”?! I know, brilliant. If this already exists, great. I love it. If not, let me found this word this day!

Please refer to me as [https://www.merriam-webster.com/words-at-play/singular-nonbinary-they](https://www.merriam-webster.com/words-at-play/singular-nonbinary-they). Yes, if you're going to be a dick about not refering to me by they/them, you might as well use the web address of the Merriam-Webster (yes the DICTIONARY) article on why it's not grammatically incorrect to have basic respect towards me as my pronoun and if you use neither I will find you and shove your foot into your mouth.
There are many words that are used in both a singular and plural ways, so it’s not a contradiction. Example: “You are here today because you want to change your life.” The speaker here could be talking to one person, or an entire room full of people (This is also the case in many other languages). 

Plus, “they” to refer to one person has existed even before Shakespears time, and has been continuously used by many famous authors in later eras.
My lit 90 prof back in community college pulled the same thing. Sucks
This is like when I put two Prefered names I want to be called occasionally on my sign in sheet at my eye doctor and they just call me one name that I was experimenting with and use Wong pronouns like aways
People will state their pronouns then say they don’t use pronouns and think they’re stupid. They will literally use they in the next sentence to describe someone they don’t know the gender of.
""Wow, what a perfectly natural sentence, definitely how people talk in real life!""
Jokes aside, thy professor is an illiterate fool.
As an english teacher they should know that when you don't know someone's gender you generally use they in context. Like with babies people will generally say ""they are so cute"" not ""he or she is so cute"" as at that point you would have just picked/guessed a gender instead of going through the trouble of saying ""he or she""
This is so petty and I love it.
Prof needs to learn that in English, the rules are made up and the points don't matter.
i thought this may have been r/facepalm lol what a clusterfuck of a paragraph
i wish people would just use they/them. getting tired of this cis nonsense
Exactly, what is it with people saying he or she instead of just they? (When referring to someone where the gender is not specified) like, just say they, more inclusive and easier to say.
HAHAHA amazing.
This would be a great conversation to have with the provost and if they are busy perhaps a lawyer, and maybe phrase it as such.
I had a teacher like that in 7th grade, and I stated my point, and later she realized I was right and apologized a few days later.
*ni femme, ni homme*

literally a centuries-old line of French poetry

we're not a ""new phenomenon""
Hello! Today I met a person who goes by MarsicusOrion. Neither he nor she has a wonderful personality. That smile of neither his nor hers makes me happy. I could talk to neither him or her all day, although neither he nor she doesn’t talk about neither himself nor herself much. I wonder if this day of neither his nor hers has been wonderful. I hope so!
Idk how these people put on **a pair of pants** in the morning without having a grammatical meltdown.
Came here to say this.
I knew I'd heard something about singular they predating plural they, but I couldn't remember what it was.
If Chaucers name was a name of one of the houses in my secondary school then he knows what he's doing, if he in old England used they then a teacher nowadays should bloody well use it!
Roses are red
Violets are blue
Respect singular they
Or fuck you.
English degree here. The above is correct. A lot of teachers like to be snotty about this in particular, but they are factually incorrect.
How people can say stuff like this and not realise how stupid it sounds baffles me endlessly
*won't use they/them to respect enbies*

*uses they/them to describe enby*

I really hope that's at least semi verbatim and you argued back that they literally JUST DID THAT lol
Accidentally still not misgendering you even while actively being transphobic… amazing
wake up babe new neopronoun just dropped
It’s also sad because the refusal to accept a simple give and take of personal and positive progress continues to limit others’ thinking and discourage play, killing artistic thoughts before they’ve even had a chance to emerge, not to mention ruling language usage within the basis of keeping things “correct” attacks anyone who learned language differently and forces those people to bend to the will of a predetermined “correctness” rather than communicating in ways that make more sense to them: furthering language in their own ways.
please say this exactly if you ever meet an english teacher thinking singular they is incorrect 'cause that will shut their mouth for sure.
Also can I use this next time my teacher uses ""he or she ""in a sentence?
I don't think comp one is computers

Maybe composition?
Wow that is quite a story

I can only afford one pant. Times are hard.
They must start sweating whenever anyone talks about deer, sheep, fish, bison, etc.
YES, it was legitimately one of the more affirming things in my life at the time. They were still terrible people but they missed the bullying mark so hard that they actually ended up being kind of supportive.
You are free to use what I've written however you wish.  However, if you want to *maximize* the cattiness, might I suggest handing out a copy of [The Elements of Style](https://www.amazon.com/Elements-Style-Fourth-William-Strunk/dp/020530902X)?  It is an ancient work - more than a hundred years old - and still considered one of the best books ever written on the subject of writing well.  You can read the full text of it [here](http://www.jlakes.org/ch/web/The-elements-of-style.pdf)

The principle of using fewer words is important and essential enough that it makes an appearance in the *introduction* to the modern imprint:

""Vigorous writing is concise.  A sentence should contain no unnecessary words, a paragraph no unnecessary sentences, for the same reason that a drawing should have no unnecessary lines and a machine no unnecessary parts.  This requires not that the writer make all sentences short or avoid all detail and treat subjects only in outline, but that every word tell.""

This is the 17th element presented in the work.

(I should note that this suggestion is a *joke* and I'd not recommend it.  This 104 year old book is commonly assigned to people seeking degrees in English.  To present it would be seen (quite rightly, I might add) as an indictment that they've no clue what they're talking about.  It'd likely be taken as an insult, and, as a rule, you should avoid insulting people who have the power to make your life miserable.)
I thought it was Baudelaire but it was Swinburne just randomly writing shit in French for no clear reason XDDDDDD
I have it in Songs for the Senses but that's not a real publication, that was a custom issuance, hold on, it might be a baudelaire quote from a letter that swinburne was referencing, they were friends/rivals/possibly lovers/definitely drinking buddies.
You guys can afford pants?
No, they can only afford pant

i fucking hate people	so i work at spencer’s right, and this older couple comes up to me asking if we have any small rainbow flags. i tell them no, sadly we only have small non-binary flags left. the man asks what non-binary is, so i explain, and in response he laughs in my fucking face??? keep in mind, i’m wearing a non-binary flag beanie, i have a non-binary pin, AND my pronouns on my lanyard. im already having a horrible day, it’s shipment day and it’s been fucking packed all day and this is the biggest shipment we’ve ever had. that remark genuinely set me over the edge and now i’m in the bathroom crying lol	"When I was young being gay or lesbian was offensive to the straight people.  Now there is a month of pride.  You exposed them to something new.  Sometimes a person's reaction is to laugh at things they don't understand.  You were brave.  What they do with this new knowledge is on them.  Thank you for teaching the Cis people.  Be you!
Im so sorry to hear that. I was at hot topic ( as a masc presenting NB) shopping for new clothes for fem stuff for  school. These people,  very clearly in there 50s, starts to destroy a fellow NB. Understandingy, I rushed over to help them. I hope they are doing well.
Ugh, that sucks. I used to work at an ice cream place, where I mostly sold sugar to cranky Floridians on vacation. Can't tell you the number of times crusty old Republicans would intentionally misgender me because I was...AFAB and had short hair. A person just existing was enough to set them off. Somedays I could give as good as I got, and others were like ""oh, this part of why LGBTQIA suicides are high"". 

When I have rough gender days, which thankfully is pretty infrequent lately, I watch an episode of something like Owl House or Schitt's Creek. Stuff where homophobia and transphobia just don't exist. Or I'll look up YouTube videos of Alok Vaid-Menon or Jonathan Van Ness. People who make me hopeful about the future while validating some of m6 current struggles.
fuck im so sorry that happened, people are dumbasses
I think its so cool you have your pronouns on your lanyard! After seeing half a dozen or so people doing this I finally very recently started putting my pronouns on my name tag. I'm pretty socially anxious so I knever told any of those inspirational people what seeing their pronouns meant to me. I bet you make nonbinary people who come into your store and see you feel awesome.
UGH I’m sorry people really suck sometimes. That’s just awful and you didn’t deserve that in any way :(((
I’m so sorry about that happening to you :/ slightly off topic tho, do you like working at Spencer’s?
Oh no! I'm so sorry that happened people are so shitty.
Why can’t people just be respectful and not laugh at someone’s identity in their face??
It takes some skill to be that guy. I'm impressed. I take it he came up to you on all fours? After all, there's no way something with that small a brain could do the calculations to balance on two feet.
Man go follow there car and go throw a eggs at there house and dip
I had a similar experience at my job. I wear my pronouns at work and a young girl talked to her grandad about how cool and brave it was. He then came over and asked me about it and I politely explained and he made an attack helicopter joke.

My manager came over in case he needed to defend me and calm me down. Girl was telling her grandad off while I stood there calmly with eyes like ice. He went ""see she doesn't mind"". To which my response was ""they do, but I've heard all the jokes and have no energy to entertain it today"". I sent him into his film, thanked his granddaughter for being an ally and got on with my day.

The people that don't want to understand will either lose family or die off soon anyway. All we have to do is wait.
I’m sorry love, you’re very valid❤️
WHO let the bigots into that hot topic 😡😡😡 exit our sanctuary IMMEDIATELY
Sorry
I also hate these people but it's really cool that you work at spencer's
I'm so sorry that happened to you. Customers can be real shitheels.
That sucks im sorry
i am so sorry to hear this. people are delusional and rude!
same thing happened to me when i posted something with my avatar on r/gocommitdie, needless to say the people in the comments constantly shit on me because of my pride flag
That would press my defiant little buttons. Mm, makes me wanna chew that guy out.
It shouldn't be your responsibility to teach the straights when Wikipedia and Google are free, but you did. Their reaction says infinitely more about them than you
Oh my god. I'm so sorry. People are so insensitive and fucking rude. I don't understand why people can't just respect others. Even if they don't understand. Even if it doesn't make sense to them at the moment, there's no fucking reason to laugh when you're learning about an identity you don't relate to. You are valid, I'm sorry you went through this.
Bruh wtf. Who in the world would life at you like that?!
This may not be the case, however it could be that when he laughed he was laughing in pleasant surprise, like a celebration. Sometimes when I encounter something unexpected I laugh, not to be mean but to express gratitude and appreciation for life. In some situations it may not seem ""appropriate,"" however that tends to be an perspective held by people who don't often find reasons to laugh. 

To be clear, I am not dismissing your feelings or perspective. I don't have a way of confirming the spirit in which he laughed, and not everyone laughs in surprise. It could very well be that he thought the idea of gender non-conformity amusing rather than something worthy of respect. I'm simply offering another potential perspective.
Hope your feeling better OP <3 <3 <3
Sounds like a rough day. I hope everything turns around for you
Working retail is the fucking worst.
Yeah that shit pisses me off when peo do that especially my parent, like my dad will go on full rants about it and my mother will make snippy comm about it making it less easy to come out.
Assholes gonna be assholes!
I mean doesn't that qualify as becoming baligrant or rude can't you at this point I don't know redirect the customer out of the store and tell them they are no longer welcome.
You hate some people. Me too
Not to defend their behavior too much, but maybe the way you explained nonbinary was wrong in the context. Idk, I definitely see that different explanations are necessary for different people. If you went with some ""people who don't identify with being a man or a woman"" or ""outside the gender binary"" can simply be too vague for someone completely unfamiliar with the topic. It's like the explaining evolution 200 years ago and people going ""I didn't come from monkeys"".
What a douche, why’s he laughing when he’s the dipshit who not only doesn’t know what that is, but knows so little that he’s surprised to see a non cis person working in a place like Spencer’s (dunno what it’s like at your store but it was known as a place trans, gnc, and non cishet folks in general were when I was growing up). I think ppl like that are currently over-compensating with even more blatant mocking and assholery towards us because underneath the bravado they’re realizing they’re wrong.
pronouns on a lanyard 🗿
thank you 🥹🥹 that honestly makes me feel a whole lot better about it. in retrospect i was overreacting a bit but stressful days will do that to you
When I was young we were still getting pistol whipped to death for being gay.

All-in-all, we’ve come pretty far… Just gotta get the rest of the way. Now is not the time to lose hope or focus.
omg that’s horrible!! i hope they’re doing well too :(
Wtf what happened?
destroy them? Like yell at them or physically hurt them?! wtf?!
Literally Owl House is how I coped through dysphoria today it’s amazing
OMFG soOO many ppl here in florida always emphasizes to call me ""ma'am"" way more as of recent after NB became more well known, a lot of it had to do with me cross dressing, it's honestly annoying
that’s a great idea :) i’ll try that right now 

no but fr i worked in food service before and i wish so badly it was legal to spit in stupid peoples food
The intentional misgendering is so fucking dumb. When I was a cashier a guy saw my pronoun pin and kept looking me straight in the eyes and saying ""ma'am"" in this dramatic tone after every sentence. 🙄🙄🙄

JVN is one of my comfort people as well. 🥰 She's so beautiful and has such a healing energy. I'm so thankful they're a public figure because he helped me come out to myself 😭
I also find that lgbtq inclusive and positive media help balance out the unpleasantness. 

I'd add The Penumbra Podcast and Dimension 20 to the list.
i will cry rn omg that is the best thing to hear. it’s so scary being as out as i am but the fact that i can inspire people like you make it worth it, i hope nobody gives you shit! you’re awesome
yes i do!! most people are very nice and have great vibes. 

all my coworkers are in some way alternative and LGBT+ and so am i, so even though i haven’t worked there as long as everyone else they accepted me with open arms. i’m pretty close with most of my coworkers already. 

plus everyday you leave you have a new crazy story to tell LOL. like we have a guy who comes in every single sunday to buy a pocket 🐱. we found out after he denied toy cleaner everytime that he USES A NEW ONE 5 TIMES A DAY, 7 DAYS A WEEK AND HE BUYS A NEW ONE EACH WEEK BC THEY END UP DESTROYED.
it’s a party for sure.
LMAOOO
bruh wtf that’s dumb asffff
it sadly seemed like the latter, but i appreciate your point of view. :)
i am! everyone’s love on here lifted me up a whole lot. i’m so glad to have a community like this <3
Nah, this is too much defense. Asking for an explanation and laughing at the answer you get is rude, period.
I'm gonna go a kinda big sibling on you if that's alright, if not, just disregard my comment: You weren't overreacting. It sounds like you were overwhelmed and that's okay to feel that, especially on stressful days. <3 your identity is valid and your feelings are valid and don't let anyone else tell you otherwise
You were not overreacting!! They laughed in your face over something that's an integral part of you that took bravery to come out with. That's hurtful!
People are scared and ridicule what they don’t know, plus, some “allies” are pretty gross acting. Be yourself, accept that, and don’t ask for permission to be yourself. Sorry this happened, but until people catch on that “this isn’t a phase, mom”, it may happen more. You’re valid, trust that.
They started disintegrating them with their mind beams, but thankfully u/local_ENBY06 came in at the last second
They were yelling at them, and starting to threaten to physically hit them.
Owl House and Amphibia are what I'm watching while I wait for this bout of food poisoning to clear. Definitely great comfort shows. I love that kid's shoes have such great representation these days. God knows more adults could benefit from them.
I wonder if they think you're a trans woman and are trying (ineffectually) to be respectful?

Also, the ma'am/sir problem for enbies is real. There just isn't an equivalent non-gendered term. ""Friend"" doesn't have the respect connotation, and ""comrade"" makes one think of Russia.
Food service is definitely a special hell. I'm pretty happy to be in healthcare now. The fact that my job now involves counseling trans folks who are on hrt is really validating. When work does suck, there's Our Flag Means Death.
Some people have been kind of rude, others havent acknowledged it at all, others have been really cool about it, but a few weeks ago since I was out to my boss they felt comfortable coming out to me as they had just realized they were nonbinary, i spent years at this job feeling too scared to tell anyone at all and they felt like there was someone there to support them day 1, it honestly felt pretty great so I try to focus on that when other people at work get me down.
That sounds amazing!! I actually asked cause I have an interview at the store where I love tomorrow :) it’s good to know that it’s an enjoyable place!!
OMG you wouldn’t believe what some customers at my store do, I had this one guy DEMAND that I accept a return for this stroker that was obviously USED, not to mention the whole bag he had brought it into the store was sopping WET with god knows what 😭😭😭

He wouldn’t accept making an exchange instead until I got my boss involved too (I’m already in a management position, however this guy wouldn’t listen to me after I explained our policy on these things… he may have thought he had leverage over me since I’m pretty obviously queer, this guy struck me as homophobic asshole 🙄🙄)

The list of crazy stories goes on lmao
im replacing my account so the last thing i do will be giving you a silver award
thank you so much <33 🥹
what an incredible rescue effort, I couldn’t imagine recovering from near disintegration but hopefully they’re healing up okay after being blasted with so many mind beams
jesus christ, it’s so spooky out here for our community, I’ve had people following me and pulling weapons on me while they said “people like you need to die” and shit
I meant to say shows, but shoes works too.
mayybe but i look cis since i still present somewhat femininly (at least as of recent more comfortable with that) , i have booba and i'm 17 and look young so like they couldn't really think i have had any surgery either (especially with the political state here ik it's harder for trans people now), but yea i mean maybe that's the possibility? still hurts 😭
trust me, you’ll love it. good luck at your interview!! :)
EWWWW OMFG THATS AWFUL
OMG THANK YOU SO MUCH :D
Absolutely it would. I'm sorry it happened. You are valid just as you are.
Thank you!!

Truth!!		"I feel like the people who make the biggest effort not to respect pronouns are the ones that would be the most offended if you used the wrong ones for them.
Agreed. 

My absolute favorite Blaire White moment was when she made Ben Shapiro admit that he should use a trans woman’s correct pronouns in a social setting.
No, the nonbinary people are just gonna stop talking to you or coming home for the holidays. You played yourselves.
Source: am the nonbinary people.
They just do it to make the queer person feel ashamed of themselves, I think. Ashamed for being different, I hate that.
My coworker is like this. We recently had a new MtF girl start with us and coworker REFUSED to use female pronouns. I said exactly that to her: that she's being an immature child and we (and HR) would VERY MUCH welcome her finding someplace else to work if that is going to be her attitude.
An overwhelming number of bigots are immature.
When you meet someone who ""doesn't use pronouns"", say, that's cool. And use only the pronouns they don't prefer with them. Call dudebro ""sis"". It's *fun*.
Sounds like this goes both ways
Or will bend over backwards apologizing if they thought you were cis-gender and accidentally misgendered you
They’re both the same side of the shit stick but definitely a rare W for Blaire.
Happy Cake Day!
You don’t have to love somebody’s every viewpoint to watch their stuff. 

Like Joe Rogan… I disagree with him about half the time. But I’m not watching JRE to watch Joe. It’s about the guest, not him. 

I would never have “met” awesome people like Jewel, David Choe, and Forrest Galante if I refused to watch JRE.

That said, Blair is a lot more politically centered than Ben. I have a lot of respect for her, because she’s the person who gave me the courage to transition. I thought trans people were ideologically homogeneous until I found her videos."	xdhwi9	NonBinary	1279	1.0	2022-09-13 20:36:25
Today I asked people on social media to use they/them pronouns for me and am feeling super anxious. but this fit makes me feel like a rockstar 🖤🖤		"you are a rockstar!!!
That's fantastic! It's been a hard journey to get me to ask anyone to use a different name/pronoun and I tend to be overly self-effacing about it. You are an inspiration!

Plus, rock that look. I try to avoid complimenting features people are born with, rather than choose, but your eyebrows are also rockstars. Not to draw one iota away from that amazing outfit.
Proud of you! <3
Congratulations!
Too  much style for one person. I'm in awe,
ace colours ace colours

Love the triangle earring!
You look so good
You look incredible!!❤️
You look so stylish! I love your hair and style!
Don't be surprised if people assume you are one and ask for autographs.
thank youuuu 😭💕
aw thank you! I was really lucky to have some close people pick up my pronouns right away. But I still struggle a lot with people I don't know well.

And the eyebrows are a combination of genetics and effort. So I will definitely take that compliment! 😁
aw you're too kind ☺️☺️
yessss! ace nonbinary people 💜💜
thank you! yes I feel very lucky that the ace flag is so good haha
Fantastic! I usually feel really awkward complimenting people on genetics, since it's not anything they had any control over. But yeah, I was totally envious of your brows.
Totally understand that as a general practice!
And I actually do use some brow products to spruce them up. So it's not all genetics haha"	mn38qw	NonBinary	1255	1.0	2021-04-08 22:29:05
Validating neighbor		"My first thoughts: heartwarming... cool neighbours to have, surrounding the home with positive, uplifting energy...
That Ending Is Classic. ""Good Talk, I'm Gonna Go Get Pet A Dog Now.""
I love validating old people. It’s just so sweet!
I love this its very heartwarming
I doubt old people would say pupper
Am shitting myself at OP awakening an elderly persons understanding of non-binary and also that elderly person responding with basically “actually yeah dude same”, because that’s the exact same way I came to understanding I’m NB. Lol love it.
Soooo cute 😻 I love your neighbors for being so supportive and understanding 🥰
Omg please GIVE THEM YOUR HAT! (or get them one for themselves) How wholesome.
and then everybody clapped
r/thatHappened

People aren't that kind. Full stop.
Yeah, and I hear people saying often ""I am too old to understand."" when it comes to gender, but here is a person whom is old and they are like ""that is so cool.""
my second one:

""I diagnose you with egg."" (to the elderly neighbor)
it was surprising to say the least.
My MIL is in her 70s and calls all dogs puppies and puppers. Picked it up from me and my niece lol. Anyone who has regular contact with someone else will pick up at least a bit of their slang and mannerisms. Usually without even realizing.
That's what my grandfather calls dogs 🤷‍♂️
Not sure how many people you know, but I know a lot that say it. It comes from the baby talk part. ""who is the cutest pupper wuppers."" ..... really I have no idea why they say stuff like that to dogs in baby talk
Aww people thinking their generation invented everything… you know pet/baby names for animals and small children have been used for generations right? Probably since humans started using language…
yeah, and anyone would remember this long a conversation word by word. Nice story though.
Wow, I really didn't think about that part of it. Glad for your buddy.
i can make it, it is just a bit of work. embroidery.
Why would everyone clap? It was a convo between 3 peeps.
Yeah, this. Never happened. People aren't like that.
this is just not true. people can be nice, and even old people can be non homophobic. woww, shocker
now I am just sad for you.
That sounds like my family. My mom usually corrects herself but my dad uses the ""old"" card. I get referring to me as my AGAB for several decades makes it easy to mess up but all I ask is to at least try.
Yeah I got a ""I don't understand that stuff"" and ""humans have to have a lable for everything"" from and older coworker and I had to stand my ground.
Agreed. I started typing something a little similar but I didn't think I was expressing myself well so just kept it to 'cool neighbours instead.
r/nothingeverhappens
..... you do realize we have cellphones. And they could have been so excited that they posted it after it happened. This is someone's facebook post that I put down. And also... there are people with photographic memories and such.
They're trying to say that this is a r/thathappened made up post. It's sweet but I don't think an elderly person would ever use online slang like ""puppers""
Yes trying is way more validating then not.
you never met elderly peeps whom baby talked their dogs?
Oh I have for sure, but not using zoomer slang, ""pupper"" is super recent millennial/ gen z term"	x6lsj0	NonBinary	1231	0.99	2022-09-05 17:21:30

Chopped off my hair and my mom had a meltdown but I feel great :) (any pronouns)		"it's your hair for God's sake not hers
Looks fantastic! The hairstyle and dye color suit you very well.
You look cool af! Your mom is obviously not seeing the world in a clear and loving manner. She doesn’t own you. You have the right to do anything that makes you feel good!
I love your hair! It's great to see another nb person with really curly hair - it sometimes makes me kinda sad when I only see hairstyles that only 'work' with straight hair. So, thanks for giving this curly-haired gremlin a bit of positivity! :)
You look great!!!
Your hair looks 🔥, I freaking love the red with it, looks incredibly striking.

When I had the big chop, my mum told me not to post any social media photos of myself with it until I “looked like a human being”. I just gave her the middle finger (metaphorically) and posted them anyway.
My mum throws a fit everytime I talk about getting shorter hair. I've tried to explain everything to her but she just doesn't get it. Now all there's left to do is get my hands on a nice pair of scissors...
[removed]
You look great! I love the red, it really suits you!
it suits you!
Stunning! The color looks amazing on you too!
Your hair looks great! You look so much happier and more comfortable. I dig the color combo too.
Your hair looks so good! It's only a guess from the pictures, but the shorter look matches your energy better, if that makes sense. And those earings...you look powerful 👌🏻 10/10
Your hair looks rad af. A++ 

When I shaved the sides of my head my dad said ""huh, it's um, interesting""

So to all you kids from across the land. Take it from me. Parents just don't understand.
Congrats :))) The first time is always the best. My mom also had a meltdown when I did “the big chop”. If you piss off your conservative parents, you know you’re doing something right. I wish you peace and safety.
Damn boy, looking great!
you look awesome!

she'll get used to it
Correct decision YESSS😤 and your curls are popping ughhh
You look so much happier and so rad! You also look so androgynous I’m so jealous <3
Looks awesome!!
It looks great! And you look you so happy 😊
That’s a lot of hair gone, but I love your new look. My mom also was anxious about me changing my hair, but she came around. I hope yours does too.
It's not even that short, she needs to seriously calm down. I know it's hard to watch your child grow up, my mom threatened to kick me out of the house if I cut my hair when I was 16 (and I'm AMAB) but come on, it's your hair.
That looks so wonderful on you! For a second in the first pic with your hair tied back, I thought you shaved it; then, I saw the actual cut and my brain went ""mom's are so dramatic"" haha. It honestly looks really nice on you, it compliments your face shape!  
For the record, I shaved my hair off like some years back and my mom lost it (I've always had my hair short lol).
Looks good on you! For real what’s her problem though? I feel like it’s not even crazy short. Not like you came home with a brush cut or anything
I’m so jealous 😤 that’s basically exactly how I want my hair to look but I have a long way to go 🥲
Thank you everyone for all the nice comments!! I forgot to add the best part of the story: a few days after I cut my hair and she had her crying meltdown... She sent me a picture of her own hair and she had cut her own hair, basically chin length (a little shorter than mine tbh since  mine is curly)

I couldn't believe it LOL she chopped her own hair off and sent me a picture... I gave her compliments and told her it looked amazing of course, I'd never stoop to her level, but it hurt to see.

Mothers am i right?
Love it! Those curls! You look great, bud. I hope you feel great.
your haircut looks awesome!
you look super cool!!
It's dumb to me that parents care so much about kids cutting their own hair. It's *HAIR* for heaven's sake! I think you look very cool, btw :) hope you're having an excellent day
You look amazing and absolutely radiant, so proud of you for being yourself ❤️!! Reminds me of my own journey, but flipped!

I had always wanted to grow my hair out, probably from the time I was around 7 years old. Growing up, everyone around me said things like, ""you wouldn't look good with long hair"" or ""long hair is for girls or dropouts"" 🙄. Fast forward to when I started college, I was like, ""literally what do I have to lose, it's ridiculous, if not now then when?"". So, I finally started letting my hair grow longer. Despite literally being yelled at to ""cut my hair"" at the first career faire I went to, and getting the occasional comment from people, I preserved. Fast forward to now, I'm a working professional and no one questions it (and I work in a more old-guard sector: aerospace engineering).

Going for the hairstyle that I wanted, that makes me feel like me, was one of the best things I've ever done for myself. It's transformative and powerful! We're all most beautiful when we're our true selves 💗!
Lol when I read ""chopped off"" I thought you'd gone full buzz cut for her to have a meltdown.

The new hairstyle suits you better than longer hair!
You look amazing!!!! 😄💕 and much happier ❤️
I don't know what your mom is yammering about. It shows off your curl pattern. The color is nice, too! 🤷🏾‍♂️
Your hair looks great!

I also use any pronouns. I haven’t been able to figure out a more concise way of saying it besides “any pronouns.”
omg you look so good!!!!
You look amazing omg!! You look super happy as well :) I’m proud of you for going through with it! <3
OMG. You look 🔥🔥, but also happier 🙂
I think it looks awesome! I like the red
Slay <3
Oh my god, I was expecting like a Grade 2. Tell your mother that the universe will die in fiery entropy, for the love of God xD
Looking rad, my fellow human!
IT looks AMAZING why would she be upset, especially since it's not HER hair that got cut
looks amazing!!
Oh my god you look amazing!!
Your hair looks amazing. 

I’m so sorry that your mother can’t also appreciate it!

Your hair looks super cool, I love it! And more importantly, it's clear how happy you are with it so that's all that matters.
Hair looks excellent tbh 😤

don’t know what your mum’s freaking about
Lookin good!
It looks so good!!!!!!!
it looks awesome! love the curls, love the colour!

after reading the title i was expecting to see a super dramatic change like a buzzcut or something 😂 people can be so funny about things that do not affect them at all lmao
the style and color both look fantastic on you!! you look much more confident and comfortable in your own skin— the contrast in the photos is like night and day. your mom can stuff it.
Your hair looks so hot now! Damn! You look a lot more happy and vibrant too. Great choice!
Damn I love it! Wish I could have hair like that! Go on king/Queen/Majesty
I LOVE THE SHORT HAIR ON YOUUU it looks so good. and red is DEF one of your colors

You look great!
My hair is a similar texture but sooooo long. I can't wait to cut it short and hope it looks like yours!!! but I wish I could find a way to look more masc with long hair :(
It looks amazing! SO fun.
Looks awesome my dude!
It suits you so well!
You look awesome! It’s your choice and your hair!

Looks great!

Seriously a meltdown over a haircut I like how this shorter hairstyle looks on you and the color suits you
Well your hair looks pretty fucken rad but I guess it's still technically legal for her to be wrong and dramatic so we can't arrest her..
I Love it!! Your curls are so bouncy now! :D
But your hair isn't even that short.
What does she care? it's not her hair. The world doesn't revolve around her. You do you.
You look awesome with short hair
OKAY I LOVE YOUR HAIR CUT. WAIT IDK IF THAT MAKES SENSE. I LIKE YOUR HAIRDYED AND SHORT AND YEAH
After before whatever
your hair looks really great, but it covers your nice face
I KNOW RIGHT??? I'm visiting my parents for the weekend and she told me that when i sent her a picture, she literally sobbed and I just laughed bc that's so dramatic.
Thank you so much I totally agree! :D
Thank you for this, it's really hard to remember that I am my own person and that the way I look and what I do doesn't have to be according to what she wants.
Thank you!!! Your words make me so happy!!! I struggled so much trying to find reference pictures for the cut I wanted and there's so many non-curly hairstyles out there, so I had to step out of my comfort zone for this! Us curlies exist too!! :)))
Exactly! I also have quite curly hair and it’s sucks trying to find inspiration
Thank you!! :))
Thank you so much!!! 

That's so funny actually because initially when I cut it, i sent her a picture and she had a whole meltdown, like literally sobbing and told me she didn't recognize me anymore (lol) and then when I dyed it red, I didn't tell her anything and just posted it online and that's how she found out lol, I'm visiting my parents this weekend and she made sure to let me know she didn't like the red but I don't care!
My mom was the same! Then i let it grow out extremely long and didn't take care of it and there's nothing she cares more about than keeping up appearances so she'd make me cut it (even when I didn't want to)

In 2021, i cut it up to my shoulders in this weird long bob (it looked good don't get me wrong) with red highlights and she loved it, but I also didn't take care of it bc i don't tend to straighten my hair (that's what she'd like me to do) 

And this time around I just decided, fuck it, I'm just gonna go to a Hair Cuttery and chop it all off, and it was the best decision I ever made.

I told her many times I wanted it short but she didn't think I'd go this short lol
Absolutely control issues! My mother has always been very concerned with how other people perceive her from a young age, and that was passed onto her kids too. So she does everything in her power to make sure we seem perfect to others so nobody can talk bad about us.

It's super toxic and I'm only recently rebelling because even in my teenage years I felt so guilty about disappointing her. I think she has this image of a perfect little girl, and every time she looks at me, that image gets shattered :) gender aside of course, since she doesn't know I'm NB, but she thinks something like this can ruin my life long-term lol!
Thank you! I'm so glad it does, I would've been so sad if it didn't look right on me
Thank you!! I was really second guessing whether I should've dyed it, but I think it looks good :))
Thank you! It makes me so happy that others can visibly tell I'm happier!
Thank you!!!  I totally agree it absolutely feels so me!
Thank you so much! ❤️❤️❤️
Thanks! ❤️
Thank you so much! I do!! It's so crazy because in all my pictures before the cut, I was never smiling and just had a blank face, and now I feel like I can't help but smile in all my pictures :)))
It really is! I've had it very long before and this was my hair grown out from a previous chop I had done that she approved, but this time around I wanted to be the one making the decision without her over my shoulder :) I'm sure she will come around, I think she's just worried I won't be able to make it look good lol!
Haha! Honestly I'd considered shaving it sometimes, but just the thought of her reaction to that would immediately convince me otherwise lol!! Thank you for the compliments, they mean a lot!
Honestly I have no clue!!! I think she has this image of her perfect little girl and if I stray away from that fantasy, it drives her nuts. I thought the hair looked quite nice!
You'll definitely get here!!! I myself thought I'd never be able to have hair this short, and yet here I am!

Wishing you good luck on your journey and manifesting your short hair!! ❤️
Thank you so much! I do feel great :)))
Thank you!!! ❤️
Thank you!!!
Literally!!! Like it'll grow back I promise, it's not the hair on your head so why does it matter???

Btw thanks so much! I'm having a great day, thank you for commenting ❤️
Thank you so much!!! Your story is so beautiful thank you for sharing!! It makes me so happy to hear similar experiences from others, I'm sure your long hair looks stunning! You're so right, people glow differently when they are themselves ❤️
I know right!? Thank you so much!! I was so worried I'd only ever look good with long hair but it's not the case at all!! ❤️
Thank you!!! I feel happier! ❤️❤️❤️
Honestly!! My hair hasn't looked this curly since I was a kid!!! She's a total hypocrite cuz now she's saying how much she loves it now that she's seeing it in person 🙄🙄🙄
Omg same!!!! Like how am I supposed to tell people to just call me whatever, cuz i can't just list the pronouns obviously LMAOOO

Thank you btw!!!
Thank you!!!!
Thank you! This means so much to me, i appreciate you! :)
Thank you!!! I'm glad you can tell I'm happier!!! ❤️
Thank you!!! Red is my favorite color so I'm glad it looks good on my hair too! :)
Slay!!! 🔥
LOLLL honestly should, she's worried about all the wrong things 😭
Thank you!!! ❤️
Thank you!! HONESTLY!!! (It's worse tho, bc she then cut her hair shorter than mine and sent me a pic 💀💀💀💀) she's just tripping
Thank you!! ❤️❤️
Thank you so much ❤️❤️❤️
Thank you!!
I feel freeee!!!!! ❤️
Thank you!!! I absolutely agree with you!
THANK YOU!!!! ❤️❤️❤️

Honestly me either!!!
Thank you so much!!!!
Thank you!!! A lot of people have said the same it makes me laugh a little honestly!!! She can be very dramatic at times 😭😭😭
Thank you!!! I love the way you put it, it really feels that way ❤️❤️❤️
Thank you!!! I feel way better!!! ❤️
Thank you!!! We all deserve to have hair that makes us feel good! ❤️
THANK YOU!!!! I'm so glad other people agree!!! Red is one of my fav colors so that makes me so happy to hear ❤️❤️❤️
Absolutely!!!! Thank you! 🔥🔥🔥
I had such a similar struggle! When my hair was at it's longest, i could usually put it in a ponytail high on my head and let the hair fall over then put a beanie over the ponytail and just readjust the hair. It was one of the only ways I could make it look short.

Otherwise I'd resort to masc clothes and the way I carry myself would be different, sometimes I'd do masc makeup.

But honestly nothing was as good as getting this haircut, wishing you luck on your journey and manifesting your dream cut!
THANK YOU SO MUCH!!! YES U MADE PERFECT SENSE
she really needs a reality check
Who cries over someone else's hair?
Most definitely. It’s unfortunate that she can’t see the happiness radiating from your eyes, but the most important thing is that YOU can see it and are willing to chase it down. Hopefully she’ll wake up to the beauty and value that comes from letting you pursue your happiness. Most people can sense that happiness, and the light you’re starting to tap into will do nothing but make your life and the lives of those around you better. Keep pushing.  Try and show her that there is only positivity that will come from letting you being yourself.
Ironically I also had my hair dyed red (though it was over a year after the first big chop when she’d had more time to adjust to me doing crazy things).
straightening your hair is the opposite of taking care of it lol so she wants you to fry it over time?? also curly hair is valid and you do not have to straighten it to be presentable. just saying cus i spent a long time thinking i had to straighten my hair. a lot happier once i stopped caring about how ppl perceived it. your hair is beautiful!!!
Lmao why are our moms like, the exact same? 😭 She's all about keeping up appearances as well. She gives me so much shit about wearing baggy clothes just because she thinks it doesn't look presentable..like fuck it, I'm gonna do what I want to lol

Also, your hair looks absolutely gorgeous. Don't straighten it (unless you need to, ofc). I've got the same hair as you albeit a bit looser curls and my mum hates my wavy hair so much even though she's got the same hair
[removed]
Actually the opposite lol my hair is already really short and I want to grow it out for the first time but I want it to be the same as yours bc it looks amazing
No problem, I'm glad you're having a good day 😁
So very glad to share stories, it's what builds community and vibrancy and hope 😊!! Thank you so much 💖, we're all better when we glow together ✨💛✨!!
WHATT so she got upset with u for cutting your hair then she goes shorter than you...😭
I definitely want hair like that it’s beautiful
ofc!!! 💕💕
Totally agree! She sees me as her little baby but I'm a grown adult it's crazy how she reacts sometimes
Someone who can't come to terms with the fact that their child is an adult i guess 😭😭😭
That's smart, maybe I should've waited to dye it red, I just did it all in a couple weeks she was DISTRAUGHT
Thank you so much!!! My hair was wavy and the ends were dead and now my curls came back (i used to have curly hair as a kid) and my hair is so healthy! I actually feel motivated to care for it and really don't want to damage it with heat :)) so regardless of what she thinks, I'm definitely going to keep living heatless !
Omggg yes my mom hates my clothing choices too and will constantly try to girlify my outfits 😭😭😭

Thank you so much for your comment ❤️
A few years ago it absolutely would have!!! Now she keeps talking about how she wants little tattoos, but don't let me mention I might want one, she might lose it LOL
Oh hell yeah!!! Manifesting your dream hair then!!! ❤️❤️❤️
EXACTLYYYYY!!! i couldn't believe it omfggg idk she's on another plane of existence
possessiveness is a helluva drug
My mom also has a hair obsession. She also gave me shit when i chopped off my hair (did this twice, both times i gave it away to an org that makes wigs for cancer patients), both times. The second time I was 30. Lol.
This gave me the idea to post when I first got it dyed [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/NonBinary/comments/11otpy2/not_a_recent_photo_but_throwback_to_when_i_dyed/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf).

She’ll come around, it’s your life and your hair.
I relate so much 😭

No worries <33
Wow I love the red on you!!! That looks so good! It really fits you :)))"	11oqav8	NonBinary	1191	1.0	2023-03-11 17:50:50
Just sad	My wife ask me if she turns me on still, and I said it would really turn me on if she used my pronouns consistently (they/them). She turned it around and told me that I shouldn’t correct her because it’s incorrect grammar and it triggers her to use my pronouns. I’m just sad. I don’t necessarily need feedback, just sharing. It fucking breaks my heart.	"What trauma could have possibly happened that someone is triggered by grammar that’s at least several hundred years old? How can pronouns hurt her, mentally or emotionally? How?? 

Anybody who cares about grammar **so much** would surely know that languages are not static, and grammar changes over time. Anyone who particularly cares about refusing to use singular ‘they’ and ‘them’ ought to know that it’s an older part of English than singular ‘you’. 

If someone don’t know these basic facts that would undermine their knee jerk bias, that’s also proof they literally haven’t looked into it, because these are extremely obvious and accessible facts 

OP, you deserve so much better than to be snarked at when you’re being vulnerable about your feelings and needs. A part of me is downright spitting, “wtf is this crap, gtfoutta here with that, PTSD is a real thing wtf is this ‘ironically triggered’ bs” because it’s so thoughtless and casually cruel on her part to talk to you like this
If it triggers her, then she should get therapy. OP, you deserve better than low-effort and catty excuses for being a transphobic bigot.
My husband is autistic, he is *actually* triggered by incorrect grammar - he goes off on one when people get it wrong. It drives him insane. But even he uses they/them pronouns for our Nb child. I am so sorry your wife is such a transphobic bigot. There is no excuse for her behaviour.
That's not what a trigger is, and it minimizes folks with actual mental health triggers. Ugh. What a terrible thing to say in any context, but to your spouse? I can't even imagine. I'm so sorry.
Your wife sucks. She’s making bogus excuses to misgender you.
I’m so sorry to hear that. Let her know if it makes her feel better, they/them is used singularly all the time. She likely does it multiple times a day. Here is an example:  Singular they, along with its inflected or derivative forms, them, their, theirs and themselves (also themself, and theirself), is a gender-neutral third-person pronoun. It typically occurs with an unspecified antecedent, in sentences such as: ""Somebody left their umbrella in the office.
Triggers her my ass
Im sorry, They them can be used singularly. I also find it weird how she says it triggers her yet shes the one disrespecting you.
Do you have issues with those self esteem ? she seems kinda manipulative. Making this about her

 A long time ago I thought non binary people weren't real and that they were just looking for attention but when my siblings came out I could see it was important to them so I did some research. Even in the several months where I thought they were confused I still was respectful because I love them and I can see that it was important to them.

 I'm a not a good person. I hurt people I care about if I'm a better person than your wife that's a big problem
I’m sorry, if incorrect grammar “triggers” your wife, she must be a mess just listening to herself, because the believe that your pronouns are in any way grammatical is complete and utter nonsense. There is quite literally hundreds of years of precedent for the use of singular “they” pronouns. 

It was used in the King James Bible, written 1604 — Philippians 2:3:

*In lowliness of mind let* **each** *esteem others better than* **themselves**

It was used in Shakespeare’s Comedy Of Errors, written 1594 — Act IV, Scene 3, Line 1:

*There's not* **a man** *I meet but doth salute me*
/*As if I were* **their** *well-acquainted friend*

It was used in Chaucer’s Canterbury Tales, written in the 14th century, *literally before the advent of modern English*:

*And* **whoso** *fyndeth hym out of swich blame,*
/**They** *wol come up*

No grammatical argument can be made in good faith against the use of singular “they.” Anyone who claims otherwise is either lying as a means to be transphobic, or deeply ignorant of English grammatical convention and literary history.
Is your wife from before 1370? Cause using they as a singular pronoun was first put into text as early as 1375. So grammatically speaking your wife is over 600 years on the wrong side of history.
I think I speak for a good enough portion of us when I say that is your *Ex-wife*...
Wow, what a drastic pivot from ""i care about whether I turn you on"" to ""I want you to feel miserable around me.""  So sorry you're having to deal with this.
oh improper grammar my fucking ass. even if it is incorrect by grammar rules, grammar changes. iirc, ""you"" used to be plural only
it's been proper grammar as long as she's been alive. Singular ""they"" has been recognized for hundreds of years. It's listed in every major dictionary. It was prohibited in formal writing in the past, but that has changed in recent years. All major style guides have been updated to allow the singular ""they,"" both in cases where it's someone's preferred pronouns, and in cases where the person's gender is unknown. The ""he or she"" standard that we were taught in school in the past is now considered outdated and non-inclusive.

People saying it's improper grammar has become something of a transphobic dog whistle. At best, they're poorly informed, but usually they're making an excuse for their deliberate choice to not recognize non-binary people.
Why are you married to someone so ignorant and belittling? To someone who doesn’t value you or respect you? To someone who treats you so poorly?
 Asked off of this post AND another of your posts stating she “acted weird” when you mentioned top surgery and you’re genuinely concerned she wouldn’t help you with recovery….

It really seems like this is not something she’s accepting of.

I don’t know how long you’ve been out, but at a certain point you have to accept that some people just won’t accept who you are. Even if that person is your spouse.
I’m so sorry - having your partner use your correct pronouns is so little to ask; like, the barest fucking minimum. I can’t imagine how heart breaking that conversation must have been. I hear you friend. ❤️
I would have just straight up said ""Then no, you don't turn me on anymore""
I remember my mom's stories of being beat with a switch, at school for using her left hand. Or writing notes. I never heard her complain when my eldest asked to be called him. 

I actively out myself through triggering situations in order to help people. Just because I know the suck they feel does infact truly suck and their suck has no choice of escape unless I help. 

I also have corrected child services, to their face. And school teachers, and police officers. I am Native American and my name is Spanish. I can definitely say those moments are intimidating, and triggering. I get over it, because I love the other person. I believe that is what most of us do, or at least try to. 

I believe their words are baseless, vague, inappropriate, disrespectful, and purely bigoted. 

But as a compromise. I can correct her if you like. Then you get the correction, and it isn't you ""triggering"" them. Eh? Lol. Joking not joking.

P.s. My wife switched to they them pronouns for me after 14 years of knowing me as another. And opens they door for me too, and helps me into the car too, and we share the normal gender specific attributes we wish to share, and cut those we think are dumb, and we both came out of extremely controlling and restrictive families. I feel lile any excuse is relatively garbage when it comes down to it. We all make exceptions for those we love. At least this one comes as a request and not a surprise. Idk. Food for thought. 

Edit to add the p.s.
I'm so sorry, friend. Ask her if Shakespeare triggers her, too, because he used they/them all the time. Also, the OWL has this to say about gender pronouns: [https://owl.purdue.edu/owl/general\_writing/grammar/pronouns/gendered\_pronouns\_and\_singular\_they.html](https://owl.purdue.edu/owl/general_writing/grammar/pronouns/gendered_pronouns_and_singular_they.html). And here is the Oxford English Dictionary: [https://public.oed.com/blog/a-brief-history-of-singular-they](https://public.oed.com/blog/a-brief-history-of-singular-they). They are like the leaders of grammar and the English language.
I’m sorry to hear this!  It is sad!  My partner also had a similar reaction even though she is agender only because gender bothers her so much. By me changing my pronouns she felt she has to think about gender more and that triggers  her. 

I agree being validated and loved for who you are is SEXY.  Being invalidated makes you feel like you’re moving away from someone not closer. 

I hope you and your wife can work it out if that’s good for you. My partner is getting better with time after I’ve explained how important it is to me. But I’ve felt really lonely at times.
You both should probably find someone else.
Divorce time, you don’t deserve that treatment
That sucks 💕 sorry love
my ex used to say random little things triggered her all the time, i eventually realized that she was just a narcissist. i’m sorry you’re dealing w this friend, best of luck to you<3
i’ve been in love with literature and the english language since i learned how to read. i’ve taken every advanced english class available to me as soon as they were offered from 7th grade on. i’m the first to notice grammatical errors and misspelling and i’m often asked by friends and family to review their work before submission. i’m also nonbinary and use the singular they/them. it’s grammatically correct and has been for ages. people use it all the time without noticing. she’s just being hurtful. 

even for “sticklers” like me seeing something grammatically incorrect isn’t the end of the world. if it’s a very bad error it’ll get an eye twitch from me but constantly correcting people is annoying and uncalled for. it is in no way triggering and it’s very telling that she claims it is. either she’s immature or she really doesn’t want to use your correct pronouns. i’m sorry you’re in this position, you deserve to be surrounded by supportive people.
My housemate has a masters degree in linguistics and uses they/them pronouns. Singular ""they"" has existed in English for longer than singular ""you"". I hope your wife gets over this, for both of your sake.
Singular ""they"" has an older history than singular ""you""


I'm sorry your wife is a bigot who uses incorrect knowledge of grammar to misgender you
That is really sad. When I came out to my bf he was immediately supportive and has done everything to make sure i feel valued and respected (using my pronouns and other supportive things included). I love him, and he loves me. 
Love is an action, and how can anyone say they love you but are okay with disrespecting you? Love you but won’t use your pronouns? If your wife loved you wouldn’t she make the effort? Shouldn’t she? If my bf can do it so can she. No excuses
I understand you to some degree, the people around me know I'm nonbinary, but they don't understand it, they don't try to understand it, and they never use the right pronouns when referring to me

It just hurts....I don't even correct them anymore
Maybe your wife should reconsider her priorities and work on her issues.
She isn't triggered; she’s intolerant.
Ýoi should take a long and serious look at your relationship, and your wife. It genuinely reads like she's full of shit; she needs to work on herself, maybe some individual and marriage counseling would do some good? Either way hang in there, and know we're here for ya
I'm incredibly sorry, OP. This is a hard situation. I hope you have (besides us ofc) a queer-supportive space/community/person in your life ❤️🏳️‍🌈
It’s not incorrect grammar, and we use singular they naturally already when we don’t know the gender of someone. “Oh no, they left their umbrella! Maybe I can catch them.” Very unsupportive and not cool of your wife.
How can she expect you to be turned on by her when she hurts you intentionally
Ya know, I think that saying “divorce your wife is too extreme”. But entertaining people who do not respect you is also not going to be very helpful to your circumstance. If she is “triggered” by using they/them, then she should be too “triggered” to speak to you with familiarity.
You should inform her that singular they is older than most pronouns we use today as well as a lot of other words. She’s not actually worried about grammar as bigots seldom are, she’s just being unsupportive and using grammar as an excuse. I’m sorry this is happening.
You deserve better my homie, she’s looking for an excuse to be enbyphobic…
You deserve someone who can show you the basic respect of using your pronouns correctly. It's really not that hard to at least *try* using them consistently.
Honestly I’d she refuses to respect your pronouns you probably shouldn’t be around her because she doesn’t respect YOU.
I’m so sorry, but if she doesn’t even love and respect you enough to use the pronouns you requested, the relationship is already over.
What the fuck. You deserve better than this bullshit.
Wow, words used in the time of Shakespeare and Chaucer are only just now triggering her, what a pathetic excuse. You deserve better than that.
Singular they predates singular you. And language evolves. Either way, she can get therapy for whatever her grammar trauma is, and get over it. If she isn't willing to try, she doesn't respect you.
In academic writing, they is frequently used as a singular pronoun. You can find lots of academic articles employing that, it isn't incorrect grammar.
Bro put a dead rat in your wife's lunch, anyway why'd you turn the question around bestie
Probably already know this, but she clearly has **a lot** of bigoted feelings to work through. She just probably didn’t think she could possibly be bigoted and trying to process that with any excuse she can say. 

Like, what happens when pointing o it singular they has been in use for centuries? What happens when pointing out that what she is doing is far more triggering, especially when the other thing isn’t remotely triggering? I’m so sorry you’re dealing with this. Sucks, but bail for your mental health.
If this was happening to your friend or sibling, what would you say?

Call for divorce. It won't get better. From someone who has been there and was engaged to a person who always forced both of us to bend to what she wanted even if it actively denied me my existence and well-being, it will never ever get better.

Live your life for *you*. Get out of there and be free, my love. You will feel so, so much better.
Your wife is making excuses and cop outs. She sounds like a terf. That is genuinely a heartbreaking thing. I feel for you.
Oh geez. She’s not even right about it being “incorrect grammar” - not that it should matter.
Does your wife mistreat you in other ways?

https://www.thehotline.org/?utm\_source=google&utm\_medium=organic&utm\_campaign=domestic\_violence
divorce. Right now. They clearly don't care about you at all
I’m sorry this is happening to you, you deserve to be gendered correctly. This honestly sounds like an excuse for something else like “not ready to change” kind of thing to me, but I don’t know her ofc. I hope the truth comes out soon but the bottom line is your identity is non-negotiable.
Big red flag. I’m so sorry babes this is happening especially on TDOV. We love you
It’s just transphobic, bottom line.
""told me that I shouldn’t correct her because it’s incorrect grammar and it triggers her to use my pronouns."" MY BRAIN COMPLETELY IGNORED THAT THE FIRST TIME I READ THIS BECAUSE OF HOW FUCKING INSANE THAT IS. This is not a healthy marriage, friend. This is psychological abuse that she's subjecting you to. Twisting things to present herself as the victim?! Not much can leave me dumbfounded but WOW that was hard to process. My brain essentially became the dialup modem sound for a minute. My heart breaks and my blood boils for you.
Studying linguistics. She's wrong. She's thinking of prescriptive grammar. ""Whom, not who, they is plural,"" etc. But this isn't how we use grammar unless you constantly are in a college classroom. We use descriptive grammar to say that ""they are good"" is correct grammar and ""are good they"" is not a grammatically correct sentence. Do you know what order to put sentences in? Congrats, you know more grammar then her. Is group therapy/couples therapy a possibility? Wishing you the best of luck.
I think it's less about the pronouns deep down, and whether or not she accepts this. This is her coming to grips with that you are coming out to be a person who is changing in front of her. I hope she can look inward and figure out what she wants from your relationship together.
I'm sorry you're so sad. I would hug you if I could. Just remember you're still valid. 💛
If this was about grammar and “trauma”, then your wife would have issues with the pronouns and nothing else. (Even that would be dubious.) 

The fact that misgendering and other transphobic issues are at play, on top of pronouns, means that this is a transphobia issue.
If respecting someone's loved one triggers them, maybe they should be the ones going to some fucking therapy for their issues
Even if she does have trauma and is still triggered by her ass of a teacher from middle school, it's not a free pass for her to use the wrong pronouns and make you feel like shit. Past trauma does not give one an excuse to make other people's lives difficult.

She should not try to make *your* pronouns about her.
Anyone who cares more about grammar than you as person does not deserve you. Period.

The grammar argument is bs anyway, as many others have pointed out. You deserve SO much better.
Wow, that’s so disappointing of your spouse. My mom tried to use the grammar excuse on me over Christmas. I told her it’s like this- if someone left their umbrella at your house, you would wonder who left it so you could give them back their umbrella. There is nothing grammatically incorrect about that. She dropped it after that, was pretty effective. I can’t imagine if my wife was like this though- you deserve better. 💛🖤💜
Dang. I feel so lucky my wife is accepting.
The “trauma” of getting points knocked off a school paper (trivial) can’t be compared to the trauma of gender dysphoria (potentially lethal).

So sorry that you’re being snapped at for asking to be acknowledged. It’s not what you deserve💖
It sounds like she is refusing to process her internal bigotry, and maybe turning that question on you because her attraction towards you may be so strictly gendered if she comes from a relatively religious or conservative background. (Speaking from experience anyways I don't know the situation.)
Allow me to chime in as a person who has been working as an editor for 15 years, which means my job is to be an expert in English grammar and to be familiar with a wide array of dictionaries and style guides: every major dictionary and style guide now recommends the use of they/them as singular, gender-neutral pronouns.

Your wife’s understanding of grammar is wrong. 

Furthermore, experienced professionals in my field are generally not real sticklers for grammar because we understand that the rules are not prescriptive, they are descriptive. We certainly don’t get emotional hangups about it.

The rules are there for convenience. They’re there mostly for business purposes. They’re a shallow attempt to tame a lively beast.

Getting hung up on a grammar rule—getting upset about grammar—is a sign of a person who has very little expertise in language and no authority to police it.

I don’t really think this is totally about the grammar, but that’s what I’d tell your wife if I could talk to her. And I’d tell her to get a life.

I’m sorry she is letting you down.
Hang on.  I’m sorry but focusing only on one side of this conversation seems unfair.  I understand and appreciate how hurtful that response is.  But she asked a question that you didn’t really answer.

Do you still find her attractive?  Where did that question come from?
I'm sorry you're having to deal with this and I hope your wife is open to being educated, because she's being extremely transphobic and exorsexist. I do hope she's being melodramatic when she says it triggers her since singular they isn't incorrect grammar at all, but if there truly is a trigger there for whatever reason she seriously needs to go to therapy for that as that's not a good thing and actively Interfering with her life and her relationship with you which isn't healthy. If it is a trigger, she should be willing to do the work to figure out *why* it's a trigger and work on healing that part of herself. I hope she's open to it for both of y'alls sake.
Your wife is wrong , Miriam Webster changed it for this to be correct grammar over four years ago .  Now she doesn’t have to be triggered!!   But also she sucks and I am sorry
Oh honey, I'm so sorry this is happening for you. You deserve someone who is totally turned on by you just the way you are.
Hope this isn’t too forward, but she doesn’t sound like a very good wife...you deserve someone who respects you and doesn’t act like your existence is an affront to them. 

I believe the most important thing in long term relationships is respect. Your wife is being incredibly disrespectful. Also, being confronted on your own bigotry =/= triggered. It’s obviously not the grammar if she still misgenders in grammatically correct ways. She should respect you enough to at least acknowledge it as a her problem, instead of making it a you problem.
That sucks a whole lot. I'm sorry you have to deal with that, and that she's making it about her instead of supporting you.
You deserve better than someone who won't respect who you are. She doesn't give a shit about 'proper grammar', and she doesn't know the actual definition of the word 'trigger', she just knows she's going to get mocked if she uses your proper pronouns, and she cares more about how other people see her.
OP you deserve better. i’m sorry you’re experiencing this. glad you know you shouldn’t be treated this way. hope you’re able to escape her transphobic-self asap
She needs therapy, and you need a love who will do anything for you, even if it's hard. What is the point of love otherwise
People using the word ""triggered"" as an excuse for everything.... *screams* *in* *BPD*
She wants you to validate her by saying she is attractive but absolutely refuses to validate you by respecting the fundamentals of your identity 😒
I’m sorry that your wife makes you feel this way. It’s extremely hard when family does it but it has to be even harder when your spouse the person who is supposed to love every part of you rejects your identity. I hope you have a support system to be there for you when you need it even if it’s online. Remember that you are valid and your wife’s opinion doesn’t matter 💛🤍💜🖤


EDIT: And if your wife keeps saying that using your they/them pronouns “triggers” her flip it back on her and tell her that her using your incorrect pronouns triggers YOU, which is the truth for so many trans and nonbinary people.
Why are you with someone who doesn't respect your pronouns?
Adding on to all the helpful replies you've gotten just to send love and support. I'm so sorry that you're going through this. Partners can be so helpful or so detrimental, and you deserve to be with someone who can respect and support you. Recognizing that this behavior is manipulative and abusive is a really important first step! It sucks regardless, but it's good that you can see her bullsh\*t for what it is so that you can decide what you're going to do about it.
If I were you I'd be fucking offended by her accusation that you're calling her out _to humiliate her_. Does she truly believe that's your motivation?
Hello. I have an English degree. I went to school for 4+ years to get it and had to pay for it with scholarships. We discussed singular They regularly and always had a few people that would balk. Fam, someone else said this, but singular they had been around since before Shakespeare. 

They are using these things as excuses and making you miserable instead of just doing the work. If someone cares about you, they'd do their best to get your pronouns right. It sounds like to me they are wholly in disagreement with nonbinary identity and using all this as an excuse.

If my partner did what your partner is doing, they wouldn't be my partner anymore. 

I hope you find peace, or your partner opens their eyes.
I've had many friends like this through out my transition, I know how painful and sad it feels. Even some of my best friends at the time did things like this. I would say going to therapy and trying to work with your wife would be the best. And make sure you have a support system to help you throughout it all. But if nothing is helping/changing, I would think it best to look and examine the relationship. I am sending you all the love and good vibes, I hope it al goes well and your life is happy! :)
Personally, I'd like to think that that would be the straw that broke the camel's back and I'd be done, but I am unfortunately unhealthily passive. She doesn't deserve you as a spouse or to be your wife (I differentiate the two only because from that comment alone, she makes the fact that she does not respect your gender evident and likely would use a gendered label) and I just hope you realize how valuable you are. You deserve better. Honestly, being 22 and single, one of my biggest worries is getting attached to someone and finding out that they're toxic.

&#x200B;

***Also,*** I can't believe I got this far into a comment without pointing out that Merriam-Webster had the singular they be the word of the year one year. I tried to find the tweet, but am not great at finding things when I want to.
I couldn't imagine loving someone who wouldn't respect my identity. Leave her ass. You'll find someone better. Trust me.
It is grammatically correct. She’s just transphobic
This is very toxic behavior. You deserve better than that, OP. This is a basic respect thing. Your wife is turning it around to appear the victim. She is also full of shit.

I bet you bust your ass for this relationship and do most of the compromising to maintain harmony. And your partner is probably never quite happy about it, no matter what you do.
Your wife is an idiot and you need a divorce if she's refusing to respect you.
using your correct pronouns means that it’s the correct grammar. we get taught that at a very young age.

your wife is transphobic :(

edit to add: i’ve read through a few of your replies to others now and it’s very clear that your wife does not respect you at all. it’s hard asf and shitty asf, but you need to leave her. she doesn’t care about you the way she says she does.

i’ve been there a couple times. i’m so sorry OP, but you’ll be happier without them for sure. 

remember, your right person will respect you for you, not offend and disregard you. you’ll find the right person one day <3
As a person who’s taking a linguistics course it’s not bad grammar there’s a whole school house rock song dedicated to that
Yeah she said her English teacher would slap their hands with a ruler if they used “incorrect grammar” in middle school. She also told me that I shouldn’t correct her in public because I do it to humiliate her, which is definitely not true. I just want to be seen and acknowledged and she still calls me a girl, female, and uses other gendered language which I have asked her not to use.
I mean, as someone with a best friend with a minefield of triggers in their ptsd, I can see how it is entirely possible. But I'm pretty sure in this case, she's just overdramatic, full of shit and doesn't care about respecting her partner. I really hope OP is doing okay and that they have people in their life who respect them.
My linguistic brain loves it when people are corrected when saying that singular they is incorrect grammar lol
exactly it's not about grammar, it's about control.
Because she adds a value judgements to the pronoums. That value judgements makes her suffer, creating emotions. 

It's not about the pronoums but about what they rapresents for her.

Off course, that value judgement could be wrong too.
Absolutely this
On the flip side, I've had some autistic friends/my partner tell me that their autism makes it difficult to really relate to strict gender binaries. My partner is a cis woman with a ton of trans and NB friends, so it would make sense at least for her lmao
seriously, abusing the word trigger *and* being overtly transphobic to her trans partner. i’m sorry, OP, that your wife is being so vile towards you.
Big time issues with self esteem. She is manipulative and when I started individual therapy last year, I started to realize this and work on my self but I’ve struggled with self worth for so long, that I know it’s a long bumpy road and I’m really trying. Which I why I try to enforce my own pronouns and it just ends up backfiring on me and this is an example. We’re in couples therapy and have been since October 2022 and I don’t feel like it’s working. She just constantly makes excuses for shitty and downright abusive behavior and I’m about to just call for divorce. I can’t handle this anymore.
I’m pretty much there
I’m on the verge of a divorce. I came out to her last fall and it’s been a nightmare ever since. We’re in couples therapy but it doesn’t seem to be working.
I’ve been “out” to her since last fall, by which I mean I started using different pronouns. She knew I was genderqueer as soon as we got together. I think you are right, in that she doesn’t want to accept that I want to change both my physical appearance thru top surgery and use they/them pronouns. She keeps asking me if I’m trans, and I’m like, well yes because I don’t identify with my AGAB, but also I’m non binary so I don’t plan on using a different set of binary pronouns, nor do I currently feel like I want to use HRT, but that could change, IDK how I will feel in 6 months….or a year…or whatever. I think our marriage is over tbh
Based not asked**
Your partner may need some therapy. Disliking something is normal, but someone else's gender identity shouldn't trigger her.. like if the very concept of gender triggers severe mental distress, she has a problem that is likely impacting her quality of life.. if it's not triggering severe mental distress, then she shouldn't say that because it trivializes serious mental health concerns. Someone with PTSD for example, can be triggered by the sound of gun shots and subsequently experience flashbacks/losing touch with reality, dissociation, or severe anxiety/distress... that isn't the same as being a little uncomfortable or not wanting to think of gender because it doesn't fit her world view.  

Like it or not gender is a concept that exists in the world. She doesn't need to like it, but she needs to work on herself because being triggered at the thought of gender is not a functional or healthy way to exist in the world,  gendered concepts are literally everywhere... but I assume that's not the case, and she's just saying she's triggered,  not that she actually is.
100% agree and that’s why I made this post. I just want to be seen and heard and respected and needed this external validation to make sure I’m not overthinking this.
Yeah counseling has been going on for a good while now and things haven’t changed much. I’m about ready to call for divorce.
YUP. It’s time for me to make a decision about my future.
Yup pretty much.
Funny that’s what I said and she told me I just want to start a fight
I think this take is accurate. When I mention getting top surgery, she freaks out and I don’t even want to do it if we are together because she won’t help me in the recovery process
She just randomly asked me and I gave her the answer, it would turn me on if you used my pronouns consistently. But honestly, my attraction to her has lessened over time because she continues to find excuses for treating me like shit and despite therapy (both individual and couples) shit doesn’t change. I have a very hard time feeling emotionally attracted even more than physically because of her behavior.
your wife should take solace in the fact that usage of singular they has been a thing since before Shakespeare's time and is not technically grammatically incorrect. We also use singular they without even realizing it, for example: ""Whoever parked their white Toyota outside, they left their lights on."" It shouldn't make a difference if someone wants to be called they/them.

 I feel like if she truly cared, she would listen to you and make more of an effort to not make you feel this way. I also think it sucks that she's more concerned with how it makes her look when you correct her in public vs. her actually using your correct pronouns in public.
""Saying person instead of girl is grammatically correct, so why do you still misgender me in that way?""

If it was truly about grammar and her trauma around a teacher who physically punished her when she used improper grammar, then she would be able or at least attempting to change how she talks about you when pronouns are not involved. This isn't about trauma, she's simply being transphobic
So she cares more about her English teacher from middle school than her partner’s feelings?
Just to come at this from your wife's perspective - there are things that my wife needs, that I find hard because of my own issues. Sometimes, she would bring up an issue to me and it made me feel really awful even though she didn't mean it to, but because I was convinced that I had 'failed' and that she was going to leave me. 

You know what I did?

I worked on MY issues, because I fucking love my wife and she needed to be able to say ""Hey, can you [do this thing a bit differently/take this into consideration]?"" Without me dissolving into a puddle of self loathing tears and making her feel like she was hurting me when she asked for what she needed. 

It's absolutely okay for you to say ""Hey, I'm really sorry if this upsets you. But I am allowed to ask for what I need in the relationship, and if you have personal issues that make that difficult I would like to work with you to overcome them, but I won't accept less respect than I deserve just because you have a trigger around that. Would you like me to help you find a therapist? Would you like me to word it differently when I correct you on it so that we are both happier? Would you like help practicing using my pronouns so that I don't have to correct you if that's what you have an issue with? I don't want to upset you, but also I need a partner that respects me, so let's work on this together so we can both be happy.""
Being called a girl and being referenced by she/her in public by your partner is much more humiliating than being corrected in public. It sounds like she's trying to manipulate you into not expressing your gender publicly by referring to you as a girl and then claiming you're humiliating her by setting the record straight as to what your gender and pronouns are.

It seems to me that this goes further than just not respecting your gender identity and pronouns.

You may not ever be able to truly and freely express yourself while in this relationship. Is this really someone you want to spend the rest of your life with?
If she thinks you're doing it to humiliate her, she has either entirely missed what it means that you're enby, or she's just trying to make you feel guilty. I hope the two of you have a serious talk about whether to try to change things in your relationship or if it isn't worth it. You deserve to be with someone who understands and respects who you are.

If she's having real issues with this, like if it's truly triggering some issues for her or if it affects her sense of identity regarding sexual and romantic orientation, you have to agree on how you're going to work on this in a way that's sustainable for both of you. But if she's not willing to try to get better for you, please don't make yourself stay with someone who keeps invalidating and disrespecting you like this.
Okay so as someone with multiple traumas and complex post traumatic stress disorder, the last thing I want to so is call bullshit on someone’s trauma so I won’t, even if I kind of want to in this instance. But one thing I do know, is that when I am triggered in a relationship, if I love someone, I work on that trigger and try to change. If she is genuinely having flashbacks and experiencing the feeling of being hurt by her English teacher all over again every time she uses they/them pronouns (which is what feeling triggered is ACTUALLY LIKE), she should want to move past that. Because trust me, no one with PTSD likes to be triggered. I know that not everyone has the resources to get help, but if she really cared, she would at least recognize her triggers are a problem in the relationship and would hopefully try to get better. It’s not easy, but an effort should ideally be made if your actions are hurting someone else. At the very least, she could learn that they they/them pronouns are actually proper grammar. Maybe that would help her feel less anxious and triggered if that is actually her legitimate problem. I can send you some educational materials to show her that can help educate her and hopefully reduce her anxiety. However, her insistence that you are trying to embarrass her in public by correcting her on your pronouns is absolute horse shit and I think it’s likely she is feeling embarrassed by something bigger than your pronouns. I’m sorry you’re having to go through this because this should never happen in a healthy relationship. She should be able to talk to you rationally and be willing to educate herself. If it was me, I would run the other way, but I have a very low bullshit tolerance and I also know it’s not that easy to do that if you’re married. I am sure there is a lot of time and feelings tied up there and I truly am sorry. You don’t deserve this.
Me too. As someone with a linguistics brain as well, I couldn’t come out as non-binary until after doing a bunch of research. 

And how totally and absolutely unsurprising, the actual facts do not support what reactionary, lazy bigots claim! What, AGAIN??!? 😂
Making a value judgement is nowhere near the same as being triggered by something. That word is to do with trauma not displeasure or discomfort or activated emotions. It seems astronomically unlikely she would be triggered by using they/them pronouns for her spouse.
Wow yeah I feel that. I'm neurodivergent and nonbinary and I definitely feel triggered by misgendering but at the same time feel more angry that people are steeped in the binary and their minds are so blockaded from seeing who i really am. I think that its hard to describe how i've never felt like a he him to people who have historically thought of me that way...
I’m so sorry for all this and support you in this decision.
I am glad that you can see she is manipulative and abusive and I know I’m just a stranger on the internet but I 100% support you in filing for divorce because you don’t deserve any of this crap. You deserve to be who you are without feeling like crap and having to deal with someone else’s childish emotions. You’ve got this.
The outcomes of couple therapy really tends to be reconciliation or separation. It’s a good measure to see if things can work out. If it’s not getting better in therapy it’s time to part ways in my opinion. Same situation in my first marriage except we stopped therapy and I continued to be physically and emotionally abused for a couple more years until we finally separated.  The divorce was difficult but ultimately one of the best things that ever happened in my life looking back.
I didn't want to suggest it in my comment, but this is more than enough to justify divorce, particularly because of how expensive it can be but you're flushing your money down the toilet with couples therapy. I honestly can't think of many (if any) rational justifications for you to continue to subject yourself to her abusive and vile rhetoric. I just worry that if you don't get yourself away from that, things may escalate. That you have been putting so much effort into this marriage with no effort from her is honestly concerning. I mean, you may not be in this situation, but if one spouse is the main breadwinner and has more money, they can drain their spouse of cash and force them to rely on them financially.
Yeah, reading some of your other comments here... Seems like this relationship is pretty toxic.   Set yourself free.
Don’t be on the verge, do it.
Good points!  Yes, she does need therapy. When I gently suggest it and tell her how helpful therapy is her eyes will fill with tears and she will say she doesn’t need therapy while starting to cry lol. 

She does have issues with examining some of her own internal experiences and feelings. She likes to keep them under lock and key.  But to her credit she is doing better and even tries to use my pronouns when I’m not around.   

We’ve been together for a long time and for most of the time I didn’t know she was agender and both of us didn’t know I was non-binary. But obviously that must have been a component of our attractions and draw to each other. 

She of course has many other good qualities and I have my own issues with anxiety/depression and PTSD from an abusive marriage.  So not to make excuses for either one of us but we are both works in progress. However, your 100% she does need therapy. I’ve been in therapy on and off for over a decade so I agree how essential it is.
>Like it or not gender is a concept that exists in the world.

Well I don't like it. Gender is stupid. Everything would be easier if we didn't have it at all.
If you're stating that here, then you already sound like you're gone. Best of luck 💗
You deserve better ❤️
Divorce is great! The earlier you start the earlier you're done, and it's such a relief to be out of a painful situation
Yeah, she's definitely projecting. The fact that you telling her to not make it about her is somehow ""starting a fight"".
Okay.  Totally understandable.  The answer seems like “no” then.  Or do you think she’s conflating your transition with attraction?

I am sorry that you’re not in an affirming relationship, and hope you have other people that are supporting you.  She is also in this relationship and has feelings and (clearly) questions.  It can be hard when a partner or family member makes a change.  I don’t know what responsibility anyone has in a relationship at all, but I do wonder how she’s feeling for her to act this way.  And if you are indeed still in the relationship too.

I have a family member that outright stated why they stonewalled my coming out (ironic lol) - it was because they felt I hadn’t been there for them (gender neutral for privacy’s sake).  Still heartbreaking and has caused a big rift, but at least it’s transparent.
Will use this example! Thank you!
Also Helen Zaltsman (sp?) has a podcast called The Allusionist and there’s an episode about the historically correct usage of they/them. And sorry/not sorry for being crass but that person can kiss my cis ass and my enby child’s ass as well😡
Extremely well said! Thanks for opening this up further. 

I had thought to include a sentence like, “I don’t want to completely dismiss the possibility that she’s being literal and serious when claiming that pronouns ‘trigger’ her,” but then I reconsidered. Theoretically possible, yes. Believable in OP’s situation? Gotta be honest, I really think not. 

I see her statements about “triggering” as an excuse—an emotionally manipulative one—even if she’s tapping into truly being upset about pronouns. My PTSD is not excuse to mistreat people. Her bad experience with abusive nuns is not an excuse to insult people. EVEN IF IT WERE TRUE.

Thanks for expanding on that point
This is a really good point. This is an issue of Need vs. Want. 

OP needs basic dignity and respect for who they are. OP’s partner WANTS to avoid the effort of giving that, WANTS to maintain the moral high ground while refusing to do a basic and loving thing for OP, and WANTS to be the only one whose hurt feelings and bad memories matter at all
It’s such a laugh seeing bigots faces drop when you show them that ‘they’ singular pronoun is older than the word ‘she’
(If I remember correctly she didn’t come til later in English history, whereas he - or a variant of it - and they were commonly used in old English)
Basically, according to cognitive psicology we make value judgement about stuff.

Then, those judgements makes us SEE the stuff with a certain perspective.

That perspective triggers emotions.

That's how a person gets triggered, i was just trying to answer that question...

Off course, those judgements can be bad judgements that create negative emotions and this theory DIO NOT underestimate personal responsability.

I don't get why the downvotes, but i hope i made myself clear.
Fellow ND here, but Agender. I've had problems all my life with people reacting to gendered words/things where I was like ""??? Why are you reacting like this? What makes it gendered?!?""

The only times I've felt bad about it, instead of confused, is the two times I accidentally did it to a FTM friend and my social anxiety + self hate made me freeze so long I didn't even manage to apologize to him, so now my brain likes to throw those memories at me from time to time and go ""he probably thinks you're transphobic! That's why you aren't closer than you are..."" so I try to be mindful, especially around people I know aren't cis, but man... My brain just has such a hard time remembering those things that I sometimes slip up, no matter people's identities...
Thank you for sharing your experience around this. I’m on a precipice and have been for a while now and I want our relationship to improve but I’m really feeling like it might not be reconcilable.
There's no pressure to be perfect, but there is pressure to do your best and treat your partner in the way that they need to be treated.. which it sounds like you're both doing. It would be nice if she was open to therapy, but sometimes it takes time to be ready and accept help.. Hopefully it's soon because she will be better for it. 

Also, figuring out identity takes some time, and gender isn't always a firm thing, which is okay too. 👌 

Best wishes to you both 😊
I am kinda with you there, I personally find the concept stupid and useless.. but I recognize that the world doesn't revolve around my personal opinions, and that gender is an important part of some people's identity that I need to respect to afford respect to the folks in my life. 

You don't need to understand or agree to respect others, you should just respect their identity regardless of your personal crap (isn't this the very minimum we ask of cis folks who don't understand enby folks?.. I think we should follow our own advice on this one)
This is how my partners feels. It sounds harsh but when she explains it for herself it makes sense.

I think it’s valid to feel like this and still respect other peoples gender. Gender is a social construct. It’s like the stock market it make no logical sense but it’s a reality and if you want to save for retirement that’s ultimately where most of your money goes. Gotta play the game even though we know it’s basically performance art.
The problem can also be deep like an identity concern. If wife identifies as a lesbian, she probably sees OP only as woman because it affects her self identity as a lesbian. She could do with broader education on the trans community as well as therapy. It’s the only way to change this attitude.
You're getting downvotes because of the fact that you are supporting the person that is in the wrong. This person's wife is misgendering them and claiming that it triggers her to say they/them instead of binary pronouns, because of the fact that in her mind it's grammatically incorrect. https://www.scu.edu/media/offices/provost/writing-center/resources/Tips-Singular-Pronoun-They.pdf
That website explains that it is grammatically correct to use they/them and that, ""according to the Oxford English dictionary, singular they showed up in ancient writing in 1375, over 600 years ago.... And it's worth noting that you and your has a somewhat similar history but in reverse. You used to refer only to plural antecedents, not singular ones. In 1660, the founder of Quakerism even wrote a book on how using you as a singular pronoun was wrong (a brief history). Yet since you is now, without any debate, used as a singular pronoun, we can trust that they is headed in a similar direction."" The website also shows a list of some organizations that were formally against the use of singular they but have now changed their views here are the organizations

: The American Dialect Society, which honored the gender-neutral pronoun they as the word of the year in 2015

: The International Writing Center's Association

: The National Council of Teachers of English

: New Fowler's Dictionary of Modern English Usage

: New Oxford American Dictionary

: New Oxford Dictionary of English( which also uses they in its definitions)

: The Washington Post
Thank you for your kind and encouraging words!!🥲💜🌈
>I think it’s valid to feel like this and still respect other peoples gender.

I never said I didn't respect others' gender! 

Just that I think it's a silly social construct and I don't like being asked ""are you a girl or a boy"" and similar questions, or worse, someone assuming my gender.
That’s just it. It doesn’t have to. Gender nonconformity is a part of lesbianism, like that’s literally the meaning of one of the colors on the flag, and I know plenty of lesbians who don’t find issue with dating non-binary individuals. 
We decide our own labels and because of that there is variety in what each label means to different people. 
Some see lesbian as “only dates women” some see it as “dates anything but men” 
If OPs wife wants to keep the label lesbian she can, without invalidating her significant other in the process.
I'm not supporting that person in any way. I just tried to explain how she's getting triggered.

And i don't need to read this, since i'm also using pronoums, being non-binary transfem myself 😅

Since it's not clear i'll state it: i don't think her behaviour is right. She's wrong and she has responsability for her actions. 

That's how mind works thou and she can work on those judgements to become a better person. My partner literally did that with my therapist.

Don't know why assume i'm supporting something i'm up against only by describing how something work...
I agree with you. I’m sorry if I seemed to say you didn’t respect others genders. I didn’t mean that. Gender is a silly construct. Silly yet crucially important like the stock market.  I just meant to expand on what you said and to validate your post. 

Gender is ultimately silly when I think about it academically. You are just YOU not a girl or a boy. Just the authentic you! 💙🌈💜🌈
I think it's a bit more complex than that. If to her, lesbian means being into women, and that is part of her identity, changing the meaning of the word is still changing her identity. Also, I think a lot of people ignore how it's entirely possible that a lesbian with an enby partner would actually not have dated them if they knew they were enby. Some lesbians are simply not into enbies. And this could be super hard to deal with, because it can make you question the very concept of sexual and romantic orientation.
It comes off as you excusing her behaviour, and frankly as you talking down to the comments a bit. Most adults are aware that people have pre-concieved notions and make judgements.
People have human emotions and they're flawed, it's just not really relevant to the fact that her actions are wrong and shows a complete lack of respect for op regardless..

Edit: you're also saying this as if you know it to be the reason why, which comes off as arrogant. we can all try to interpret the situation with our own experiences. However it reads a bit like ""this is how she's thinking and feeling, it is something all people do, here is what she needs to do to stop hurting her partner."" 
You talk about it as if it is not her intention to be disrespectful, and as if you're an expert on human emotion who knows more than everyone else here about it.

I'm not saying that is what you wanted to say or how you meant it to sound, but I think that's why you keep getting downvoted.
That’s fair.
I’m not ignoring that some lesbians don’t want to date/be with enbys. Like I said the label has different meaning to different people. And to some the label means only women. 
But if OPs wife doesn’t want to be with an enby then that’s a serious conversation they need to have rather than her just pushing her “grammar” on her significant other who has expressed that that is not how they identify. 
I meant the part about being able to keep the label lesbian because the person I was responding to said OP being NB might affect how their wife self identifies to the label lesbian so I was just trying to add that she could keep the term and be with her partner if she so chose. 

Me personally if they identify as a woman or enby it doesn’t bother me and I identify as a lesbian, but A friend of mine is a lesbian and doesn’t date enbys. So like I said the label is a bit subjective in how the person who self labels themself that feels about the term.
I agree with this and i wasn't trying excusing her behaviour. 

But since i'm in a similar situation and i've been ""solving"" it with my therapist and my partner in this way, i talked about that.

I'm talking down the comments because i don't like assumpions made from things i didn't say, or even opposite to what i literally said.

But what can i say? I apologize if i made people think that way, maybe i could have wrote the comments in a better way.
There are other psychological perspectives you can take with this too. For example, it could be that OP's wife is experiencing cognitive dissonance because she's seeing herself as someone who is into women, she also thinks of herself as a good person, and she thinks that someone who misgenders people is not a good person. Thing with cognitive dissonance is that it's really hard to cope with, so if you can't, you end up defending yourself in ways that can make you do really shitty things. Like OP's wife is doing.

If this is true she is lashing out at OP because she doesn't want to change. It's more important to her that she can keep feeling comfortable in her own little picture of herself and the world, than that OP is feeling okay, validated, loved and respected in their relationship and as a person.

My point is that there are many angles to take with psychology. You can never truly know exactly why someone is reacting the way they do, and sometimes they don't even know themselves. And when there's a conflict, yes, it's useful to consider how the other person is feeling and thinking, but there's a point where you have to actually make a judgement about the situation. There's a limit to how much it's reasonable to try to bend backwards to accommodate the other person just because you may be able to work it out. At some point, the different perspective that they have can very well hurt us, and hurt us badly, if we decide to keep going. So yes, try to understand and solve the conflict. But if the other person is not ready to change to accommodate your very valid needs, you simply shouldn't stay.

I really hope things work out for you and your partner. But please keep this in mind. If your partner is in any way showing that they're in fact not willing to change, please re-evaluate if this is a reasonable thing for you to keep working on. You, like OP, deserve someone who respects and validates you. No amount of psychology to understand the other person can change that. But again, I hope things work out and that your partner is ready to take your perspective and change as much as you are doing for them.
Thanks for the kind words to begin with, since people here seemed to get angry even if i didn't want to.

You're right actually, there could be many possibilities around this situation. But sadly most of them, if not all, needs the partner to work on something and accept.

Sadly, my partner needs a similar work too, but she's not willing to do it completely. She made progress, but she finds a skirt ""too much"" for example. If she's not going to work on that, i don't know what i could do thou."	1287xzq	NonBinary	1184	0.99	2023-04-01 02:07:15
When people ask for my pronouns, I show them this meme I made		"i only have two reactions:

they/them or it/its:      conmfy chir

anything else:               meh
PAIN THRESHOLD [Challenging: Failure] - The words being used to refer to you have got to be the most uncomfortable pronouns in the world. They're \*violating* your identity.
I use 'em all along w/ 'e/em/ers.
Radiator chair radiator chair
This is great, can I steal it to show people?
Same but switch she/her and he/him 😭
Human/Person - Beach chair it's there but no one ever uses it

He/him - Recliner been relaxing as that for a bit now

They/Them - Camping chair when you sit in it it's comfy but it's no Recliner
Yoink I'm stealing and just showing ppl this when they ask why I prefer they/them
This is the relatable content I come here for.
As agender amab, those are my reactions:

they/them: isn't that a welcome surprise  
she/her: did not expect that, but okay  
He/him: okay
For me it's:

She/her and They/them: comfy chair

He/him: aaaaaa ow ow ow
Excuse me but this is ingenious
this is me!! omg
switch the first two and that's me lol
Is that chair made out of radiators?
Can relate to this, the she/her chair looks like a torture device
A meme about pronouns and a comment referencing Disco Elysium in the same post! What is this, a crossover episode?
does what a radiator chair does
Sure!
Ay have fun with that :D

I’ve been inspired by all you (mostly younger) braver souls and officially changed my pronouns professionally to they/them - here’s my new LinkedIn headshot. I finally don’t loathe how I look in business attire!		"Iconic!!! Looking so handsome and confident !!
You are amazing!!!! I love everything about this post!!! Go you!!!!
You look amazing and I am in love with your tattoo!! Thanks for keeping the cycle of inspiration going!
That's a great headshot! It looks so professional I almost scrolled past thinking it was an ad.
Yaaaaas love my BIPOC enbies
you look handsome af, what a great photo and outfit!!
Stunning - confidence shining through
You are rocking it! I’m 42, and have recently changed my pronouns as well, life is ridiculously better. Congrats on embracing and being you.
As an enby Korean, I LOVE this photo of you. what a dapper look!
i want to both hire you and also hold your hand 🥺
Looking badass! :)
u look so dapper and professional! i love ur tattoo too.. is it a chrysanthemum?
You're killing it 👌🏻
You look great! I especially love your tattoo, it’s beautiful
You look great!! Strong arms 😍
You look awesome. Love the fresh shot.
You. Look. INCREDIBLE. I’m so proud of you for taking the steps to be out and visible!!! Look at you, out here being all incredible and stuff 🥳
You look happy. And that’s the best look I can find.
Awesome handsome beautiful  🥺🤗🤗🤗
This is so amazing and gives us closeted young 'uns so much hope for the future. I'd love to hear more about your experience as an nb in the business world.
You look great!! And professional!
Hi linkedin always makes me nervous but this makes me happy :) you look handsome and lovely and I hope one day I’m brave enough to do the same
Absolutely slick as hell. Congrats!
Looking good!
awww congratulations!! while it hasn’t been without its challenges, using they/them pronouns full-time and professionally has been so rewarding for myself! both in terms of personal validation, and also for the opportunity to increase non-binary visibility in majority white cishet spaces
Thanks so much for sharing this, you do look super handsome! As one of those maybe younger souls who recently started using they/them professionally it means a lot to see someone older and so accomplished working openly as non-binary.
You look amazing, wow! And so radiant. You go! :)
I would hire you in a heartbeart! The glam, the tattoo, the confidence... Outstanding.
You look so awesome!!! Very handsome!! That business attire looks super rad
Hell yes!!  Go you!!  The more of us who our out and proud about who we are, the easier it is for those who come after us to do the same.  Thank you for making the brave and bold step to be that beacon for others.

If it's alright for me to ask, did you go the route of adding your pronouns to the end of your name on LinkedIn?  Or did you just include them in your profile description?  I'm not a big fan of how LinkedIn provides no conventional place to specify your pronouns.  I've admittedly been a bit scared to take that leap.
You're the first person ever in my life to call me handsome and I'm smiling like crazy big. Thank you!
Thank you so, so much! Supportive communities online like this one have definitely helped me re-evaluate all my confusion/dysphoria from my childhood. It means a lot!
Thanks! The artist is [Alicia Thomas at Boston Tattoo Company](https://www.instagram.com/aliciathomas_art/?hl=en) who is awesome!
Thank you! My ""hifey"" (hubby+wifey) took it!
Represent!
Thank you!
Thank you! I’m still working on it, but I’m confident in front of my bookshelf at least haha!
Wow! You are rocking it and I am so happy for you. Congratulations! Can I ask a question? Being slightly older, we experienced a lot of time using incorrect pronouns and performing incorrect gendered norms, making patterned behaviors in our brain. For me, I feel like it makes me  lean forever slightly towards the female side as a default. How do you define what is you and what is the indoctrined socio-behavioral pattern you've been performing forever?
Literally this comment proving the existence of other asian enbies gives me ALL THE FEELS. Thank you!
ayyy a fellow enby Korean! there are dozens of us! dozens!
Thank you! Gotta give the artist some love - it's by [Alicia Thomas at Boston Tattoo Company](https://www.instagram.com/aliciathomas_art/?hl=en). They are ""Dandy Lions"" from the old animated Alice in Wonderland :) I have a couple tattoos of peonies, but I have always wanted a traditional Japanese chrysanthemum!
Thanks! I linked above too but the artist is [Alicia Thomas at Boston Tattoo Company](https://www.instagram.com/aliciathomas_art/?hl=en)!
I really appreciate your comment! I’ve struggled for years with athletic bulemia/orthorexia/body dysmorphia over my upper body specifically. It all came down to gender identity and now I think I like my arms!
Up until a year ago I was purely a scientist in the academic world, which was ... interesting. I have a lot of opinions about it, haha. In comparison to that I find the business world really liberating in most ways, BUT it really brought to light all the gendered norms of professional performance. In the lab, everyone wears lab coats all the time. In business, what you look like is a status thing. I became hyper conscious of my presentation at all times. It made me really unhappy. But it's not all negative - a business relationship of mine put pronouns in her email signature with a link saying [""What's This""](https://assets2.hrc.org/files/assets/resources/TalkingAboutPronouns_onesheet_FINAL.pdf) and it started an entire domino effect of me coming out professionally and as of this morning, to my whole dad's side of the family, too!

I also am extremely lucky to have my company's leadership be 110% supportive of me (in all realms, not just gender-identity; they are interested and understanding about my mental health atypicality and self-medication routine). My business partner fully has my back and I go into every meeting with that knowledge. I think it's so critical to build local microcosms of support in the workplace, but it's also TERRIFYING. It's unfortunate that we have to be so vulnerable and risk losing professional status (in the eyes of others) just to be true to ourselves - which is the story of my life as an atypical research scientist who is fairly typical-passing, but definitely lapses at times. It's my hope that any discomfort/confrontation I deal with professional is in some way changing the basal assumptions of those I interact with.  


Sorry this got really long. TL;DR - as of right now my experience with ""professionalism"" is that it's a giant facade of gendered norms and judgements. It's no difference to me whether I'm in the conference room or on stage at an open mic - it's all a performance. But I'm working to change that performance to be a more accurate representation of me (whatever that means).
I have faith you'll get there - everyone is always in transition from who they were to who they are going to be and you hoping and visualizing that future means its in your path. LinkedIn for me has the anxiety of the other social medias (which I don't use besides Reddit) but on steroids because it's linked to your perceived professional performance and ability to produce/contribute to capitalism. I think it becomes easier once you begin to accept which of the inevitable mandates of our current economic/political/societal structures you MUST live by to increase your quality of life. It's a constant balance and moral argument for me.
Thank you! Can I ask you about the challenges? Obviously if you're not comfortable I 100% understand. I know there will be challenges... it would be nice to get a little heads up if you know what I mean!
Thank you! You're beginning your career life as your true self; that's exceptionally brave and it means a lot to me!
I was JUST complaining about this yesterday to my ""hifey/wubby."" I did add them to the end of my name so it's FIRST LAST, DEGREE (they/them). I'm mostly annoyed because I had to remove my old/legal first name that I've been published under so that my name wasn't super long and complicated. It seemed like way too much for it to be FIRST (OLD FIRST) LAST, DEGREE (they/them)... But now people won't know/easily find my old publications. I mean, technically I guess if they cared enough they'd know that about me and/or ask me for a CV, but it still bugged me a bit.

Maybe if enough of us do it LinkedIn will start offering a little badge or something we can select for pronouns? I think it'd be cool if under our picture there was just a little ""flair""-like thing to select.
No way! I'm passing it on then because someone just called ME handsome for the first time on my recent post :') All the enby love
Your username is on point too!
Boston Tattoo Company? Do you know which location? I drive by the one in Medford all the time. Awesome look btw!
Oh what a cute gender neutral name for a spouse!!

ooooh nice! i thought they looked familiar
Wow, thank you so much for sharing. I'm going to save that HRC resource.
Of course! I’m privileged enough to be able to have an accepting workplace, so thankfully the worst of it for me has been dealing with unintentional misgendering and incorrect terminology. It’s definitely a challenge to stand up for myself in these situation, especially because my coworkers are well-meaning and I find it difficult to correct them. It’s something I’m still working on, but thankfully the situations that I’ve spoken up for myself in have been have been met only with sincere apology.

I’m the only non-binary person on the staff (in addition to being the only person of color—small town), so it can definitely feel isolating as well, not having anyone with shared experiences. That said, I’ve been lucky enough to find someone who is an educated and passionate ally on the staff, which has helped immensely.

Hope everything goes well for you! My inbox is open if you have any more questions. :)
That's amazing and now I'm on a mission to call someone handsome for the first time to keep it going :)
Haha - well after a lifetime of imposter syndrome I decided to own  being a cannabinoid pharmacology expert at the very least!
I went to the Davis Square location, but I'm not sure if Alicia ever hops over to Medford! Not too far - although by Boston standards 2-3 miles can be like an hour of driving...
Thanks! At home we also regularly use ""wubby"" (wife+hubby), but I spent a lot of time around the Bay Area so I like the double-entendre of ""hifey/hyphy""!
Good bot.
You're very welcome! I feel like not having to explain it suddenly alleviated a bunch of the anxiety for me.

I guess they/them pronouns are objectifying now??		"This guy missed the point of... Everything.
wtf is this lmao does this dude not realize that the whole point of afab people using they/them is because they AREN’T women and don’t want to be seen as such
???? literally where are they getting any of this I'm so confused
HOW!??????????????????

I'M SO CONFUSED

HOW??

H  OW??/?

DOES THIS PERSON THINK THE ""PLURAL"" MEANS THAT THEY ARE SEVERAL BEES?

IS IT OBJECTIFYING TO BE A SWARM OF BEES?

I AM CONFUSION
I object!
Ah yes all nonbinaries are afab OF COURSE! /s
Make it make sense
1. No. No, they are not the same thing
2. Pointing out what? All you said was that they/them pronouns ""objectify women"", didn't explain what the hell that even means and that was it. You somehow said less than nothing meaningful lol.
“something needs to be said” but it didn’t and never did
What I don't understand is this infantilization of women. As if they aren't able to defend themselves or choose their pronoun or identity. And if they do and someone calls them that its apparently ""objectifying""

This odd urge for people who don't understand us to try and ""protect"" us and control us for our safety or something.

I grew up AFAB and I had no shortage of men who thought they knew better than me and tried to ""protect me"" despite me knowing  what I wanted and that it was indeed safe. Even someone I knew who was an old school protesting feminist would often tell me not to do certain 'masculine things' (cleaning the yard or trying to fix something that was broken) cause it would ""make my clothes dirty.. 

Its creepy to feel like they need to ""protect"" 'women' (I understand we're all people not women but just for the sake of the argument I'm using this word) from them taking their own agency and identity into their power.

I find that creepy. Not calling people by their preferred pronoun...
Bruh, something tells me this person is a terf
I kinda can see where they are going but it's a proof of how much they dont understand the concept of genders and the basic English ( English is my second language and I think it might be their case too)

But you really all jump to the conclusion it is a man...
Ugh. Juat ugh.
Imagine just being so out of the loop.
""They/Them pronouns are objectifying women.

\*does not elaborate further\*
I feel like using it/its when you don’t know a person’s pronouns would probably be a lot closer to that if anything ? Objectifying women is making women objects and I’ve never referred to an object as “they” before (I know there are people who use it/its but I feel like using that as a blanket pronoun set when you don’t know is not going to go well
We use it for objects not them. And in my case, you can use both.
I love when people are convinced that they've got your goat but they just make themselves sound like an idiot.
This guy missed the point so hard that at this point I don't know what he's even talking about lmao
That makes no sense. This person must think only afab people are non-binary.
Also, wouldn’t it be more objectifying to misgender someone based on what was between their legs at birth, ignoring their identity and their wishes? Isn’t denying a sentient being’s individuality and autonomy over their own life the very definition of objectification?
...Wat?

No, sex and gender are not the same thing. Take an introductory social science course before opening your mouth, Mr. Mental Gymnastics.
How? I'd understand (but disagree) with this person's logic if the pronouns we were talking about were it/its (I don't like it/its for myself but some people do and I prefer respecting people's  pronouns rather than arguing about how they make me feel), but they/them is already used to refer to people outside of a trans sense... so I don't get this person's whole mindset ar all.
I've re-read the objectifying line 7 times and I cannot wrap my head around what that means. Even in context. This person thinks gender and sex is the same thing as they said, so why would using they/them be the thing that's objectifying woman and not using she/her (if pronoun = gender = sex) ?! The only thing that can kinda make sense to me is if this person is foreign and is confusing they/them with it/its as for quite a few languages the only neutral pronouns are those used for objects. But that had to have me take several leaps and assumption for this reasoning to somewhat follow.
How did they get to that conclusion omg
Yeah it's, like, reprehensible but it's also dizzyingly incoherent
entire offense but what the shit
Like, I get if someone's confused about it/its, but they/them? That's just... normal everyday grammar that has been used for hundreds of years...
Honestly, I’d rather be “objectified” than have traditional gender roles *forced* down my throat. 

I’ve never fit in with most humans and never identified with this wretched sex/gender dichotomy, so being left outside of traditional human gender demands is what feels right. 

To be perfectly honest, at this point I’d rather not live at all than live a lie to make people like this happy.
Ah, yes, because every time I refer to someone in gender neutral terms, regardless of how they identify, I am objectifying them. Makes total sense
Yes because instead of ""its over there"" referring to a chair or box I say ""they're over there 👀""
that literally makes no sense. i can’t find any logic behind it literally anywhere
objectifying is calling someone it/its when you know their pronouns are something different. got called it a lot in highschool when i came out as transmasc.
wait until they found out about it/its pronouns. they’re gonna lose their goddamn mind
Fucking Terfs.
I notice that in ""Progressive™️"" spaces people can tend to get very transphobic towards specifically enbies under the guise of wokeness. 

""you can't use they/them pronouns or it's objectifying, but also if you're enby and you use pronouns besides they/them are you actually even non-binary? why not just call yourself a trans man/trans woman? but we toootally support you, that's why we made this space for Women and Enbies (but only if they're afab and vaguely feminine! amab enbies either don't exist are are just Big Scary Predators trying to invade our spaces)."" 

we just can't win lmao
This reads like it was written by an AI that was asked to be pompous and confused.
I can see a point buried under all that. I can see the angle that maybe immediately identifying someone as they/them could deny them their personage. Like it’s turning a personal pronoun into a piece of objectifying language… but again this person is just missing the point of they/them pronouns in general
[removed]
Using the pronoun ‘it’ would be objectifying. Ask any transsexual, they have been hearing that forever.
Hot take maybe: this is why I have been iffy with it/it's pronouns
What does this even mean? How is this objectifying women? Especially if they are a they them. 

However, there is no such thing as a human not objectifying another human, ever at all. If you find anyone slightly desirable you are objectifying them. People tend to find objectification insulting only, and only when it's someone they don't find attractive doing it. 

I am fine with objectification, and I'm find with being the objectifier. We wouldn't have sex or reproduce as a species to make more LGBT and non binary people if this wasn't the case. 

I think people should learn to accept this as a human trait, because it has always happened and it always will. It's basic human nature.
Someone needs to get off the stupid train and stop doing drugs. That is such a hard miss it hurts.
Wat?
Yea i really don't understand what they were trying to say at all. Only questionmarks in my head
I guess I objectify people whenever I refer to a group of them in the third person
I mean they got a point. When people objectify women by calling them it or them or they it can be pretty creepy. But the people who do that seem to get really butt hurt when people want gender neutral pronouns. It's almost like being sexist and transphobic are different yet equal horrible things. Kinda like sex and gender being different things.

Edit: it being creep depends on context. We all use gender neutral pronoun to refer to people all the time.
I thought nonbinary people assign themselves their own pronouns, but I guess the left is ""objectifying women"" by forcing they/them pronouns onto girls and transing them.
This is some woke segregation tier shit🤨🤨 just let people be who they are holy shit. They/them isnt erasing women dude.
For some people is very difficult to understand the difference between sex and gender. It depends on the social environment you grew up in.
It’s only objectification is it’s made in an objectifying way, or if someone takes offense to it. Non-binary people would only take offense to they/them is they only go by it/itself. Also you can’t objectify just one person, like you can’t say only some women are property but the others aren’t. That wouldn’t make sense.
Wot
If Somebody Was Using It/Its Pronouns, I Could See Thinking It's Objectifying (Which It's Not, By The Way), But With They/Them It Doesn't Even Make Sense, It's Used To Refer To Humans All The Bloody Time, And Oftentimes In The Singular
HOW
this person's head is an airport
TERFs are reactionaries, not feminists
They/them isnt a object pronoun? Lmao I would understand where they are coming from if it was it/it's or neo pronouns. Because alot of people just don't understand why ppl use those pronouns [doesn't matter if they don't understand or not, people's pronouns etc should be respected anyways] This person doesn't really make sense ;^; lol. And gender and sex is different, now days for sure. I like to think that sex is what you were born as and what you use on like medical documents etc. Gender is what you really feel like you identify as who you truly are and you can change it to whatever you want, whenever you want.
I... I don't even understand... what?
...I guess I could kind of see their point if they were talking about it/its pronouns but that just makes no sense

Plus if someone uses they/them pronouns, even if they're afab, they most likely wouldn't identify as a woman. They seem to be very confused.
Yup. Nothing about their (oops, sorry, accidentally objectified them) point is correct
Glad someone else despises the stupid amount of misgendering in that comment
pronouns arent tied to gender, and gender isnt tied to sex. sure, they're all loosely related in some ways, but none of these things are mutually exclusive. your sex can be male, your gender being non binary and your pronouns being she/her. i think the biggest goal in society for me is to devalue the importance of sex, and hopefully some day gender. pronouns serve a social utility to language so getting rid of that would be practically impossible (though i would be interested in arguments about gender-neutralizing all pronouns, though without gender pronouns would inherently be gender neutral, or well, just neutral, so then it would be up to preference i guess), plus pronouns dont produce the social harm that gender produces, while your sex should hold no social value or utility outside of medical situations where one's sex might be important for certain types of procedures, idk, im not a doctor, im sure sex has some medical utility.
I definitely agree that the guy is an idiot, but there are actually people who identify as women and prefer they/them pronouns.
Probably from an anti-vaxx Facebook soccer mom
They think they/them pronouns are ""objectifying"" because they view enbies as subhuman.
I fucking wish I was a swarm of bees if I'm honest.
I mean I know it's a joke in enby space about ""NB"" actually standing for ""numerous bees"", but I didn't think anyone actually took it seriously until possibly today, reading this post lol.
Lmao
Appropriate time to object
That was... Objectionable!
Impossible
(First of all—massive trigger warning. I’m going deep into the root causes of sentiments like those in the screenshot) 

In the traditional gender system (patriarchy, which the person in the screenshot supports), AFABs* are seen as weak, childlike humans, needing guidance, protection, and domination by AMABs*. This is the reason for sayings like “women and children,” “ladies first,” “she’s too bossy,” “might get your clothes dirty...” etc., and criticism of “domineering” (egalitarian) wives. 

It’s also the reason for ‘traditions’ like female disenfranchisement, forbidding AFABs from military service, (cis) male control of (cis) female sexuality, shaming AFAB people for not submitting to AMABs — as they all reinforce this patriarchal sex hierarchy. 

The Abrahamic religions, as well as much of ‘gender critical’ (or ‘trans critical’) conservatism, see this system of weaponized misogyny and male privilege** as *virtuous*. They want to “bring it back” as part of restoring the old social order, which they find to be less “dehumanizing.” Because to them, to be human is to be *gendered*  based on sex at birth and assigned a place in the aforementioned hierarchy (as well as being placed in other hierarchies based on ‘race’, religion, etc.).

Trans and especially non-binary people challenge the validity of this patriarchal “great chain of being” (which also explicitly objectifies non-human animals and the environment). Because of this, those who seek to uphold it see us as the ultimate enemy. 

This is why popular anti-trans activists (including, but not limited to, GC feminists) focus more on shaming and stigmatizing trans people than resisting misogyny.  Because their primary goal is to uphold the traditional sex/gender hierarchy (and the traditional social order as a whole), not liberate women. 

*using AFAB/AMAB because we all know they don’t see trans women/men as women/men

**while AMABs hold a relatively privileged position, they’re also locked within strict gender norms, not able to show the slightest bit of “femininity” without facing ridicule and violence as reprisal. They’re also seen as expendable, able to die in war or die in dangerous occupations to protect the inferior “women and children” (again, they see AFABs as more like children, rather than equal to adult AMABs).
I don’t deny that for a second
 No you still see that shit from people who are native English speakers
It would be impossible to elaborate further because it doesn’t make any sense. It’s just prejudice and appeal to tradition (a logical fallacy). Conservatism for its own sake, even when that actively causes harm (saying this as someone who leans conservative!).
Exactly. I don’t call any living being ‘it’ (unless they [it] specifically tell[s] me to). This includes non-human animals, too.
A lot of people think that, sadly.
Yessss! Reducing people to just their sex is what’s objectifying
As a NB person who actually hates they/them pronouns being used for me because it feels like the ""Hey, You Over There!"" of pronouns? It feels *de*gendering. I agree with you that it could be taken deeper by people who care.

That said I highly doubt Douchey Misgenderson in the post up there was thinking that deep about it :V for all we know, he got they/them confused with it/its.

Hi! I don’t want to change your opinion. I just want to share my perspective. I’ve been living for years as nonbinary. For me, it’s not two genders in my head battling it out, a trippy experience, or a political statement. I’m not a man or a woman and it’s as simple as that. I happened upon this post and your comment after opening reddit for the first time in something like a month because I’m getting ready for my college business class and procrastinating. I have a partner who I’ve been working on converting a bus with to live and travel in and have been doing all the life planning that goes with that. You seem to have this idea that nonbinary people who live outwardly identifying that way are consumed by it. It’s really, for me, a very simple thing. You mention sex in the rain and building fires. Both these are things I love haha. I camp a lot in the summer. I don’t watch movies much but I could try wonder woman.
Your gender isn’t based on the things you do or don’t do or the roles you enjoy. It’s innate. And if womanhood is what you enjoy living in, then that’s you, and that’s beautiful. Create your own definition of it if you want to. The beautiful thing is, you just choose whatever pronouns feel best to you and any labels beyond that are your own business. I haven’t ever introduced myself as nonbinary. Just given pronouns if I felt safe enough to do so.
It isn’t all-encompassing, is what I’m trying to say.
[Edit: It’s been a LONG time since I used reddit. My pronouns are they/them. I’m on mobile rn so I can’t change it.]
Watch the mods delete this comment and ban me from the thread.   


I can't even express my opinion on Reddit.   


Time to go learn some html programming and start 420Chan, where I can think thoughts without inviting the ridicule of Reddit peeps, as much as a love this website.
I’m asexual, don’t find *anyone* “desirable,” and do my best never to objectify any sentient being (human or otherwise). If someone is living and breathing, they are sacred to me. 

And I still call them they/them as a default, because neutral pronouns (and non-gendering as a whole) isn’t objectifying to those who haven’t expressed an identity with a particular gender.
You objectified them twice!

WAIT, OH NO
i can’t tell if that guy is just really ignorant or flat out enbyphobic but either way they need to delete that bs comment immediately
Sex does have some medical utility, but only in some very limited situations. Human bodies are more alike than different, that’s for sure.
Sex is relevant when treating some medical disorders, especially reproductive. But there’s no reason sex needs to be gendered, either. Why are penises considered male and vaginas female? Because humans arbitrarily decided they were. Male and female are genders, not sexes. 

In the future I would love if society progressed to the point where sex was nothing more than “my genitals do function A during reproduction” or “function B” or “neither”. Because objectively, that’s all it is.
thanks for the explanation !! do you mind if i ask some questions regarding this? :0
My friend is convinced that if you use she/her pronouns, you must be a girl no matter what (and vice versa + the same with he/him).
sorry if i offended you with my comment, i don’t usually see women going by they/them so i didn’t know. thanks for informing me and i’ll be more careful next time :)
and there are women who prefer he/him pronouns.
Bee honest now. We are already a hive mind. Enbees.
Thank you for your detailed response. I appreciate it.

There is a massive irony to hear that GC feminists want to uphold the traditional sex/gender hierarchy considering how constricting it can be to those who fall outside of the binary, or even cross over.

 We should all be able to just do what we want regardless of gender norms or whatever society thinks. 

I just wish people would understand that we can do what we want with our identities and our pronouns and just leave us be. I don't get why its so hard to just give us basic respect and human consideration.

I understand the traditional genders have their norms and often anyone outside of it is often bullied or made fun of. I've seen my cis guy friends be made fun of for being feminine. I've seen  a lot of folks who fell outside of the norm be made fun of and hurt. I always tried to be kind to them and defend them. Which is partially why I'm here in this subreddit.

If only people understood we're all just people and that by treating each other with respect we might just all get along.
I’ve noticed that. People like him give me impostor syndrome for being amab.
A silver award for Douchey Misgenderson. Wish it were gold, my friend.
Thanks for the differing perspective, I really enjoy hearing about what the experience of non-binary ness is like for other folks.   


Too tired to reply properly at the moment, I will book mark this post and return to this when I have rested and have my brain back to full power.   


I hardly ever get to hear about other people's experiences. 

&#x200B;

I accidentally got myself ousted from my local queer youth group as a kid, for being too edgy in my queerness, and I really offended some folks by expressing my edgy opinions.   


Thank you so much, for taking the time to share.

I can tell you one thing. 
If you find that child molester sacred you have a problem. Don't bullshit with the holier than thou, being biased is human nature.

Objectification doesn't mean only sexual, you find them sacred, therefore you objectify them differently.

Saying you look good or your outfit is cute or you're such a wonderful person is still a judgement. Let's not debate the ethics of what is and what isn't.
“I said it! Ah! I said it again! Oh! I keep saying it!”
I think it’s both. There’s a lot of “you should know your place and stay there” energy in that comment.
As someone who has been around for a long time: 

S/he is phobic. 100%, no doubt in my mind. As someone who grew up around evangelicals, this sounds exactly like the arguments “this collection of hes and shes”* would make against our existence.

*Wouldn’t want to “objectify!”
yeah i know. i also think if we stopped using terms like ""male"" and ""female"" for certain biological functions and physical attributes it would probably make everything easier, and probably make everything make sense.
What's an example of this? Aside from like ""you have a penis so you might get testicular cancer""
yeah i agree. penises and vaginas being considered male and female respectively is a type of language and term differentiation, and just like language and terms, are social constructs, and if this social construct cause more harm than good, or isnt justified then i dont really see much a reason for keeping it. i think we could come up with better, more scientific or medical names for what we currently consider male and female, or use different terms which cover a wider array of biological functions and shit. to be completely honest im not 100% educated on all this biology and medical shit, i only got a C in biology thanks to my ability to hide my phone from teachers well and speak up sometimes. and vaguely paying attention. rarely.
Some people decide to define sex by your chromosomes however even in the same organ, including reproductive organs the actual way that those chromosomes activate or copy over during cell reproduction can change that so are you going to go through and find out how exactly your genes express in your body to find out what ratio of ""male"" or ""female"" you are or are you going to acknowledge that your sex doesn't matter overall, in societal or medical ways excluding treatment of specific parts of your body?
go ahead. keep in mind, im not 100% educated about like everything but i know what i believe in and i try my best to keep my explanations coherent and consistent.
your friend is thinking pretty irrationally and illogically.
Your friend is aggressive incorrect.
Thank you for being so polite and understanding! I understood what you meant, and it is a bit less common in the nb community, so I didn’t think it was on purpose or particularly offensive. I really appreciate you apologizing and being inclusive anyway, though. It’s always great to meet someone so kind and supportive <33
I’ve met a few butch lesbians (cis) who prefer he/him. It is definitely a real thing :).
You don’t need to feel like an impostor. You’re just as valid as any other enby.
xD thank you! I appreciate it!
When did I mention anything about child molesters? I was speaking as a baseline, and I think you knew that. 

And to be honest, there is very little about human nature that is ethical. From war, to fundamentalist religion, to sexual assault, to ecocide, humans cause far more suffering than they alleviate. 

From an objective standpoint, the best outcome for the planet (and the majority of sentient life) is human extinction. The next best thing would be a consciousness shift to humanity, where we reject the “great chain of being” idea and accept all life as having intrinsic worth.

Your attitude (“being biased is human nature”) is also the root cause of racism, sexism, and even genocide. Do you realize what you are upholding?
i really wonder how people like that live their lives…if they act so high and mighty all the time idt anyone would want to talk to them anymore
i feel like a lot of people like this will pull up any trash excuse just to act like they/them pronouns aren’t valid, being really oblivious to how dumb they sound
I think it’s probably more feasible to just stop equating male and female (sexes) with man and woman (genders). If we simply change the name without changing the basic assumption that gender = sex, the new name will eventually take on the same connotations as “male” and “female.” 

We need to destroy the idea that gender is in any way determined by sex.
IIRC, things like sex-specific cancers (breast, ovarian, testicular, prostate, etc.), certain surgeries on the digestive system (some parts differ by sex), blood transfusions, and some medication doses.
And I get it on a personal level too, because I’m technically AMAB (I know it’s not the same for me, though, because I’ve lived as / get read as AFAB). 

Still, sex assigned at birth has nothing to do with being non-binary.
And you most certainly were not speaking as a baseline, I can't read your abhorrent thoughts on shitty people. I don't know you, nor do I care. 

You said ""if they are living and breathing, they're sacred to you"" that's certainly not speaking in baseline. 
Please with the same hypocrisy as everyone else. 
🙄
agreed
Ok, you’re just another a—hole. Just leave me alone.
Am I tho? Or did I just find the fallacy in your argument and you're mad and have nothing else to say because you were actually really rude in your biased judgement about me because of your human nature while being preachy I be someone and something different in order to make myself smaller to make you feel superior?

Sharing this here because I can't post on my socials	"Hi! I'm Hollis, sorry for awkward unused account, but I started a new one due to it being possibly unsafe to post from my other account since I'm not completely out. 

Anyway, I'm recently out as non-binary/gender non-conforming to almost everyone. My partner and basically all of my friends know, but my family that lives 8 hours away is pretty outwardly transphobic, so I don't really have an opportunity to post about it or change my name online etc. for now. 

I started a new job and I guess I just didn't expect seeing my name tag with my name and pronouns to feel so good. I just wanted to share my excitement with people who would get it 🤠

I've included a selfie cuz why not 🤗"	"That's so cool! Good list of things to enjoy too 😎
This is a great format for a name tag and wish I had one like it just for like normal life and socializing.
You seem like a super awesome person tbh… if you need a friend or emotional support or whatever I gotchu
+20 to your house for the Sailor Moon shirt too
This, and you, are incredible! It’s the little things right!? Go you!😍
As someone who does business online with Noble Knight. Good on em!
Score!   

ngl, I'm the kind of person who's relieved to be at the point where I can take your pronouns on your nametag for granted and just focus on the inexplicable apostrophe for RPGs. Rock on, this is awesome!
thats so rad!!!
Ayyy, that's amazing
That’s so awesome! 💛
Hollis! Love the name, what’s your favorite Pokémon? 🤔
Everyone in the world should wear a name tag like this
You seem like an individual of taste and style, glad to hear you've got this boost 😎
Great name
Hiya Hollis, nice to meet you. Love your style. Good list of things you enjoy 😊
Hollandaise got that sauce
Hell yeah let's go punk rock
Congrats!!! That’s huge! Seeing it printed on something official can feel so so good. Wishing you the best with your new job!
🤘🏼🤘🏼🤘🏼
Wtf do you work at Noble Knight???
my dear friend’s name is Hollis! So cool to see another nonbinary Hollis out there!
Eyyyyy fellow nonbinary Hollis!! We also have very similar interests (though I'm more into musicals/showtunes than punk music, although that is great too) so this is kinda like seeing a strange mirror
I am very happy for you and wish you all the best! I hope the people around you are supportive and help you deal with your transphobic family, even if you never come out to them :)
Yo Mx. what do you think of Fallout New Vegas?
Congrats on the coming out as your true self to almost everyone.

I'm not out to many people so I get the whole not posting on socials (dont think anyone knows im on here)

Lucky you getting to be around your hobbies/interests while making a living too lol
Thanks! I work in the hobby industry, so I'm lucky enough to be surrounded by all my fun interests while making a living 🥰
Honestly yes, should I just wear it everywhere? Maybe add a little ""does not enjoy being touched"" note and we're golden
It's wild how many times I've had my breath taken away by very tiny things like this over the last several months!
Hell yeah! So far I think they seem like an awesome place to work. I just came on as the purchasing manager 🤠
The way my eye twitched when I saw it. Lmao
BIG Mimikyu guy lol. Love that sad little cutie
Would certainly streamline the social interactions I have lol
I do!
Honestly I couldn't have a better support system! Thanks for your positive vibes!!
BIG fan! I'm about to run a fallout-esque Eberron campaign in fact
Yayyyy I love this for you and hope it doesn’t stop!💛Isn’t it crazy how much goodness people can do and spread when they treat us like people instead of freaks!?
Let's pretend it's a possessive or a contraction. ""This newest RPG's class system is ass!""
YEAHHHHHH good stuff! My partner adores Mimikyu. Always glad to see another fan. I love Joltik personally. I want a pocket full
I was just there the other day!!! I looooove how queer it feels and I’ve been trying to spend more time there! Nice name tag!!!!!
Eberron? What's that? 

(And yes I asked cause the name tag had interests)
That's awesome! Vibes are definitely great. I unfortunately won't work in the store front as the purchasing manager, but I'm really happy with the environment so far!
Eberron is a sort of steam punk d&d setting! Sorry, I've worked in the gaming industry so long I operate like everyone knows what I'm talking about sometimes
I've played enough DnD and have nerdy enough friends to get part of it. Please literally tell me everything I'm curious now and needa unwind after a long day at an FRC competition.

Using they/them is easy…. as long as it’s for a trans woman.	"I met my grandma for the first time as an out adult, post-testosterone, and introduced myself with they/them pronouns. She constantly uses she/her pronouns for me anyway, claiming that they/them is just soooooo hard. And like, she’s old, I get it, I can be patient and correct her. For years. Whatever. 

But my little sister came out as trans and my grandmother seems to have NO problem using they/them for her instead of she/her. 

Why is they/them so hard when it’s MY pronouns but it’s “easier” to use when misgendering my sister?!!!! Where’s the fucking logic in that????"	"That's actually an old joke in the community, what's the easiest way to get someone to call you they them? Come out to them as a trans woman who uses she her pronouns. It's a tale as old as time
The logic is that she wants to missgender you two. So now you know she can use they/them but she'll only do it to missgender a trans woman in this case.
""Have you tried actually trying? Like, actually putting in effort? Like fucking any effort at all?""
""they/them"" is easier to use because it un-genders your sister and is therefore insulting.

""She/her"" for you is a move to infantilse you while rei-fying your agab.

It's all calculated impolite behaviour.

The cis math absolutely checks out when you understand the equations and not just the ""pronoun answers.""
I thought maybe you can play game with her too. Since she uses your preferred pronouns with your sister and viceversa. You can tell her she must be confused because she is old already. Maybe she needs to go see a doctor, her memory is not right... And you introduce yourselves (names, pronouns, ""we are your grandkids""...) very slowly and loud. Everytime she gets the pronouns wrong get upset because she is getting old and makes you sad, you reintroduce yourselves again... I know it's petty, but she started it xD Hopefully she stops out of embarrassment or anoiance
Grandma is making it clear you're not welcome. You might wanna do the same.
Bigotry and being mean then disguising it as an age thing, sorry to say. She's mean spirited about it and I'm sorry you have to deal with it.
They're great at it when the intent is to purposely avoid correctly gendering us. There is no logic to it. Pure contrarian bullshit.
similarly: afab she/they’s never get called they and amab she/they’s never get called she :(
SAME. My mom constantly uses she/her for me despite me requesting that she use they/them - she claims ""it's so hard"" and she ""needs more time."" I came out to her around 5 years ago, so I'm genuinely curious just how much time she thinks she needs/deserves. My friend that has known me since kindergarten (so, almost as long as my mom has known me) got my new name and pronouns down almost immediately.

Meanwhile, my mom uses they/them for my girlfriend, which is really bizarre considering that *she has only ever known my girlfriend as a woman.* It's so frustrating. I'm willing to tolerate a lot of disrespect toward myself (read: I am a pushover and bad at enforcing boundaries), but I draw the line at disrespecting my girlfriend. I've been seriously considering telling my parents that I won't visit them anymore if they can't get it right, but I'm worried that this isn't a serious enough reason to warrant cutting them off. Idk.
This happened on an Irish radio program where they were discussing the trans ""debate"". The nonbinary person was consistently she/her'd by the host and other guests, yet when a trans man came on the line, everyone used they/them to talk about him.
This is not an age thing. One of the most supportive people in my life is in his 70s. Like sure he was confused when I came out, and he hasn't always used the right terminology for me. But he's done research on his own and he's clearly trying his best.
Yep. My parents use they/them for my trans sister instead and still deadname her. Idk why they don’t just use he/him at that point
I go by They/She. I used to go by She/They, but that was just an invitation for people to ignore the They part. I use They/Them for myself constantly but sometimes She/Her works too. I’m still very feminine, but I’m just a person, a smol kitten, not a woman.
Call her grandpa the next time you see her and see what happens. emphasis on the ""pa"" part.
how to make this work for an afab person
Idk man, my mom started using we/our for a friend of mine after she came out. ""So, [friend's name], what are we up to nowadays?"" while talking to me about her lmao
And then they're like ""ohh but it's so hard to remember"" even if they've never known the person by any other pronouns...
i am out as a trans woman but am secretly nonbinary so im kinda doing this......

but really it was that i thought i was a trans woman at first, and i kinda do prefer she/her, sort of....but i think mostly because the experience of being misgendered with they/them feels like total shit because you know and they know why they're doing it. i unfortunately kind of associate they/them with that feeling now which sucks because i think i would at least like them just as much as she/her if not more otherwise
ok wait wow this is interesting cause i'm a transfemme, i use they/she in that order because i don't mind she and i prefer they but cis and straight people who try to be queer friendly tend to default to she with me unless i specify. it seems like everyone around me assume i'm a woman or am trying to pass as one as soon as they hear trans femme but obviously transness goes so much further than just that
Kinda Weird That She'd Use They/Them Instead Of Upright Using He/Him Honestly, Maybe In An Attempt To Look Supportive Despite Not Actually Looking Such, Or Just For Plausible Deniability If Called Out On It?
Gaslighting grandma for the win
Tell people you go by he/they. It seems to work like a charm even for the allies I know. 🙄
Buy a nerf gun and use it on whoever gets it wrong. Maybe an  airhorn if the situation requires it.
Same: come out as a trans woman who uses she/her pronouns.
Woah. That is wild. I’ve never seen someone go the we/our route… wowwww
It's probably cis math.

You have to ""earn"" being a man. And doing so is an impossible task if you're afab.

If you're amab and a trans woman, your man card only gets revoked until they find a convenient time to use it to misgender you, and then it's temporarily re-issued to the holder.

/j
That's unironically what I do. I use he/she/they pronouns so I just tell everyone I'm out to he/him so there's about a 33%/33%/33% chance I'll get called any set
Actually, fun fact. When I went by they/them pronouns, nobody had a problem using the correct pronouns. But then I put he/they as my pronouns, and suddenly everyone messes up and uses she/they instead. The logic??? Idk.
I did that, saying if they/them is too challenging they can use he/him, but they still just use she/her bc they’re bigots
Oh shit new pronouns dropped???? Jokes on her I like those pronouns now and I am commandeering them.
i actually really fuck with this it’s so much better than xir/xim in my opinion bc those are not words - we/our those are fuckin words bayyybeee and it’s actually understandable how one would use them in a sentence it’s awesome - so for ppl who don’t understand this - they/them gets a bad wrap for being plural when it’s only one human and i’m sure we/our will too but i like this idea really bc it suggests more than one gender in one and that is the purpose of the plural in this scenario i believe anyway
Ah Of Course. ~~Jokes On Them I'm Smuggling Man Cards Out To Anybody Who Wants Them, Can't Stop Me!~~
lol I might try something like that. I accept all 3 but honestly prefer they/them, but I'm also a very masculine looking AMAB, so as you can imagine he/him is the norm. I'm sure if I switch to she/they I'll get a mix of they/them and he/him
i feel and i’m a nb person when u go from they/them to a gendered pronoun + they i find if someone uk is born female for instance uk as a feminine energy and they present as such, then they come out as they them but then switch to he/they — first of all i gotta be honest i mix up he/she pronouns at least 3 times a day and this goes for cis ppl/gender non conforming ppl/and/or my cat’s pronouns and it’s so not on purpose and this whole pronoun discourse in society right now has me so bugged out that i can’t even mix up my words without feeling like i’m hurting someone sooo that being said if one switches from she/her (OG)>>>they/them>>>he/they there is going to be an adjustment period and if u look feminine and a person doesn’t know you ik it hurts but u can’t help the way a person perceives you. but it’s f they disregard the they part entirely or just purposely say she they’re obviously just dicks - sorry for my run on sentences i’m not adding grammar sorry y’all
I corrected my MIL the other day and she just rolled her eyes. Alternatively, I play D&D with Europeans that apparently have never dealt with this before. They proceeded to say ""She er... He/they!"" Which is just facepalmingly stupid. It's one or the other not both!
*Our* pronouns
I don't think I was issued a man card, but I bought my spouse The Woman Cards as a gift a few years back, so I can just borrow some of those, right?
Omg you talk like me. I totally agree. I wanna be good but I mess up pronouns all the time. And also when you're from a bilingual family or are bilingual it's so easy to mess up pronouns. Some languages don't use pronouns or use gendered anything for the most part. My coworkers mess up pronouns, my mom messes up, my girlfriend, me... I tend to default to they for everyone. It's the safest and easiest. I also plan to come out to my parents about being non binary... ( I'm about to be 32.) I bought a comic book from Amazon to explain it lol I think it's called, ""A Quick Guide to They/them Pronouns"" by Archie Bongiovanni. It honestly has always bothered me when my parents say feminine words around me about me, mostly my dad. It just feels like he's saying it on purpose. So hard. Always referring to me as, ""your daughter, She!"" I know of course that isn't true but the more I learn about myself and have accepted that I am non binary, it has been grating me more and more. Uh... Spilling my heart out uh hahaha my bad. Anyway. Point is, I know it'll be hard for my parents to correct themselves. I know they care for me and love me, but this is such a new and hard subject for some that I'm scared of their reaction even though I know they are great parents. I never really talked to them about personal things ever. Okay uh yeah it'll take time for people to get it.

Also, I used to go by Nova for a while and alot of my irl friends have told me that they really like that one. Opinions?
I WANT HAIR LIKE THAT
i've seen Silas here and I'm a big fan!! If you're going for more dramatic flair, Ares, Mars, and Jupiter all are names of Gods and planets (and I've seen on a range of nonbinary people) - Theseus could be a powerful name, but is pretty masc. 

Sol is such a nice name, and if you're genderfluid in your presentation you could use Solomon on masc days and Sol on neutral/fem days!

if there's a reason you don't like nova but you still want a cool space name, you could go with quasar. if not that, you could name yourself like me, and take the name of a mineral, rock, element, gem, etc. and make slight alterations to it (I've found that rocks and stuff are some of the things that people least associate with a masc/fem spectrum) for example my name is ""komatii"" based in the mineral ""komatiite"".
Wren or Ryn, Reid, Kai, Cyrus/Silas, Sybil, Syd.
lex or jasper !
Ray
Unique
Rai
nova or somethibg spacey makes sense in my mind
Why not Lion?
Don't have a name but I like that theorist drip
Jagger, Dawson, Ash, Val, Phoenix, Kadin, Quinn
Cloud bc big hair, but like imagine being Frost or Claw
Zion
please tell me how you get your hair to be this fluffy😩
Géne, it's Irish and I think it's gender neutral
Kenny
Hunter
Dama
Gary
Chris/ty
Simon/e
Leroy? If you wanna keep the L theme lol
a fellow theorist i see… first off, i love you hair, secondly, i think sybil fits you? if you want something a bit less out there though i think alex and a names would suit you as well.
Victory?
Rox
1. goddamn you look good

2. i’d have to say rowan or robyn
LOVE THE HAIR, LOVE THE JACKET
lime maybe?? also I love the jacket
raven !!!
Raven?
Grouse
Rush
hmm, Robin?
My name is feminine and I like it, but when I don’t feel feminine, I use my nickname, which is Mars. It sounds neutral.
Ash
Felix
Alex
Cruz
Rin
Jordan
Sam
Bread
Nat/Nate
Elli
Em
Scoot/scooter
Sky
Ore, Decay, Arc, Level. Love the game theory merch!
Bones or just straight up your zodiac sign
I love your hair! Some names that I feel that ""Theo"" (means God), or ""Havoc"" (means chaos and destruction) suit you the most! Just my opinion! <33
Leo?
Euhm hi! Looking at u makes me so nervous lol ur so fucking beautiful/handsome 😩🥺 i love the name nova ☺️
Oh please Kaz suits you so well
Lazerath
Cole? I know it’s not gender neutral but it is the first name that came to mind
[deleted]
I've never been good at naming, just wanted to say that you're really attractive. Have a good day!
Ziya or Zion, btw you’re really fucking cool :3
Griz
Ashtyn
You look like a Trinity to me. Love the sweater btw!
Lavender....idk  if it's good but it's the first thing that I thought...
Lius
Idk what name suites you but you look sooo coooool
Noel. Yes I just reversed your current name. 😋
I'm so jealous of your hair.
- Aries/Mars
- Quinn
- Ziv
- Xen
- Vesper
- Orion
- Delta


I couldve misinterpreted what you meant by ""powerful"" but these are the names I think would fit you!! Also i really like ur hair :) i hope you have a nice day/night!
Maybe Leo? Is that gender natural? And you also look amazing! I hope you'll find a name that will suit you the best... Have a wonderful day 😄
Josie/Josiah
Apollo? Luna? Hex?
I looked at you and my brain immediately fired off the name Kilian. ^_^
Powerful name?

Rocket
Phoenix
Yo, Neo/Neon?
I’ve been thinking about going by Jona or Jonah, it’s traditionally male but i think it can go either way
Radish like the veggie
Danae
For some reason you look like a Max or a Alex or maybe even Ian?

Although i gotta admit the name ""Nova"" defiantly sounds better than my suggestions...
I know it's not exactly the character's hairstyle, but my first thought was Rogue.
Skylar
I agree with everyone else who’s suggested Raven…
But that’s just a theory, a NAME theory!
Robin.
""Ari"" would suit you. It's a strong name with roots in hebrew.

And can I just say that your hair looks otherworldly fabulous? Because it _does_! Amazing look💖
Ash/Ashley or something like that I don't really have a supportive mom and my dad moved state so...umm yeah I really got nothing sorrys
[removed]
Halo!!
Tron
What do you think of the name Talin?
Azra
Ezra
Altay 
Ilan
I think you look like an Orion tbh. 

PS: Love your hair!
Aeon popped into my head. 8D
Idl why ig the game theory and red hair makes me think of neo idk why
You give me slight Lycan vibes, honestly
I don't really any suggestions but what about Roen? Anyways your hair is so cool ☺️
Finch or Soda maybe Crow?
Not good with names but GAME THEORY HOODIE
What about loki? Its a powerful name god of mischief i think? Regardless of what you choose im sure it will suit you
I immediately got “c” name vibes like Cameron or Cal!
Everest
Try your favourite cartoon characters for inspiration, I almost called myself Finster (I was obsessed with the rugrats as a little kid) or just characters in general.
Kay…. I don’t know why but that was the first name I thought of when I saw you. ❤️❤️
No names... but that hair tho...
Lake I’d say
Idk about a name but I like your drip and hair, fits you really well
If you’re going for a powerful name you can look to rulers and emperors for inspiration. Augustus (August), Julius (Jules), Cleopatra (Cleo). You could also look to deities and sorcerers like Morrigan, Apollo, Loki etc.
Rhea?
Ash, Flame, Ember, Fire, Rain, or Arson
Something like Arson, or you also look like a Max or a Zeph
Helo, Starbuck, Skulls, Racetrack.
Jagrebawöy
Auburb
james
It's alright :) Thank you!!
Ahh love this suggestion! Bird themed names are just 😍😍
And Phoenix comes to mind for something that (I think) fits.

And is also neutral.

Also, I definitely think it falls into the “powerful sounding” category, especially because they friggin are, and technically can never die (as they are reborn from their ashes when they do pass)!
I love Nova! It makes me think of Super Novas and how they're cool. And hey, great to see another enby theorist!
Okay I actually really like that one, your friends like it, you’ve already used it, and SPACE
i think nova is a great name! it suits you v well
🖤🖤🖤
These are all wonderful suggestions!! Thank you! 🖤
Honestly I think OP should change their name to Nova Silas Sparrow.
Oh my 😭
Ooo I've never heard that one! It's nice!
YOO THAT'S MY MIDDLE NAME
Ooo that's a new one! And thank you!! 🖤
And the God that Tuesday is named after

LOVE
Aster is so cool!
Hii! Haha 💚
Love this idea! Thank you!
Ryn was the powerful lead mermaid in the show Siren!

Also a Star Trek character who has an interesting storyline
I LOVE Jasper, but it's my ex's name 😭
I used to go by Nova! Love space themed names!
Cutee 🦁🦁
It's alright! Thanks!!
I don't do anything with it actually, it just air dries like that. 😅 It's pretty layered tho so that helps! Oh and I pin my bangs up while they dry for extra fluffyness there!
Hehe yess! And thank you for your suggestions!
Ahh cool suggestion!!
1. Ugh thank youu 😩 🖤
2. I like Robyn! Thanks for your suggestions!

Cutee!
You're suggestions are great!
Haha! A theory indeed!
Tysm!! 🖤
Maybe hunter?
Oh, i'm sorry about that! I hope things change for you soon!
Thank you!!
How is it pronounced?
Ooo and thank you!!
I like that one!
Neos cool!
😮 This one's cool!!
I like it! And thank you!!
HAH!
Loki 😍
Finn from Adventure Time for me 🥴
Thanks!
OOO OKAY! THANKS!
I really like Sparrow too. It's unique, gender neutral, and of course, awesome. I think it's pretty powerful too, but maybe thats just because I like sparrows.
Since you like bird themed names might I suggest Crow or Kestrel?
Yess! That's actually how I came up with it! Love the space themed names!
I've got hair like that :D I cut it a month ago and it's the shortest I ever had. I didn't even knew you curls where that strong. Love the hair and I have the same jacket. Game theory fan ;) 
Edit: ok know I'm thinking about posting a picture just to proof those two things. I don't look as cute as you do but It's funny we have those things in common.
Silas is my cousins chosen name! It’s a great one :-)
Lucky you! It’s a great name. 😌
I thought you looked like a Raven before I even read your caption
You’re a new transition goal for me now
Oh my god thank you so much you just made my day
My name is Kai Ryn :)
NOOOOO omg

There's also a Seraphim. Apperantly it's a normal name in Greece , it gave me strong nb vibes

Very popular anime about titans suddenly attacking humanity, which built a great fortress city that is the only place humans can still live in response.
Oh that’s so cool!
ah yes ,,,,,, you are right
chopped the collar off literally like two hours ago too because it kept falling over the giraffe’s head 😂"	hgzwwp	NonBinary	1064	1.0	2020-06-27 19:36:02
I just started a new job, and they started putting pronouns on the schedule! <3		"cosmetician got the they/them pronounce, we in good hands
Awh I love this!  Considered asking my manager about doing that but I'm too afraid to ask😅
:)
I love this ❤️
Cosmetician...wus dis? Sounds fancy (my english is not that good, so i don't know every word...but i know it' something with cosmetics :3 )
[deleted]
This is amazing!
That's amazing, it removes the awkwardness of correcting people (I always feel really anxious when I correct people and usually I just won't and internalise it)
This is so dope!! My online job space did this as well, such a simple way to help people feel like people.
that's amazing! such a nice feeling to work in a welcoming environment! wish all the best for you and your new job!! <3
OH WOW! Love this so much
Love to see it! Hope the rest of your time there is just as good! Strong first impression 💗
Yup, that's me!
Fair enough! I didn't ask about this, they did it proactively which was super sweet.
Basically, I'm in charge of the Cosmetics department at a pharmacy. I keep the displays stocked and pretty, and I advise people on makeup and skincare.
Yup, that's me! 😁
Yeah, and it puts the weight of the employer behind it too, so you're not the only advocate. 

The company also recently started distributing official pronoun stickers for our name tags, which I think is because of something I wrote in an internal survey.
That is super sweet, really happy for you!
Uuuh your job is fancy indeeed :3
It's a good idea honestly, I like it. I saw in another comment that you didn't have to ask for it either which is super sweet of them that they did it out of their own initiative"	x6r93w	NonBinary	1067	1.0	2022-09-05 21:03:16
Challenge: try and give me a new name, based on these three pics of me. Name can be male/female or both, I use any pronouns.		"[deleted]
Oka - It's Finnish name that is used for all genders and it means ""spike of a plant"" and I've always liked it. And you made me think of it :>
Rocco
Jay
Dawn/Don. The only thing is your not allowed to spell it for anyone leaving them lost and confused
you remind me of a Yuri I used to know (name is male in some cultures but female in others so ymmv. dude i knew was from the ukraine.)
Wow I love your vibes. How about Morris? It gives me masc/enby vibes if you’re up for that. Maybe you can have multiple names/nicknames for whatever vibes you’re feeling
Casey
Jess
Russell
max seems to fit
Sora is a good name, it's a non gendered Japanese name that means void/sky 
Here is how you write it 
空(🈳)
The emote is the irl method to write it, now some systems will make this kanji look diffrent, but the emote never changes. Couldn't find a good french name cuz french is a romance language, so everything is gendered except the pronoun ""iel"" , the word ""avion"" which means air plan and ""trampoline""(since 2018)
You look like a Chase to me.
Lamar, Ellis, Canyon, Jacob, Carson, Camden
Harley
Finley
River. Because that's the only name that came into my head when I saw your photo.
I’m getting some Sam or Charlie vibes. Idk you seem very friendly and like good company at a bar, and I’d bet Sam or Charlie both know how to have a good time
I think Mack suits you :)
Mica
Drew is a fun gender neutral one
Tate
Jethro
Riley
Evan!
Alexis?
Sam
The ones that jumped out to me are jack (more neutral than it gets credit for imo, Jackie also cool and p neutral or jax is pretty lit) and Sten (idk why)
Alex/Ruth
basic but you look like a jay to me (could be short for whatever or nothing, just seems to fit)
Cam
Henry
 My brain immediately said Jackson or Jax
Jillian is the first one that came to mind. To me that name sound both feminine and tough
you look like Frank/ Frankie to me
something starting with a ch- sound.  
like chuck or charley
Jenn. I have no idea why it just seems good
Kane
Evan or Jay
Chase ☺️
Zeke
Tommie.
Donny
>luca
You look like an Adam
Skylar!!!
I’m getting julian vibes idk
i feel like you look like a Gwen, i dunno why
I want to call you Lance or Red or Hero.
Ash 😃
You look like you could be a Deborah or a Steven.
Ashton/Asher
Briar
I like Max
Terry or Ash
Ray. Is that good?
Jason, I feel like it fits you
Jonah.
Hmmmm.... David!! :D i know a lot of ppl think of that as a ""basic"" name but ive only ever known badass Davids so now it has a cool ring to it imo
 Kikka is: Mistress of all in German names
Adam. when I saw the third pic I literally thought ""FOR F\_CKS SAKE ADAM""
Surge
Niko

Not sure why, you just have that sorta vibe goin on
Mylo - on side note, your style is absolutely amazing
You look like you’re named Dan idk why
Orthan idk why just seems like it
Randell
Janie-Scott? That’s so specific but it immediately came to mind
Zion
Jackson or Ashe and maybe Marli? (Marlee or Marley)
Idk why but the first thing I thought of was revolution
Ray
Carson.
Strider
Nick
Devin \*immediately\* sprang to mind! Per wikipedia: 'Devin is a unisex English-language given name, of many origins. One origin for Devin is from the surname Devin, which is an anglicization of the Irish patronymic Ó Damháin. The Irish patronymic is in reference to the given name 'damán allaid' meaning ""fawn"", or ""poet.""'
James
Harper
Rebel, Sasha, Alex(is), 
or, 
Aodh, Cathair, Fiach, Tadhg

I'm irish so I always think of Irish names. If you're American there's a good chance you have some Irish in you anyway ☺.
These are mostly male leaning names but I think you'd suit a sorta rebel/warrior name. Cathair is derived from struggle or battle, Aodh (aid) has something to do with fire and Fiach (fee-ahk) comes from Hunter. Tadhg (taig or tieg like tay or tie with a g) just means poet but still sounds cool imho.
Mac jumped into my mind immediately
Absolutely no name, but where do you got the overall from? 1) u look hella fine in it 2) I want it for myself
Tyler seems like it might fit
Reese
Chestnut or Chess for short!
reggie ? wayne ? winona ? i'm seriously stealing your whole wardrobe
Rob is what first came to mind after the prompt, but after seeing all 3 I can say for certain if I saw you at a bar, I'd be aiming for your digits. 😍
Spencer
Gregory heffly
Venture
Harlan: Masc name but sounds rather non-binary. Bonus is that you can claim to have started a food fight at a science fiction convention and came to blows with another writer at an awards show in the 70s (see below)

Harlan Ellison was a mid-century sci-fi writer who penned an episode of TOS Star Trek, and the outer limits but is mostly known for his short stories. He was possibly the most confrontational writer of the 20th century, should look him up. Has sued Gene Roddenberry for plagiarism and thought about it with James Cameron.
Alex\~!
Jonah !
Carson
Zander
jody, because you look just like the biggest influence in my life, Sr. Jody P.
Not sure why but }acton or Austin seem like they kinda fit. 

You look amazing by the way, honestly gender goals.
Love the DM shirt, but I really can't help you with names, I'm one of the worst people when it comes to names
Jax, Dax, or Javik
Drew?
Don, Holland, Alloy, August, Lake
Thor
Vesper, one of my names rhshnsa
Cole! Or Colin.
Glenn
Cato
it’s probably bc the second pic but “Houston”
Jack? Idk just felt like the vibe fit
Milo
That last pic really came as a surprise

Also, you look like a Jesse to me
Ashbury
Alexander- idk you just look like one lol.. also if you shorten it to Alex it’s gender neutral
Kai
Bartleby
You look like a Bryce to me
You seem like an Austin to me.
Barry comes to mind at first
Akira.

It means ""bright fire"" in Japanese and is a gender neutral name.
Alex
Duncan...maybe Riley.
Kieran
Rudy
For some reason, I thought of Bastion. I don't know, it just popped into my head
Jericho is the first name that popped up in my head idk why. Lol.
No idea why, but they second pic screams the name Caleb!
Gabe
Couldn’t tell you why, but I looked at you and thought “Ace”! 
(Also that power lift in the last pic is 11/10)
tyler, jo, jordan, johanne, johannson
Charlie!
Zed
nigel
something about you reminds me of the army so i immediately thought something like chief or trooper haha
Quinn
Quill
phineas!
Atticus
Randi
jean

meredith

dominique

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Ajax?
Shane!
Cam. And obsessed with the cargo pants
Zia / Zee
Dillon
Kenny
I’m getting Chaz or Chet vibes!
It is giviiiiing...anything with a j. Maybe Jasper?
Felix
My brain went to Clancy…
ramie or remy. no idea why, but that feels really fitting.
Reece
Aton (Short for Anthony or something), Alex, Sam, Dean

Ooh Dean would be cool. You could use some androgynous version of the name and confuse the heck out of people :)
Boris/Borys first came into my mind. I could also see Emil or Dorian I think
Blaise
You look like a sam/sammie
Jules
Gerry
I don't know why but I immediately saw you and thought Parker. It's gender neutral and could work for any pronouns.
Aaron or Wes
i feel like Milo would really fit you!
Sunny is what comes to my mind. It feels like a nice cheerful name that can be for female or male.
Sigourney
You seem strong and wise so Chuck
Marshall
Arlo.
Sloan comes to mind. You seem like a badass!
Ridge
Dash!
Gerard? Something with a G
Tori
Xavier or Maxim, Xavier is just a fitting name and Maxim in Russian means the greatest, and also fits.

(Max-eem)
my brain is going in the inanimate object direction (as per usual) but first thought was Cannon
Chance. I think it fits plus the d&d shirt
Tyler. I have no explination.
rain or charlie
Jason
jake from state farm
Carter or Cardyn
Runic or Atlas?
Finn, Jamie or ken
im thinking oliver

Getting a Devin/Devan vibe personally!!
Barry
Kevin or Derek, something with a k
Idk why, but I think something like Jason
Butch
you give me Evan vibes. idky, but you just do.
chad
Axel!
I was thinking of Adrian for some reason
Reese (any variation of spelling idk what it is typically)
Grayson or Kieran
Look like a Steph to me, you can twist it both ways if you like.
Jamie
I get a ""Connor"" vibe from you.
Kade
Parker or something with an ""er"" at the end
Sammy or Sammi in the Arab world its a masculine name that means risen or high but in Finland its a feminine name I honestly forgot the meaning  but ill ask my sister next time i speak to her and fill you in soon 
P.S. Till i noticed someone else suggest Dawn/Don was my first choice but heres to more options 😮‍💨
quentin
Ryder for the second pic
Clyde for the third
How about ✨""Tachi"" 😬✨?
It's a kind of long edged samurai sword. And cool af.
Clark
Dallas
Rocko 😈
Dylon
Dylan, it was just the first name that came to mind after looking at the pictures (you look awesome btw) so I went with it.
you look to me like someone with an S name. Maybe something like Sam? Or Shiloh?
I am feeling a Charlie
Idk why, but I got Noa vibes
You look like Tim would fit you 🥰
I see you as a Zach!
Craig, no particular reason 😂
something beginning with d - like Damon or something :D
Lesley
Ty or Max vibes
collin
My first thought was Davy/Davey, but I have some more :D  
Masculine: Milan, Rory, Darvey, Dian, Kai/Kay, Jack, Devian, Keith, Aran, Lex
Feminine: Fenna, Diana, Sevi/Sevia, Autumn, Jackie, Mabel, Azzy/Azzey, Azura, Luz
Neutral: Will, Max, Sam, Void, Saturn, Devi, Kaeya, Kaen/Cayne, Xylaen, River, Ace, Lux
Idk why but Taylor comes to mind?
onyx
Tristan
Jacob for a more masculine name, and Hope for a more feminine? And for neither something like Milo? IDK lol-
Kevin... just Kevin U KnW some Kevin vibes on you
Liam
Mikhail :) It’s the Russian version of Michael. A nickname for it is Misha.
Jacques. No reason... Just look like it'd suit 🤷
Asher
Jimmi
Sammie
Anthony sounds good
Tyler is the name that came to mind when I saw these pics
Jon
Dunno why but I’m getting strong Jonah vibes
dude... Ivan.. it struck me as soon as i saw you
Marcus 🤙
cub or caleb
Gabriel
Lexi. It could be both pronouns and people will call you sexy Lexi cause you're beautiful.
I'd say something with a J like jason, jay, jackson, jonas,jo, jessie, june,...
Ridley? First thing that popped into my head, kind of a sick name
Tate/Tatum idk why, just seems right
Gardenia
Josh? I dunno it's not a great name.
Endrohuman is your name. It comes from endrogenous and human, cuz you look endrogenous af.
Seriously Fabulous
First thing that came to my mind was carter. Not enough people are named carter
Tracy Trance Tacticool
definitely getting either a connor or a sprout vibe here
How about……clown????🤡
For some reason the name I thought of was ""Emla"" which in asatru is the name of the first female.

I don't know why though (I don't believe in asatru; as in I don't follow the religion; and I just randomly remember the name Emla and who in asatru Emla was)...
Thanks! Odd compliment, but I'll take it. 

Tough, to be fair, Ripley is both gender and life goals.
Nice one. I like how it sounds and it has an interesting meaning.
Spike would be a good name too tho- XD
Tht sounds like okra.
Nice, I like it.
Nice, I like the double meaning with it also being the name of a bird.
Definitely jay
I thought Jay too! Also Jayce.
I like dawn. Has some really nice vibes to, of a moment of beauty, before a fresh new day full of adventure and possibilities is about to start.
It's 'Ukraine' and not 'the Ukraine'

[[Merriam-Webster](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/Ukraine)] [[BBC Styleguide](https://www.bbc.co.uk/newsstyleguide/u)] [[Reuters Styleguide](https://handbook.reuters.com/index.php?title=U#Ukraine)]

^(Beep boop I’m a bot)
Interesting. Masc/Enby vibes are definitely nice. 

I kinda go by multiple names already. Only some times my birth name (don't like it that much), most often my last name, cause it's a thing at my workplace that we refer to everyone by their last name. Could be your best friend, it's still last name only (or a nickname) , I even refer to my brother who works here by our family name. I like my job, so just using my last name in other places has been a nice n simple option. I've also been trying Sam for a bit now, and for years I went around using ""Admiral"" as my name. So currently I introduce myself with 4 names.
Sora sounds very nice, and void and especially sky are really nice meanings.
That’s what I think too!
Lol I think the L Word ruined that one for me
Uhhh, I like that one, nature, water, movement all very nice associations.
I was going to say Charlie!
I've been trying Sam for a bit now and Charlie has been on my list of considerations. Thanks for the compliment, I guess I know to have fun, though I haven't been to a bar in ages, due to covid and because we've been having parties with the rest of the building in the communal kitchen instead.
Came here to say Sam!
I've been trying that one for a bit actually. I like how it could be a shortened version of Samantha, a girls name or simply a guys name.
Alex is nice, has this nice ""could be a shortened version of a girl's name, could just be a guy's name"" thing.
Well, I went around calling myself Admiral for years, so not the strangest name I have had. Not sure if I want to call myself (a) Hero, sounds a bit arrogant, but I really like Red.
I've really considered this one, but unfortunately I and my friends have had some bad experiences with a guy called Max. Lots of lies, accusations, manipulation and general sgitty behavior on his part. We all laugh about it now, and it's been a very long time, but I've decided that it's not worth trying to reclaim that name.
I've actually considered Jason, because it means ""healer"" and I am/am training to become a medic, so it would really fit.
Sounds nice, unfortunately ""Kika"" is a popular kids channel here in Germany.
I sadly don't get the joke, though Adam is a valid option. The third pic was more of ""I'm tired, can someone carry me?"" ""sure I can!"", because I will carry you, but I'll carry you like that. This is also me bragging about being able to haul an entire second person around.
Uhh, nice vibes with that one. Like lots of energy just waiting for the go to be released.
Interesting, I've always liked that name, but it's not really an option for me, as this is a common shortening of my brothers name. With both of us working at the same place, where we use last names almost exclusively, wear uniforms and the two of us looking somewhat similar, it's confusing enough as is.
Thank you. I like sound of Mylo, unfortunately the dog of my boss is named like that, and I couldn't compete with his cuteness.
I like this one. Has nice associations with travel and adventure.
Rebel/Warrior, well you got me there. Got some really nice names/meanings there.
On a side note I'm very much German going back into the 1700 century, but using old German names tends to have a bad connotation to them.
Thanks, it is in fact not an overall, I just tucked the top part into the pants wich are just black cargo pants. I think I got those from EMP, but I have several black cargo pants, those on the 3rd pic are ""US army ranger cargo pants"" or something like that, which are pretty good. The black top was called ""foreman jacket''? I'd have to look up the brand, but I got it for cheap at an outlet type store. The belt is a generic"" tactical belt"" and I think I just got the bandana cheap of amazon. Hope this helps.
Wayne sounds interesting. Also half of my wardrobe is just ""black cargo pants"", followed by ""black shirt with print tucked into pants"" and black belt and black boots.
Uhh, like adventure or as in ""big project"", I really like the idea of using it as a name.
I feel honored by that suggestion. Sadly my native language doesn't have a ""th"" sound, so it's just pronounced as ""Tor"" which doesn't sound as nice.
I really like Colin or Collin.
I like it. Plus the Hawaiian version means ""sea"" which is pretty nice.
I have been considering Alex, or a version of Alex.
Thanks, and I am asexual, so I'd fit.
Army? Don't know where you got that vibe from... 

Well, I went around for years calling myself Admiral, but can't really do that anymore since I'm actually in the military now, training to become a medic. So I kinda need a new name. Beyond just my last name like others use first names, it's a weird thing to outsiders, but normal here, and I like it.
I really like Ryan for some reason.
Sounds really badass for some reason. I like it.
Cargo pants, especially black ones, are life though.
I've been considering Jason. It does have that j, and it means healer. I am/am training to become a medic, so it'd fit.
I've been considering both Alex and Sam. Both have that ""could be a shortened girs name, could be a regular guys name"" thing. To confuse people even more.
I've tried Sam for a while now, and it seems like a very valid option.
I've had a suggestion with different spelling, but my bosses dog, which he often takes to the office, is called Milo, so I could never take that name. I'll never be as cute him. It is a good name though.
I know how to handle almost any kind of firearm, so I guess it's not too far of?
I've had this suggestion before. It means healer, as a medic/medic in training I'd be very down for it.
3rd time getting this suggestion. Jason means healer and I am/am training to become a medic. So it's a very good option.
I like Grayson. Sounds really nice.
Over been trying Sam for a bit now, the option of using Sammy as a version of it is definitely nice. Dawn does also sound nice though.
I have been trying Sam for a while now. Definitely one of my top candidates for a new name.
Or Embers
Cory? Not a good name either.
Connor sounds nice, could be shortend to Con.
Why?
Bit random but I misread it as “I like how it tastes” lol, kinda common trans name but Elliott (or different spelling) maybe? It can be shortened to Ellie for more feminine or Eli for more gender neutral? Idrk
Heck yes!!
I have a cat named Spike and she is the absolute best!
You definitely give me that energy—can’t wait to see what fits you best!
Good luck on decided the perfect name. Whatever you choose will be awesome
sorry bot
Oh I can definitely see you as a Sam kinda guy
Plus it's from Doctor Who.
Aw man that sucks. Sorry to hear that
Oh nice, now it fits you more than I thought it would lol
Understood, I am 1/2 German from my mother
Haha fair enough :)
point still stands :D curious to see what you decide on, assuming you dont already have a name and this was just for fun!!
Like both! You really give an adventure sort of feel, like someone who gets things done. Plus, noun names rock!
I love that for youuu!
Ooh yeah, those are pretty good ideas
What about Riley?
Danni is always a great option as well very versatile dont ya think   
P.S. Merry Christmas 😊
I've been trying Sam recently, could be short for Samantha, could just be Sam, can be used as Sammie, nice and sg as is. But I've been really unsure recently, so I decided to let the internet do some brainstorming. Fun, but with the side effect of getting some possible ideas. 

Got Jay several times and Jason. I've been thinking of combining them, using Jason, with Jay as a short version. Jason means healer, and Jay can also be a bird. Free, adventure loving, medic in training, that I am... I love these meanings. Though Sam is very dear to me because it was chosen by my roommate who I'm very close too. 

There were a lot of really good options though. Wanye, River, Ajax, Connor/Con, Tyler...
Noun names are awesome. I've spent years calling myself Admiral.

And, yeah, adventures. My life is pretty much a bit of an adventure, with exciting stuff happening all the time. Outdoors, lots of action, doing something different every day, getting stuff done. That's my kind of life and I'll do my damn best to keep it that way.
awesome!! sam makes for a great nb name. have fun with it!! Ob"	rgafth	NonBinary	1061	1.0	2021-12-14 15:54:04
Made a meme for myself to ease my anxiety about this rn lmao fr tho im proud of myself :]		"You’re doing what everyone should be doing, social change doesn’t happen instantly and by itself, people need to put their actions towards things for a long time for them to integrate and you are doing your part in a big change, I know it’s anxiety inducing believe me, but you’re definitely doing the right thing, good on you
unironically that is braver than i could ever be, hell i struggle to tell anyone who isn't trans my pronouns! ur stronger than any US marine
ahh im proud of u too (⊃｡•́‿•̀｡)⊃
This is me with my nb flag pin and about to also be me when they implement the pronouns on ur name tag thing at my work.
i wrote my pronouns on my name tag today and put beads in the colors of my flags (nonbinary and pansexual) through the necklace cord. i was so uncomfortable and felt like i stood out and someone would tell me that nonbinary doesn't exist. 

it takes guts. thank u for sharing this, this makes me very happy that someone feels the same way i do. i didn't know it would actually take bravery to do something seen as so small to other people. but it does.
at work one man looked directly at my ""they/them"" pronouns button & then looked at me & said ""hello ma'am!"" :|
Thank you for sharing. I am at the phase in my journey where I am telling everyone my preferred pronouns (he/him) and sticking to it! I wear a non-binary pin that shows my pronouns but for whatever reason no on has acknowledged it. 

I am even firmly and with compassion reminding people when they slip up and refer to me as she. 

I will hold this boundary like steel period! 

When I meet knew people I am going to start Introducing myself like this. ""Hello I am Naos I prefer he/him pronouns."" With this I feel it supports in others knowing right of the bat how I want to be treated. It's scary as f*** to do but I am learning that boundaries are like a guide book for how I want to be treated and if I don't speak up know one will know how I want to be treated.
woah i just realized i am too!! go us!!!
Having my pronouns on my work badge was a scary experience for me bc I was scared I would be shamed for it? Which is wild to me but this meme actually describes how I feel on a daily basis
I was scared when I first did that too,  but I've had it about a year now and there has been no single negative comment.  I've gotten a face or two,  but otherwise I've seen decreased misgendering, people who actually correct themselves once they have noticed my pronouns, and more importantly a couple other enbys who have really appreciated feeling their own validation seeing me be so open about it. 
I think safety is always important,  because some areas are more receptive than others,  but I'm really happy I did this for myself and I hope it helps you too!
I am so proud of you and remember - negative responses don't say anything about you, they say something about the person giving it. I always feel weirdly ashamed of using neopronouns so you're 100x braver than I am.
Dude that's actually really brave of you
I IS PROUD OF YOUUU!!!
I live in a fairly conservative area so I (painfully) have she/her on my name tag because I want to normalize pronouns but don’t feel safe having they/them on it 😭
Yeaaaaa!!!
This is me putting my pronouns in my email signature. My contractor client updated my preferred name with no problem, but I’ve been asking (begging) my actual employer to update my preferred name for ages now …
Kiddo is making a name & pronoun badge for their first day of middle school. Ann’s they drew a rainbow flag on it. I think they’re brave AF.
Yeah, i put my pronouns on my zoom background. So far don't have enough engagement to tell if it has made a difference.
I would be so afraid to do this but god I wish I wasn’t. Also I should get a name tag.
You got this! The school I teach at has our annual open house tomorrow and I’m wearing my pronoun pin for the first time. We’re in this together!!
Everyone at work:🧑🏾‍🦯😎
I decided I'd try being brave and ordered myself a nametag with my pronouns on it, and of course day 2 of wearing it my dad comes in to my work to buy some food despite rarely ever coming in. I managed to do a quick swap since I kept my pronoun-less nametag with me for this exact scenario, but my heart was racing
thank you! it's definitely hard but seeing everyone's positive reactions and even just them acknowledging it is helping so much💗
thank you ( ◜‿◝ )♡
that's so cute! i have an infinity sign pin that's pan and nb colors, so it covers my sexuality gender and neurodivergency☺️✨ also you got this!
yea i know what you mean, ive even been told off by trans people over my identity, it's so frustrating that it takes guts to just be yourself. but we're both doing so good, being yourself is hard but it is so worth it, i hope you keep it up :]
i love neopronouns! id go by all pronouns except for she/her, but im too scared to do neopronouns still >.<
same, i had she/they up until yesterday but i finally decided to go all in after i had a coworker actually ask me which i prefer :] but ofc do what feels right to you, im proud of you for taking steps to feel more like you :)
wow, im so proud of them and you, i wish i had that courage in middle school or even high school💗
yea, it was definitely scary doing it the first time :( an easy transition for me tho was putting both my agab pronouns and they/them on there so i could just look more inclusive and then fully switched over lol it was hard but people have been more supportive than i thought they'd be! the most negative reaction i got so far was just indifference or ignoring it :]
ah thats so nice i wish my teachers, lgbt or cishet, would've worn them! i hope it goes good :]
you know it, only had two people acknowledge it so far
ahh i think id freak out😭 but good on you for doing more to be yourself :]
Where did you get that? I need one!
But when they do it means more than when they don't
[this is the one i got](https://www.etsy.com/listing/765218806/infinitely-non-binary-pin-subtle-enby) but they have many styles and variations on Etsy! :] definitely my favorite pin and it's very small so it works perfect for badges and lanyards :]

I am not a boy. I am not a girl. I am a dinosaur. *gets shot*
Lol I need a pocket sized version of this. I would totally use it too.
Classic Pavlov! I need thisss
i love this 😭😭
My friend got me an enby flag bracelet and anytime they accidentally misgendered me i used to just fling it at them lmao
Oh fuck, that’s such a good idea!!!
I have one too!! Mines a spray bottle tho lmao. There’s nothing like getting yelled at after squirting them for misgendering you 😅
I can't believe I've never thought about this!😂😂 Amazing idea!
Unexpectedly wholesome and i love it
This is the best thing I’ve ever seen. Istg this thing would give me serotonin for days
Lol amazing
This is Amazing! I want to go make my own now...😆
That’s a good friend right there. This is so sweet!
Wake up babe new social transition method dropped
I sometimes wish it was socially acceptable to correct people with a simple water squirt gun. Like getting your cat off the counter... although I don't do that to my cat because I would feel bad. I would totally do a gentle water hit to a person when they wrong
That made me smile!!! 💕😃
Oh, I wish these were allowed at school. My kiddo tried wearing a pronoun pin but has since just given up on most people using they/them.
Honestly, I thought about getting a squirter gun so I could train my friends like cats
To go with your literal ammunition here's some literary ammunition:

""...And whoso findeth him with none switch blame / They wol come and offre a Goddés name...""  
(""...And whoever finds himself *(singular pronoun)* without such blame / They *(still a singular because we're talking about the same person)* will come and offer in God's name..."")  
\- The Pardener's Prologue, The Canterbury Tales, Geoffry Chaucer, 1387

Essentially a load of nonsense on it's own, but useful to quote at people who claim singular they is grammatically incorrect or too new to be ""proper"" English.
YES
I'm very lucky!
Haha I tried. I stared getting bigoted insults immediately. Yikes.
I am 'saur, hear me roar!
That's the one where after getting a Nobel prize from the King of Sweden for your experiments on psychology in dogs you turn up the next year without any experiment and still get a prize, right?
NO!

There's a post from someone about two hours after you put this up saying they do have a spray bottle. I had the exact same mental image of treating people like cats.
I’m sorry :(
Me when I posted my bag to r/EDC and broke no rules and got mass downvoted because (theoretically) I had pride pins on my bag. Thats the only reason I could think of for the downvotes. I did nothing wrong. Someone actually hate DM’d me talkin bout “asexuality isnt real”.
ouch

Came out on my socials and my close friends two years ago. Not once have anyone that matters to me (or anyone really) used my pronouns (they/them) when referring to me and I feel tired and bad reminding them in the nicest way possible I just feel like giving up. Do I need to look more non-binary :(		"You don't need to ""look more nonbinary."" Nonbinary does not have a one size fits all look, it can look different for everybody. The problem is your friends who aren't respecting you. I'm sorry they don't treat you how you deserve to be treated. Maybe seriously sit them down to have a talk about it? Call them out on their behavior cus this should not slide.
It's them, not you. My partner was out for 10 years and nobody used their pronouns correctly. Today it's finally starting to sink in. People around us might take a long time. Keep at it. You deserve to be seen. You deserve to be you.

It takes some of us a long time to come out, to figure out our looks and pronouns and comfort zone. Those around us are going through their own transitions with our identities too. It takes time. (I do wish they'd hurry up, though!)

Until then... Are there any places you can go to feel seen? Even places or support groups (like this one) that only exist online? Fill your cup in those places and add supportive folks wherever you can. It'll get better.
This OP is looking fresh. They are androgynous and real. I hope they find more support from their friends and family.
Unfortunately you already look as non-binary as is possible, as there is no particular ""look"" that we all have! 

I understand your feeling of frustration though. You can correct people close to you, but as far as strangers goes, I still have the same problem, and I guess there's not much we can do except ignore it....
Sorry to hear. You're looking so androgynous. The problem is not you, it's the people around you.
No, hun, your friends need to look more respectful.

You look lovely.

Also, after you tell people your pronouns they should use them correctly, this does not depend on what you look like.
2 years is a long time. If they were trying to use your pronouns but still struggling, that would be one thing. However if they haven’t tried at all despite reminders from you, it’s time to either have a final confrontation or simply look for new friends. They clearly don’t respect your wishes. I’m so sorry, you deserve better.
This exact same thing happened to me!! There's like one or two friends who REALLY use my pronouns and I also feel like giving up on it. I play in a band and I talk to my band mates about this cause I wanted to be introduced as ""them"" and not ""her"" and yet in front of at least 60 people they introduced me as ""her"" and I had to pretend I didn't wanted to cry on stage (I left that band obviously)
Nonbinary is not an aesthetic. You don't owe anyone androgyny. I'm very sorry that people you care about can't bother to make you feel comfortable around them, and I hope you find a better social group soon!
It's them that are at fault not you
Need new friends
You don't have to make anyone happy but you. In fact, find something to wear that makes you happy. If its that shirt, great! It is a dress, great! But focus on your own happiness.
Nah mate, just stay the course and keep it up. If you want to change how you look because you want to, I’m all for it! If you’re changing your look to make it more “comfortable” or “convenient “ to people, I see that as compromise. Never compromise on yourself. You are valid and hope you have a great day! Love ya!
You don’t need to change your look, being non-binary is about being your truest self. They need to change their attitudes on the matter, yes I understand that it’s hard for some people to change to those pronouns but it seems that they are not even trying. If they don’t give you the light of day and don’t respect you for being yourself then don’t let them drag you down, if they are left in the dust that is their choice.
I understand what you’re going through, and it’s not your fault. It’s not even about you, it has to do with how rigidly people interpret sex and gender. I’ve struggled with feeling like I’m going to be seen as an attention seeker if I allow myself to present in any way feminine (I was AFAB), or if I show that my hobbies or way of speaking are too feminine. I pushed myself to present as masculine as possible and every stranger and acquaintance still used feminine terms to refer to me, because I’m an adult with a smooth face and high voice and I’m pretty small. It made me realize that the problem is other people and how strongly perceivable sex characteristics are conflated with gender even after you tell someone “hey, mine don’t match up.” I’ve let myself grow out my hair and present more androgynously since, because forcing myself into an ultra masculine box that didn’t fit me didn’t make a difference. For me personally, medical transition is going to be the next step, since I have some body dysphoria, and the social dysphoria of being constantly gendered as feminine by every new person is really affecting me. That doesn’t mean that everyone should make this decision or that anyone needs to go on hormones or get surgery to be valid, it’s just how I’m addressing my own experience. Ultimately it’s your choice whether or not you change how you present and it doesn’t make you any more or less “real” as a nonbinary person  - it’s all about what makes you feel the most happy and comfortable. If changing your style or your body is not worth it to you, then don’t. If it is, then do. You are exactly who you are either way
You are non binary fuck how you look. Sucks that people don't use your pronouns you are fucking valid💜
You don’t owe them anything. You don’t need to dress or look a certain way. If they care about you they’ll use the right pronouns and respect your identity. 
I
it's not about how you look, friend. it's about how much the people around you care about your comfort and respect who you are
there’s no right or wrong “look” to be nonbinary. nonbinary ≠ androgyny. i know it can be difficult, i’m genderfluid and nonbinary and have been using leo and he/him pronouns for a few days but a lot of people forget. just keep reminding them, after awhile if they don’t get it they could either have a bad memory or could possibly be doing it on purpose, but you never really know unless u ask. i wish you the best of luck.
You are nonbinary, therefore you look nonbinary 💕
Ur pretty and also hella valid pal.
Omg guys are they absolutely killing it or what??? I love their style!
You don't need to change anything about yourself. 
I understand how this feels though..
You don't need to look ""more nonbinary"" because you ARE nonbinary and however you look or act or are is nonbinary enough. I'm sorry that this is happening and advise you to take the insistence on talking to the imaginary person they wish was there instead of you as a sign that they don't respect you.
non-binary doesn’t look like anything, i’m sorry your friends suck but you should get some new ones
I think you need to get new friends. Seriously, I've been there, and I'm still fucking bitter even though they are the ones who stopped talking to me cause I was too dramatic or something. It's still better than hating myself.
You don’t need to look any way other than yourself. Sounds like you need new friends instead. I’m sorry they’re assholes
There isn't really a non-binary ""look."" You need to communicate with your friends. ""When you don't use the correct pronouns for me, I feel \_\_\_\_. Please use my correct pronouns."" Treating you with respect is the cost of entry for interacting with you, not using your pronouns is disrespectful.
If it's worth it to you because it bothers you,  keep it up.  Me,  I acknowledge it's a general issue with languages globally and don't get offended. Their lack of respect doesn't change who I am or how I feel.  I know I'm enby, I don't need to rage over it, it's too much energy wasted. 

You look fine. You got this!
I feel your pain. I came out to everyone on social media a month ago and no one has attempted to call me by my name or correct pronouns and I know they never will respect me enough to try.
If they don't respect your pronouns that's their own problem. I know it's heart breaking when the people you care about don't respect you, but it's their choice whether or not they respect you and your beliefs. Also, there's no ""looking nonbinary"". As long as you feel more like yourself then you're doing all you can; some people just have to learn to get over themselves and respect others. I hope you have a better time in the future 💚
Friend you are wonderful just the way you are!! Being yourself in spite of the world is one of the bravest things you can do!
Hey friend. I’m sorry the people close to you have treated you badly. You do NOT need to look any different. Being non binary is about how you feel and you can look whatever way you want. Sending hugs.
You don't have to look more non binary. That really sucks that they won't respect your pronouns. My advice is make boundaries and make new friends who will respect your pronouns
Non binary doesn’t have one specific look and although many people who look “androgynous” may be nonbinary that androgyny doesn’t equal nonbinary. You are valid. If the people around u can’t respect your pronouns, then that’s on them. Call them out on it. They shouldn’t be misgendering you. It’s not hard at all to respect ppl’s pronouns and gender identities
I'm sorry you aren't being gendered correctly by your loved ones. I'd use they/them pronouns for you! You look very androgynous to me tbh. But besides that, I just naturally default to they/them and don't wanna accidentally misgender someone. It sucks when family and friends can't put in the effort. Sometimes it's just hard to understand and get in the habit, other times they just don't see why it's such a big deal. Sometimes people just don't care and only care about what makes them comfortable. It's really hard to deal with regardless. You deserve to feel comfortable.
Keep pushing your friends and reminding them, you don't need to talk about it all the time or change yourself, just when they use the wrong pronouns, say something. 

I also suggest you please talk to more nonbinary and transgender people, making friends like that at clubs and stuff when I was first coming to terms with my identity was seriously a game changer and made me feel much more understanding and kind towards myself. It is amazing to have people like that in your life who do actually get it.
Nonbinary is what you make it friend! You seem like such a cool person!
You dont need to do anything, the people around you need to change their point of view and actually make an effort. Sometimes you have to stop playing the nice person and tell them flat out how it is. I know it’s hard but you got this.
You look so beautiful! I wish your friends could respect your pronouns, at least you have us to support you, it's sad having friends that do that..
I have the same problem, except only my close friends and family know and a couple of professional people. I get miss gendered and I wish I looked more androgynous
I made a few different coming out posts on social media, changed my pronouns on social media, plus told everybody I was friends with and if anyone still didn’t acknowledge or respect my pronouns after all that, I just started cutting people off. If they were told so many times and given a couple chances and still don’t get it, then they’re just refusing to get it and not worth my energy
Yeah, annoying for me too. I've came out to my friends, and I've got a jacket with a patch that has my pronouns on and even when I wear that my friends make no effort to use the correct pronouns and continuously get it wrong, yet one friend manages to get all her other friends pronouns correct just fine but not mine. Only person who does is my bf.

There is no non-binary look, it's just straight up disrespect.
It shouldn't matter how you look; whether high femme or ultra masc, you deserve the respect of ppl using your pronouns and being seen as who you are. I'm so sorry they haven't realized their failings, bc it's def not your fault
I feel this. I gave up on changing my pronouns because no one cared enough to call me by they/them.
You look perfect the way you are!
You don't need to change anything you don't want to. A lot of my family members don't use my pro-nouns. Try and find queer spaces (in person is the best, but online is also good) so you can keep sane
No. and if they’re not making an effort to get it right they just don’t care sadly.
im so sorry that those around you don’t use your pronouns but i want to say that you are non-binary enough just as you are, you don’t need to change how you look to be valid. I hope things get better soon
Are you me? This was almost my exact experience.
Dear, you have to understand that your friends are shit. 

You are not obligated to look more non-binary (what even is that). If you want to change your appearance or anything about yourself do it because YOU want to. 

I would suggest that you have a talk to them about your feeling regarding this matter. If they don't respond positively... well, you should try to distance yourself from them. I know that it's hard to let go of friends, especially if you have a deep bond with them. But, hanging with toxic people will poison your mind!

I believe you already look quite stunning! Love that piercing btw!
1. You look lovely.
2. You look non-binary as heck, and even if not still no reason to misgender you.
3. Sit them down and have a clear talk about it. If they do not want it to be a thing that is always a topic to talk about rhe easiest way would be to respect your pronouns so it is not an ""every conversation"" topic.

They should just be ok with you and sould also try to do the right thing which is adress ypu as you prefre.
Anyone who actually cares about you should want to respect you. Even if they trip over their words sometimes, even if they make mistakes, they will make sure they’re respecting you by respecting your pronouns. (And for people who don’t really know you, if they’re decent humans they’ll do the same once they know what pronouns you use.) There are definitely people who will feel confused or not sure how to adjust exactly, but they won’t let their own feelings stand in the way of showing you respect. Not if they care about you. The only reason to change your external appearance is if you want/need to make a change to feel more like yourself. Celebrating you right now for exactly who you are!
I'd stop being nice tbh. I look exactly like you'd expect someone with my agab to look, but everyone who knows my gender uses the correct pronouns. When they slip up, which is rare, they apologise unprompted. If they care, they'll try.
Don’t change yourself to please disrespectful people.
Might be late, but you look wonderful. And what I would do about your ""friends"" is misgender them, use different pronouns for them and make them see how it feels. Maybe even use more feminine/masculine variations of their names. And if they only see how you're hurting them, and not how they're hurting you, then it's time to make new, accepting friends.

There is no ""looking non-binary"" just being non-binary. 
There are so many different non-binary people who all look differently, you could be as femme or masc as you like, if your gender is not female or male, it doesn't matter. Like a man putting on a skirt doesn't automatically make him a women (but a man in skirt) and a trans woman pre transition is not less of a women.

You do not owe anyone androgynous.

You can be androgynous if that's how you like and express yourself but it is not necessary to validate your gender.
You need to look exactly how you want to look, I have the same problem, sometimes they even tell me to pick a side basically. People can be very ignorant, never feel bad for wanting to be accepted and treated fairly. Just, try not to become a total bitch in the process😅 like muah lol 😬 have a wonderful day/night 🥰🥰
Hey sorry, just don’t know what non binary means. Does it mean some is a homosexual?
No, they just need to try harder. And maybe you need to remind them more.
I think you should stick to being you.  For best results dress to what makes you happy when you can. There are maybe situations when you can’t dress to your hearts content but hopefully that’s not too common for you. Unfortunately it seems like people refusing to use chosen pronouns is the number one micro aggression towards trans, enby, and gender non conforming folk. As other posters have suggested find a group of friends who is more respectful of your choose pronouns.  You need a safe space where you don’t have to question how you dress or act.
Also I think you should call them out every time they do it. Tell them your correct pronouns.  You should be just as rude to them as they are to you.  Each time they do it tell them ‘are you really that dumb that you can’t remember my pronouns and I have to keep reminding you?’ Wait don’t say that unless it’s absolutely called for but do correct them every time.  Do not be shy about doing it because they are the ones who are rude and you are just responding to their aggression so you have to match their aggression. Correct them a few times then if they continue call them out. Call them out for hate criming you, being  a transphobe and living in the stone ages.
I’m scared of being labelled as those people where the only thing I talk about is being non-binary and make it my whole personality, I don’t know it’s not my intention but I just want to feel like myself among others
Thank you for the nice comment, I guess this really is the only place I can feel accepted. I’ll try looking for more online communities
Thank you for this :’) <3
I feel like being in a country where it is illegal to be part of the LGBTQ community definitely is not helping. I just want to feel accepted as myself, even if it’s only around my close friends really
I try to be more forgiving because I come from a South East Asian country. Maybe they’re just not used to it. I think my friends are good people. It’s just hard when it comes to this I guess
I’m sorry you went through that, I hope you’re in a better band now!
My “friends” did this too. I came out to them a few months ago and asked them to refer to me by a new name and pronouns. They said it was confusing and they didn’t even try AT ALL. Things were awkward later and they don’t talk to me as much anymore. I gave up on changing my name
Geezzeeeee that is soooo hard!!

I wonder sometimes if I do feel like losing my shit, if they would get it right. 

Maybe embarrassing them infront of all those people being like: yo — my pronouns are THEM get it fucking right. It’s been xx number of years assholes.

Ugh. It feels like a lost cause. Why does everything feel like such a fight?
Yeah I know this, but I do like being androgynous though! I don’t really show it in how I dress because I can’t afford clothes that I like at the moment but yeah I just thought maybe it would help. Thank you for the affirmation <3
Thank you for the comment, I feel you deeply and I hope your transition goes well! Keep us posted about it. <3
I wish I had your attitude, I couldn’t help but feel icky and a little sad when people I care about refer to me as a guy all the time. Maybe it’s too much to ask I don’t know
I am sorry to hear that, I hope they were supportive when you came out. I at least had that pleasure, but they must’ve forgotten the very next day haha
You are so kind <3
You are too kind, thank you <3
How’s it going for you?
I’m scared of the mentality where “if they care, they would” or anything along those lines because really all my life if it’s not me no one else would.

I’ve given up on that ideology long ago I think
Need to apply this to my other aspects in life as well
Haha it’s actually 6PM here. Thank you for your nice comment. It made me laugh because it reminded me of my ex.

She had a pet snake and I called him an “it” because I simply had forgotten the snake’s gender. She was so quick to correct me but never once used my correct pronouns
Appreciate the input, Aaron
Nonbinary means not identifying as male or female. It's a gender identity. Has nothing to do with sexual orientation :)
people only label us like that because they don't want us to talk about it at all. because ironically cis people talk about gender wayyyy more than we do. every time they misgender you, they're putting binary genders in your face in an actually disrespectful way.
The only ones making you bring up being non binary is them for misgendering you
Cis people make being cis their entire personality; Pushing their gender roles on us all at every turn. Talking about “men’s clothes” and “women’s jobs” — which isn’t inherently negative, but they live their lives under the assumption that we’re all alike and have to live by their rules.
Seems like the thing making it a topic of conversation and top of mind is them not respecting your preferences and using your preferred pronouns, and that if your needs were met in that way it wouldn't be something you feel you have to continually talk about with them.
*they* are the ones making you bring it up in the first place. and if anyone tries to say that if/when you do confront them, that’s a pretty clear sign that they don’t give a fuck about your feelings, and might be people you wanna add to you “distance myself from or cut them off entirely” list
Well, you don’t have to cut them off completely, but I’d still recommend looking for other friends who will respect your pronouns, even if it’s just online. 

And I understand that it’s hard, but 2 years is a long, long time to learn, adapt, and educate yourself. You’re clearly putting in a lot of effort to help them understand, and to be patient with them, but are they giving the same effort back?
You can be patient for them to learn past cultural norms, but 2 years is a long time!! For reference… my best friend is from India. She didn’t know a lot of out queer/trans people when we met, but after a few months of friendship and her putting effort into it, she is a pronoun pro and uses they/them perfectly! I also mispronounced her name when we first met, and she patiently taught me how to say it correctly. Soon I could pronounce her name like it should be in her native language, not a lazy Americanized version.

Both of these are signs of respect for the other person, a matter of putting in the effort for someone you like. You would try to pronounce your international friend’s name correctly, right? It’s the same. It’s your identity. Your friends don’t get a pass for being from xyz country - if they’re hurting you, speak up once more and explain why it matters. If they continue to do it, they frankly sound exhausting to be around. Good luck, you’re doing great my friend!
They're not your friends then.  Friend is someone who understands you completely :(
Cause in a certain way it is a fight and it is even beyond getting people gendering us correctly. It's a fight for our rights, for recognition, for being equal and I deeply think we have to get more radical about it as it grows on us. This month in my country I've know about at least 3 hate crimes that occurred to trans people and as far as know two of them died. It's not easy and we have the destination of the future generations in our hands. I feel it's on us to get them to understand and respect our needs for however hard it might be. To get politicians talk about us, to get them to discuss our rights and become more and more part of the general population and not only just small communities where we feel safe. We are a large part of this world and it's on us not to be seen as a minority anymore.
Cis folks will always find a way to invalidate your identity. If you're gonna present androgynous, do it for yourself, not for the sake of being perceived as nonbinary by others.
For some,  it really is. They're slow or unable to change. An argument usually won't help. I can't control them,  I have enough trouble with controlling me 😂  I just look at it as an way to weed out haters. You learn a lot about relationships when you see where the respect stops. But I study psychology and like people watching. 🙃 

You are valid. Your pronouns are valid.  If they didn't exist,  would that change? 

Logic and philosophy can be so useful sometimes.
It's all good, I'm trying to get used to my new name myself and trying to be understanding. It just feels... defeating at times when no one I'm close to that has known for years is making an effort. I hope it gets better for you ❤
It's getting better with people close to me. Slowly.
>“if they care, they would”

I mean it really depends on the circumstances, but using someone's pronouns really isn't that hard. They might not understand how important it is and thus not put any effort into it, but then making it clear to them and not being quite so super extra nice might help. Sit them down and tell them.


>because really all my life if it’s not me no one else would.

I used to feel the same way. Parents didn't care, friends didn't care. It felt like that's the best I could get so I tried not to rock the boat. In my late 20s though, I cut nearly everyone out of my life after I did some therapy and realised they're just stomping my boundaries left and right. Made some new friends and rekindled an old one since and they're _worlds_ apart. They're supportive and check in on me and make me feel loved. My current partner is the kindest and most caring I ever had. He was worried in the beginning that he'd struggle with my pronouns, but he excelled at using gender neutral language for me even when I'm too lazy to do it.

It started by having uncomfortable boundaries. I thought I'd attract nice people by being nice, but I attracted selfish people by having no defenses.
Not saying you gotta cut out all your friends, but it doesn't have to stay the way it is now.
Sooooooo ? Lol
I think society in general does not understand the impact that using the wrong has on NB people and as mentioned in previous comments it may seem it is just a preference and ""what's the big deal"" or you were born as a male/female anyway and always called you by he/she. Ideally if one is close to you, they should pick up the suffering but that may not be obvious if you are not assertive about it. It may also take time to change pronouns and the name of someone you have known for years or decades, so if there is no clear boundary on how people address you, change won't happen by itself. It may not be Ill meaning and people close to you that respect you should change the way they address you when they understand what it means to you.
In the most gentle, respectful way, I would suggest that these are not our 'preferred' pronouns. They \*are\* our pronouns, and using words like ""preferred"" let's cis people think we are being annoyingly 'different' because we want to. 

I prefer not giving them that inch. My pronouns are ""they/them."" Full stop. They aren't a preference because being trans isn't a preference. My choices are ""be trans and figure it out"" or ""die from the agony of being chronically misunderstood.""
Do you have any book recommendations? I’d love to get into philosophy, if you have any favourites
Not sure what you're implying
That's a really good way to think about it.  Recently I was having similar thoughts about the phrase ""identifies as...."".  It just struck me that the phrase is only used when talking about LGBTQ+ topics and never outside of that.  Cis people aren't referred to as ""identifying as"", they just \*are\* so why do I need to ""identify as""?  Shouldn't I just \*be\* as well?
Thank you, defaulted into how I've most commonly seen this presented but understand the issue here with it seeming like an option with this language (which is the very issue with OP's situation here).
Almost anyone that's Greek. Socrates, is good at logic and forced ""why"" thinking.  There are quite a lot of philosophy and poetry in the Harvard 5 Foot Shelf of books.  I find I'm drawn to such things,  as well as spiritual philosophy.  Sufi mystics. Hafiz I think was an enby, he speaks of being something beyond man/woman and how irrelevant gender is.
Lol never mind, enjoy ur non binary thing 😂
Lol not being rude, it’s just funny sorry
Really not sure where your going with this. Being nonbinary is nothing we do for fun. It's a gender identity just like being a man or a woman.
How is it funny tho?
It’s not sorry lol have a good day sir/ madam"	wty9j9	NonBinary	997	1.0	2022-08-21 12:18:40
So the dude my “friend” who like made fun of not understanding they/them pronouns and like being like “I’d only respect attack helicopters” I haven’t spoken to him in 2 days. I’m doing well, am I doing well I feel bad he keeps messaging me, he told me he’s going through a hard time, I’m struggling		"My best friend started thinking it was funny using racial slurs. He knows I have black family, I told him repeatedly not to say that stuff and he kept going. I kept hanging out with him because we'd been friends for most of our lives. I thought he was a good guy. He was a depressed alcoholic. I thought I could help him and tried for years.
 Now it's been years since I dumped him as a friend and I wish I'd done it sooner. He dragged my mental health down.

If someone can't respect other people for who they are, especially their friends, then they're just a straight up shitty person. Walk away from them and don't look back. Be glad you didn't waste too much time on him.
Yeah, him going through a hard time doesn't give him an excuse to put you through a hard time. Thats not what good friends do. If he wants to talk hes welcome to acknowledge how he took his pain out on you and offer you assurance that it wont happen again.
Nah, you don't owe anyone help that has behaved like thid towards you. I understand you feel guilty but he can't treat you like that and then expect to keep you as a friend.
Don’t talk to him until he apologizes and promises to respect you and your pronouns.
My coworker who I align with politically did this to me. I had been sort of hinting at gender identity issues to test the waters I guess. To a few things he said ""that's stupid"" or ""if you ever changed your name it would be  too late, i know you as ____ and I would never call you something else"" so I filed that under something I'll never talk about at work ever again.

Then a month or so later he goes on a tirade against Republicans denying the identities of trans people and lacking basic respect by ignoring pronouns and chosen names ect ect, then he goes ""can you imagine what that's like?"" And I'm like ""......yes?""

Anyway, the moral here is that he didnt realize he was being transphobic until I pointed it out. He felt bad about it, tried to pull it off as a joke, neither us were buying it. It's sometimes best to communicate that it makes you uncomfortable, dont argue, and then let the chips fall accordingly. They are either going to change or not, and either way you are valid in your feelings.
I don’t know what to do be keeps telling me he’s having a hard time and like what he did and said is fucking sickening as someone who is non-binary he also told me “that’s their problem though ain’t it, they need to get over themselves they world isn’t here to make everyone happy” I feel sick ignoring him but I need fo
I had a friend who would say problematic stuff like this & I would let it go & then one day he sent me a TON of racist & antisemitic memes. He's alt-right now. If they're willing to do the work people can change but if they're not willing to confront the harm they're doing it will only get worse not better.
thank you all for literally helping me, I was terrified to post this I don’t know why I was worried people would side with him, since that’s usually how the world plays out. These comments have honestly helped me so much and yes I’ve teared up because of how incredible you all are
i cant think of a logical correlation between going through rough times and being disrespectful to ones identity, so you did the right thing. it sucks to lose friends to this, but it’s even worse to keep em’ around.
Oh hell no. Don’t let him guilt you back in with that bs
He doesn't deserve to be your friend, it sounds like, so he can fuck right off. Find better friends.
It's one thing to be transphobic, it's entirely unforgivable to parrot a meme that was old in 2012.
His going through a hard time is not any excuse for being deliberately hurtful. Emotions are valid, but they give no one the right to behave badly. If he genuinely apologizes without any excuses, maybe then you can have a real talk about what hurt you, and maybe then AS A FRIEND you can see how you can support him through whatever hard times he's having. But only if it's something you're willing to do.

I truly hope things resolve, but remember you need to take care of you first. You're responsible only for you. 

Stay amazing.
If you're really worried you could either explain to him that you expect an apology and explain that they really hurt you or (better yet) have a mutual friend suggest they apologise to you for hurting you. Just make sure this friend doesn't mention you want an apology.

As for ignoring him, without an apology I think he should just count himself lucky he's not blocked. You don't owe him respect if he won't respect you!
I grew up in a small town, my family is very transphobic / racist / etc. I myself also didn’t fall very far from the tree in that regard.

My partner of about 8 years at the time came out to me and said she wanted to transition mtf. I’m not going to pretend it was easy I guess, but I took the time to understand her and support her. So did her mother. And her sister and brother. And even my own mother (and I was certain she’d never come around)!

Eventually, my then-partner’s courage and strength opened the door that led me to discover I was non-binary.

But her best friend was never on board. He accused me of brainwashing her and all of this other crap. Went out of his way to dead name her and use he/him pronouns, no matter how much she asked him to stop. He would even use her preferred name by accident and then “correct” himself. We could have an entire room full of people referring to her correctly, but he would still be the odd man out. He wouldn’t change. She had several heart-to-hearts with him and it went no where.

She always insisted he was very smart (he is) and that he’d come around. It took her years of mental torment to finally see that it wasn’t a matter of intelligence, the dude was just a full blown douche that couldn’t be bothered to treat her with basic respect. The reason she was even his best friend was cause he had no other friends. No one else would really tolerate him.

All I can say is, if they care, they will change and adapt to you quickly enough. There may be slip ups and there may be people who are a bit socially inept that maybe struggle more. But your real friends will be making adequate progress, and if not, don’t waste your time.
you don’t owe him anything. and at some point, i’d encourage you to voice exactly why what he’s said was inappropriate if you feel at all comfortable. he needs to reflect on and reform his actions 

plus the “attack helicopter” joke is just peak cringe at this point, as much as i hate the c word
I (ok I am enby myself but) have been dealing with depression and stuff for a long @ss time but doesn't give you the right to be a dick to someone about something as simple as a bunch of pronouns. He can either start to treat you like a friend or just bugger off until he starts to behave himself better.
Going through a hard time isn't an excuse for discrimination.  There are plenty of things you do when you're ""going through a hard time"" that can be less than stellar but forgivable; saying shitty phobic shit isn't it.  Nothing about being a douche to LGBT+ people helps a person *go through a hard time*.
Adversity is never an excuse, I learned that from my abusers. Their justifications were bad home lives, but my sympathy ended when they went out of their way to hurt me.

That's a more extreme example, but that's what taught me that abuse can't be justified by going through hard times. In fact, I went on to meet people who faced similar situations and never laid a hand on me, nor threatened me.

Like everyone is saying, don't talk to him until he apologizes sincerely, no excuses attached. Joke or not, he mocked you and basically said that he doesn't respect you, so what do you owe him?
The problem here is, he has a double standard. He's going through a hard time and expects you to care and support him. But he won't do the same for you when it comes to using correct pronouns. If this causes you to stress and he doesn't care, then he's being a huge hypocrite. Maybe if he wanted people to support him he should consider supporting his friends back. He's not being a good friend.
My family looks like the most accepting and all, and i've been coming out twice to them as pan and nb, but in my language pronouns are a bit different so i hadnt decided yet. When i did decide to use a sort equialent of they/them, my uncle (with whom I cut off contact due to other reasons but still in the family group chat) called me an it. After i made it very clear that i was a human and wanted to be adressed that way i got a lecture why it was more suitable than they/them. After that my other family members said he ment well.

Now i cut off more contacts with family. You do not owe this person anything. He completely disregarded you and noone should have to endure that
First rule is give respect and you get respect 
But if you don’t receive respect move on and 
Don’t let their drama into your life
Nope. Byeee
[deleted]
If someone treats you less than you are, you don't have to stay. If it's better for you, leave.
He’s tryna guilt you into talking to him. Don’t fall for it.
[deleted]
Any one who does not respect your boundaries is not someone you want in your life. They don't care about you, they don't respect you and they only want to use you.

You are so much better without this person. You deserve light, love, happiness, healing and peace.
Normally when people have a hard time they won't start disrespecting minorities for fun...
Block him you’re better off I promise
You’ve done nothing wrong. It’s okay to set boundaries and stick to them.
You don't need that abuse. Sounds like he's also guilt tripping you. Another abusive behaviour. You are better off without a ""friend"" like that.
You deserve a less boring friend. Same old jokes, punching down at people who are struggling. If he's going through a hard time, you'd think he'd have some empathy for other people and not give them a hard time too.

Maybe that's a cynical way to think about it but I just feel you deserve better
Saying you don't understand they/them pronouns is stupid because I use them most of the time to refer to people I don't know the gender of and no one is ever confused.

Also the attack helicopter joke is so old at this point, like if you're going to be a bigot at least be original.
He may have the ability to change, but that doesn't mean it's your responsibility. You aren't responsible for the mental health or views of anyone other than yourself. If he's dragging you down, move on. Show him kindness, but I would distance yourself from him if it's making you dysphoric.
I’m late to this, but honestly I would just tell the truth. Tell him your gender and pronouns, and explain that if he doesn’t respect them, then he’s hurting you and not willing to support you. If he’s really going through a hard time (and not just a straight-up bigot) then he’ll respect it and try to retain the friendship.

Edit: re-reading this, it’s possible that you’ve already told him, in which case I would just explain that you sympathise, but you can’t try to help someone who doesn’t respect just the basic parts of your identity. Hope this gets easier for you soon, no matter what you do!
Proud of you for cutting him off. The emotional withdraw is bad but not as bad as abuse and degradation. Keep strong.
You're in the right, I'd say a genuine apology and desire to do better should be required if he wants to still be your friend!

Though in my personal opinion, anyone who uses an attack helicopter joke isn't worth the effort. Using that line at this point is just embarrassing, honestly. Like we get it dude, you identify as an uncreative jackass who stopped maturing at 12, but do you need to be so LOUD about it? 😉
Him having a hard time does not make it okay for him to be an asshole and invalidate you
If you feel you must respond, you could say something to the effect of, ""I acknowledge and respect that you're going through a hard time, but that does not excuse you being disrespectful to me. I don't deserve to be treated that way and I won't tolerate it.""
I’m really sorry you’re going this with him. It sounds like a really hard position to be in, but even though he may be going through a hard time which is valid, it doesn’t give him the right to treat you in such a manner. I do hope though that things can be resolved peacefully 💕
Oh hell no.  I don't give two shits if he's going through a hard time.  WE'RE LIVING THROUGH FUCKING GENOCIDE.  He can act right or fuck off.
Nah ignore him they're a big person they can handle their own problems
Just stop. You don’t need the stress.
if he needed you for a hard time he should've never been giving you a hard time
He wants you to think he’s a good guy without actually being a good guy
Fuck him, walk away and do yoy
I understand that you feel bad for them, but its not your responsibility to do their emotional labour for them.

As to whether or not you’ve handled it well, I think the main thing is whether or not your happy.  If you’re happier then that means you’re doing something right.  Don’t feel bad about that.
ignore them
Aww come onnnn, really? 😣 Attack helicopter jokes? That's well cringe. I'm not even NB (joined the sub for a loved one) and even I'm offended by that. Yeeteth him. You are not responsible for his happiness. If he's being a dick and causing you harm, do not engage.
Karma hurts like a bitch.
I sorry you have to go through this :( 
i wonder if you should respond with something like sorry you're having a hard time but i dont really want to talk to you until you respect me as a person, etc. Like if he doesnt take your pain seriously its possinle it doesnt even occur to him that you not talking to him is linked to that.
him going through a hard time doesn’t mean he gets to treat you like trash. you set a boundary and now he’s trying to guilt you into supporting him. he’s made his bed, now let him lie in it
Any friend that mocks you for your gender is no friend at all. Leave that person. Block them. Tell them to fuck off, I said so. People who don't respect pronouns are shit. Remember your worth and don't let fake fucks get you down.
My 2 cents but if he doesn't support you he doesn't deserve your support. Friendship is a two way street
I’m so late to this but I agree with everyone here.

If he can’t respect you and you have made attempts to correct him and he hasn’t (or isn’t willing to), then it’s time to block him and move on.
Thank you so much for this, this has really helped. I’m also glad you dumped him off because that shit is unacceptable.
Yeah! Often dumping people who won't be respectful is what those same people need to start to get better on their own journeys. You are doing what is best for you and for them. They can choose to take your rejection of them as a learning experience.
Been through similar stuff but with like 70% of my friends. I am so much happier after this last month after just dropping all of them
Thank you so much, yeah he hasn’t even messaged to check on me after he was literally horrible, he didn’t even be like I’m sorry for everything I said and that I understand it hurt you. Thank you a lot
Thank you so much I appreciate that a lot ❤️
Thank you so much, I defo won’t until he does. I appreciate this so much
Thank you so much for this this has really helped like majorly I appreciate it a lot
Ita true, the world isn't here to make everyone happy. But he isn't the world, and is actively hurting you. That's different from not validating you. He's being an ass, and unless he's actively being in mortal danger, I don't care how much of a hard time hes going through.

The world sucks sometimes. Humans get to choose. He chose poorly.
Well, follow his philosophy for him. His hard time is his problem the world and you don't owe him anything. If he can dish it our then he can take it
I always tend to empathise with people who are going through a hard time and try to help them because I know how it feels like and I don't want anybody to feel that way. If you are the same kind of person, I understand why you feel bad ignoring him but there's a little basic problem of respect here to solve first. Friendship has to be reciprocal, friends help each other, he's not doing his part; he's hurting you and doesn't even want to acknowledge that it's his fault. If his philosophy is ""that's their problem, the world isn't here to make everyone happy"", well then you are not there to make him happy either. If he'll try to understand you, you can try to help him, but if he doesn't he's not your friend.
Omg and yeah very true, thank you!
youre hella valid, friend. have a hug🫂
Idk if anyone else has said it, but block his ass. If his constant barrage of attempts to contact you are stressing you out, block him. You don't owe anyone an apology or explanation.
Thank you for sharing this
It sounds so good hearing someone say I’ve done the right thing, thank you. Like thank you so much, I appreciate it. Also I may have happy cried because of that and that’s the first time I have in maybe a year so thank you
I defo won’t! Thank you so much, I appreciate it
Thank you so much and very true
Agreed 100% thank you
Thank you so much, this made me tear up. You stay amazing too, you’re such a kind hearted person and everyone needs someone like you
Thank you so much and I’ll defo do tthat! Thank you I appreciate it
This really hit home with me.

I first came out as ftm a few years ago in a small town and while my family was openly transphobic (and mildly homophobic), my hiring manager at the job I was working at seemed promising.

She let me change my name to my preferred name (which I spelled wrong but I can’t seem to want to change it — the spelling just seems *right*), but that was it. She didn’t let me wear the male’s uniform, but she promised to use my preferred name and pronouns.

A few friends at that job were also transphobic or at the very least, not understanding why I would feel that way.

(At the time I was ftm feminine presenting at times, I probably confused the hell out of a lot of people.)

Not long before I left the job to get ready to move back to my home state, my hiring manager was giving a bunch of newbies a tour around the store. I was 18 and “head” of a department (not really) so she stopped to introduce me.

She disregarded my preferred name *despite my name tag reading Aidean* and used my dead pronouns and when I corrected her, she looked off-put by it.

I haven’t contacted her since I left the job, can’t even recall her name.

I came out as Non-Binary Male perhaps a year later after that (so around 19) and my family became even *more* transphobic, if that’s even possible.

At the beginning of this year, I informed my parents that I *am* going to be transitioning physically and my mom essentially asked that I wait until I leave the house.

Once I leave, I’m thinking of dropping my family until they start respecting my decisions and gender.

The only good thing is that once I legally and physically transition, at least two of my siblings and perhaps my mom will start to call me by my preferred name and pronouns.

The only thing, because of my first job, I’m terrified of coming out to my new job, despite there being another agender person who has came out before me (I don’t think she’s an enby, when I asked her, she said that she doesn’t do gender and that he answers to any pronoun) who is openly accepted by *everyone*.

Ah- I didn’t mean to tell you my life’s story! Your comment just really hit home.

Edit: why is it that I never see the typos and extra words until *after* I post something 😭🤣
100% agreed thank you. Honestly I hate it so much when he said it I automatically froze up

Agreed
That’s actually really good, thank youuuu
Yeah, I know plenty of people who have anxiety/depression who are extra thoughtful and careful because they know what pain is like.  I know others who are assholes. The assholes haven't changed much(some are family or friends of friends, so I've been able to follow their lack of progress despite generally minimizing contact). The more thoughtful people still mess up sometimes, but often grow and reflect so they can do better instead of using it as an excuse to repeat mistakes ad infinitum. There are resources for people to unlearn shitty coping skills, but they have to want to. I've definitely had to do that myself. I cared but hadn't been exposed or taught the best skills, so I looked into it and trained myself to act in ways that were in line with my goals and moral beliefs. I'm always learning and trying to improve. 

As they say, the best apology is changed behavior.
He's been self centered. Don't look back.
And if he doesn't follow through, dump his ass for good
You’re welcome!
1000% agreed with all of that, thank you so much. To be honest I didn’t know why I was so paranoid posting this I thought people would back him instead of me but i think how the world is just tried convincing me that, thank you so much
>But he isn't the world, and is actively hurting you

This was a BIG turning point in a discussion with a loved one that was having a hard time getting on board with respecting my pronouns. He was coming at things with the ""you just want to feel special and you're asking the world to change for you"" angle, and my response was effectively   


\- I'm not asking the world for anything. I have accepted that the vast majority of people for the rest of my life will misgender me, and aren't worth the energy especially with strangers I won't interact with for more than a few minutes out of my entire existence to try and get someone to understand or change their mind.   
\- I'm not asking to feel SPECIAL, I'm asking to *not suffer unnecessarily*. My entire life until realizing who I really was, I was suffering because of being misgendered. Your average person has a vocabulary of tens of thousands of words. When I tell you that my pronouns are they/them, I am asking *you*, as someone who claims to care about and love me, to shift your understanding of how to apply a handful of words out of literally thousands so that I don't suffer.    


Overnight difference from him after that. It really is as simple as that - however it needs to be expressed, ""I have told you that they/them are the correct pronouns for me. Anything other communicates that you don't care about whether I'm suffering or happy, that you don't respect me, that you have no love for me."" Anyone who can't wrap their heads around that concept values their image of you over the real you.
Very true thank you so much
Yeah I definitely am, and thank you
THIS MADE ME CRY, I really needed a hug so thank you I appreciate it so damn much
Appreciate this so much thank you! I will do
I've been amazingly fortunate, and I don't like anyone hurting. Please take care of yourself.
And you! Valid as fuck 💖
Its okay, and actually maybe not even the worst they did to me honestly. Now i atleast now how deep their hate for me goes
This is a person who thinks it’s ok to treat you like shit, then when you say you are not going to be treated like shit and set a boundary, they apologize/justify their behavior with some ‘poor me I couldn’t help it’ bullshit to try to cross that boundary you drew. Don’t fall for it now or in any other relationship in the future. Good people won’t treat you like that in the first place, even if they’re having a hard time. (I’ve had very shitty periods in my life and did not start treating people like shit because if it…and I suspect you haven’t either when you’re going through a rough time.)
[deleted]
You're welcome
He's gotta learn not to be an arse, innit?
Agreed
Thank you! I won’t
I think this is an important detail. 

Cutting someone off because you're angry is destructive, but it might be a last resort when every other attempt to save the friendship has failed. 

Before losing someone I really cared about I would want to have said to them, I'm so hurt by this behavior that I'm not able to be around you anymore.
youre very welcome, you too are loved and appreciated <33
Thank you I will, you too
Honestly it’s hard for us, and people just make it so much worse. And yes when you finally realise how deep their hate goes for you you finally realise that fuck them, you’re literally better without them they’re just toxic
Thank you very true and indefinitely haven’t i despise people like that
Thank you so much and very true
Very much, no one like that should be worth anyone’s time
Same for you, please never forget how valid and loved you are. You have also literally made someone’s day and just you being you could brighten anyone’s day up so thank you
Exaxtly this! And thank you for sharing too! Lets find or own accepting families
thanks so much, youre too sweet. whatever youre struggling through, just know youre not alone. youve got plenty of internet strangers to help you. youre doing great, keep it up :)

Eeeexactly
Shouldn't* lol

It was obviously a typo 😂 why are you in this sub then if you have an issue with it friend?
[removed]
I assume you understand that saying ""it"" while referring to someone is rude, no?
[removed]
Im leaning towards the idea that you may be playing dumb with me. You say you believe it's gender neutral, but I see that you're very active in the r/homophobes subreddit. 

Also I'm bi, hope that doesn't offend you here. 🤗
[removed]
It just seems weird to me that you'd come to the nonbinary subreddit, that I can tell you dislike by previous postings, and call me it. I dont feel like arguing with you, because I know you dont respect the way I live my life anyway. And I can tell by your posts you're not interested in trying to understand. 🤗
[removed]
You seem a little aggressive, I'm just stating I dont feel like arguing it explaining myself to you. I'm sure you can understand what I'm saying to you?
[removed]
Like I said, i dont feel the need to explain this to you. Obviously you didn't catch that
But to be fair it is a clump of cells, not a person.
This is hilarious 😂

Why dont you go back to r/homophobes 😂

I cant take anything you say seriously 😂 like I said, not interested in debating you mate

Misgendered by a trans person	I just got told by a trans woman that I'm just a girl who added they to their pronouns to pretend to be non binary. I'm so upset. I feel like I'll never be taken seriously in my gender if even a trans person can misgender me like this.	"I’m so sorry, friend. It stings so much when coming from other trans folks…I couldn’t care less about the cis at this point, but being seen by fam feels so necessary. 

My doctor’s office when I lived in the big city was staffed almost entirely with queer and trans people and every single time I went, binary trans women misgendered me. And my pronouns are in my chart, tattooed on my neck etc. There’s no missing them. It’s painful and I’m so sorry you feel like this rn. 🫶🏻
Fuck that person. I am sorry you had to hear that from a trans person.
Trans people have internalized transphobia too. Lots of ""fuck you I've got mine"" among any marginalized group. Plenty of assholes.
So you know how abused kids reenact their abuse sometimes? I feel like that never really changes even when people get older. They don’t have any better claim on YOUR gender because they’re not Cis. This dummy probably thinks a lot of silly and harmful things. I’m sorry that happened
I blows my mind how some other folks in the community still believe they know someone else's gender better than the other person. I'm nonbinary as well and got misgendered at the gym, while wearing my they/them pronoun pin very visibly, by a staff member who was ALSO wearing a they/them pronoun pin. It was so surreal. Like, this ain't it homie, what the actual fuck. I know it's not on the same level as what you experienced but at the root of it, people in the community need to be more aware of how much power they have to hurt each other. It's bad enough when cis people invalidate us but when it's other trans folks, it's so much more damaging. Trans and nonbinary people should be safe humans to go to for other trans and nonbinary people.
You’re valid. Anyone can be an AH, it doesn’t affect your right to be yourself.
As a non binary AFAB who prefers they/them pronouns this is one of my deep insecurities.
I've had some devastating things said by binary trans folks over the years, until I medically transitioned. 

Honestly, it's very typical of queer community. Some of the worst comments I've gotten about my asexuality were from allo queer people. Bi folks get lots of hate from gays and lesbians. 

We're all insecure and hurt and sometimes one marginalized group will attack another marginalized group. I can see how it would be hard to be a binary trans person, especially a trans woman, go through the hardships of a visible transition, and then see someone else claiming a trans identity while not undergoing those same struggles. (There are of course plenty of different struggles for non-medically transitioning trans people!) 

Here's the deal though: you don't need to struggle to be queer. Our struggles bring us together, but so do the beautiful things about queerness. It's not just about dysphoria, it's about euphoria. Whatever makes you feel like you're not a cis is literally all you need in order to be trans. 

The cruel comments from binary people, trans and cis, will continue. I'm sorry. Non-binaryness is new to a lot of people and challenges a lot of norms and it will make people be cruel. I hope your knowledge and comfort in your gender will increase over time and you will be able to ignore them. Your non-binary community is here to support and celebrate you. Any amount of transness is enough transness - you don't need to prove your gender to anyone.
As a trans woman, fuck her, we don't claim her, you are valid af!!
thank you all so much, I really needed to hear this ❤️
Hey, you ARE valid! No matter what anyone says, your gender is valid. Being trans doesn't mean that they can't be an asshole. There can be many reasons why they said that, maybe they had a bad day or were mean because they themselves heard it and were hurting. I'm sending you virtual hugs!
The opinion of someone not living in your shoes carries 0 weight in how you comfortably identify. The queer community still has a lot of internalized ick to work on. 



Do you, love.
Binary trans people can be shitty to us sometimes. They act like our existence somehow invalidates theirs. I'm really sorry that happened to you. I've had it happen to me plenty in the past; it seems like we're the community punching bags atm.
A lot of binary trans folks seem to take issue with non-binary people.
As a trans woman who is good with they/them and likes the idea of being at least futch: fuck her. Especially since for some of us that’s a stepping stone, and even if it goes no further you’re still valid.
[removed]
You’re absolutely non-binary. I’m so sorry she was shitty to you.

I’m a trans woman, so maybe this will help you heal even in the smallest of ways~
Trans people can be transphobic too. Sorry she was rude to you. There are lots of good people out there cis, and trans, binary, and non-binary who will accept you for who you are, those are the people that matter.
And here we learn an important lesson. No matter how marginalised, no matter how much you think someone would learn the gift of empathy, no matter how much you'd think there'd be solidarity: pricks are universal. Cis, trans, NB... \[Buzz Lightyear meme\] pricks, pricks everywhere. Sorry you had to meet this one. Tell them to go fuck themselves and move on. You're a nonbinary star.
I feel like a lot of binary trans folk are super judge-mental and uncomfortable about non-binary and genderqueer identities 

Not saying all are, but I’ve found that vibe from a lot of them

I’m non-binary transmasc and often feel scared to show my gnc/fem side in trans spaces because I’ve been criticized for the times I do, 
I’m accepted when I’m presenting as a guy, but if I dress androgynous or fem I’m seen as just a girl with short hair instead of my non-binary self I’m proud to be
Honestly some transgender people are really inconsiderate.

Noone has the right to tell you that your identity isn't real. Noone should ever tell you that you are just trying to seek attention, that non binary is just to look cool or fashionable or is bullshit.

Yet, there are some who still do because they think it's only them that are entitled to being called transgender. They don't even think for one second that non binary is real, because to them it doesn't count. Frankly I've seen a few subs that hated non binary people, there is even one sub dedicated to this!

Ground breaking news for them folks: the definition of being transgender is applicable to anyone that does not identify with their assigned gender at birth.

So the best I can tell you is to honestly not react to this. There are the subtle kind of transphobic comments that are worded in a way that will make you feel angry at the person, and it's designed to be like this, so you feel manipulated. React and you'll look like an ass. And yeah there are the bold ones who will outright tell you that you are not trans.

It is absolutely awful but all I could recommend is to ignore them. I know it is upsetting but there is not much one can do about it. Fighting over who has the right or not to be transgender is pointless, certainly.
Sorry you had to hear that nonsense. Don’t let them get to you, you are just as valid as any one else. Hugs x
That's pretty disgustingly hypocritical of them! I'm so sorry!
My therapist once told me that your likely to find the most discrimination inside the community itself. Same thing for bisexuality in the gay community.
> I feel like I'll never be taken seriously in my gender if even a trans person can misgender me like this.

You may be making the mistake of inverse stereotyping, where instead of assuming inherent evil in someone trans you're assuming inherent virtue in someone's judgements because they're trans.

Trans people of all kinds are still human and capable of making most of the same errors of judgement as anyone else. And calling you ""just a girl with they pronouns"" is way the fuck out of line.
A lot of trans people really don’t like NBs, unfortunately. It’s something I’ve noticed for years. They treat us the way cis people treat them.
Unfortunately being trans (or any other minority) doesn't automatically make someone not an asshole.  It just makes them a trans asshole instead of a cis asshole. I'm sorry you had to deal with that.
Sadly just because someone is trans doesn’t make them a good person there are a lot of us though that are not complete pos’s though please don’t give up hope because you are valid and loved by a community of people who accept and care about you plus she was probably jealous enbies are usually the coolest and best looking people 😁
transphobes, *any kind of transphobes,* fucking disappear challenge
Coming from a trans woman fuck that person. Gender is not as simple as people would like it to be. And i really hate people who try to force others into the gender binary.
OP should know that their pronouns are 100% valid and they don’t have to do anything to prove it. I want them to know that I support them and I believe them. What that woman said is nasty and hurtful but it will never change that fact that you are you. ❤️
$5 says she's had someone say something similar to her at some point and unfortunately she just ended up projecting it onto you

So essentially, it has nothing to actually do with you and everything to do with whatever issues she's dealing with so I would advise against making her an authority on your identity
unfortunately, there’s a lot of internalized transphobia in the community. i’ve seen it mostly in binary trans people, targeted at non-binary people a lot of the time. someone being trans doesn’t mean their opinion on your gender matters. i know it’s easier said than done, but try to just not give her any power over you. she’s projecting her insecurity on you, it’s not actually about you. keep your head up and continue to live your truth!! love ya
that wasn't the trans talking, that was the asshole talking. she can eff right off. People who disrespect others' pronouns are an embarrassment. You are taken seriously here and you will be in many other places. 💙💙💙
Gatekeepers/truscum suck ass, I'm sorry you had to deal with this shit :(
That's crazy wtf
Yo fuck that girl, she's wrong.
Trans people can suck too. Cis people aren't the only shotty folk out there by any means. 

You are valid and that turd-burglar can choke on her vape.

Signed,
A pissy non-binary trans woman
Binary trans people have said to me that “I’m the reason trans people aren’t taken seriously”. So apparently transphobia is my fault because I’m non-binary 😂 I just laugh at them. They’re losers.
Being trans doesn't mean you can't be transphobic! It's like all the biphobia that exists in the LGBTQIA+ movement. 

I'm sorry that she made you feel bad about yourself, I believe on your gender and even that I don't know you here's some online support.
There's this frustrating thing in the trans community where people don't take feminine presenting nonbinary people seriously; if your born a female and like makeup and heels but go by they/them like myself you'll get people who think your ""she/they"" when in reality I am ""he/they"" I just dress feminine. I had alot of trans people including my own nonbinary friends who were more masculine than me not take me as seriously or call me she because I was effeminate.  Keep your head up op. Your pronouns are important to you and us.
Heya. I'm a trans guy. IMO, you're always valid
Thats very rude
That's horrible, I'm so sorry people treat you like that!  You are NOT a girl, you are non-binary and don't let anyone tell you otherwise.
Lmao sounds like some truscum/transmedicalist trash. They are the blair whites and buck angels of the community. Fuck em. Pieces of shit all of em.
I feel you on this one.I had a conversation with an ex friend of mine last year (he’s a trans boy)who said that nonbinary,gender-fluid people etc.. are just mentally ill and they should get help.At that time I was at the begging of subconsciously understanding my gender;so when he said that I was..flabbergasted and became silent. I’m happy that I didn’t open up to him back then I just wish I knew more non cisgender people I could relate to irl.
they're just an asshole people who are demi are nonbinary and you deserve to be correctly gendered
Ah, yes. The community gate keepers. So exhausting sometimes. I’ve gotten that, disgusted looks and an internet argument by another trans person saying I’m not also trans if I’m nonbinary, and to stay in my lane. I have to laugh at the fact that things sail right over people’s heads and they end up turning into a bit of what they try to avoid.
That person was a twat. And amazingly stupid. Like mind blowingly stupid. Ignore them. They’re literally so stupid their opinion holds no value.


Also?
They just told you they feels powerless. 

Powerless people will either try to be good, or find someone else to dominate and have power over. 

That’s why Alt kids has the audacity to try and hate keep Metallica. Which is ridiculous, and misses the point of the alt community which is to be welcoming and accept anyone. And rock out. 

That person just told you they are, or they feel, weak. 

And they want to drag you down with them. 

Don’t let them. They’re lashing out in spite.
That person is a gatekeeping idiot. You're as valid as fuck and don't let anyone tell you otherwise.
Were you taking to Blair white or something??? That’s pretty rude
Sadly misgendering happens more than we would like it to, however, there are a lot of assholes within the LGBTQ+ community who are just as bad as straggots
trans ppl are not incapable of being assholes with transphobia. I learned this hard being Black. Just b/c you're part of a marginalized group doesn't mean you don't reenact oppression
I’m sorry, that sucks. 

Unfortunately being part of a minority doesn’t make you immune to bigotry. Binary trans people can hate non-binary people, gay men and lesbians can hate bi and ace people. Queer people in general can be racist, ableist, etc. Anyone can hate anyone, basically, and *being* hated by other people doesn’t automatically make you a good or empathetic person. 

I realize that doesn’t make it better though. It sucks that we get hate from people inside the community as well as outside it. I’m sorry this happened to you. 💙
That's a shitty person. We need to remember that every group of people have good people and shitty people. Yes a trans person can also be a dick.
❤️🧡💛💚💙💜
Demi-phobes are the worst, especially as an AMAB Demi-boy, because they just make my own self doubt louder
They are completely transphobic. Doesn't matter if they are in fact trans themselves.

Presentation does NOT equal your gender, hormones and hrt do NOT equal your gender.

You are completely valid with how you want to identify and present.

Love u xx
I've had this happen to me, as a gender nonconforming person several times from both binary and nonbinary trans folks. It usually is in response to me pointing out that I'm not cisgender (because you know there's nothing like some complete stranger online thinking they know me better than I know myself).

Ignore the haters, they are just insecure and uninformed. And they don't deserve your headspace.
Fuck people who gatekeep being trans like it's a special clique. We love you, we accept you, and most importantly - we see you. Their opinion is worthless - you are you. That's all there is to it!
That sucks.  Keep being you.

People who accept trans and criticize NB make no sense and drive me absolutely mad.
Well hear this from another Trans girl then. You're gender and identity are fully and completely valid!! I promise!! Don't let people like her get in the way of you experiencing your gender identity to the fullest that you can. You are valid.
People try to cut others down to make themselves feel less miserable. It sucks if it comes from someone who you would think would be more supportive. If you think you have yourself even partly figured out you are doing better than most. So be you, be proud, hold your friends and loved ones close and fuck everybody else.
The worst thing anyone has ever said to me was said by another non binary person, who called me cis because I don’t have any plans to medically transition in any way anytime soon.
I know the feeling. Just remember who you are. Other people will mislabel you but that does not define you. If a trans person did that to you, that's a reflection of one individual and not the entire community. Stay strong buddy. 👍
my guess is that she is insecure about being “trans enough” and feels she has to put down other trans people to make herself feel better. it’s a really shitty thing to do and i hope you know that you’re so valid, and you are the only person who gets to define yourself.
there are some super shitty trans people out there, unfortunately. I honestly don't understand where it comes from. I had to throw a trans woman out of a support group once because she wouldn't stop shitting on nonbinary people :(
Binary trans folk can be pretty shit to non-binary ones, unfortunately, because you’d think they’d get it better than most. :/ 

Just cause someone is queer doesn’t make them a good person/ally — punching down is pretty common for oppressed groups and individuals, even if we try to dissuade it (unfortunately there are group cohesion and emotional benefits to it, so yay.😬(obviously, the target needs to be *outside* your group/perceived group for the cohesion benefits))
I hate in-transphobia...
(Yo, whoever was playing with the upvote button w me on this one, cuz it was on 666,hmu)
I’m sorry this happened to you. Unfortunately so often binary trans people even exclude non-binary people in their fight for trans rights, despite us being under the trans umbrella. I remember when binary trans people were pissed at the x being added to womxn to show inclusivity because they are women and completely forgot that x was meant to include non-binary, gender non conforming, etc. So they erased our inclusion calling it transphobic because they were only focused on the binary transitioned trans experience, and not the trans umbrella as a whole. Often they even bulldoze trans folks who never want to or can’t transition, even if they are within the binary. 

I think there are some people who are deeply insecure and treat it as some sort of oppression olympics, and they use internalized transphobia to assume non-binary people who don’t give androgyny have no obstacles or oppression, when that couldn’t be any further from the truth.

I think a lot of binary trans people who focus on transition are so stuck on fitting the gender binary that they forget that just because someone outwardly appears as something doesn’t make that so. It’s a constantly struggle as someone AFAB who’s non-binary and still comes off quite femme. The level of hate even from our own community is unbelievable. I am sick of it. A non-binary person can look however they want and still be non-binary.

I think people forget that even if we look like our gender assigned at birth doesn’t erase the deep feeling of not being able to be who you truly are, in fact it actually makes it worse because we are always assumed to be something we aren’t. I don’t want a full transition or to wear binders and that means for my whole life, to look the way I want, people will always assume I’m a woman and automatically give me she/her pronouns. So in my gender expression, I am always misgendered. They forget there is a privilege in transitioning and being in a binary, even when trans.

To be honest my best experiences are with other non binary people and my worst experiences were with binary trans people because a lot of them still uphold a toxic binary system and toxic gender roles. (Obviously that’s generalizing from my own experiences)

They make assumptions someone has it “easy” and want to tare them down. They use their own trauma to traumatize those in their community. It’s true that hurt people hurt people. But that doesn’t make the behaviour okay.

I’ve never quite felt comfortable being in the “trans umbrella” because of these experiences. I feel like there’s cis, there’s binary trans, and then there’s those of us who are non-binary, non-conforming, etc. And because binary trans people are in their own realm and can just as easily enact transphobia against anyone who doesn’t fit the binary, it just feels weird to be meant to be in the same community when they never care to learn our experiences or fight for us, but we are always fighting for them. It’s why I’ve specifically seeked out non-binary spaces as they tend to be better and less oppressive. There’s a general understanding of wanting to be everything and nothing. And I love the comedy of understanding completely when someone says “I identify as a frog” or random stuff like that. Like eff the binary, eff gender, eff being a human lol.
Even when someone should have a wider perspective, people are still people and people sure can suck.
Happened to me too. Tran woman would call me her and we had met a few times and I made it clear each time that I'm nb trans fem. She would say ""we know you're a girl"" 🥺
There are shitty people across the board. Hope you know you're valid in whatever way you may identify now or in the future. Don't let anyone tell you otherwise. Wishing you the best.
It hurts but it is the way the world is, even people within the community don't always see eye to eye. But we will just forget their words a movie on :)
Something people seem to forget is that just because someone is LGBTQIA+ doesn't automatically mean they're a good person. We have an unfortunately large amount of internal bigotry between the various differing parts of the community 🤷‍♂️ humans suck sometimes. I'm sorry you had to deal with that
I'm so sorry that happened, as a trans woman I'd like to apologize, and assure you that many of us Think you're completely valid❤️
It’s so sick that this is happening even in our own community. I’m so sorry
Don't let one idiot keep you down.
You've likely met a transmedicalist. I had an ex-coworker who was one, but also identified as nonbinary (the duality of man, I suppose), and that set back my coming out by a lot. It made me insecure in my identity and like I was somehow appropriating something.

Truth is, what other people think literally does not matter. They cannot know your gender because they are not you. You are valid, I promise.
It’s ok, you don’t need people to tell you what your gender is. People ask all the time and never use them for me. You just got to ignore them and let it go, when’s the next time your going to see them?
There are trans people who havent actually unlearned transphobia they were brought up in. 

And there are trans people who ""punch down"" so to speak to feel mote validated by ""acceptable society"". 

There are jerks and assholes of every identity. 

Its unfortunate that theyre like this but they by no means are the majority of the community. Though, at times and in certain places (almost always online places) they can be the loudest.
Bad intolerant people exist in every community. So sorry friend. If you need to vent about it I’m here
Omg based
Trans people are people, and some people are bigoted assholes.
But that’s just my knee-jerk reaction. In real life when I was misgendered by a trans woman, I recognized that she was newly trans and a trauma survivor and was desperately hiding in the binary because she thought it protected her. It won’t. It never will. But she doesn’t know that yet. It’s not an excuse for the behavior, and some people are so hopelessly tied up in it that they’ll never let the binary go. No matter where it comes from, you don’t deserve it. You deserve so much better. It may take work to respond to people like that and to refuse to accept that treatment, but you’re worth it. And you’re valid exactly how you are. Most trans folk I know are deeply supportive of me, so I try to soak that in.
I'm so sorry this happened to you ! Binary trans people can be just as mean as cis people
Sounds like that person still has some self loathing issues.
I'm sorry you had to hear that from ANY person...
Seconded. Every group has bad apples. Unfortunately another person being part of the same minority group as you doesn’t automatically mean they’re in your corner.  There’s a lot of internalized shit going on in some people’s heads, and sometimes bigotry against other minority groups as well. The world sucks that way.

I’m sorry that happened to you OP. Just understanding *why* doesn’t make it hurt less. You have our support. <3
This. I used to work for a trans person who mis-gendered me constantly. I REALLY needed the money on this contract at the time, or I would've just quit.   
I would gently correct her every time. She then went on a rant about how nonbinary people just ""wanted to be trendy"" and a whole lot of right-wing rambling. I ended up firing her as a client.
Thank you. I LOVE your username
If it helps at all, I once accidentally misgendered someone (who was not there at the time, thankfully) and was reminded that they actually went by ‘they/them’, and I, because brains are dumb, replied ‘oh crap, you’re right, he does!’ 

Odds are decent it was less a personal choice on their part and more the fault of a brain on automatic pilot on mental infrastructure laid down when learning the language with binary gender categories. 

Still no fun!
Ah I'm so sorry that happened to you. Its so painful coming from trans+ people because they should know how much it can hurt.
Auction house?
Yeah I really hate it. I mostly use she as well as they because I know ill mostly be perceived as a girl so having she as a pronoun gives me slight control over that, but I so wish I could just use they/them.
One additional thought I've found comforting: cis people don't worry about being ""trans enough"". If you're worried about it... that's a sign you're trans.
I believe most often its people medically transitioning both non binary and binary get frustrated by what they perceive as people not medically transitioning taking up the majority of space in the community. Which in some cases I can understand when people who desire medical transitioning feel side lined considering lived experiences are so different and transitioning is still something that is a huge burden. However, I don't believe that the reaction to these frustrations should be to belittle others and deny their identity. A lot of binary trans people who medically transition specifically are often the most awful in this regard.
>Honestly, it's very typical of queer community. Some of the worst comments I've gotten about my asexuality were from allo queer people. Bi folks get lots of hate from gays and lesbians. 

I've definitely had my fair share of negative experiences relating to asexuality (and aromanticism) from queer people, had a lesbian friend who kept telling me that I ""just haven't found the right person yet"" and also a different one that told me that I'm probably gay.
FYI these are in response to me coming out as AroAce to them.

>Here's the deal though: you don't need to struggle to be queer. Our struggles bring us together, but so do the beautiful things about queerness. It's not just about dysphoria, it's about euphoria. Whatever makes you feel like you're not a cis is literally all you need in order to be trans. 

Simplest way I can say is that if it feels right for you, go for it. You don't need explicit euphoria or dysphoria, all you need is to have a connection that feels right.
I once dated a nonbinary person and they refused to correct anybody on my pronouns, called me their girlfriend on numerous occasions, and never switched up my pronouns. Another enby person I knew once said nonbinary people were just ""looking for attention"". They were literally nonbinary❗️Some people I stgs
Thank you <3
Thank you so much <3 I looked on their page and it seems like they just share comments like that to lots of people, but it just brought forward some worries I can usually ignore

> Binary trans people can be just as mean as cis people

I think most of all; anyone can be a fucking prick regardless of what kind of struggles they've been through. There's no guarantee that someone won't be an abusive asshole just because they are part of a marginalized class. Hell, I had to help my trans woman friend out of an abusive relationship with a trans woman.
I think there’s a segment of binary transfolk who—consciously or not—think that if they can invalidate someone else it will make them more valid in their genders. Or like. That if it weren’t for enbies “making them look bad” then cis people would take trans people seriously and not be giant transphobes. 

Which is, of course, not how anything works. But its a lot safer and easier to hurt an enbie than to hurt a transphobe so thats how it shakes out sometimes. But its comforting to me to remember that it has nothing to do with me, and that how other people choose to handle their stress and insecurities doesn’t have to matter to me. I hope its helpful to you too.
Actually I feel like they can be meaner, since they usually know more ways to be hurtful and can do it in a way that comes off as a firming to other LGBTQ members.

An example of this that I have personal experience with is Egg culture, which generally has the idea of trying to force people who are ""in denial"" to come out against their will. Granted that's not what it's supposed to be, but it still unfortunately happens that way since a lot of egg culture is based on gender conformity and a lot of people there will say you're ""in denial"" or that ""it's a sign you're trans"" (almost always referring to Binary trans).

Here's a quote from one of my attackers, trying to convince me that I'm binary transfem TW Enbyphobia:
>!""I'm saying you're an Egg because you seem to have an interest in dressing as something other than your AGAB, you're obviously not Cisgender. People can be either Male or Female and you're clearly not male, because males don't enjoy things like that if you keep lying to yourself you'll never be happy""!<

>!Bonus points for encouraging me to buy and take Hormones from the black market in later messages!<
""Every group has bad apples.""
So true! One would think that a person that shares someone else's struggle would also have compassion for them. But in way too many cases people just isolate themselves as the only ones who could possibly have this certain experience and deny that someone with a little different point of view may have a very similar struggle.
May that be a far right politician who's gay and actively works against others who are also gay or a trans person who neglects the possibility that outside their bubble there could be enby people who share the same struggle.
Homophobic homosexual people, transphobic trans people, it's really absurd but always kinda the same toxic mentality.

I wear a button that says my pronouns and it helps. My presentation is ever more ambiguous so that helps too but it sucks to feel that I need to present a certain way to be taken seriously. 

So far my best day was the time someone wasn't sure which bathroom I needed when I asked to use a restroom that was locked and yesterday when I bound my chest successfully for the first time with tape and I felt so perfect I didn't want to take it off.
Thank you so much <3
You’re welcome :))
Womxn wasn’t created by gender expansive people as a way to change cis people to include us, if it was, it would be a different conversation. It was created by cis people to ensure that women’s groups and feminist spaces signified they were inclusive of more than just women (aka showing it isn’t a TERF or transphobic space) without having to list every single identity.

While it’s easier to understand by writing it all out, this was done for brevity and things like bios or business names or spaces with a character limit. And as a writer myself I know very well that it gets extremely tedious having to write out or say women (including trans women), non-binary, gender non-conforming, gender expansive, etc. every single time. And things like that can’t fit in bios.

When this first started it was very clearly explained everywhere I saw it, so I do not have the same confusion as you. I however prefer women+. Again when I saw this introduced it was in a book and explained in depth what the writer meant. It was a cis person finding a way that worked for them to explain a long list of people without having to write it out every single time.

I also think anywhere these things weren’t obvious to the viewer it was also meant to start a conversation around inclusivity. So if other cis people ask what it means, you’re telling them about the importance of inclusivity and also showing your values. It also helps weed out the transphobic clientele and people around you.

Not all language will resonate for everyone. However my specific example here is not to talk about the language itself or argue about semantics  but to give an example on how certain language or things help to include non-binary people but binary trans people call it transphobic because they only think of their experience. They saw it and automatically assumed it meant cis women were typing to distinguish trans women as something else, when that wasn’t the case at all. It is in fact calling it transphobic that is the transphobic action.

In truly inclusive places they will use various forms of language to symbolize inclusion. That can be things like “those socialized as female” to signify AFAB people who were raised as female, or some people use “gender expansive” to signify an umbrella. Regardless, what people use isn’t going to feel right for everyone and it’s never going to capture everyone properly. That is the non-binary experience - we are everything and nothing and so having labels in itself to define us or box us in feels wrong. That doesn’t mean their purpose isn’t helpful in a step toward making safer spaces. And our preferences also can’t negate that something else can be helpful to others even if it’s not to us. Language is meant to evolve and will continue to and it doesn’t evolve lightly without consensus from a huge group of people.

I personally only feel comfortable showing up at event spaces that signify they’re open to non-binary people in some way, that includes the use of things like womxn or women+. If they don’t I actually ask them so that I start a conversation and help them to learn that inclusive language is necessary if they actually mean to include beyond cis and trans females and that actions need to be taken to ensure it’s a safer space. While womxn isn’t my preference, I still see it’s worth. And in the context of this conversation it was used only as an example of transphobic erasure by binary trans people, not as a discussion about the word.
This^ 
my partner was sexually assaulted and then stalked by an afab nb person but he’s masc so didn’t feel like he could say anything about it and they abused that to the point of moving around the corner from his apartment.
Yeah me too, I've noticed that when quite a few people see it they only use my name and no pronouns. 

Ahh I'm so glad you have these moments!! <3

My therapist just said that it’s “coercive “ of me to tell my employer that if they don’t respect my proper pronouns, then I will quit. He said it’s passive aggressive and kinda manipulative. Wtf.		"Get a new therapist. They clearly suck at their job
I mean, how else do enforce a boundary about it?  My boss continues to call me “sir” and “he/him” after I explicitly asked him not to.  What can I do about it, other than quit?
ultimatums are not inherently manipulative or coercive, your therapist isn't just bad he's stupid
It sounds like your therapist doesn't understand ""abuse"" and ""healthy boundaries."" I would ""fire him.""
So your therapist thinks that you setting an important personal boundary is manipulation? What the ever loving fuck. 

They’re putting a stranger’s feelings before yours.

They’re putting the hypothetical convenience of a business before your feelings.

Your therapist is not only a bad therapist, they are acting like a bad person. Ugh, your therapist’s actions make my skin crawl.

What you are doing is awesome. Not all therapists are shitty. I hope you can find a good one.
You cannot coerce an employer. The power imbalance is inherently in their favor.  This is a ridiculous misunderstanding of words and capitalism.
In California that would be considered harassment to not use your proper pronouns in the workplace
If that’s coercive, then good employment tactics are coercive. Wanna wrap in asking for a raise/getting paid time off in there? It’s all basic respect…obviously your therapist isn’t very knowledgeable there
It's literally harassment according to the EEOC to continuously misgender an employee. I would reach out to your local EEOC office and file a complaint
[deleted]
Your existence is is not passive aggressive and manipulative, and that therapist is transphobic. Byyyyyeeeee
That sounds like a shitty therapist.
Ask them what is more coercive: you threatening to quit if they refuse to use your proper pronouns or them trying to condition you into using old pronouns.  They need to learn the difference between coercion and boundaries since they got em mixed up here.

You could also ask them if their employer started using their wrong pronouns if they would set the same boundary and threaten to quit.
An employee can't really be coercive against an employer (at least in the work relationship with each other) the power the employer has over the employee prevents that
And anyway even if it was it ( is) would be the right thing to do
You have the right to quit for ANY reason, that's some bullshit therapist, time for a new one, if you can. Sry that happened to you.
If the people you work with do not respect your pronouns, you have every right to quit. 

It is not a sign of a good enviornment to be in ... so why bother staying?
To use a British slang term.... that's a load of bollocks!
He showed his cards, he doesn’t take you seriously. Find a new therapist.

PS - I’m sorry you experienced that :((
""having boundaries is cooercive"" wtf lmao
This is really taking capitalism-blind therapy to a new level.

Pathologising saying ‘no’ to your boss.

I’m willing to bet that therapist has/had a management role and it personally hurt their feelings when staff called them on their bullshit.
What everyone else said. It's not coercion it's a boundary. ""If I'm not treated [this] way I will respond by doing [this thing that doesn't harm anyone else]."" I don't even know how one would coerce someone to use their pronouns without like a physical threat?
If you haven’t disclosed how you’re feeling or spoken with your employer and co workers about pronouns and respecting them, then yea quitting would be kinda passive aggressive. Have you spoken with them? 

If you’ve spoken with them already about pronouns and they’re still being disrespectful then write an email to HR department and see if that helps. Take steps to advocate for yourself and help the situation before leaving. There’s potential to get misgendered anywhere for any trans person
Cute how your basic human needs being dependent on your usefulness to rich people is fine, but maintaining any sort of boundaries while working for them is coersive. Very cool take on workplace power dynamics from Mr. VA Therapist.
Like as if someone is coercing anyone is your employer that thinks they have the power to misgender you. Your therapist sucks
I quit after giving my previous employers a month to start using the correct pronouns for me (talked to management in person, sent emails, did everything except take it to Corporate higher up the chain of management.) They never changed and didn’t see why it was important. I quit but I wish I had reported them to the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission first for discrimination. They didn’t even give me a recommendation at a future job, it was against company policy. That way I could have gotten unemployment while I looked for another job. Talk to someone is what I’m saying anyway, this is real and harmful and you deserve better.
Sounds like he should be an ex-therapist-- and I don't even mean *your* ex-therapist. This dude shouldn't be in the profession.
Tell that POS it is called “market economy”…
He sounds like 1. a transphobe and 2. dangerous because he clearly has zero respect for boundaries and is happy to weaponize ""progressive"" buzzwords to undermine you standing up for yourself.
From this therapist, please know that's utter horseshit and that therapist sounds awful, harmful, and incompetent. You do whatever you need for your safety and wellbeing ❤️
my boss has one more strike before i quit. 

he doesn’t know that, and i’m quitting regardless, but he randomly deadnamed me based on the name in my email and not the name i told him and the name that’s on my name tag. 

he does it again i walk out. simple as that.
Lmao and misgendering isn't manipulative? Like buddy I'm gonna be as passive aggressive as I need to be. If God wanted me to be the bigger person they wouldn't of made me 5'5"".
What?! Absolutely the fuck not. It's called putting a boundary in place for your own mental health.
First off. That’s not passive aggressive it’s active aggressive.

Second off. Good on you for enforcing your boundaries.

Third off. Employees are not the ones with coercive power in the employee/employer relationship.
Hi I am a non binary therapist. From my perspective, giving that ultimatum sounds more like a strong boundary because I’m assuming that your employer is not respecting your identity. I personally believe that manipulation is when you are trying to control other people through passive  ways. Setting reasonable limits about how people refer to you is not manipulative.

Also not passive aggressive because you are being direct about you boundaries. Passive aggression is more like being unkind without stating what’s bothering you.

It can be really confusing and jarring when a therapist misreads a situation or makes an unhelpful statement. 

I admire your courage to stand up for yourself in the workplace, one of the most vulnerable spaces for queer folks.
Get a new job AND a new therapist. Wtf? Who says that??
""Please respect my gender"" is the new ""I'll blackmail you and ruin your company and life if you don't give into my every demand."" According to your ebnyphobic therapist.
Dump that therapist. They're an incompetent fool at best, and a conniving fuck at worst.
Get the fuck rid of that therapist. If your therapist doesn't validate you, you've got the wrong therapist!
Depending on the state, if they didn’t respect your pronouns you might have a cause of action against them
I was so glad to read in the comments that he's not your usual therapist! If you feel up to it, maybe report him? If you don't, just focus on looking after you 🖤✨
Did your therapist suggest an alternative when calling you passive aggressive and manipulative?
Yeah, how dare you coerce someone into showing basic human respect and decencu
Get a therapist from Pride Counseling. I think it's pridecounseling.com/. It's closely linked to BetterHelp. My therapist uses they/them pronouns.
It's a very textbook interpretation, though I understand the logic (even if I vehemently disagree with it). ""If you don't X, I will Y"" is a sentence pattern that *can* be coercive.

Of course it completely ignores that this is a professional negotiation context, where the relationship isn't personal. In a family or intimate relationship this would be closer to the mark, but even then I would argue it's also a kind of negotiation.

Ultimately, this interaction sounds like it went poorly, and unless there are a lot of good reasons to continue the relationship, I'd be considering other therapists.
I mean, if you're in a position where you *can* quit, surely you have the right to if you want? Including if you're in an unsupportive environment?

That's not manipulative that's just basic employer-employee relations. Oh, and it's the exact opposite of passive aggressive if you're outright telling your employer your needs.
It isn’t manipulative in the slightest to establish that you want to be respected. It’s basic human decency. What is manipulative is to imply that because you’re trans you can’t expect people to respect you
Don't you know that wanting respect makes you a sociopath and literally the worst person ever? Smh /s
Having boundaries is healthy. Having boundaries is NOT manipulative or passive aggressive
It's Manipulative To Not Want To Be Somewhere Where You're Not Respected? Damn, Guess I'm Manipulative Then.
Never stop asking your employers for respect, or anyone for that matter. I’m sick of seeing people being told not to ask for common courtesy. I got the same line from an
old boss about not threatening to quit if I don’t get the days off I requested. It was for fcking surgery. I left right then and there.
That’s called an ultimatum. It’s kinda the opposite of passive aggressive lol
I guess I got lucky with my therapist considering how many posts I’ve seen like this lol

My therapist hasn’t ever said my feelings are invalid or that I’m doing something manipulative.I tell him a problem and he works with me to try to fix it in a healthy way.
Nope, you were being straightforward and setting a reasonable boundary. Your therapist is probably scared of that.
🙄 demanding respect is absolutely not coercive
That doesn’t even sound like a therapeutic technique. Sounds like a transphobic reaction. If a therapist thought you were being controlling or something in your life for some reason, or coercive or manipulative, a therapeutic approach would be to ask questions to see why you feel defensive in that situation and what’s at the root of your response. It wouldn’t be to use judgment-laden language. Highly unprofessional even if it WAS true (which it isn’t). i’m sure many cisgender people would quit a job or at least threaten to if a boss continually misgendered them

Eta: I think that the response people should have when therapists step outside of their job to be judgmental or give unsolicited advice is, what therapeutic approach are you using right now in telling me that? Is that Cbt? Narrative therapy? Call them out.
it is worded in an aggressive and coercive manner.

more diplomatic would be ""i want to continue working here and want to feel safe while doing so, but for that i need you to respect my correct pronouns.""

depending on how you feel about the situation,  either may be more appropiate to say.
I can see why an addiction counselor might go there with you first; many people with addiction problems also have psychological problems. And some of those addicted with psych problems enjoy stirring the pot for all the chaos it creates, which further fuels their addictions in this awful, endless feedback loop.

That is not you, though. I just wanna toss a psych book at this guy and say ""STOP IT. You should know better."" I mean, Jesus. Read the fucking room already.

Personally I choose my battles about my pronouns, but I'm also middle aged and I don't have the energy I once did either. Unless you're in a State that protects LGBTQIA+ people, insisting on pronouns in a space that provides your income to pay your rent can be a risky, deeply personal affair. I'm on Team Pronouns, but again, choose those battles wisely.
It is. You can't force people to respect you. You have to earn it. The world doesn't revolve around you and doing what you want.
This sounds like a bot made this post lol I'm sorry
I almost forgot the real world exist. Fucking hell
Manipulate your boss oh yeah sure go ahead totally makes sense
Time for a new therapist, he clearly doesn’t understand the importance of being referred to correctly and the transphobia that comes with misgendering.
Ultimatums don't work in the professional world. you don't threaten to do things, you just do them. If you don't like how you're being treated at work, you tell HR what the problem is and see if it stops. If it doesn't, then your response is the only thing you can control. Either you quit and get a lawyer or you don't.
\*my\* therapist would simply call this drawing a boundary
Get a new therapist who respects you for who you are.
Is the problem with this therapist or your employer at the core of this? Wherever the problem lies is where you need to look for solution.
Report him and request never to work with him again. Wtf kind of backwards bs. I’m so sorry you were treated this way.
As a psych major id never say that to a patient. Theyre  obviously transphobic so for your own sake I think you should use a different therapist.
I guess it could be considered manipulative if you dont actually plan on quitting, i used to work with someone who would use ultimatums to get their way for any and everything, so maybe he interpreted that way???? Maybe??
Otherwise i think most people would consider it to be setting boundaries, which is always a good thing to imho. Like why respect your boss if yout boss doesnt respect you? Thats just a no-brainer.       
Sounds like something someone with no psychology background would say imo. Why would they flat out tell anyone that they’re manipulative and coercive? Idk much about psychology but ive been to a lot of sessions and it seems like saying something that could invalidate your feelings like that, or outright accusing you of doing something immoral instead of making gentle suggestions towards a better direction is something they’d never do.
i think your therapist needs to consider a new career path, as having to ask somebody to treat you with basic human decency is not coercive, or manipulative. 

your therapist is supposed to be a safe space for you, a place to be vulnerable, there needs to be a trust between you and your therapist to get the most out of it. if they are making ridiculous statements such as this, then there’s a lack of respect there on their part, and it sounds like they definitely are not suited to being your therapist, let alone a therapist for anyone else. 

i’m sorry you have had to go through that.
You can also look up your rights regarding constructive dismissal - that's when you quit even though you don't want to, because your working environment is hostile. If you quit because of discrimination, that's constructive dismissal, it's against the law. Your threat to quit could be a threat of a lawsuit so they ought to bloody listen.
Imagine thinking people are manipulative by asking them to respect your boundaries…. Tell them the clown college is the next city over
You're asking to be treated as an equal and your therapist needs to realize that's what this is
Welp someone is not shall we say trans competent. Setting a boundary is the opposite of passive aggressive.
Your therapist has poop where their brain should be.
... yeah get a new therapist, preferably one that is or specializes in trans people
Enby therapist here: fire his ass and/or refuse to be seen by him. That’s some goddamn bullshit and if he doesn’t understand and refuses to learn he’s not a good therapist.
Get a new therapist
Oh noooooo you so toxic for not being a pushover with your identity and giving yourself dignity oh nooooo there's a walking red flag ova ere and it ain't me, yikes, unpack your need to manipulate people into giving you basic decency :((((((
Oh look, it’s new therapist o clock.
Need a new therapist!
Fuck that transphobic bastard SO HARD
If anything is coercive, it’s your employer putting you in the position where you’re forced to choose between employment and basic respect.
get a new therapist. this one is shit, that's very obvious.
I dealt with a similar but not same scenario and the answer is ABSOLUTELY get a therapist that deals in LGBTQ+ issues, your therapist sounds like he has absolutely no idea what he’s talking about, and from reading your other comments, he obviously doesn’t have much experience with nonbinary/trans people. I have a non-binary polyamorous therapist now, and I find our conversations are much more fruitful and incredibly supportive as compared to the way therapists in the past treated me. 

You are in the right to give your employer an ultimatum, that is what it is and it’s not “kinda manipulative and passive aggressive”, NOR is it coercive, I don’t even know what he’s going on about there. It’s literally saying “respect an integral aspect of my identity or I will take my experience somewhere where I am granted the basic respect of being gendered correctly.” 

You’re simply asking for your gender and pronouns to be respected by your employer, you are not asking for something crazy or unreasonable.
That's not right. It's true that people in passing will normally refer to a person depending on how they look, but since your boss is familiar with what you prefer this is unprofessional. Your therapist sounds biased toward thinking that the former way of addressing someone based on initial assumption is always correct, but this line of thought does not consider human courtesy.
It’s passive aggressive and manipulative to not accept discrimination? No, he’s wrong. I’m sorry you had to experience that
time to misgender your therapist! show him the meaning of passive aggressive manipulation!
Nope. A therapist not understanding what a boundary is.... moronic, literally no excuse. Not one. Lights on, no one's home. Head empty. Set those boundaries! Proud of you! Your job can absolutely respect your pronouns! No excuse there either.
Yeah no get tf outta there that is a duschebag
No it isn't. He sucks.
omg time to go shopping for a new therapist
but seriously fuck your therapist
misgender the therapist in return 😎
You need a new therapist.
Time for a new therapist
Uhhh I’m so sorry. It’s so hard to stand up for yourself in this world sometimes. I’m so sorry people arnt respecting your pronouns. Also you’re therapist sounds awful. Therapists are ment to help you feel better and more comfortable in who you are and clearly they are not doing that for you.
Tell me you don't know what coercion means without telling me you don't know what coercion means
Employment is an agreement between two parties that one party will trade their labor for a wage from the other party. Period. The end.

You can leave any job, for any reason, at any time. 

You are ALWAYS allowed to leave a job where your personhood is not respected. It is a business relationship, not a marriage or family relationship.
If possible, try to find another therapist. If not, tell them that they are wrong and explain to them why. If they don’t understand what you mean, start calling them by the opposite pronouns and see what they say. 

Your pronouns are yours and they are to be respected. That is basic human decency and is not manipulative or passive aggressive at all. You have to work everyday and you should feel safe at work. If you don’t feel safe your performance will go down and your mental health will too. 

You deserve to feel safe at work, and if they don’t make you feel safe and give you basic human respect, then I would quit too and find a place that would gove me that
This sounds like my middle school therapist, relation: she fucking sucked. 
Your therapist sounds like shit, I'm sorry
Thankfully he’s not my usual therapist.  He’s a social worker with the substance abuse clinic at the VA.  I don’t think I’ll discuss trans or non-binary topics with him anymore.
Came to say this. He’s wrong and you have every right to be addressed properly.
Does your therapist work for your company or something? This sounds like anti-worker propaganda, not useful feedback.
Does your boss do it intentionally like he won't use your pronouns? Or is it the constant lack of will and poor attempts? If it's the latter you can eventually make progress with persistence. If it's that he refuses then keep requesting the correct pronouns, document it every time, and if/when he gets sick of it and fires you collect unemployment on his dime. 

You'll have a clear case of discrimination too. A lawyer might be interested in that, but personally I'd probably just collect the unemployment while finding a new job.
Report them to someone above them in the organisation?
I'm not sure where you live, but if it was me, I'd bring it up to HR (if there is one) as well. Not sure if you could, but like... I could see a discrimination suit coming from this. Not a lawyer, of course, but I'm pretty sure this could count as either discrimination or something related to the creation of a hostile work environment.
Thats definitely just enforcing a boundary and the social worker sucks
exactly this, especially when already set boundaries are being crossed
Yeah, I think in the very least I won’t discuss trans issues with him anymore.  But I’m supposed to talk to him about what’s driving my drinking, and a lot of that is trans issues and dysphoria.  So now I don’t know how useful our sessions are gonna be if I can’t discuss what’s going on in my life.
https://www.eeoc.gov/employees
Just thought this might be helpful to add. You can also find the office near you on there and how to file a complaint with them etc.
I read that wrong the first time and thought it WAS unanimous and then I got a funny feeling and read it again. Oh good God. Those poor kids 😔
Yeah, I’m starting to get that impression.
Jordan Peterson
If I quit I could still be misgendered at the next job, or by the next client.  So quitting doesn’t really fix the problem.  I don’t know that there is a satisfactory outcome here.  I may just have to take the constant misgendering for now.  I can try talking to them again.  But I already explicitly asked them not to call me “sir,” and they are almost doing it more now.
Yeah, that’s the crux of it—I could just as easily be misgendered constantly at the next job.  So why quit?  I like my current job/client otherwise.  And yeah, I did already talk to them about my pronouns and what being non-binary is, and explicitly asked them not to call me sir, but they continue to do so.

And they’re my main clients, I work for myself, really, so there’s no HR department.
He started talking about having more “flexible boundaries,” and I just stopped listening at that point.
I’m not a bot!
I’ve seen a number of therapists over the years, and many have claimed to specialize in lgbtq issues, but then had no clue how to help me with trans stuff.  I do get to see a specialist on occasion, and she’s great, but is out sick a lot, so I only get to talk to her once a month or so.  I will ask her what she thinks of all this next time we meet.
I’m going to fire him.  I know it’s crazy, but I’m worried about hurting his feelings by firing him.  Ridiculous.
VA like veterans affairs?

Report him to the patient advocate
he sounds like a niche addiction counselor, definitely don't discuss anything outside his area of expertise
So a social worker is not a therapist, and should not be portraying themselves as one, especially to give awful advice like this. OP you are not being coercive or manipulative whatsoever when you wish to be referee to in the right way.
There it is. Every shitty experience I every had in the mental health field was with ppl in the substance abuse clinic because as soon as they hear you smoked pot once when you were 18, they immediately say that is the root of all of your problems and disorders. Last year, I went into the er for trying to ""reroll a new character"" and I was sent home 2 hours later because she deemed I was just high and im safe now, when 2 days later I was in there again completely sober and she was like ""well I just lost my job""(she didn't actually, unfortunately. As far as I know she's still there.)
Report him. There are trans-friendly people in the VA, and anyone with this attitude needs to GTFO.
No, he’s a VA social worker.  Straight white cis male.  I don’t think he knows what he’s talking about.
Trust and rapport are the essential foundation for a successful therapeutic relationship. If you have to filter what you say in session, then you've already lost 95% of the point of going. Cut your losses and find someone that can help you make progress on your stuff. This guy might be the nicest person in the world, but if he's not going to be supportive of you, there's no value there. You deserve someone you can be completely honest with.
They're not going to be useful. You need a therapist willing to actually listen.
I just wrote an article on exactly this, how discrimination is a barrier to recovering from addiction, when discrimination is also fuelling the addiction. Sorry it's happening to you.

Is there any option for you to find some LGBTQ support with your drinking? It's more effective, what a surprise... I know AA have LGBTQ groups these days but it's not everyone's choice. Maybe you can ask for a queer therapist at your facility.
Have you tried the Sinclair Method (pharmacological extinction with naltrexone)? I've never personally tried it, but I've heard glowing reviews.
Is there someone who you can explain this to? Like is it a therapist in a group practice, centrum, ... if that's the case you should explain the problem and ask to be changed to a different therapist.

If you cannot even safely adress the root of your drinking, these sessions will probably not be very helpful to you. You deserve a therapist that at least knows the basic stuff (a boundary is not manipulative and coercive, and even if it WAS, no proper therapist would tell you that) even if they aren't specialised in trans specific issues.

My therapist isn't specialised in trans identity, but she recognises it impacts my mental health and helps me work through those issues as well. Without judgement. Like a therapist should.
I just want to echo a later comment and say that EEOC is the way to go if you want to stay. This is against discrimination law.
I refuse to answer if they use the wrong ones and have a blunt way of correcting them every single time. You already know the instances in which they do it so practice a clear quick way to correct them. Practice over and over so you can say it without a lot of thought or emotion. Alternatively you could use noxious stimuli to train them like a “wrong” buzzer or a spray bottle when they get it wrong lol. You can train them how to treat you even though it takes a lot of effort and energy. It sounds like you have nothing to lose to try to train them except if it causes you personal agony.
please do! like i said if you can try and find a therapist who *is* trans because thats a guarantee they will better understand you, but also if you find ""lgbtq specialist"" therapists its a rlly good idea to search for reviews on them and try and vet them on your first meeting by talking about trans related issues and seeing how they react/what they say. good luck!! i really hope you can find a supportive and actually helpful therapist💙💗🤍💗💙
Why are you worried about his feelings? Worry about what you can control. You cannot control his feelings. As a friend told me the other day, what they think of me or feel about me is none of my business. That is so liberating! 
Anyway, the therapist works for you—you pay him—and seems to act in a toxic way towards clients. He should be fired and he should be told why. You should absolutely not be worried about his feelings about being fired because of his behavior. I hope you find a fantastic therapist to replace the soon to be fired one.
If he’s a good therapist (doesn’t sound like it but could just be a misunderstanding) then he will understand. Not even the best therapist in the world is perfect for every one and we all seek to learn and be better. If he’s a bad therapist then while I understand your caring it’s important to pay attention to how he makes you feel. If the answer is only worse, then he’s not helping you anymore.
Social workers can specialize in specific areas, but social work as a field of practice is very broad. He is not abiding by the social work code of ethics; he should know better.
Clinical social workers can provide talk therapy, and their training and person-in-environment lens can make them some of the best allies  This particular social worker may not be good at what he does, but that’s not social work’s fault.
Not sure about where OP is from, but in many places social workers can study to become psychotherapists, and in some settings it may make sense to combine both roles into a single service. This guy was bad at his job though.
LCSWs are therapists. Actually, almost every therapist I've ever seen was an LCSW.
They aren't, but unfortunately in many clinics they are all you are offered. I don't know about OP's situation and state, but in my area, some clinics only have LCSWs because they are dealing with either rural towns or very poor urban areas (for the same company but satellite clinics). It sucks. The one I see is not someone with whom I can discuss anything involving my idea of self. I just hope OP can ask for a different worker. The occupation as a whole is shortstaffed, and I know that here it's often difficult to switch unless they are fired/quit.
He do not. You need a new therapist, preferably one with some experience working with LGBTQ issues.
Ok but at the very least he should know a boundary when he sees one. He's actively causing harm that should be against his training, no matter what part of the field he's in or his own identity.

Edit: I'm still mad, idc. Like literally at the very bare minimum he could say he doesn't agree that's a necessary boundary & that you should consider if it's realistic. That I could let slide because he's not a gender therapist & he's the unholy Trinity. But this is actively malicious. He knows that's a fuckin boundary which looks completely fuckin different than a manipulation tactic. I actually think I would fight this man
If you have a pride center near you they should have some info on where to find an LGBT+ literate therapist!
I'll be real, my experience with VA social workers has been shit. I'm not a veteran but come from a military family. My mom and I had a tense relationship for a bit bc, among other things, she was constantly deadnaming me and refused to stop... eventually she suggested family therapy, I agreed hoping it would help her gain some perspective on why her actions were hurtful to me. She had an individual counselor through the VA and so we set up a family counselor through the VA since it was at no cost, and I found out that I was eligible for free therapy too thru the VA center as long as my mom was an active client. I was told it's because their scope is to serve veterans *and their families*, and the logic was: the mental health of a veteran is better when those close to them (eg family) are doing well themselves, so it was in the VA's interest to allow family members access to these services just the same.

Made sense to me. I was having issues with depression and PTSD and needed a counselor but I was broke and it all sounded like a good setup. Plus, the counselor I was assigned was a trans man himself so I really thought he'd understand my struggles with queer gender identity and family!

But, he interpreted the logic of my eligibility as a non-vet differently though, and told me that he wasn't there to help me through my problems for *my* sake, but that his only concern was the veteran in my family dynamic -- here, my mom -- and he was here to ""fix"" my behavior insofar as it made *her* life easier. I preferred to keep my issues with her to our family sessions since that was the whole point, and use my individual session to address my other struggles, but he made our sessions all about my mom and how she must be struggling and how I could be more ""agreeable"" and ""less stressful"" for her.

Idk what it is about VA social workers, if they're all trained that having/enforcing boundaries is manipulative or what, but I ditched him pretty quick, because that was not okay. I don't have any real advice here... just that fortunately I found a great non-VA therapist, and the one my mom and I saw for family counseling worked out well and we have a much less tense relationship now that she stopped deadnaming me, and those more positive experiences really drove home how *off* that other guy was. But I'm sorry you had to encounter a similar shitty take from a VA social worker. Just know it's not you, you're not alone, and I'm wishing you the best.
Ok, yeah, you’re right.  I have the option of seeing someone else, so I’m gonna do that.
Naltrexone gave me migraines.  But I’ve got 3 months sober now.  I’ve been doing Mindfulness Based Relapse Prevention groups and regular counseling.
this is very true. I'm wondering if he has only specific addiction counselor training but is hired in a position titled social worker. We've come to associate all social workers with LCSWs but he could have none of that training (example: My job title is social worker but I have no advanced degree, I just work for the state)
They maybe be able to give great advice but impersonating a medical professional is a crime and a social worker is not an adequate substitute. You have to pay for therapy. Insurance wouldn't cover the appointment knowing the person giving the therapy was not licensed.
Just want to second the above advice. Therapy is a holistic experience - even if you are seeing someone for a specific issue, it is essential that you click with them on multiple levels - especially since you are already aware that your struggles stem from trans issues and dysphoria, and you don’t feel safe talking to your therapist about these things. The therapeutic relationship is first and foremost built on trust and rapport, and without these building blocks, it falls apart. 

Also, that guy is completely whack and stepped totally out of line. You set boundaries with your employer. Boundaries. Stick to them, op. You will be glad you did.
By law, you cannot call yourself a social worker unless you have a degree in social work.
What? Social workers can be credentialed for therapy and it’s not less legit than other types of credentials. Social workers who do clinical work are legitimate and can take insurance.
You may be conflating licensed social workers (LSW), MSWs, and licensed clinical social workers (LCSW).  Licensed clinical social workers are perfectly credentialed to offer therapy, and are in private practice all the time.  Licensed social workers generally may offer therapy under supervision.  MSWs have the education but not the licensure.
I think you're confusing psychiatrists, who are physicians specializing in psychiatric practice, with therapists, who can hold a variety of degrees which can be but are usually not medical degrees
okay tell that to the commonwealth of massachusetts lol. I don't provide therapy. I do provide access to social programs. social work isn't just a clinical profession. but I will defer to greater knowledge if you hold it about the clinical arena. I just know there are so many more types of counseling-associated degrees than most folks realize, that's all.
(example: I'm studying to be a psychiatric APRN. most folks think their psychiatrists hold MDs, but that's not the only path to private practice)
Idk where this is but in my country social workers can NOT provide therapy. Only licensed clinical psychologists can.

Someone told me I wasn’t androgynous enough to be they/them	"Dude kept misgendering me, and when I corrected him he told me he “just doesn’t see me that way” because my presentation “isn’t really androgynous enough”. 

Oh come on! 

My usual presentation is “man bun tech bro”, so it really stung to hear that I’m still not butch enough to have “earned” my pronouns. Short of a teat yeet, there isn’t much further I can go!




Edit: Thank you all so much for the support!  I feel validated and seen, and I appreciate it. Androgyny is its own style thing and embracing or not embracing that style doesn’t change my right to have something as rock bottom basic as pronouns respected. 

For the folks telling me to misgender this cat right back, though, nah. Calling a man “her” as punishment for bad behavior plays into all the sexist, misogynist, and homophobic tropes that men are better, women are lesser, men loving and/or having sex with men is bad, bisexuality doesn’t exist, etc.  I’m not gonna drag entire disadvantaged groups through the mud just to get back at some bumhelm; I’ll probably just let him know the reason why Imma peace out, and then lose his number."	"Yeah that's pretty yikesy.

Remember, it's not your fault you get misgendered. Dude is just an arsehole.
You don’t owe anyone androgyny. You don’t have to embrace any specific presentation to be nonbinary. That guy sucks, and his comments are bigoted nonsense. So sorry you went through that!
Fuck that dude
Good thing androgyny has literally nothing to do with being nb
It's nothing to do with you, mate. You're awesome

That dude's just an ass
""oh shit, I put on the wrong gender this morning, my bad. I see you're wearing butch lesbian today, I should have noticed earlier- sorry, I'll switch to she/her"".
Dump that guy, yuck. I'm sorry. You are valid, your pronouns are valid and you owe nobody androgyny
I hate these people. I had a coworker when I started in my shop who referred to me with my AGAB. I corrected her the first two weeks, until I heard her going on to a customer, not even covering who she was talking about, misgendering me the whole time, while talking about how I wanted to be be referred to as they/them, and how ""such a waste of a girl."" Thankfully the manager moved her to another store, but it took a while of me complaining to them and bringing up the word discrimination a lot 🙄. Tldr: people suck.
Screw that jerk.

Also ""teat yeet"" killed me 🤣🤣🤣
No such thing as looking nonbinary. Androgyny is not a requirement of nonbinary. I can't stand people who think you can look queer. It's one thing to try to signal to other queer people that you're queer(I wear a trans pin, pretty obvious stuff) But when you deny someone's identity on your own preconceived notions of that identity you are a fucking asshole.


I personally choose violence in these situations, however possible. From being casually rude remarks to fully aggressive, whatever you think it will take without getting you in trouble. 


You are valid. Fuck this asshole.
Dude sounds like a right dick. You do you. I can just chill in sweatpants and a Colombian soccer jersey and still be NB. Not like there’s a dress code or whatever, lol.
Well teat yeet is the best thing I've heard on the internet this week if it's any consolation. Also who made that one lord of pronouns? Sounds like someone who hasn't earned your time or consideration.
some people can't handle the idea of people outside of ""man and women"" if they don't ""look the part"" enough. it's very annoying and invalidating. also sad. it all has to do with looks. how people who've been making rules for society all these years want to see things. they respect you based on how you ""pass"" in the eyes cis people.
i feel this.  i have a deep voice, and people are constantly misgendering me as ""he"" even after i share my pronouns (they/them). 

we shouldn't have to ""earn"" our pronouns.   our expression on any given day doesn't define us.  if we want to be masc one day and fem another day and andro another day we can do that, and fuck what anyone else thinks :)
To hell with him, do you, stay you!
I ask people that tell me such things why it matters or why the gatekeeping.
The argument past the insult is like trying to eat soup with a fork.

I have yet to hear a reason why only afab can be truly non-binary or that looking super masc or super fem denies your non-binary...

Humans like that are just not keeping up with society and are most definitely in the minority thankfully.
I would have been so tempted to laugh in their face and be like:

""Well, either I'm not androgynous enough or your understanding of the world isn't big enough, honey.""
Wow fuck this guy. You literally did nothing wrong, he just refuses to see you for who you are. What an asshole. Gonna change his pronouns to was/were.
Why can’t people see that there are male presenting non-binary people, female presenting non-binary people and androgynous non-binary people. We are all unique.
ugh I really dislike people who link gender identity with gender expression.

you are very valid and do not owe this person an explanation. it's not your fault for being misgendered at all. people are just assholes
I'm very feminine, and I'm non-binary. In a way, it helps you root out the shitty people. You are deserving of love and respect no matter your presentation, and you are absolutely valid.
Oh, man. You don't have to look or present a certain way to use certain pronouns, so you don't need to look androgynous for they/them. Unfortunately, some people just love to be assholes. Try not to let it get to you and just keep being you :))
[reminds me of this bigender meme](https://www.reddit.com/r/Bigender_irl/comments/q3giuc/bigender_irl/)
I hate people like that. Judging by looks is terrible, and always a huge red flag to me.
Can I do a stabbo?  *Please?*
Tell him he “really isn’t open minded enough” to be talking to you ✋🙄
Androgyny is not the only valid non-binary identity/presentation... the idea of there being one valid form of NB is totally backwards. Even if there was a well-established androgynous archetype, all that means is that there would start being non-trinary people.
I've had a similar experience. This guy I was dating said he wouldn't using he/him for someone without a dick. 

They can fuck off or learn to respect people!
absolute dickhead that's not the point of being non binary 

being nonbinary is how you see your ideal self and no one else should decide that for you
My partner is a femme presenting enby and is as valid as I am as a masc presenting enby. They are free to express themselves as they feel. People just don't get that. We are all valid and it shouldn't matter if I want to be referred to as cupcake. My choice.
Tell them to go fuck themselves.
Being non-binary/ using they them prounouns ≠ being androgynous. Tf?
There's not such thing as ""not androgynous enough"", fuck that cishet and the dysphoria they throw around

You're a light in this world, now go eat crackers 🍘
What a jerk! I hope you dumped his ass.
This guy is a complete a—hole. Dump him. You don’t need to look like his idea of androgynous to have your identity and pronouns respected.
It’s almost like he doesn’t understand androgyny isn’t about how others identify and perceive you, but how you identify and perceive yourself.
That person just sounds like an asshole. Your identity is your own, and can not be determined by another person just because they think you don't look that way enough.
I hate when people say dumb shite like this. A good comeback is misgendering anyone that misgenders you.
You don't owe anyone a goddamned thing.

You are valid.
I feel this. Am amab and hear this more frequently than I’d like. Not femme enough or not trans enough. Without going on estrogen and getting tits I’m just never NB enough
Kick em in the shins
Remember yall: Being Nonbinary doesn't equal androgynous!
His shitty opinion on whether you meet his personal standards for specific pronouns doesn't make you any less valid. He is just an asshole. Next time you see him keep referring to him as she and when he gets angry explain that he isn't masculine enough to have he/him pronouns. Bet he changes his tune real fast
Ahn... do you need to look androgynous to be they/them? Wtf? 😶🤦🏻‍♀️
Don't mind these kind of people. The only thing you need to worry about is how fabulous and awesome you can be 👍
You could be the most conventional ""manly man"" the masciest masc that ever existed. You're still Nonbinary. Its internal not external. That guy is a dick
What does this person do when they encounter a very feminine-presenting man or very masculine-presenting woman? I bet they don't misgender them, so it's probably just an excuse to be a bigot.
I envy the imagination of the binary and the cis.  The things they ""see"" seem so real to them.
I suffer from this too. I feel too feminine to be considered non-binary. What really helps is following other people who are non-binary and present the way I do. It’s really affirming.

Just remember, non-binary has NO look. That’s the whole point of it! :-)
Fuck that dbag
Androgyny is very strict. Like, it’s usually femme white people in all black masculine clothing.
Ugh, hate that. Like, it’s one thing for somebody to perhaps not know your identity or even to know it and mistakingly refer to me in a masc way on a day that I am presenting masc - that’s normal human stuff to me - but for someone to look me in the eyes and essentially just say they reject me??? Thats painful and they just don’t even get it because they can’t fathom a world without comfy boxes, or at least don’t respect me enough to share in my world.
That’s just being a jerkass for the sake of it. He ain’t worth your time
Ok no im pissed at that dude. You don’t owe anyone androgyny and its certainly not your fault if someone misgenders you. You don’t have to “earn” the right to use your pronouns, that’s a ridiculous concept. I hope that that dude isn’t bothering you anymore.
My close friend who is a super woke, poc, queer social worker likes to pull the ""Well you PRESENT masc, so..."" Try maybe gently reaffirming how important it is that you are gendered correctly? A little compassionate but stern conversation can go a long way.
That’s bullshit. You’re free to present yourself in any way you feel comfortable. My partner is non-binary and presents very feminine and uses she/they pronouns, but it doesn’t make her any less non-binary than me. (A very androgynous person who uses they/them/any pronouns) non-binary people come in all shapes and sizes.
There is nothing I can do to look Androgynous. I am doomed to always look female. I have huge boobs and very Fem features. Shaved the sides of my head and wear wife beaters. I'll still look female. 😨😨😨

I feel you. I wish just once someone would be like....
 "" I'm sorry, just can't tell what gender you are.""
Bro, I remember I posted a picture of me wearing an outfit on Instagram and captioned it ""Looking hella androgynous I LOVE IT"" and my ex boyfriend texted me saying that it really wasn't because even by wearing a flannel shirt and a fadora, it doesn't make me androgynous. I was like, ""well what do you consider to be a more androgynous outfit? "" and he said, "" what? No, you can't be androgynous based on clothes. You have to have feminine and masculine features to be androgynous."" And I felt like I lost a few brain cells when seeing that.
Dude someone could be the most feminine/masculine motherfucker on the planet, but if they say they are non binary, then that’s what they are.
Oof, thats what scares me the most about coming out publicly. I really like my beard (it could be a little fuller though, thanks body), I've wanted one since i was like 10 and i absolutely hate my face without it... But it's an instant beard=man...
Sounds like he isn't human enough
Thanks. I really needed to hear that it’s not my fault.
This
Thanks. It was a second date, so maybe “don’t fuck that dude,” is more apropos, lol. 

Thanks, though. For reals. Y’all’s reaction has helped me solidify that I don’t actually need to put up with what doesn’t make me happy.
Word.
Truly, because it doesn't matter how he sees you. If you say you go by they/them pronouns, then you go by they/them pronouns. Full stop. Not up for debate, regardless of how he sees you. I'm sorry this happened to you
I was so glad to realize androgyny was optional, because I have no fashion sense to begin with and didn't want to have to think about buying new clothes or maintaining a hairstyle.
Which is funny, because this guy sometimes goes by she/her and uses the femme form of his given name (think Julio/Julia). I pick up on where he’s at that day and pronoun appropriately, which kind of makes his malfunction over my pronouns even worse.
Moved her to another store instead of firing her? YIKES.
I prefer not to sink to their level. Anyone who can force me to be a violent, cruel person has full control over me, and I refuse to give anything or anyone that control. I stay kind and non-violent because it’s the most fundamental aspect of my identity and ethics.
>>Gonna change his pronouns to was/were. 

I love this!  Thank you!
Right?  Friend of a friend is High Femme as all get out, but my friend still manages to call them by their proper pronouns.
You are so right. I think I just added a new Dating Shit Test, there’s no reason for me to put up with this crap. 

This particular guy was pushing my boundaries anyway, I think this is as good a final straw on the “Nah, I’m good” side of the scales as any might be. Thanks for seeing yourself out, Mr. Misgender, don’t let the door hit ya where the good lord split ya!
Right? Dog knows I’m not gonna….
This is true, but I feel like I want to pick my battles. I’m already the Kind and Patient Poster Child for disability (especially hidden disability like mine often is), sometimes I am just tired of putting on that beatific educator smile and I dowanna.
Oh dang!  I guess there’s reasons he’s an ex, then!
First, it is absolutely in no way whatsoever your fault.

Second, of course you can use they/them, it’s literally and actually NEUTRAL, everyone can use it.

The guy’s a jerk!
Far out, this happened on a date??? What an asshole. You absolutely don't need to put up with why doesn't make you happy. I am quite happily single, but I refuse to let anyone into my social circle that doesn't respect my gender identity (or lack thereof) or the gender identity of any of my friends. 

""I just don't see you that way"" sounds like a them problem, friend.
The fact that this happened on a date is wild. Like yeah dude that's how you convince someone to continue seeing you, disrespect the fuck out of them and then make it seem like it's their fault(which btw it absolutely isn't and you owe no one androgyny which is absolutely not a requirement of being nonbinary). That guy should teach ways to show you're a walking red flag 101.
100% do not fuck that dude. Not worth spending another second of your life on.
Right?  I’m absolutely tragic with clothing and makeup, too, and maintaining a hairstyle just seems like so much work…. I have the tech bro man bun because I’m too lazy to get my hair cut regularly and that’s the easiest way to keep it out of my face.
What the fuck 😭 so it's not even a cis man, they're gatekeeping smh
While I admire that practice, it isn't for me. I am very comfortable asserting myself in any situation. To me, being told to be quiet and kind is giving people power over me. I've been told to behave since I was a child. I refuse. I will defend myself and my friends. You cannot make me accept mistreatment. 


You do not deserve and will not receive my kindness if you are a bigot. 


But I fully understand and respect pacifists. My husband is a pacifist. I love him dearly. But if a bigot was screaming in my face I would not ask for his help to gently talk to them. I would (redacted) 😌
Oh, dude is a straight asshole. The audacity.
YESS, don't put up with ittt! My very much ex boyfriend used to do that all time 🙄 So not worth it. Best of luck in the dating scene!! <3
You should.
I want to start a company for the little ones in the LGBTQ+ community where I tell people to go fuck themselves when they misgender. 

I'm the last of seven children. 
I took shit from no one.

Next time just walk away. They don't want to respect your boundaries, just pretend to be a NPC.
Hey, that's totally fair.
Haha! Yeah! I'm actually really glad we broke up. I started realizing that we weren't that good for each other after out break up. So good thing that's over!
Like wtf is he doing going on a date with someone whos gender he isnt cool with. What a freak
God damn, right? 

No way am I jumping hoops just to get someone else to demonstrate basic human respect. Fuck that.
Wait till that guy learns he's not straight because he's attracted to them
Be yourself. There’s wisdom in asserting your own power and defending yourself / your family / your community as well. All the best.
To clarify, “Friend” is not “Dude who Misgendered Me”. My friend has been super solid with my pronouns all along.
This was in the last two minutes of a date so we parted company pretty much right after this anyway. It’s been really bothering me since then, though. He was so casual, telling me he referred to me as “she” to his friend because I’m not androgynous, and basically blowing off the correction.  Like, non-binary people can have hips and asses and curves, too. It’s just that my curves are non-binary curves, this glorious cleavage is non-binary cleavage, and these “lady parts” aren’t attached to any kind of lady.
To be fair, this guy wasn’t straight before he met me, either. He might need to expand his definition of “bisexual” beyond just “attracted to both men and women”, but he knows he’s 100% not straight.
Same to you!
I meant the person in the original post.
Fair enough. Friendo is pretty rad and I don’t want him mixed up with Mr Misgender. :)"	qntq9p	NonBinary	946	1.0	2021-11-06 05:33:56
Me and my friend baked a cake for a first time in our gay lives! 🥳 Both covered in cream, had lot's of fun and got to come out to my childhood friends 💛🤍💜🖤 Waiting for my native language to form they/them pronouns		"NB: Non-bakery
Looks yummy. What’s your native language?
Awesome cake! Sponge with buttermilk frosting?
Look at that texture. And such delicate thin layers,  perfect colors, beautiful!
Make up your own gender wording in the mean time! Language is made to be changed!
You are going to have some vivid bowel movements. Beautiful cake!
This is so fun.
Oh that looks so yummy!
That cake looks really good 😍😋 Congrats on the coming out!
omg 💕 pls share this recipe i want it for my bday!
beat yah to it on international non binary peoples day. checkmate baker
That looks delicious  :3
That is so awesome!!!!!!!!! May I ask what your native language is?
How fun! And super cool too! Congrats
Looks great! 😋
Let me just say that for a first time this looks immaculate
That cake is gorgeous!! I want to eat it
Such a perfectly done cake!
Gonna make this my pfp
Omg I'm opening a Non-bakery 💜
Thanks, we're pretty proud! My native language is Polish. It doesn't have a they used as singular. In classic example ""Who lost their wallet?"" in Polish unknown person has pronouns he/his
Sponge with mascarpone and cream 💜
Yea, screw this language, I'll have my own!! 😈
Thank you!! 🥳💜
It's polish
I guess a non gendered question might be:

""Who lost a wallet?""

I don't know how that would work out for other uses. (and I don't speak Polish)
Same in Serbian. Ugh. r/needlesslygendered
for spanish, o is masc, a is femme. so i use e (it can sometimes be considered masculine by default, but not always) for german i use o
Yum!
Yes, that form is very natural and commonly used! But there are many other conflicts. Most cases where speaker doesn't know gender of the subject masculine form is used even if not directly. Right now there is a trend to create feminatives everywhere which is supposed to empower women, but it also creates more binary in the language.

Wish me luck, I'm asking my family to use my pronouns tonight.		"My dad was totally okay with it!!!! He actually said he was already thinking about using different terms for me. I'm literally in tears I'm so happy right now. I still have to tell my mom and brother but I think that will be easier.

Thank you everyone who encouraged me and wished me well. I was so horribly anxious about bringing up the subject but yall helped me work up the courage.

My mom was good with it too. I don't think she'll call me her daughter but at least no one is going to use male pronouns and titles for me.
You're so brave and inspiring! I hope it went well!
I wish you luck in your endeavors
Good luck!
Good luck, you got this!
good luck and good for you! i hope it goes well
Good luck 💛
You got this, I believe in you and know that you'll do great!!! ♥️
good luck!!! you’re valid no matter how they respond
Sending good vibes- you got this!
Good luck
Hope all goes well.
Good luck !
Goodluck
Godspeed, dear one.
I hope they are as supportive as you hope they are!
Good luck!!! You’ve got this and remember you have this community that’s here for you💕
Good luck!
Good luck!!
Good luck!! I hope it goes well!
I wish you the best of luck! I haven't even gotten that amount of courage get so I'm proud of you stranger :)
You got this! Good luck, we’ll be here for you :D
Sending love your way, I know you can do this! <3
Congratulations! 🥳
Best of luck! No matter how it goes, you are valid and deserve to be recognized for who you are 💖
<3 AHHHHH I'M SO HAPPY FOR YOU! <3
Good luck! What pronouns do you use so I can validate?
Yayayayayayayayayayay 💚 💚 💚 💚 💚
That RULES, you love to hear it. Happy 4 u, OP!!!
Congratulations!!!!!! 🥰🥰🥰🥰
Congrats!! So happy for you and your family! Also, I had yet to see someone else who identified as both a demi girl (though I'm actually a demi boy) AND bigender so I feel valid now!
Sometimes I don't feel so brave. I struggle a lot with anxiety. I'm glad I'm inspiring though, that always makes me happy to hear. 

It's going well so far. My dad is totally accepting and understanding.
<3
Thanks!
I keep telling myself I do
It's been starting to bug me more and more lately. It's about time I say something.
<3
Thanks! I put on my brave face and talked to my dad about it and all is good. =\]
=\] I know I'm valid but it helps so much when you have people close to you on your side.
Vibes recieved!
Thanks
Me too, hopefully better than when I came out
<3
Thanks!
Thanks for the support!
My dad is at least. I'll see how my mom takes it later today.
This community has given me so much strength and courage, I'm forever grateful for the support from everyone here.
Thank you
Thanks! it's appreciated.
It did go well!
Be brave and proud of yourself, push past that fear.
Thank you
Thanks! Yeah, I spend half my time agender and the other half female. Which makes me gender fluid, bigender, and Demi-Girl by definition. My gender tends to flip fairly frequently so I end up presenting a bit tomboyish to be comfortable.
I understand that feeling! But regardless, the act of coming out is brave! Especially to your family. I'm so happy for you that you took this step!
definitely! you are valid, and you deserve to be heard, both for who you are and on your own terms!

i'm sorry i just saw this, also. i hope it went well. i've been thinking for a long time of coming out to family members, so it means a lot to me to see others doing so.
i know... my immediate family is unsupportive and it really fucks up my mental health
HELL YEA!! I'm happy for u!
An update on this, I came out to my mom last week! It went well :)
That's quite similar to me, except I flip between non-binary and male and both. There's quite a lot of labels for that 😆 I'm also queer and asexual so I never know what flag to get!
My parents weren't always supportive but I've been persistent about presenting and being who I want to be. I gave them the option of being part of my journey or be left behind. Eventually they came around and are now supportive. I know that this is a best case outcome but one should always hope.

Please send some positivity & love , people on insta are bodyshaming / bullying / misgendering me because i use THEY/XE pronouns and I have a body hair I'm comfy with my body I do not wanna shave but cis het men and women will send death threats , bully and HATE because i don't fit in their ideology		"You’re giving me enby envy!
You look incredible, you give me gender envy tbh, don't listen to them they're stupid and awful and block each and everyone of them. You look splendid, don't let them hurt you. ❤️❤️
bruhj they suck, you genuinely look very pretty (not in a femme way but yea) and you're literally give me envy with that hair of yours!
It breaks my heart that such a lovely and kind person is receiving that kind of hate! Keep being yourself friend, you have my support and a whole community behind you. Never forget that and never stop being yourself!!
honey you are perfect the way you are!
You and your pronouns are epic and I wish I looked like you
Hugs, all the hugs in the world
you look great, I'm happy ur happy with not fitting into their binary's :) xxx
Forget them. You’re flawless ✨
You look amazing!! Those people don't know what they're talking about, I love your fashion sense
Man U look amazing and make me feel gender envy don’t listen to them they suck
Only people who are insecure and have no true love or understanding of themselves would hate somone just being themself
 Especially when they look as amazing as you!!
Yoooo. You are handsome and gorg af. Vibes all day in that shirt love
Why should somebody shave?
I, for one, am glad you don't fit in with their hateful ideology. you look terrific and deserve all the happiness 🥰
You look gorgeous! And the hair is serious goals. Keep doing you, because you're.obviously.doing.it.right.
Block 'em. You're pog. You're valid. You have us.
Also, I go by the same pronouns!
The moment I saw you my brain went “that might just be the coolest person I’ve ever seen” your whole vibe is AMAZING. I’m so sorry that people suck, people who have lived their whole lives feeling forced to live in the binary of life (not just gender) hate it when they see others who are stronger than themselves. To be yourself in a world full of people pretending is truly an amazing thing. Also I read energy’s and auras and yours are both very kind and warm :)
You look great and the shirt, accessories and hair style really suit you! Don't pay attention to the haters. Embrace yourself 🤗
i'm sorry what ,, you're absolutely magnificent and your fashion sense is something i aspire to no kidding <3 also neopronouns are great idk how to switch to third person in this comment without sounding weird lol but yeah !! you rock !!
Looking great! They all suck
Rando internet trolls suck, let 'em die miserable and alone. We love ya. Keep looking amazing! <3
Much love 🤗
You look amazing af! I like your necklace. Don't change anything unless you want to. Your body, your choice to shave or not. (Same pronouns here, hi fellow they/xe!)
You look awesome :) love the top
Body hair is beautiful.
So are you.
I like your vibes and style.
Very funky.

You also rock the brow split.
Here are some Rick and Morty quotes. Hope it helps❤️

I’m sorry people on your instagram are hating on you for how you want to express yourself - its completely uncalled for. You look extremely [word of affirmation to your liking (i dont wanna use a word that you’re uncomfortable with)] and how you’re comfortable in your body is phenomenal. Keep trucking along and block everyone that thinks you can’t present how YOU want. All of us here will 100% have your back no matter what. 💛🤍🖤💜

you are giving me big gender envy.

Why must you do this to me :(.
Woah woah, firstly im so sorry you are receiving bullying and death threats that is straight up wrong and they have no respect. Secondly, thank you for being open and visible, people like you help others to feel comfortable and safe in their bodies. And lastly you are VALID, you are LOVED and you are a seriously majestic human.
Dear, you look gorgeous, ignore the toxic people!
I'm so sorry you have to experience that sort of online abuse and harassment. No one should have to.

You keep doing you, no matter how hard they try to bring you down. You're someone that goes against whatever the hell they believe in and live outside of the box they think you belong in. People lash out at others because the internet allows for no real repercussions for online bullying.

Don't worry about them. You're living your best life while they go about their little insignificant lives and that bothers them. You look amazing. You're stylish. You're strong. You got this.I'm here if you need to talk.

p.s ur hair is amazing <3
I'm so sorry they're treating you like that. You look so cool and stunning, body hair and all. You have such a cool style, I really love that shirt.
Don’t be ashamed of having body hair. Everyone has it whether they like it or not. Don’t let the cis hets make you feel bad about being yourself you gorgeous bean
You are gorgeous. Let them be upset about how you don’t fit into a box.
Fuck them, your fly af
You are always valid as you are, and should be able to be comfy in your body!! Come for good vibes whenever and as often as you need to avoid the haters! ❤ sending oodles of positivity ✌
they are such idiots and u are amazing!!! your body hair is beautiful and so are your pronouns. stand by you ❤❤
you look so good
(1) You are honestly a striking human being
(2) Your andro vibes are giving me major inspiration
(3) Nobody knows your body better than you do
(4) Bullying and cut downs are far and away most often an attempt at reactive control because on some level these people feel threatened 
(5) I hope you’re having a good day and my DMs are here for you if you aren’t 🖤
By god you’re handsome 🌻
You look amazing!! Walk away from the haters and don’t look back!
listen to me! you are beautiful just the way you are and nobody has a say in it. if you are worried go to somebody you trust and that you are out to and ask them for help.you are loved and people care about you. live your life baby!
You look awesome. I am jelly!

Also, you looking awesome has nothing to do with your not deserving bullying, no one deserves that. If ever you were to look in the mirror and not like what what you see, you'd still deserve all the good things :)
You look amazing!
I wished I looked like you. You are awesome and your body is yours. Don't let those haters get to you.
You look absolutely wonderful and I'm sorry those ppl are giving you trouble
Fuck the haters! You are fabulous and valid!             💛🤍💜🖤
Woahh you are so attractive!!!
WHATS YOUR IG YOU AMAZING THEMPEROR?!
You are a lovely human being and I’m sending my support and good vibes to you!
Stunnnnning! ✨
WTF you are so beautiful, how can people seriously say that to YOU? And OH MY GOD WHY CAN'T WOMEN AND AFAB PEOPLE HAVE BODY HAIR IT LITERALLY MAKES NO SENSE
Honestly, you just do you!
Bad times are like a rain cloud

Royalty! 🙌🙌. Your style rocks. Keep doing you.
What they say doesn't matter. We are here for you till the end. You are gorgeous.💜 They WISH they were you
im just stupid your amazing so don't take this the wrong way but how do you pronounce xe i wanna know but i hate sounding rude and i feel rude asking

Hi, I'm Jay and this is me 🥰 I'm enby and don't mind any pronouns - this is my first time dressing like this and I've never felt so much like myself ❤		"This is such a cute outfit!
That SHIRT. LOVE. SO COOL.
Your style is incredible 💜

Also, same, that first time getting dressed up, instant “yes, this is it!”
Ayyyy, hi Jay, my name's Bluejay, most people just use Jay though.
Oh daaang! Super cute!! I love your style so much!!
You look great!!! 💕
I love your look! You look absolutely amazing
I love this look!
Hi Jay! This outfit is amazing. Are these cats on the shirt?? Gosh I'm in love with any limited palette outfits but the way this just plays with gender? And your hair? And your *smile*? Glorious, the whole of it.
You look awesome!! :D
You look fantastic （●＾o＾●）
you look incredible! love your confidence so much and i hope you get to dress like yourself more often! :)
YOU ARE SO BEAUTFIUL 😍

That's not what they meant. Just bc they don't mind which pronouns you use doesn't mean all people should let you call them whatever YOU want. Also when someone says they don't mind any pronouns, it probably means switch it up, use a variety of pronouns for them. I should know. I'm Jay's boyfriend

Made a new pronoun pin!		"This is so cute! What is this made out of? It looks like glass over the pin but I can’t tell if the shadows are real or just an eye trick. 😍
I love this 😍😍😍
Looks so good!  I could use one since my glittery genderqueer heart one got lost off my bag!
You should sell these! Would totally buy one if it was the non binary flag.
Oh wow thats really cool!
I LOVE THIS
I love it!!
this looks so good!
This is fantastic!
Cute Pin!
Well done! Love it!
Can I buy one? 😅
Thanks! It’s shrink plastic. I wrote the text with sharpie, baked it, then painted the back.
It looks like the layer behind the glass is painted as the trans flag, and the text is painted on the actual glass.
Thank you!
Thanks! They’re very easy to make if you can find some shrink plastic. I made mine just in time for thanksgiving weekend in Canada.
I’m making genderqueer and non binary flag ones next!
Thanks! 😊
I’m certainly considering making more!
Shrink plastic? Like those shrink he dinks figures they used to have back in the 80s? That still exists? This is awesome! There’s cool if that’s, and yet the text is nice and crisp.
Yeah that’s what I was thinking! I just wasn’t sure if it was actually glass
I hadn't thought about it as an option before but now I REALLY want to make shrink-plastic pins. The pressed pins with layers of plastic and paper on a metal back always fall apart on me eventually.
You're welcome!
Yaaaaas 👌🏻
I hope so, maybe sell them on etsy? Just a suggesting ☺
What a great idea! This would be such a fun easy way to make a bunch of these for various pronouns if you needed them for a gathering or something.
I’ll let you know if I start up an Etsy!

my friend bought some pins for me! the flag isn't known to many people where I live and nobody cares about my pronouns anyways but just having these after so many years of being non-binary makes me feel happy		"I wore a enby pride mask when taking public transport today and yeah its pretty obvious that almost nobody knows what the flag is. To most people it's just a bunch of cool colors I guess. I did notice 1 person staring at it with a big smile on their face though, that felt nice.
[not a phase](http://etsy.me/2iX64Ly)

[nb flag](https://etsy.me/2LH36Ja)

i didn’t see that particular pronoun pin, but there are a ton of great ones on etsy, and never buy from aliexpress because they often do cheap knockoffs of etsy artists without giving them credit
Where can I buy these op?
I love the not a phase one :D
I want all of these.
Yesss
I would like to get ALL of these for my partner. Do you have the link or shop name?
Super cute
the pronouns pin is awesome!!
that's so sweet! I definitely don't expect anyone to recognise what the flag means but I know it always makes me so happy and excited to see anyone wear something I know is pride-related in public, so if I can give anyone that kind of feeling, that'll be more than enough for me :)
my friend said she got them all from AliExpress, she's about to go to bed (she's in NZ) but said she'll try to find links when she gets up :)
I've seen very similar pins on Etsy.
SAME! As a bisexual who follows.....unorthodox religions, this pin fits me so well.
if you check the comment above yours there's links for the flag and not a phase pins, I don't have the exact links my friend used yet (she's still asleep) but I agree with what someone said about how there's very similar ones on Etsy that are even better to buy since you can support small creators that way :)
Thx
Thank you friend! I appreciate that and will definitely check Etsy as well (:"	img4fz	NonBinary	894	1.0	2020-09-04 13:41:06
Or gendered langages in general		"I have the opposite problem, Polish is omega-gendered. We have the third gender, but it’s reserved for objects. “Oh but what if you don’t know the gender of a person you’re referring to?” You use masculine pronouns.

Furthermore!! Polish has one word for sex and gender, which will make it INCREDIBLY HARD to come out to my parents
There's a saying for the Estonian language we use ""no sex, no future,"" cause we don't have neither gendered pronouns or future case (English ""I will"")
Thankfully in hungarian we dont have many gendered words and our only 3rd person pronouns are ő/őt, both of which are gender neutral, so i suppose my language fits here too
Finnish person here, what shocked me more was gendered languages, like italian and german where *everything* has a gender. I would rather disappear into a lake than deal with that, especially while being nonbinary.
Based and finpilled (god I love Finland)
In italian even objects have a gender, articles, adjectives, names... If you talk to someone, even in 2nd or 1st person, you'll almost always gender them or yourself. I don't like it... If you need to talk about a group of people where there are males and females you use male pronouns, so male pronouns are the neutral ones too, but it's not the same as a neutral pronoun in my opinion.
It's not even easy to use new pronouns since you need to chance much more in sentences than just the pronoun
Fucking italian.

The Word ""partner"" is gendered because you need to put ""my"" before and that is gendered. There is no neutral, only suffering
spanish is gendered. literally any word here is genered :'(
Tagalog/filipino as well. They have one word for he/she and generally say kid (anak) instead of son/daughter
Same goes for te reo Māori
So true. Our Hungarian cousins usually use non-gendered pronouns too in day to day interactions.
Same for Turkish! We just use ""O"" for he/she/it/they. Also, subjects are most of the time altogether dropped from the sentence because we alter verbs based on the subject, meaning we already understand the subject from the verb which makes using the subject redundant.
Same for Persian, god i love this language
WE MUST CREATE NON-BINESE
yooo that's me :D blessed to live where the language has no pronouns🥰
One of the reasons I love ASL is it’s pronouns have no gender. She/he/they(singular) are all the same sign. Weirdly enough, the word “cousin” is gendered though. But you can easily adjust it. Male cousin is signed on top of face, female cousin is signed bottom half of face, enby cousin could be signed in the middle
Polish is soooo gendered and I'm sooo sad about it
Türk tilliri ftwwwwwww 💪
Same in Chinese, one word for sex & gender, when don’t know someone’s gender, we use masculine pronoun too, and I really HATE it
sometimes I hope enby folks can create a new language just because of that
Mood
Same in Dutch (tho we have recently adopted the word ""gender"", but it's used in queer contexts only.)
And that's where we go and borrow some gender neutrality from Silesian grammar 😂
Exactly the same for french BUT there is no gender neutral, object are either ""male"" or ""female"" . 
A gender neutral pronoun was officially recognized not long ago, iel, but apart from some queer people, people don't use it
> no sex, no future


Yooo you talking about me??
Out of pure linguistic curiosity, how do you make plans?
All three are Uralic languages so that makes sense!
magyar a legjobb nyelv :p
German here. My language makes me furious. Please show me the nearest lake to hide in.
This is why Finnish is a beautiful language. I was looking for a new language to learn and dabbled in a few but Finnish is the one I am sticking with. I like how it sounds and gendered languages melt my brain. 

If you want true gender chaos look at French.
But ""le"" is used as object pronoun for all genders, I guess that's something.
At least the gendered pronouns sound the same
Same in German, we just say Geburtsgeschlecht for sex instead which literally means birth gender
> I hope enby folks can create a new language

r/tokipona doesn't have any gender marking!
Did you know 他 *was* gender-neutral at one point? (That's why it has the 亻radical and not 男 .) That's what makes it even worse.
Omg really?! I've never heard of that. Could you give an example or a source, cause I can't find anything
Śląsk has gender neutrality???
Could you use “on” as a gender neutral pronoun?
You use the present tense and just use other words to clarify what you mean. Like for example:
""Homme ma lähen tööle ja olen tööl kogu päeva""
""Tomorrow I go to work and stay at work all day""
It sounds strange in English but in Estonian everyone will get what you mean. Even in English it's not that confusing
Yeah, what they said. Instead of saying ""I will go to work"" you'd say ""I am going to go to work."" It truly does sound better in Estonian, I swear haha
Jó kis nyelv, csak bonyolult nagyon :v
As a native, it doesn't feel that pretty to me anymore lmao but the neutral pronouns do help a little. Though I can say that if you do want to learn Finnish, it's a hard language to learn! A lot of words that would be used in English just get turned into weird post-fixes into the main word. I have no idea how people learn it, but good luck if you try!
In ""standard"" spanish that only works for indirect objects.   


""Le escribí una carta"" = ""I wrote a letter TO him/her/them""  


VS  


""Yo lo conozco"" = ""I know him"" / ""Yo la conozco"" = ""I know her""  


Some people now use ""Elle"" as a neutral third person pronoun, and ""le"" as a neutral direct object pronoun, but like singular they in English, most people don't know it or outright refuse to use it. Even I as an enby find it hard to get used to it.
And soziales Geschlecht (Social gender) for gender :) to differentiate from sex
yeah, and I tried to use”他” on everyone for a long time, until I realized most people don’t see it as a gender-neutral pronoun. Like many people consider the word “man” only means male man, it’s really frustrating. 
Being Influenced by western culture, The Chinese character that means “she” (她) was created in early 20th century, then we need a Chinese character means “he”(男也）too
It's not super common yet, I've mainly read about it/seen ppl using it online, though I've experienced it few times in real life as well, but only in queer safe spaces. It's just nonbinary ppl refering to themselves by saying ""Jo kupiłom"" instead of ""Ja kupiłam/kupiłem"", stuff like that.

This article talks about nonbinary polish language, it showcases many different ways but also the Silesian one: https://zaimki.pl/korpus

And here's an interview with a nonbinary person who uses Silesian grammar: https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.wysokieobcasy.pl/wysokie-obcasy/7,157211,28926879,kae-tempest-dwa-lata-temu-zrobilom-coming-out-jako-osoba-niebinarna.amp

I'm assuming you're Polish as well, if you just type in ""Jo zrobiłom"" in google, you should get some more info on that.
Śląsk ma wszystko 😤 But yeah, it's been in use by some Polish nonbinary ppl for at least few years now, you can just Google ""Jo zrobiłom"" and find articles talking about it.
Technically yes but it would feel unnatural. ""On"" designates an undeterminate person (not as, ""there is someone but we are lacking info about them"", but more, x someone somewhere, maybe a group of people...""). However it is most commonly use instead of ""nous"" which is ""we"" in French.
That s why ""Iel"" being a mix of il and elle was invented.
Hope I m helping ☺️
I get ya!  That's fascinating and makes total sense.  Context clues help a ton I imagine.  Thank you for the answer!
Sajnos igen, tanulni próbálok de ez nehéz
Thanks for the warning. I thought it being rather difficult was a me thing. It's motivating to know it's just a true thing
but its only used for those instances tho, there is no gender neutral pronoun at all, and every profession or stuff like that is mainly genered
Is that a northern german thing? I have never heard that word even once
Oh, I actually use this form, just with normal ""ja"". Had no idea it has roots in Silesian. That's so cool. Thanks for explaining

ŚLĄSK MA WSZYSTKO 😤🤣🤣 

But what about 3rd person? “Ono Zrobiło?”
I knew it was more plural but I wasn’t sure. I’m trying to improve me French so thank you so very much.  Is lel pronounced like lelle?
I’m in western Austria actually
Good bot! I tried to do that with the link but it'd only let me copy the google result for some reason 😂
Look, I'm not a silesian expert, it works for first person and that's great already 🤣 I imagine it could be that, or ""oni zrobili"", depending on the person's preference.
Exactly how you would pronounce the word ""yell"" ☺️
Then it's an Austrian thing ig
Again thanks
I think it has more to do with my progressive leftist queer bubble haha
No worries always here to help☺️
fair enough, in my former group we just said gender because a person's sex was irrelevant to us

my older brother found my pronoun badge...	"Context: my older brother, he's pretty...right wing I'd say. He likes conservatives, throws slurs around like there's no tomorrow, has a questionable ""sense of humor"" and all that jazz. (This happened on the 5th of November but I can't stop thinking about it and especially his reaction) 

Me, him, my older sister and my older sisters friend was cleaning the house because we were going to have like a get together kinda thing. My older sisters friends were coming over for fireworks, a bon fire, and drinks to chill.

So, we were cleaning and my little sister, about 10 minutes before what happened next, was looking through my jacket pockets (a jacket I wore everywhere) and in there was a small-ish, metal pin that just had ""they/them"" on it that I got from pride earlier in the year. 
I wore the pin when I wasn't at home, so when I went out with friends, or went to school, I wore that pin. (Wasn't that safe to wear it in school but I liked the fact that it pissed people off but I digress). 

So, while looking for whatever she was looking for, she pulled everything out of my pockets. And my pin was one of them. She didn't put anything that she took out of my pockets back in my jacket and she left it on the stairs. 
My older brother was cleaning near the stairs and he found my pin.
 He just shouted loudly ""who's pin is this?"" Because all you could see was the back of it, not what was on the front. 
I had also been preparing a lie to tell anyone in my house if they found the pin. Saying it's a friend of mines and I took it from them and I'm waiting to see if they notice. 

He picks the pin up, saw what was on it, and shouts (again) 
""why the fuck does someone have a (t slur) pin?"" 
And I just felt like I couldn't breath. My little sister didn't help either, accidentally letting it slip that it came from my jacket pocket. 
He looks over at me and asks the question again. I told him the lie I was practicing. 
""It's my friend's. I took it and I wanna see how long it will take them to notice I have it"".
And to that, he just said
""Good, cause I'm not having a gender queer sister""
I took it from him and I felt sick to my stomach, but I hid it and continued cleaning. 

We haven't spoken about it since. (I thought I lost the pin but I just found it >:) )"	"Sorry this happened to you. My older sibling was not very supportive of me. I won’t project my experience on to yours, but I’ll share a thought : you’re you no matter what any family member says can or cannot exist.
[deleted]
first reaction: f him in particular for using those words as his ""sense of (very shitty) humor""

second reaction: are you safe where you are because if not I'm sure some of the others here have amazing resources that can at least get you connected with some people who aren't as closed minded as a concrete slab 

third reaction: (coming from a thankfully accepting family view which I feel bad sometimes that not everyone has had that same thing...) 

Fuck it, be yourself and if they don't like it they can suck it up and either realize how stupid being a one minded person is or they can get out because there's more to life than being a biggoted waste of breath.

Hope you're okay OP
*hugs*
Your brother sounds like a real POS. At the very least radicalized beyond basic decency of humanity.

Do your sisters share his perspective? Are you safe or comfortable speaking with them about this? Is he an anomaly or the norm within your family?

Beyond all this: your chosen family of your peers does and will support you throughout your life. Sharing a bloodline with someone does not make their opinion on anything important. Especially when they are bigoted. 

You, in whatever core self you hold to to true, are valid. You are real. You are trusted. You are loved. You deserve to exist, openly and honestly. You also don’t owe anyone an explanation at all, ever. 

I’m so sorry you had to experience OP. You’re dealing with trauma, and that’s very real. Know you are not alone ♥️
That sounds terrifying, I'm so sorry this happened. Stay safe and remember this is a reflection of your brother's shittiness and not the treatment you deserve from family or anyone else.
Even though this happened a month ago, I give you full permission to beat his ass the next questionable thing he says.
Sorry you had to deal with that; what an asshole.
He knows nothing of your situation. His words are empty when he hasn't lived a day in your life. You know who you are.
That’s not family worth keeping. Sincerely, someone who left theirs
hi there, im so sorry this happened to you. it’s a very gut wrenching place to be in, and i totally understand as i also come from a SUPER conservative family. publically, i have been out and using they/them pronouns for about 3ish years, but personally to my direct family, i don’t think it’s worth it to come out and try to make them understand. While I totally support the option of fully being yourself around anyone, even your fam; I also support staying quiet about it to them. i, personally find it very harmful to be in a toxic situation like that. My method of coping (though it might not be the best tactic), is to just let it lie. The time may come where it is safe to be your true self, but right now it seems like is isn’t. Confide in your younger brother and sister, but stay safe. I really hope this isn’t the same for you, but i don’t think i will ever come out to my parents. for me, it’s not worth the arguments, the guilt trips, and the mental trauma, to try to explain it to people who are literally unwilling to understand. they don’t define you, as much as they would like to. no matter what happens, everything is a learning experience and a chance to grow. you’re an incredible individual with an incredible life. stay strong, stay safe, friend ♥️
Place a thumbtack in the front seat of his car, and wait for him to notice~
Hey! I have a very similar experience. My brother has pretty awful mental issues and was very susceptible to the alt right pipeline. I’ve dealt with many yelling matches over the years bc eventually (probably after leaving home) you will want to come out. You’ll get through this and I know from experience that hearing “it gets better after high school” doesn’t help but- it DOES get better! If your brother doesn’t want to support you, you have the right to not be around him. Ultimately it’s his fault if your relationship suffers, but it’s a better alternative than you suffering in silence. I hope you get to leave and live your truth!
All I’m saying is hammers and kneecaps were meant to be together
i’m so sorry 😣 i hope you find a more loving environment soon ♥️♥️♥️
It sucks, but at least you know where you stand with him and are still relatively safe.
When he later asks why you cut him off, just remind him of those words.
He's absolutely right. He won't have a genderqueer sister. He won't have you as a sibling at all with his attitude, because you, a nonbinary person, won't be in his life when you are old enough to make that choice.

*Editted for grievous lack of proofreading
All I hope is that he changes the way he thinks in general. I can't understand why people have such hatred in their heart for someone they don't even understand and know nothing about how they feel.
This hurts my heart and soul for you😔. I'm super sorry that you have to hide who you are with the people who should be the most supportive of you and who you really are. 🫂 We don't get to choose the families we're born to, but at least we can choose who we keep, and who we make our family with as we grow older. You are loved and you are always accepted somewhere, I'm just sorry that your home isn't your safe place.
Throw the whole brother away.
Well he can fuck RIGHT off with that bullshit.
I'm so sorry. What a prick.

Hopefully you'll be able to safely live on your own someday and be rid of him.

Until then, stay strong. 💖
I'm so sorry your parents other child is an asshole.

 You matter and you're valid no matter that bullshit comes out of his mouth. You deserve people who will do more than the bare minimum of supporting and respecting you, but will also celebrate you, and you'll eventually find it when you can move out and can cut contact with anyone who chooses to use the bar for bare minimum for limbo practice.
He deserves to step on legos the rest of his life.
That's absolutely fucking horrifying, all I can hope is that he comes to his senses soon enough and grows up
one hell of a wanker. i can’t exactly sympathise with you- the worst I’ve had it is that my mum cannot understand my gender because she believes that gender = sex rather than gender ≠ sex and she says she will not ever understand being nb. oh well, it’s not her fault. 
you have my best wishes and i hope everything gets sorted out soon. your brother is a piece of shit. :D
Ah almost none of my family is supportive either, a lot of them use slurs and talk about how non-binary is “made up” and “not real”. I don’t talk to any of them anymore but it still sucks that the people that are suppose to love and care about you won’t accept the real you
I Hope you have supportive people in ur life and if you don’t I’m here for u <3
Sorry but I would’ve clocked him in the jaw the second that slur came outta his mouth- wouldn’t even let him finish his sentence. I can’t stand that shit. I’m so sorry about your situation :(
I hope you get the support you need, and sorry the way this happened ❤️
i feel your pain and fear so deeply and it sounds so painful, especially when it’s coming from someone you’re presumably around so often. i just need you to know there are so many people who support the hell out of you and love you so much. there are subreddits if you’d like them where you can speak to someone for parental advice and affirmations (i don’t remember the names but can go get them) and i always tell myself when it comes to shitty family that you know their arguments and beliefs aren’t based on reality, most of them  are based of their perception of religion and easily digestible arguments. they aren’t putting in effort for you and aren’t open minded so don’t waste your time, use that time building up yourself and your chosen and found family. sorry for the ramble it’s 2 am and my brain is shortcircuiting from tiredness so i don’t know if anything i said made sense 😭 i just want you to know you aren’t alone out there and it will get better, and i know that that’s such an unsatisfying answer to so much pain but you just need to tough everything out for as long as it takes to leave such a hostile environment. you’ll always find people who will love you so much (jesus christ this paragraph is a mess)
What an asshole. I’m sorry that happened. I’m in a similar situation and I’m just waiting to be older so I can move out
I am really sorry that this happened to you. I hope you have people you do feel safe around and show you respect. Take care of yourself.
DAMN- with the ""Good, cause I'm not having a gender queer sister,"" that just hurts dude. Hope things end up in your favor.
He be acting like he owns the house and you owe him or smtg? This guy doesn’t know his place. He be acting like Iran Islamist police with his pseudo conservative American “values” that are nothing but oppressive. I’m sorry you have to deal with him.
I’m sorry your brother is trash. I know how hard it can be with family. My one set of grandparents just told me “You’re still our grand daughter” and went on to say “All this weird new stuff, what happened to just gay or straight”. That sucked and all but not as bad as half my family being “accepting” but still only uses she/her and daughter/aunt/woman and it almost hurts more.
Wow that dude sounds like a fucking loser
your older brother is a hoe!
Dm me his address. I wanna have a long discussion.
How old is he?
My toxic trait is wanting to fistfight people like your brother; it would be nuclear war in my household if a sibling or parent of mine were blatantly homophobic.
Share ur experiences if you're comfortable, that's the point of this subreddit, love. Take care of urself <3
Sadly, I can't exactly cut him out. We live under the same roof atm. Can't wait to move out so I can literally never talk to any of them ever again lol. Thank you so much, take care of urself <3
Thank you so much! Take care of urself!  <3
My older sister doesn't share his views, she tries to be accepting when she can. I came out to her a little while ago and we haven't spoken about the whole non binary thing since. 

I'd never come out to my family, they wouldn't exactly kick me out (even though that sounds great tbh) but they would never call me they/them. I have a trans younger brother and no one called him he/him accept for me and his twin sister. I told my little brother about me being non binary and that was kinda it. We don't talk about that kinda stuff in my house. (My mum literally justified herself for misgendering my little brother by saying ""that will always be my little girl"" or something). 

Just thought I'd share, I couldn't stop thinking about it. 
On the bright side, it's a tie for positive and negative coming out's lol. 

Thank you so much, take care of urself <3
> At the very least radicalized beyond basic decency of humanity.

This is the major fucking problem. People like him aren't turning out like this in a vacuum. They've been molded by propaganda to spread hate and be hateful, told lies about LGBTQ people, just to generate an overzealous voter base that'll never consider switching sides and fight against us until the death.

He might be a POS but he's an expected result from what we've seen in conservative news.
Thank you so much! Means a lot to me <3 take care of urself
That's easy, I only have to wait about 40 seconds 😅
Thank you so much <3 means a lot. Take care of urself!
Well done for leaving urs, can't wait to leave mine. They've done nothing but cause trauma, pain and guilt 😊 
Take care of urself <3
I totally understand, I will never come out to all of them. And I completely agree, don't come out until you're comfortable and safe. Stay safe, take care of urself <3
He doesn't drive 😭 but he does have like a gamer chair >:)
On the bright side, we don't have a relationship to loose 😅 thanks tho. Take care of urself <3
I was going to say I’ll come punch him the face.
What a sweet, sweet crack
Thank you so much <3 take care of urself
Yepp, and thank fuck for that. Take care of urself <3
He wonders why we literally never talk
He won't even have a sibling the way this is going 😅 thank you so much, take care of urself <3
I think that's why he had that hatred, because he doesn't understand. But he has so much hatred that you can't make him understand. We both hope for the same thing. Take care of urself <3
Thank you so much, that was so sweet. Take care of urself <3
If he's trash, that poor bin
Dick head exit is that way ↪️
You too <3 take care of urself

Thank you so much, I hope everything works out for you too. Hugs are being sent, take care of urself <3
Yeah, it really sucks. Very suffocating. Hope you're doing well <3 take care of urself
Thank you so much! <3 same goes for you! Take care of urself
I'm used to the slurs at this point, as sad as it sounds. Thank you, take care of urself <3
Thank you so much <3 take care of urself
Omg, thank you so much 😭♥ sending hugs <3 take care of urself
Me too, watching the days go past ready to leave :) gays against the world! See you on the other side. Take care of urself <3
Thank you so much, you too! <3
Honestly, it didn't hurt me that much. Frankly, that's the nicest thing I thought he'd say.
Yep, pretty much. Take care of urself<3
He's the mum of the guy who threw the paper! He a hoe!
Nice long chat, over a coffee
29...and I'm 16
Can ur family adopt me? I'm queer, non binary and I can be a great domestic mf. And I don't take up much space
I'm guessing your parent/s aren't much better?

This isn't something you can have a parent talk to him about, right? Like quit throwing hate around under their roof
It gets better. (Hugs)
nah dont put it on his chair, hide it in one of his shoes for extra damage
Oh god, typos. 🤦‍♀️ so sorry. Fixing.
Yeah, it's sad to think about but only hope. You take as well!
thanks, you too my friend :)
You too! :)
Definitely has a ton of growing up to do. Know that people who hate themselves and their lives can’t stand people who are authentically happy. If you feel like he would hurt you if he found out, I would definitely have a safety plan. Door locks, hiding weapons, having a way to escape etc. Call the cops if he ever threatens you or becomes aggressive. I would look online for local resources like a safe space for trans folx. If you can’t find it in person I recommend online. Talking to a professional social worker or counselor would if possible would be ideal. You don’t have to engage with him. I don’t know the situation well enough to know if he would be violent but your safety is priority. Otherwise I would avoid him until he leaves or you leave. He definitely needs some help.
My mum is one of those mums who's like ""supportive"" so a bunch of Facebook mums are like ""omg, you're so brave"" or whatever. And my dad's a Catholic so you can guess where that goes.

As really bad as it sounds, I've already looking into that kinda stuff. I was always uncertain of my gender but had my proper identity crisis during quarantine. I've seen that he isn't very fond of my little brother but he hasn't physical done anything to him really, he's just scared him but even then he hasn't done that since social services have been involved with my family. Idk if that's because of my trans little brother or because both him and my older brother have mental issues that go alone with it but I digress. When I figured out that I might not be a cis and I thought, I panicked. So I came up with safety plans incase well, anyone in my family found out. They're pretty big mothed individuals.

It's the older generations of my family that are the most difficult, but some of them are kinda turning around but it's only for my little brother. For Christmas, it warmed me that all my family got him ""grandson"" and ""son"" and ""nephew"" and ""brother"" Christmas cards. But my older brother didn't sign his brother Christmas card, it just had the rest of our names in it. 

Thank you so much <3 I really appreciate it :) take care of urself!
Hmm... You think your mum would get him to stfu? Like ""if you're supportive, why dont you tell so and so he can't talk shit under your roof""

I buzzed my hair yesterday and I feel like myself for the first time in ages (18 any pronouns)		"Yoy look so cool!!! The style suits you well!!!
You look empowered and amazing!
Wow, it really suits you 💖
You look fierce. Also, your skin is amazing.

The pictures look like different people. THATS SO COOL!
Hyvältä näyttää! ❤
YESS I love this - more people need to feel the liberation of a shaved head, it’s the favourite thing I have done in so long and you look amazing 💕💕
You rock the look. I've had my hair cut short (until lockdown made me go months without a trim again) but I still feel the need to *shave. It. Off.*
It looks amazing! Congrats!
YEssss so good!
YEssss so good!
looks good :)
Yes! Doesn't it feel great? I've been shaving my head since the day I graduated high school ten years ago. I use razors from dollar shave club and feel it's too long by the time it's three days long. And somehow I STILL have hair dreams! You look so good btw!
You look so cool and handsome!!!
YOU LOOK FINE AS HELL LET'S GO
💜💜💜💜
Looks stunning!! I wish I could pull of a buzzcut like you but I probably look like a toe
Badass Warrior Monarch!
I love your shirt!!!
Holy power stance. The set jaw, the determined look... fire.
Such a good look for you!

Thank you! :) It does feel amazing!
Thank you so much! :)
Thank you! :)
Thanks! :) I had some doubts about if I'll be able to pull it off before I did it, but I went for it anyway and I'm really happy with it now that I did it. The best way to know if it looks good is just to do it. One thing I did do before was wear a wig cap, it's not exactly the same, but the closest thing I had that kinda gives an idea of how it looks like.
Thanks! :)
Thanks!

TIL about something called mirror pronouns	"And I absolutely love it! It's usually for people that are comfortable with any pronouns, and when talking to a person they'd rather the person uses their own pronouns to refer to them.

For example, I'm talking to a guy, so he should use he/him for me, if I talk to someone with neopronouns, xe should use xe/xir for me and the list goes on. 

It's such an interesting idea and for any Latin languages it kind of fixes the struggle with gendered language (at least in my case)"	"What if two people who want mirror pronouns are talking to each other? 🤯
This seems like an elaborate plot to have my pronouns stolen by the fae /j
id never heard of or thought of this before, but what a cool concept! i hope it becomes more popular, tysm for sharing :)
It's also grammatically correct, though disused it was once appropriate to substitute your own pronouns when the subjects gender was unknown. While I like the idea of mirror pronouns I also very much don't vibe with he/him
Ok I kinda wanna use these but honestly I feel like it would be so confusing to the people around me that it's not worth bothering. (Conservative area)
I can get the feeling behind this. I don't want men to view me as a woman, and I also don't want women to view me as a man. Often I feel like what happens for me is that both men and women view me as an other. Maybe it would help people view me as part of their group for once if they used their own pronouns for me too? I feel like that's the logic here?
But 3rd person pronouns are most often used when you're talking *about* someone, not when you're talking *with* them. When you're talking with someone usually 1st & 2nd person pronouns are used.

So it doesn't make sense to me to base the mirror on who you're talking with so much as basing it on who is talking about you.

So if you are talking with A (she/her), while B (they/them) & C (he/him) are in a different room talking about you, it would go: 

 > B: Bit and I were talking about linguistics the other day and they told me the coolest thing.  
 > C: What did he say?  
 > B: They said something about... about... ah, I can't remember the details, sorry.  
 > C: Cool story, sib. I'll ask him myself next time I see him.

For A to use your mirror pronouns it would have to be more like 

 > A: There you are, Bit! I've been sitting here asking myself 'When is she going to show up?' B & C are meeting up over there, and you know they're going to botch a story about your linguistic adventures, and he'll will want to hear it from you directly. 

What I want to know is how it works when the storytelling gets more complex. Is it 

 > C: Ok, so B was telling me that he [Bit] had some cool linguistic facts to share.  
[mirroring C's pronouns because C is talking]

Or

> C: Ok, so B was telling me that they [Bit] had some cool linguistic facts to share.  
[mirroring B's pronouns because, even though C is talking, he's relaying what B was saying about Bit]
I like this idea. I like that it would work great for some people who, like me, experience that their own gender identity differs in relation to different people. The issue for me would be that I usually experience it as *different* from the other person's gender. But maybe you could come up with a system for that too, like maybe people could use anything *but* the pronouns they use for themselves.
My mind was blown (in a good way) the first time I saw someone use these! Pretty cool concept!
That actually sounds like it could really work! It's a great idea!

Mind you, at work I got my birth pronouns used a little too much, so I had to insist a little on Mx. as a preferred form of address, so ymmv.

Let us know how it works out!
Do I resonate with this? It's possible
This is really interesting and cool, I freaking love it.
 Do you have any sites or sources of information about this that you could share? I would love learning more about mirror pronouns. 
And them being used in heavily gendered language such as latin ones is awesome (Spanish is my native L).

Anyways, thanks for sharing this with us. :D
People do this to me a lot for some reason. (trans lady, she/her, I appear relatively andro) All the ladies call me ""sweetie"" or ""honey"" and men be hitting me with ""bro"" or ""man"" at the end of every conceivable sentence. Nb people always clock me as nb as well. I swear if I walked into any large room of people that were all the same gender, they would start chanting ""one of us, one of us""
~~So Since I Usually Refer To Myself With I/Me Pronouns, Should I Use Those For You?~~

Actually What's Pretty Funny Is I Once Made A Set Of Neopronouns That Sounded Pretty Similar To English Second-Person Pronouns, So This Would Make Those Especially Confusing Haha.
That is SO FASCINATING!! Making the gender of a pronoun reflect ones own gender, rather than the person you’re referring to. Is there currently a language that does that?
I love this!
That's pretty neat I should say 😀
That's interesting
So we’re just gonna refer to ourselves in the 3rd person now? 💀 seems a bit infantilizing tbh
This sounds like a personality disorder, and I don't mean that as an insult. Like your identity is dependent on who you're with.
why
...imma start using this... this sounds like fun.
You know I’ve really been thinking about this a bit lately. I’d almost say it feels like codeswitching? But there’s still a lot of sincerity in it. My outfit for the day also really plays into my internal gender vibes.
This is so accurate!!
What happens when two people using this system want to talk to each other
mirror pronouns are cool but i just don’t vibe with she/her so it’d be different rules for different people. also in a group setting that would be a little chaotic but i live for that
I think then the top picks the pronouns.

A infinite loop throws a stackoverflow error.
So many joking answers but my brain just went to names. Just go by names.
""TheBitsiestBit"" sounds like a fae name too so I feel like you're on to something 🤨
I mean they already stole my gender, or at least most of it, so.
Lol
I like it mostly on Latin languages, as I said. It's very hard because the languages are HEAVILY gendered. If I want to say ""I'm tired"" I'll have to use a gendered word for ""tired"", and everyone talking to me referring to me will also do the same. (""are you tired?"" would be gendered too) 

 So instead of doing a workaround of using passive voice (""I feel tiredness"" in this specific case) a person can just mirror the person talking to them.
For your last point, that is a moot point. 

When referring to A: She/Her is the only appropriate pronouns no matter who is using them. 
For B: They/Them is the only correct option no matter the person. 
For C: He/Him is the only choice no matter who uses them. 
For D (mirror pronouns) I would think it would be ""I was talking to Sam the other day and (he/they/she, based on who is talking) said..."" 

Note: I simplify it by just asking pronouns to use and then respect it. If I am told to use mine, I will refer to that person as They/Them as those are mine. 

Example in use: Ash said that they just got some great news but it is a surprise. I don't know what it could be but I am excited for them. 
My partner (he/him) would say the same but replace they with he, and them with him.
I think you could do it absolute self referential with the exception of direct quotes? Context dependent pronouns have been a thing for a long time in terms of trans people who are not out yet.

For example. A uses he/him, B uses she/her, and C uses they/them, but has only told B and does not feel comfortable with other people including A knowing yet, so in front of other people, C uses he/him. So in a private convo, A uses they for C. If A and B are talking about C, both will use he. If B goes back and tells C about the conversation, should B use they them, because the two of them are alone now, or he him because she's directly quoting A? It probably isn't super important, but I've been in this scenario so it does happen, but I can't remember what I did 😅 it have been random.
That would be insanely confusing. Pronouns are supposed to simplify language

Wow imagine thinking pronouns are supposed to complicate language. You know what words are for right? Your pronouns are not supposed to communicate who *someone else* is, that's objectively insane.
I saw it [here](https://en.pronouns.page/mirror), and yes, for my native language it feels amazing too. A great alternative since older people are so resistant on using neopronouns
I haven't said anything about third person?

Let's say A uses he/him, B uses she/her and C uses mirror pronouns

A: C is my friend, he went out with me last week
B: oh that's great. I met C yesterday and she looks like a fun person to be around.

---

In Latin languages though (Spanish, Portuguese, Italian, French) talking about yourself in active voice is very gendered. I'll use the same example I always do. ""I am tired"", ""tired"" is gendered (""cansado"" for masculine, ""cansada"" for feminine) and trying to avoid gendered language is a huge hassle, almost impossible. Mirroring pronouns (If I'm talking to someone who uses he/him I'll use masculine language about myself, ""I'm tired"" as in ""cansado"", and if I'm talking to a person who uses she/her pronouns I'll use ""cansada"") seems like a great idea for non-binary people in a similar situation.
Yeah that’s really messed up
I SAID WE GIRLS TODAY
So if ""biggest dick tops"", does that mean ""biggest dick picks pronouns""?
Error: varPronoun expects a value of type string. Provided value null is invalid.
> You
That’s not a great solution bc pronouns are supposed to make language smoother in a way that repeatedly using names does not. It’s why we invented them in the first place.
Oh no you found out my ploy to steal everyone's pronouns!! Too late, I already have a pile of them anyway
A lot of Latin people use e' instead of the ""a, o, x""
We are in agreement about how people with constant pronouns should be referred to, and also in agreement about how someone with mirror pronouns should be directly referred to (by mirroring the pronouns of the person who is talking about them).

Based on your examples, I think you missed the purpose of my last point: which pronouns to use when talking about what a 3rd party said about the person with mirror pronouns.

Example: When Andy (she/her) is talking about Cody (he/him) and says that Cody said something about Bit (mirror), does Andy use her own pronouns for Bit, or does she use Cody's pronouns for Bit *for the part where she is saying what Cody said about Bit*?
I like this answer. So when Person 1 tells Person 2 what Person 3 said about Person 4 (mirror):

 - if Person 1 is quoting what Person 3 said and Person 3 mirrored their own pronouns in their comment about Person 4 --> Person 1 mirrors Person 3's pronouns to refer to Person 4 because that's exactly what the quote was

 - if Person 1 is just paraphrasing/summarizing what Person 3 said --> Person 1 mirrors their own pronouns to refer to Person 4 because it's not a direct quote so ""absolute self referential"" applies

Plot twist: Persons 1, 2, & 3 all use they/them pronouns, so when they're quoting them, they're using their pronouns for them, and when they're summarizing them, they're using *their* pronouns for them. 

[Not mocking, just enjoying the complexity. My own pronouns are they/them.]
Ive thought about this and I think I would feel very uncomfortable if someone asked me to use my own pronouns to refer to them just because **I** use them. It feels like someone is basing their identity off of mine and I absolutely do not vibe with that. I do not want to play a part in how others identify or want to be addressed, and I disagree with the idea of having to use certain pronouns for someone else because of my own identity. It rubs me the wrong way.
Im French, this still sounds ridiculous to me sorry
That could work, though I think an ""Invader Zim"" style of Tallest would be simpler.
my dick is the biggest, u just have to use your imagination
Yes, and yet there's still a massive pushback against it in society. In a group job interview (for a very trans friendly business btw) someone said ""hello all (todos), all (todas) and all (todes)"" and even being a trans friendly environment half of the room laughed at the ""absurdity"" of a gender neutral word. Not only that, for the same reason some people might dislike ""they"" in English to refer about oneself, some non-binary people might not want to use neopronouns for themselves, and yet we still don't have a non-gendered way other than neopronouns to speak in our language.

In fact, most non-binary people I know living in my country struggle often with language because the majority of people I know that are non-binary (including me) don't like using e for themselves. Sounds a little clunky, forced.
A) If you are talking about Andi, use she/her.

B) If you are talking about Cody, use he/him.

1a) If Cody is talking about Bit, he will use he/him.

1b) If Andi is talking about Bit, she will use she/her.

1c) If Sam (they/them) is talking about Bit, they will use they them. 



For your 3rd example: 

Andi would say: ""I was talking to Cody and he was telling me that Bit got some amazing news and she is exited but wants it to be a surprise. I am happy for her""

Cody would replace she/her with he/him.

Sam would replace with they,/them.



See my example of my partner and I.

Imaginary dicks work too
Interesting, I always heard ""x"" was what felt forced and ""e"" was a sort of compromise I've heard from nonbinary Latines. What do you and your friends like to use for yourselves?
My personal option is much easier. Everyone is they/them unless I am told otherwise.
X is really awful for speaking, yeah, but at least in my language ""he"" doesn't match the gendered rules of using ""a for female, o for male"", since someone missed the memo when making the language. She is ""ela"", he is ""ele"", so I see people online using ""elo"" for neutral they. 

Most of the ones I know (and the non-binary people I spoke to up until now are around my age or older so I can't say anything about millenials or younger people) tend to pick masculine/feminine exclusively but explain to people their situation, or switch gendered language around when they feel like it, or just use he/him since the default in mixed gender groups is to use masculine. (idk if French works similarly, if you have a group of exclusively female friends it's ""amigas"", if it's exclusive male it's ""amigos"", if it's a mix between male and female friends it's still ""amigos"")

I'm mostly the last example, but in languages like English I'd rather stay with they/them. I will still use the new ""e"" language for people that prefer to be referred like that, but not using neopronouns for ourselves is probably just a choice based on what we're used to, or just not wanting to go through the massive stress of correcting people over and over again since the language is highly gendered and every single interaction with anyone might misgender you.
>TheBitsiestBit

X is cool fro writing but when talking it doesn't work. And as OP said, gendered romance languages means that it's not just about pronouns that are gendered, but adjectives, objects and adverbs become gendered.   


Personally as a non-binary person from a latin-language speaking country, I love this mirror idea and with most of my queer friends we kinda do this naturally, especially once we've had a ""talk"" about our gender.   


For example, I had a cis-gendered male gay friend who doesn't mind being called and adressed in the feminine. And I've said I don't mind being adressed by either masculine or feminine. So we play around with it. Some days I'm ""linda"", other days I'm ""lindo"" (pretty). Some days I'll say I'm ""cansada"", other days I'm ""cansado"". But honestly, and referring back to the use of ""e"", the regional accent from when I'm from already naturally makes the masculine turn into ""e"", so it's not that ""effective"" in being neutral because it just ends up sounding like masculine.

My workplace now puts everyone’s pronouns on their name tags, and the catalyst was that my boss wanted people to get my theys and thems right ❤️		"Sounds like a very supportive place!(: sounds like you have a great boss
As someone who is currently in the closet at work the idea of putting my assigned pronouns on a badge is my idea of hell.
You are so beautiful and cool you make me wanna eat more popsicles
Wow that's interesting! Is it an opt-in kind of deal, or is it expected/mandatory to include it on nametags?
I just started at a workplace that puts pronouns on nametags!! It's so normalizing and validating.
I dab to that.
I am so happy for you, but also so jealous! I would give up a third of my salary for my workplace to be that supportive.
I publicly came out during the summer, I hope my workplaces will be just as supportive. One of them already used my new name, so I'm hopeful!

That's wonderful

congrats!! your workplace sounds great
That sounds so cool! And you're sooo good looking!!!!!
that's so great!! wish more places did xx
Ayy I have that shirt too
That’s so cool.
Also I love your shirt and your hair. 👊
Thank you for bringing this up! For many, letting everyone assume your gender feels way less bad than actually having to ask people to call you the thing that’s wrong. Someone in my department has pronouns in her email signature, and I’m torn between knowing that’s a good thing and also being low-key worried that the **expectation** of stating your pronouns will reach my workplace before the actual understanding is there that would make me comfortable saying “they.”

I know this is a happy post for OP, but it’s still a competing needs issue I don’t see talked about that much. Maybe a good compromise is encouraging everyone to give pronouns but still letting people opt out. But I know the potential failure there is that a lot of cis people just would’t do it.
I just checked in with my boss and it’s definitely optional!! Thank you so much for bringing this up.
I agree, it should definitely be optional to have pronouns on your name tag! I would never want a policy like this to put pressure on people to come out. I’m pretty sure at my workplace it’s optional, but that is important and I should make sure that’s the case. Thank you for bringing that up!
It definitely seems like a good idea at least as an option though. It helps somewhat mitigate that ""coming out everyday"" issue, a little."	crtjvj	NonBinary	829	1.0	2019-08-17 23:19:29

My pronouns are she/they but I’ve been having a hard time trying to get people to call me they/them. I’ve been told I have really feminine features by literally everyone ik. When I look in the mirror I just see a person. Thoughts? Opinions? Make over tips? Please hit me with what you’ve got :)		"Let people know that, even if they think you look feminine, you're still non-binary, and you'd appreciate it if they could respect *all* of your pronouns. You don't owe them androgyny, and you don't owe them a makeover to ""pass"" as non-binary.
""When I look in the mirror I just see a person."" I love that :) I just wanted to say that to you.
I like to dress like a non-binary stereotype and people still misgender me. So, dress however you like. Like someone else said, you don't owe anyone androgyny. 

Try telling people you trust that (since you get she/her all the time) you'd like to just use they/them for awhile. Or don't tell people you also use she/her. When most people see she/they, they only use she/her. (Also, you'll likely still get she/her). HOWEVER, take that advice with a grain of salt; my pronouns are they/them and I'm a little bitter I get misgendered all the time. 

Pronoun pins/stickers. Shirt is supposed to be the best place, but you can also use it on your purse, laptop, water bottle. There's also pronoun jewelry. 

Finally, this is why queer spaces/friends are important. People who can see you and use your correct pro-nouns after a long day are worth their weight in gold
maybe you can wear a pronoun pin? i’m pretty feminine too but strictly use they/them, so the she/hers especially bother me. i use a pin at work and it’s not perfect but it works :)
I have the same problem. I use she/they and most of the time don't mind she/her but EVERYONE just blatantly ignored that I also use they/them literally no one uses it and it hurts so much. It's starting to make me hate she/her because that all people see me as. Ugh
Being nonbinary isn’t about looking a certain way. If you’re comfortable telling people you’re nonbinary explain that to them they shouldn’t see your fem appearance as an excuse to use pronouns you only use occasionally. I also use she/they, but I use she mainly at work and with family I’m not out to. Point is your pronouns are decided by you and no one else. Respecting that is the baseline expectation we should be holding people to. I know it can be tiring to constantly be explaining to people, but it pays off eventually.
Pronoun pins are pretty cheap on etsy, and most LGBTQ groups (and Planned Parenthood) give them out :)!
A lot of people are talking about how you don't owe anyone androgyny, and I 100% agree with that. I use they/she but read pretty fem too, just because that's how I like to present. If you like how you look don't change anything. I'm honestly not sure how much a difference changing your appearance would make anyway. In my experience when people don't use they/them it's more because it's unfamiliar language than because I don't look androgynous.

In saying that though, if you do actually want a more androgynous look I think a shorter haircut might help with that.
Bro i feel you. I use they/them exclusively, because i feel like if i told people im alright with she/they, id never get they'd, yk? 

Peoples view of your identity does not change it. You are who you are. Thank you for being you.
I just switched to only they/them. I look more femme as I can't bind. I dress more gender neutral and use layering to hide them
I know sometimes it's hard and annoying but correct people. You can be fem and use they, I have 2 really good friends that do! Once you correct others a few times you kind of get over the nerves/weird part. 
Main thing is be you, present how you feel and don't feel that you have to change for others.
okay but the “when I look in a mirror i just see a person” hits so close to home that’s how i’ve seen myself my whole life and if you see yourself that way than that’s what you are it doesn’t matter what others say or how they see you
non-binary doesn't equal androgyny...? you could tell/ask them to use or switch between both sets of pronouns, or have some ppl use they/them while others use she/her.
:))
I use he/they. Even my partner forgets they. Ive had people tell me they dont believe in they pronouns. ""You cant be more than one person."" Even after i correct them and teach the grammar they still dont use they. I have no tips just riding your tailcoats. Lol
You do have feminine features, but that shouldnt stop people from trying to use they/them if you want them to.
howdy! i’m a non-binary person that also presents very femme. it can definitely be frustrating especially when i’m at work because everyone uses she/her and very feminine language when referring to me usually, but there’s such a large staff at my job (i work at an applebees) that it would be kind of a hassle to be able to tell every single person that im  non-binary and use he/they pronouns. honestly as long as the people that im close to are respecting my pronouns and chosen name then i don’t really have any issues when im in other spaces and get called she/her or ma’am. because at the end of the day i don’t rlly care if the cashier at walgreens calls me by feminine language. because they’re doing their job and trying to be polite and im just there to buy iced tea y’know? these are just my thoughts! feel free to disregard. i just thought i’d share them with you (:

EDIT TO ADD: i suggest getting a pin/button with your pronouns on them! it’s a great way to kinda have it on display! you’d be surprised how many people would pick up on it
All of your pronouns are valid. You should only get a makeover if YOU want one. I see a person, too. A person who deserves the same validation and respect as everyone else.
It doesn’t matter if you look feminine it’s how you feel so you should tell people straight away you use they/them
You are a person. You are you and that's all that matters. Do what ever makes you happy. A lot of people think makeup is feminine.
No idea. I have the same issue because ""that is the body of a woman"". I can only hope a pronoun pin would help.  If you figure it out let me know.
I think you're really attractive! your hair is so pretty
i look feminine (to other people anyway) and i exclusively use he/him pronouns. pronouns aren’t your gender so how you look shouldn’t matter at all! people should respect you and i hope they do soon.
you could try using they/she pronouns instead of she/they, putting the they before the she prioritises it as your main pronoun and even if people don’t realize this, they’ll the they before they see she and might be subconsciously more likely to use they/them for you more
I’d recommend telling people you prefer they/them pronouns. You could even tell them that your pronouns are exclusively they/them. I’ve found that, when given the choice, people will go with the most familiar or comfortable options. So if they have to choose between using she or they, they’ll probably choose she.
As a fellow Femby, I just wanted to say hello:). If you are comfortable with the way you dress/style yourself now, no need to change. And or if the way you dress/style yourself gives you euphoria, don’t change it.
Unfortunately if you give people the option to use binary pronouns, that’s what they’re going to do most of the time.
Man, I feel that. Good luck!
I see a person too <3
maybe correct them when they don't call you they or tell them you'd prefer to be called they? I've had a hard time having ppl call me he (pronouns r he/they) and only a couple people I work with call me he and the rest calls me they and I'm just like 😟 so I get it but just try correcting them even if it bugs them
This is why I insist on they/them because if I said ""call me any pronoun you want"" everyone would use she.
I became way more comfortable in my body when I stopped seeing myself how I was supposed to be and just let myself see myself as me. As human. Let them know what makes you feel comfortable. As a pretty feminine non-binary there’s no “way to look” or something your supposed to “pass” as. Just be comfortable with your own skin.
I use they/he and have recently come out as trans/non-binary.
I now wear exclusively mens clothing or more masculine styles and wear a binder and or trans tape and I still get misgendered all the time by strangers. With my family I just got aggressive with them and passive aggressive. At the past few family parties I yell my pronouns when I’m misgendered. My coworkers are really good about it but if they misgender me by accident I say “hey it’s they” and they’ll correct themselves and move on which is dope. 

Other than that you really just have to tell people “non-binary like everything is a spectrum we all present differently. No matter how I look I’m still non-binary”
I know for me I made little changes at first, just to see if it would help. Some style tips to look more masc

Smaller glasses, as opposed to bigger ones. 

Wear your hat around your head instead of framing your face with it tilted back. 

Fluffy eyebrows :)

Tuck in your shirts

In your makeup try to contour your temples, eye sockets, jawline and cheek bones, and contour to make your nose look wider. 

Put on hats to hide long hair. 
 
But also gender expression is different than gender identity and you don't owe anyone masculinity or androgyny.
If you are up to it (and it's OK if you're not) you could always remind then pronouns are personal, there is no one way to be a demigirl or nonbinary, and your pronouns are what you say they are. They need to honor that or they are disrespecting you.
Honestly....... Why does it matter what others say🤷.  People like myself and others are brought up with the simple ""she/he"" and that's all it's ever gonna be to us. We see a girl it's instantly ""she"" we see a boy and it's ""he"" that's not gonna change. Your pronouns isn't other peoples number 1 priority. People will forget. 

When people get annoyed it's normally because they want the acceptance and attention from others. If this is how you feel comfortable then you got to be YOU and not get annoyed at other people
So because it is legally acceptable we can now claim what we are based on pure feeling? You basically denied the existence of God, your creator, by denying what you yourself who was created, is. 

I can only see these emotions expanding and pointing fingers like everything is hate or an attack. 

What horrible things happened to you people ?
I've been through horrible things but never denied myself as who I was created as. 

I genuinely do not understand and I know people fear what they don't understand. 

Help me understand why this option for humans exists?
Thank you. I need that :)
<3
THIS! I'm also she/they and get ""she"" 99% of the time, so this is really helpful! Also can you teach me to dress like a nonbinary stereotype lol (kidding but...not actually kidding)
How do you “enforce” your pronouns? I get shy about correcting people and just accept she. I thought of gettin a pin but I wouldn’t know where to find one
YES! Also once I saw a pin that said ""femmes can be thems"" and I think that pretty much sums it up
Echoing this - been using she/they for 15 years for a reason. When I say 'she/they' it means 'they/them is my heart, she/her is my history, please listen to my heart and help it beat as strong as I wish it could.'

I just wish people would try. I hear that anger <3
Right? I found myself not wanting to go out because I’d be misgendered on a day I wasn’t feeling she/her
I was thinking of doing a pixie cut but I’ve had longish hair all my life I’m afraid lol. But about the “it’s an unfamiliar language to them” i thought that would make people remember it even more since it’s new and fresh. But eh ig not?
🥲❤️
Where could I get a binder from? I didn’t know layering could work too
Glad to know I wasn’t the only one. thanks for your input<3
Ouooo I thought about this but I need more friends on my life to make this happen 😂
Nooo I was gonna ask if you had any tips about correcting your partner mine does the same thing!
🥲❤️
I gotchu XD
Thank youu 🥲✋🏼
I do too. I just need to find my voice then it’ll happen. Thank you❤️
Yeah, surprised this comment is so buried. I generally assume the first pronoun listed is the one preferred unless I’m told to change it up. If someone said “she/they” I would assume they’re fine with “she” or they wouldn’t say it—and most people are going to default to she/he over they if they isn’t the one requested. FWIW I say he/they and I definitely mean “use he but if you say they it’s okay and valid” by that.
Thank you🤍 I really appreciate you saying that.
True sadly
(✿◠‿◠)♥︎
Thanks you 🥺💚
LEMME GO ON ABOUT ENBY STYLE

It seems like there are a few dominant non-binary stereotypes/styles, though of course they by no means represent the community. There's what I'm calling Color Explosion with Rocko's Modern Life shirt (aka loud,colorful, abstract button up), round glasses, poofy hair, and poofy pants. (There's a Dark Academia version where it's all in browns/beige with a vintage influence.) There's Fuck This where you got a mullet, dyed hair, bunch of piercings, and grunge clothing. I often go for the Male Witch vibe with a lot of black/gray, short/fluffy hair, leather jacket, combat boots, masc jewelry, binder, eyeliner, masc shirt, fitted pants. (Though most of the time I bum around in a graphic tee and jeans)

Also, you got your some transfemme tomboys and transmasc femme boys. Also people who look like they're cis (whether they dress as their AGAB or ""pass"") but they sport a fun pro-nouns pin or graphic tee like ""The Future is Non-Binary.""

Because I performed ""girl"" for most of my life, I figured I'd perform non-binary. Spent a lot of time on pintrest and reddit. And I do feel I have a style that fits, but yeah. Doesn't matter if you study fashion trends and gender performance; people gender you how they like. So might as well wear what you want (or at least that's what I tell myself when I'm having a gender crisis)
honestly, in some situations i accept she but in situations like work, where i spend a lot of time, i have to assess the vibe to see if it’s safe. or find safe people who i can ask to correct people if needed. my bosses are really good about it now after a face to face. sometimes it’s easier to tell one person and kinda have them “out” you so to speak. now i overhear ppl talking about me and using my correct pronouns when they think i’m not around and it makes me feel so warm and fuzzy inside. it takes a while and i’ve really only corrected people a few times (and i’ve been out for like 7 years lol) but if you need your friends to correct ppl, you may have to come out and ask

edit: [pins](https://etsy.me/3byWEzN)
Finding allies who are willing to also correct others in passing is helpful if you have some friends who are more outspoken. Sometimes that’s especially helpful if people mean well but need to get into the habit of using a different pronoun with you.
[deleted]
There are lots on Etsy!
That beautiful and yeah I totally relate to that it really sucks. I'm glad someone else understands haha
Thank you for this wake up call. I was confused because I thought they were in order of preference. I’ve been unsure on how to handle the she/they and the he/they.
This is such a good way to put it!! I feel like this is such a common problem with she/they folks (to be clear, only a 'problem' in that it's ignored, nothing wrong with us!)--it's what I've been using for a while but I've just recently started introducing myself as they/she instead to see if that helps.
Ikr like I'm fluid between like demigirl to full nb and on days when I wish my breasts would evaporate and I hate every thing about my agab I just have being called a she
Yeah, that would make sense... but it doesn't seem to be how it actually works.

A pixie cut could be pretty cute, I recon go for it. It's only hair, if you don't like it after all it'll grow back in time anyway.
I'd recommend GC2B. They rule!
I got mine from a pride event. They're also on Amazon.
Well they do use he pronouns to the point they accidentally out me. And at first they used they pronouns mixed in. Somewhere over time they stopped and i didnt notice. I think it has to do with repetition and the fact that they pronouns are ""new"" to most people. Have a talk with your partner. If that doesnt work like with mine, interrupting them with they once in awhile might help.
yw :D
Um this is amazing and awesome THANK YOU SO MUCH!!! I love the Male Witch vibe you described. Maybe you should start an enby fashion/style blog just sayin :)

I haven't used Pinterest in a while so maybe I'll try that and make some secret boards or something! Thanks again!!!
True. I’ll just grow a pair and speak up XD hopefully sooner than later.
Yeah it sucks haha, but at least we're all here together
Aw, thanks!
So true haha"	s03ob7	NonBinary	823	1.0	2022-01-09 22:39:41
I mentioned my partner is non-binary and they assumed he was AFAB	"My partner is a non-binary boy, he doesn't consider himself trans because he's still comfortable being perceived as his assigned gender but he is still non-binary. We were doing a little game in class and I happened to mention them, I didn't use their pronouns in the sentence (I just said ""I like my partner"") but then they asked me if they were a man or a woman to which I answered ""non-binary"" and I heard someone in the back say ""so just a quirky woman"" and it bothered me so much. I do not want to disclose my partners assigned sex just to prove a point, so I decided to ignore it.

I hate Italy and the misconception that all non-binary people are afab. My partner is uncomfortable being seen as a woman but I don't know what to do, they'll never accept he's just non-binary. It really shouldn't matter to them as they don't know him and probably never will, but it hurts seeing them invalidate him behind his back.

Edit: I spoke to my partner and he says he doesn't care if they believe he's a girl. Still, that was clear transphobia and I no longer feel safe in my classroom :,)"	"I’m AFAB nonbinary and it *bothers me so much.* Yes they’re dismissing the idea of an AMAB nonbinary person, but they’re also trying to forcefully make nonbinary binary and make fun of afab people who don’t want to be seen as men or women. It’s so frustrating.
The response is to look at them as if they had just said something incredibly fucking stupid, like ""so just a quirky woman"" and reply ""No, I said *non-binary.* Not a woman, not a man, not a joke for you to disrespect.""""
This is something that annoys me to no end. I often see spaces open for ""women and non-binary people"" (or in German the term FLINTA is often used, which translates to ""women, lesbian, intersex, non-binary, trans\* and agender""), but the expectation is ""feminine people"". Alas, a lot of people see non-binary people as ""women lite"" or something.
I am Nb AMAB, and I kinda feel this. I like being not perceived as male, but I am not feminine looking either and would hate this. I still accept He/him pronouns in the sense that it does not emotionally effect me and it is useful for safety reasons.
Yeah my brother put it in a way I like, “a lot of people think nbs are just diet girls”
My partner is also AMAB nonbinary and I always found this assumption pretty funny. They only use they/them pronouns, which is what I use for them. But for months, until I introduced them to my coworkers, my coworkers would slip and accidentally she/her them now and again. I never bothered to correct the assumption that they're AFAB, why would I right? I just told my partner ""I think my coworkers think you're AFAB"" and we would laugh about it together.

After they met my partner they pulled me aside later and asked if I was gay 🤦🏻‍♂️Like yes but not because of their AGAB.
I'd have laughed at (most definitely not with) the commenter and called them an idiot for being so confidently wrong.

however, it's better to ask your partner how they would like to be referred to if at all, in addition to learning to read the room for when it's safest not to say anything. you don't owe your (or their) life story to everybody you meet
That's awful, I'm sorry they were rude and disrespectful to you and your partner like that. Honestly, that would have been uncalled for even if your partner *was* AFAB, since that still wouldn't mean being ""just a quirky woman"".

Unfortunately, I don't really have any advice for you on how to handle situations like this, other than to ask your partner what they would prefer.
Transphobe:  *Assumes all non-binary people are  women and AFAB*  
Transphobe: ""If non-binary people are valid why are they all women? 🤔🤔🤔""
Hey, i am sorry that you are surrounded by such people and i get you i live in south africa so barely anyone knows about being non-binary and most of the people that do dont take it seriously. Once my friend said that in their class someone said that non-binary people are sensitive for getting upset when people use the wrong pronouns for them and others have said equally concerning things about being lgbtq+. It really sucks because we can try to educate people but its almost always frustrating and unsafe for us but i am really glad that your partner has you, someone who not only accepts him but is willing to defend him you're a really good person for that.
This is part of why I tend to avoid revealing my assigned gender at all. Either you understand nonbinary genders and thus understand its not necessary or you don't understand nonbinary genders and thus I don't want to give you that information to fuel you putting me into a binary container.
I'm just having to accept that the world is still catching up. My gender is not recognised in Spain, it isn't understood on the street, and the language doesn't exist to refer to it.

Even the local English speaking population mostly thinks non binary people are making it up, being fussy or demanding or unreasonable or delusional or what have you. 

I think a lot of people are scared subconsciously, because they don't consciously realise that all their codes for behaviour are actually gendered, and they're lost without the gender cues. When someone doesn't know my gender, they don't know how to treat me. They're also scared that they'll be vilified if they get a pronoun wrong when they genuinely don't understand why they have to change them.

Upshot is, it's not a safe world for enbies at the moment. But the more visible we are, the safer it'll become. We're paving the way for the next generation to be accepted whatever their gender. So keep speaking out. We gotta accept the world as it is right now, but have faith that together we can change it over time.
It’s the misogyny + transphobia innit
As a non-binary amab, I very much appreciate everyone's support.
It’s both transphobic, cissexist, and misogynistic all in one comment. That’s why it feels so gross, in room of it being about your partner.
These people just want to know what organ in their pants. Annoying.
I kind of dislike even the distinction people seem to feel or are pressured to disclose their AGAB. Like if you are non-binary why should AGAB be a thing bc again you’re falling into the binary trap.
I'm AFAB and this one transphobe on Reddit kept comparing transgedner to astrology which really irked me. And the whole ""Non-binary people are just women who want attention"" or ""Non-binary people just like the aesthetic"" is total bull. Gender is way more complex than people give it credit for. They get off by invalidating others to make themselves feel superior or something idk. Fuck them. They can fuck right off.
yeah what the heck is up with the notion that all enby people are afab? amab and intersex enby people exist too and need a heck more representation.
I’m AFAB and I *hate* how non-binary instantly makes people think Woman Lite™. I’m transmasc, don’t call me a woman. I stand with my AMAB non-binary company and refuse to let them be forgotten.
AMAB enby here and I hate situations like this so much I usually just don't disclose my enbyness. So yeah, definitely a shared experience.
This kind of made me feel really bad for being an enby who was AFAB.
Have you talked to your partner about this? Ultimately you should talk about him and handle these situations in the way he's most comfortable. He might have a way he'd like to be spoken about if people ask or prefer you let it go like you did. I think talking about it is your best option.
""Just a quirky girl"" i mean i have to give them credit for some how making the most offensive statement casually for all people under the NB umbrella without using a slur.
I'm amab nb and damn does it bother me when that happens to me too.
Dang that sucks im really sorry that happened, but ur partner took it like a champ
My spouse us AMAB nonbinary and I am AFAB nonbinary but I am not woman ""lite"" as people say it is. I looked like a guy so does my spouse if anything we'd rather be seen as 2 gay men. But it's impossible due to 1 we have a biological kid. And holy shit does that bring up more uncomfortable questions. 
Ended up having to explain to my partner not to out me when talking about it. They didn't think that's what they were doing and felt horrible when I explained that saying I am the biological mother I will be seen as their wife and female cause people suck and assume being nonbinary is just a quirky woman. 

It's difficult and it sucks cause people are just not understanding or frankly don't care. 
Just continue using their pronouns and preferred name. It feels a lot better coming from someone you love.
What is AFAB, please?
I'm a afab non-binary and this post immediately gives me a really bad nausea. No hating on you at all, it's just, I don't know, I suddenly feel so uncomfortable. The way those people assume that an enby is female (as in bio sex) makes me feel so scared. Am I even really an enby? I certainly have zero attachment for being a woman but I don't feel like a man either. Is it enough proof of who I am?
As an nb, I see your partner’s feelings bc I am comfortable being perceived as my assigned gender, but I wish people would respect my existence. 

The biggest issue with your classmates is the blatant ignorance. Assumptions and the disrespect shows that they wouldn’t even listen if you tried to tell them.
Queerphobia revealed by assumptions feels extra irritating sometimes because, as you've experienced, proving it wrong frequently requires giving people info and insight they honestly have no entitlement to.

My partner is a bi man. Biphobia in my country frequently includes the assumption that if a man says he's bi, it's because he's actually gay and 'confused', or scared to come out 'all the way' or something.

As a result, when his co-workers who have never met me asked about me and he said I'm NBy, they all automatically assumed I'm AMAB and now casually default to masculine pronouns on a regular basis when asking how I'm doing or referencing me in conversation.

He asked how I'd prefer him to respond, and I said that if he doesn't think it'll cause drama, he can just remind them that my pronouns are they/them and I prefer neutral pronouns - but honestly, I'm more okay with masc terms than femme, so if they refer to me as his 'husband' or whatever even after being reminded, I don't really care.

""You're the one that has to work with them - I care more about you having a low-stress work environment than people I'll never be around getting my pronouns right, especially if they're getting them wrong in the first place because they're biphobic.""
I know it’s hard and frustrating to stick up for yourselves sometimes in the face of discrimination, but we have to. I would have said something like, « non binary doesn’t mean woman, it means non binary. I don’t know why you associate being nb with being assigned female at birth, are you playing a stupid character or do you really need me to explain it? » they expect us to be entitled children, treat them like the children. Be backhanded, be fucking mean about it, in a way they can’t figure out if you’re really mean or they’re just stupid.
I'm nb, I just ignore them and keep on being the eldritch cryptid I am 💓🦤
I mean, I'm a researcher looking into a non-gender-related thing for work that requires me to interview a lot of young people in the UK, and i've got to say, maybe it's sampling bias, but a LOT of the non binary people were afab teenagers.












Like I can understand where they're coming from with the assumption, the human brain likes patterns and it sure is one hell of a pattern
It physically hurts me how often you used he/him pronouns. I can imagine that using terms like “non-binary boy” or saying “he’s non-binary” is a great way to give your partner gender dysphoria. As an enby, I know if I was your partner it would make me pretty uncomfortable.
NB Amab, because I present “masculine” aka shirt and jeans, I’m so often seen as not really non binary. But then they see me in drag and say “oh, now I get it”. The misconceived notions on both sides are so gross.
biggest fear rn is being denyed entry to a Pride or ""No cis men"" event since I look like a man, but don't identify as one. Started wearing pins with my pronouns to let people know im chill like that tho lmaoo
I genuinely don't engage those people. I'm non-binary, and AFAB. It's very nerve-wracking to enforce my pronouns and gender identity because people do this *all the fucking time.* Eventually, I just figured I didn't have to prove shit to anybody and it was much better for my mental health not to go around fighting this erasure. 

I'm trying the ""lead by example"" thing instead. I do me and exist as I want - unapologetically. People will get it eventually.
I hate the binary forcing too! They think nonbinary is a thing for AFAB, and this kind of makes me feel like a traitor to the nonbinary community, especially to AMAB ones, because I was AFAB and fit a lot of the stereotypes of being nonbinary!
I’ve met about as many AMAB enbies as AFAB enbies tbh
T H I S
I said something similar to my cousin to shut her up.
I love this. Thank you.
As an AMAB enby with a masculine name, I join groups like that and the ones I’m denied entry to are the ones that raise red flags
Women lite like a beer lmfao holy shit you’re right. They absolutely do.
If you are really open to anyone but cis men (and I can see a reason why you might want spaces like that), I prefer the term “marginalized genders”, but only if the expectation is actually that they can be as masculine, feminine, both, or neither as they want in that space. Trying to list out everyone but cis men gives me the “women and women-lite” vibes.
Fellow German here - how do you known what the expectation is? I help organise skate events for FLINTA and try to actually make everyone understand that trans can mean a trans man, and non-binary might look like someone amab, too. They'd be welcome. The policy is ""if someone shows up, they belong"" (And it's scary, because there is always some cis-man saying he feels discriminated against because of the event and then often say ""okay, so if I am not a man I can come?"" - which, correct, you can, but also because of what he said first I now have troubles believing it)
There’s two categories. Cis men and non cis men.

That’s how they decide these things.

Doesn’t make a lot of sense though.
DIET GIRLS???
Which commenter?

But yeah I did talk with them afterwards and I will edit the post to add those information. Thank you <3

Edit: i jsut realised u meant the classmate in my story and not a commenter here on reddit,, my brain-
Yep it was very distressing and awkward especially since I am non-binary myself but I am AFAB and try to appear cis-boy-like irl. I feel like they only respect me slightly because they think I'm a binary trans man.

Even my religion teacher understood what it meant and didn't judge (he a cool guy)
I totally feel what you said. Teenagers will not care of you try to educate them. They will just say ""that shit isn't real"", laugh at us and walk away. They hate learning and figuring new things out,, honestly so sad :/
I've only just started dealing with other people about my NB child and I've had the suspicion that they have assumed AFAB. But thought I may have been reading too much into it. I didn't know it was a thing until this post. 

Before they came out as NB they were often misgendered so I'm quite alert to it. (They are still misgendered, twice today people got a gender they have never been, but we least it's a good time to tell people they are NB)
It matters when we talk about social conditioning/expectations before coming out (though it is a shorthand for a large set of inconsistent norms). These things do change the way people interact with and see the world. But, outside of that it has *no* relevance and even within that context there shouldn’t be pressure to out AGAB. 

(And *sorta* relevant if you’re trying to sleep with someone, but again it’s not addressing the actual question directly (woooo junk) and can lead to incorrect assumptions, because bottom surgery exists!)
Exactly !! This is why I ignored it. I asked my sweetheart if they would've rather if I said anything but they said they didn't care. It still upset me so much because I am non-binary too and I'm tired or being considered just as my birth sex to the point where I present fully as a trans man at school
Same..
I feel like I already have so much imposter syndrome for being enby and not pursuing medical transition for medical concerns and this type of shit makes it worse
I 100% will when I get home.
Lolzz accidentally posted that twice sorry
Assigned female at birth
You're valid and anyone who tells you otherwise is just a transphobe, you're not a woman if you do not feel like one, you do not need to prove yourself to anyone. Stigma and misinformation don't make you any less of a non-binary person. <3
As a D&D player I love the question ""Are you playing a stupid character or do you really need me to explain it?""
Of course there’s a skew in the data: 

0) points evilbunboy mentioned 
1) it’s self-reported, and we know at least a notable percentage of people are not fully honest even in anonymized data, and will tend to answer what they think they’re supposed to, or what they *want* the answer to be. 
2) think about our general societies attitude towards gender non-conformity in young girls and boys:

Girls/AFABs are socially “allowed” to be boyish without significant push-back (“tomboys”) giving them freedom to experiment and feel out the concept in relatively safe conditions/under the radar.

Boys/AMABs are *not*. Femininity, or anything perceived as such, is resisted, or even punished. This makes any sort of exploration of gender or pushing the boundaries of social role/appearance/etc. much riskier. (Risk is not just physical, but social too, being mocked scares people)

Good example is my cousin—as a young child “he” (before having a real concept of gender) really liked pink. While the father & that side went with it no problem, my aunt responded by removing everything pink or pinkish (except her stuff of course). She was convinced that her ex was using this to troll her. Other similar stuff occurred over the years apparently, but this is one I saw in person when I lived with them. Kid eventually came out as trans. (Thankfully my aunt did come around, and is surprisingly accepting, and seems to genuinely try.)
I have a feeling this is a result of toxic masculinity. Men are told not to express their emotions and therefore struggle with exploring their identity. Many don't even question it even if they are not happy living as a man because ""why would a man feel happiness"".

Afabs arent shamed by society for presenting more masculine / being gender non-comforming.

In recent years the trans community became more well known and there's a lot more research about gender identity, gender dysphoria and euphoria and so more amabs feel the need to inform themselves. Still, could be better.
It could also be a societal phenomenon. Males are treated very harshly if they do anything remotely feminine and they're being conditioned like this from a very young age were I don't know if females get the same pressure so that might be part of the explanation other than sample bias. Males might just be afraid to take the time to introspect themselves due to societal pressures. Though AFAB folks also get pressured a lot to conform to their AGAB too but idk if it's as extreme in most cases. Also so what if more Non-binary individuals are AFAB? they should be respected for the gender they identify as none-the-less.
How do you know that isn't OP's partner's identity and pronouns?

Nonbinary men and Nonbinary women exist alongside nonbinary people who are neither or both, and Nonbinary folks can use any pronouns.
My partner uses he/they pronouns and I often call him my boyfriend. He calls himself a boy and a male-aligned non-binary. I will not gender my boyfriend incorrectly just because you don't like it
Why do you assume that’s not how he wants to be referred to? Not all enbies use they/them exclusively. I’m transmasc enby. If someone called me a non-binary boy, that would be awesome.
Not every nb person's experience with being nb is the same :/
Good thing you aren’t OP’s partner. You sound insufferable.
You're doing the same thing the stories about, you're trying to fit non-binary people into being a certain preconceived notion.


Being non-binary is not AFAB person that exclusively uses they/them pronouns and presents androgynously.


Non-binary means non-binary, not 'new gender just dropped, genders trinary now'.


Non-binary is literally anything other than man or woman and they don't have exclusive rights to masculinity, femininity or any pronouns.
Non-binary isn't whatever's left, it's whatever the fuck we want.
Right there with you. It really sucks constantly hearing the wrong pronouns. Do you ever correct people or just ignore it?
I hate the exclusionist factor as a double bladed sword with inherit transphobia.
>If you are really open to anyone but cis men (and I can see a reason why you might want spaces like that), I prefer the term “marginalized genders”

I've also heard ABCD (Anybody But Cis Dudes)
Oh, I by no means tried to say that everyone who employs the term FLINTA does that. I definitely also had a lot of great experiences. But there were also quite a few instances where I did not feel welcome, because of my gender expression (in that situation, it changes a lot, depending on how I have to get where, because, you know, I'd like to arrive without bruises.) That being said, sounds like you're doing great. :)
Yup, like diet coke only with more asshat-ery.
That was extra crappy of them then, I'm sorry they did that
I think the transphobia might go hand in hand with the sexism. Because I'm an AFAB non-binary individual, people look at me, notice my feminine features and treat me with so much disrespect. Females and feminine people probably get it even worse and I feel so bad for them. These misogynists should be ashamed of themselves and grow the hell up. Sexism is real even today, even if you're trans, and there's no place for it.
It is, teenagers and anyone of any age really need to start realising that just because they might not understand or relate to someone elses experience doesnt mean its not real jist different.
Ignorant and hateful people are bad enough already but people who are willfully ignorant and are so closed minded to a point where they blatantly refuse to accept the bigger picture here drive me insane.
Thanks for your reassurance. Normally I'm pretty confident about my gender. It's just that I sometimes freak out and couldn't control what I think.
Something I noticed tho is that this behaviour is way more present in cis men. It shows how much more women / afab people educate themselves.
Damn patriarchy..
I totally understand that. It happens to me too :,)
I hope you have an awesome day my fellow enby
Oh i agree. I mean life already gives them a headstart so why worry or care about anyone else who is different to them and they certainly dont care very much for the damage they cause. Not saying every cis man is like this but like majority of them are.
Geez, ty. Nice day to you too :)
Tell me about it. I dated a cis man once in college. He was so immature. He literally got life handed to him and would be dismissive of minorities entering the STEM field and minorities in general. He thought he was something special and just expected nothing but good things to come his way. He clearly didn't give a damn about me nor his previous girlfriends who I bet were as thrilled to deal with him as I was. I guess in the end I just wasn't worth his time. Cis men ☕.
No, he was never worth YOUR time.

Just got misgendered by a cis gay man	I really want to scream i'm in a zoom class room and someone speaking to us misgendered me despite me having my pronouns in my zoom name and him proudly declaring that he's a gay man earlier. I am just soooooooooo sick of cis queer people lmfao idk if i'm being unreasonable but it feels so much worse when a cis gay person misgenders me? or does anything transphobic? like y'all really aren't paying attention, huh	"Omg. My m*nanger is the yaaaass queeniest of white gays and he *always* misgenders my partner. Who is amab. Which doesn’t matter, but apparently it does to HIM. Luckily I use all pronouns and am un-misgenderable 😈 or I’d be fukkin miserable dude
I live in a queer community in a major California city and the difference in how I’ve been treated since coming out (and appearing) from cis gay men was *shocking*. Like, out of their way rude. 

I know it’s not most people but don’t think queer people can’t be clueless about enby/trans. Some openly hate us but this is the safest neighborhood for me so I’m here, dealing.
yoo this happened to me in tHE MENTAL HOSPITAL ?!?!!! this guys would Not stop asking what my partner ""was born as"" and i had to literally be like ?? you wanna know what genitals they have??? and he j kept being like ""haha u know us old people""......... he was 32
[deleted]
A cis gay dude once told me, ""Oh I don't care about pronouns."" And then proceeded to misgender me. It was a great experience!!! :))))
They're the top of the queeriarchy, and want to stay there.
every time I meet new ppl I tell them I'm nonbinary and my pronouns are they/them and they will not hesitate to misgender me IMMEDIATELY
I came out to my cis gay therapist as genderfluid. He didn't judge, but he clearly doesn't really get it, as he, while trying to reassure me, told me one of his patients is a trans man, and he told me his dead name and used feminine pronouns. I was so taken aback by the wording I didn't even think of correcting him until way later. I think some cis people are just clueless. It clearly wasn't malicious, he is actually supportive, but it still made me cringe. 

Remember, y'all, cis white queer men are often the weakest link in the community.
Idk why but usually gay cis man or lesbian cis woman (specially the man) have this feeling of putting others in the community down (and sometimes just so they can get cishet aproval, wich is fucking weird)
It's real ""pulling the ladder up behind you"" energy except they don't seem to realise they can't do that when they haven't yet gotten up the ladder.
I really don’t understand this mindset, if you’re a queer person, why would you treat other queer people like shit?
Welcome to the shit show.  Even the well intentioned cis who you open your heart to will fuck up.  Repeatedly.
I find cis queer (especially white ones) all too eager to throw trans and other gender nonconforming people under the bus because they are afraid of losing the meager progress they’ve made already for themselves. A cis gay white man nowadays loses almost no privilege anymore for being gay and they like that and want to keep it that way.
A lot of gaymen are transphobic af, also feminists lesbians
I've learned to not expect anything from cis white gay men. There is so much sexism, racism, and transphobia in that community. There's a reason why gay trans men feel more comfortable with lesbians than they do with their fellow gay men. It's really sad tbh..
Omg it's so annoying, I'm AFAB, which doesn't matter. Since my pronouns are They/them. But even tho I introduce myself with my pronouns, does anyone use em??? NO! JUST MY FRIENDS! 😭
A cis gay man told me (an enby) non-binary isn't real. To my face.
It's a bit of a misconception that all gay people should be supportive of all other people's issues. 

Generally ALL people should be supportive, but in every group there are closed-minded assholes. 

It's sort of a tough lesson to learn in life cuz you think marginalized groups would be supportive of each other, but that's just not how life works. I work in the nonprofit sector so I really appreciate and value and support and celebrate when marginalized groups support each other, but it just doesn't always happen
Yeah, I always will think of a person in a shirt covered in rainbows and saying ‘good vibes only’ mocking me to my face about using they/them, while she was at work in the customer service world! Dang! She was my best friends co worker and was terrible for months until she finally was fired.

(And was also queer, not just a rainbow shirt lol)
Yeah, you can’t trust cis queers all the time. You’d think they’re more conscious about this stuff but then you realize that, at the end of the day, they’re cis and gender/pronouns is something that they are apathetic about. A lot of them don’t think highly of nonbinary and trans people. It’s really disappointing how much disregard there is within the LGBTQ+ community.
Sick of people thinking just because they belong to one identity/community that they can disrespect other identities/communities. Being gay doesn't give you a pass to be transphobic. I saw Jewish people who thought being Jewish gave them a pass at being racist (saying that as a Jewish person), trans people who thought they have a pass at being misogynistic etc.

I don't GET it. You don't get to hate on people just because people hate on you. Don't disrespect other people especially when you know what it's like being disrespected for the way you were born.
It's why I kinda don't feel immediately safe if I'm in a ""queer space"" irl, there could be terf lesbians, transphobic gay men, ace people who think allosexuals are inferior. I'm queer and the level of judgement and abuse I get from my own community is ridiculous.
The weird part about life is that you can be gay AND sexist...conundrums everywhere
White cis queer ppl are the reason there's so much fragmentation in our collective community and they blame cis het ppl of color for it, welcome to the lgbt :)
sucks when lgbtq people misgender people. there’s a gay guy in my university and he’s also extremely transphobic
I was at a bar waiting for my friends and a group of cis gay men noticed me sitting by myself and invited me to join their table. I told them my pronouns multiple times and I have a full ass beard and they kept calling me she/her. Then asked if I wanted to be a boy so much (I’m non-binary) if I’d be signing up for the draft. As soon as my friends arrived I noped tf out of there
You have every right to be upset and I’m not trying to excuse this person’s mistake.  However, I am a non-binary person who uses they/them pronouns and I occasionally slip up and use the wrong pronouns for my nonbinary roommates.  I make every effort not to do this and am correct probably 97% of the time and always correct myself if I mess up, and I feel terrible every time it happens.  I talked with my gender therapist about this, and she said it’s from the societal conditioning we receive growing up.
Same! Currently doing an online counseling course. And even though my pronouns were in my name, the lecturer still misgendered me. You'd think as a counselor you'd be a bit clued in on not doing that. Made it hard to focus that day. A couple students messaged me privately to be like wtf, so at least I wasn't alone.

It's like we're not apart of the same community like what-
MOOD. I spent all last year's pride getting misgendered by white cis gay man that think the fight is over. It annoys the hell out of me.

I'm fortunate to have some good eggs in my personaly community, but the ""queer"" scene where I live is very much white, cis and gay, with little respect towards trans people.
I came out to a trans woman as non-binary and she said non-binary people are weird and should just “pick one”. Unfortunately even trans people can be transphobic 😪
honestly i’ve stopped trusting monosexuals with my identity, regardless of if they’re a straight man or woman or a gay/lesbian person. i’ll always be she/her to them.
Did you try correcting them or letting them know that you prefer certain pronouns privately if you don't like to have a confrontation publicly?
I work for a NGO that is active in asylum support for LGBT people and in the NGO I'm the only one not cis, but we help a lot of non cis persons as well ofcourse. They struggle with pronouns and gendering people correctly, and it angers me so much
It could be that he just didn't look at your name and didn't mean to be rude
I am struggling so much being mostly attracted to cis men. I wish I was a lesbian they look like they have so much fun 😭
“Sick of cis queer people.” Okay. I was here because I was trying to learn and understand, but I’ll leave.
Yeah no if you are a gender or sexual minority and you are hating on a fellow gender or sexual minority, wether you feel a kinship with them or not, wether you respect their identities or not you’re trash.
OMG what? I'm sorry but im confused... WHO?
I'm glad I found this thread because I feel off about actual LGBT members putting down others in the same community. Like ok, I expect non queer people or conservatives to side eye if they hear ""non binary"" but not our guys.

My bisexual friend didn't know what deadname is (he also asked like ""wtf is deadnaming"") I explained to him and he was all ""are you freaking serious?? People actually cry about names they had most of their life?? Lmao how soft can you be"" which not gonna lie, that actually hurts because he reacted this way and didn't bother to put himself in the place of trans people, especially that he's closeted because of living in a mostly Christian neighborhood. Unfortunately some people, lgbt or not, don't care unless it's their own skin.
Same. Call me ""it"" and these hands are buy one get one free tho lol
Hehe, they have no power over us!!!! 😈
I use he and she pronouns so they have to deliberately use they/them pronouns for me despite the fact that I present as a boy and am amab
Small thing, but the word ""manager"" isn't actually gendered despite how the word appears, it comes from the Latin word 'maneggiare"" which just means to handle/train horses originally, but has been expanded to include people over time obviously. Not important, just a fun thing I found interesting. Also, fuck your manager for misgendering on purpose.
Shit should be considered sexual harassment, that's like asking if ""the carpet matches the drapes."" Like back the fuck off dude, my private parts are none of your fucking business, that REALLY SHOULDN'T NEED TO BE SAID
No fckng way they actually referred to themselves as ""old"" when they're literally les than halfway through the average life expectancy. People are so weird 😭
people are so fucking gross
the icing on the cake was he has his pronouns in his zoom name too lol
Cis dudes are still cis dudes in the end...
[removed]
Bruh if he doesn't care about pronouns then how would using someone's preferred pronouns be an issue
This right here
Okay there’s a lot to unpack here, but I wanted to say: deadname or actual name - it is so NOT AT ALL legal or ethically acceptable for your therapist to be naming other clients to you (or anyone for that matter)!!! I’m sorry that your therapist has a lot to learn as far as gender identity and the like go… I would also be seriously concerned about this egregious disregard for confidentiality.
Find a new therapist. If he’s going around giving personal info about patients, he is not a safe therapist to be around. He can talk about other patients but not in too much detail and absolutely not with their name. For your own safety, switch to a different therapist
I’ve noticed a trend of Cis Gay Dudes especially who love to be THE token gay, and bully other queer people away from their cis/Hetero social circles
It's so fucking odd how people that get the slightest bit of leverage in society just immediately start kicking down on the next oppressed minority. Like really, even they of all people can't expend just a bit of empathy
Especially white cis gay and lesbians
I wouldn’t say “usually”  I’d say some of them do this and the ones that do are a rather vocal minority. This statement you made is kind of a huge generalization. Cis queers are not our enemies.
It’s mostly because they’re afraid of losing the power they have over others
While the LGBTQ+ community is one with a broadly overlapping goal of acquiring equality, in reality that very large group is made up of smaller communities and individuals who may not have any overlapping goals with others in the community at all. On top of that, some have an ""I got mine, you get yours"" mentality when it comes to acceptance and rights, and many are happy to forget that intersectionality is a thing. Most people in the community are not cis gay abled white men, but many people forget that there's more to fight for after that demographic got the rights they were vocal about. Many people forget that there are aspects of queer identity beyond ""gay"" that are important to people.
Nope. Feminism is trans-inclusive. Second-wave ""feminism"" is pretty transphobic and bioessentialist and in many ways not at all feminist in the slightest, but current feminist theory is not. Lesbians who are trans-exclusionary tend to actually not be feminists either, as the flavour of transphobia they adopt flatly denies that non-binary people exist because ""gender isn't real"", disproportionately punishes and polices cis gender non-confirming women for their perceived masculinity while blaming trans women for having to do so, and then immediately turns around and infantilises tomboys and GNC women to protect them from the influences of evil trans men in case we snatch them up and turn them trans.

People who are also feminists are not transphobic, by and large. TERFs are not feminists.
> also feminists lesbians

Huh? I know plenty of transbian feminists who are hardly transphobic. I think you mean TERFs, whose ideology tends to align nicely with that of literal Nazis these days. And, yeah, Nazis aren't big on inclusivity.
I’ve personally had far more experience with allosexual people believing they’re inherently superior to me and other ace folk than the opposite. Occasionally I’ll see the “I don’t have silly sexual attraction distracting me” rhetoric, but it’s almost always from a teenager, and almost always shot down by others in the community. Or it comes from allo folk who misguidedly assume it must be “so nice to not have to worry about that!” 

Not to say that you haven’t experienced that personally, but idk. I don’t think it’s necessarily fair to claim that’s a concern when asexual folk make up SUCH a small percentage of the community, and are often pushed out of queer spaces as “basically straight” or “just trying to be special,” etc. I think my odds of encountering explicit sexual conversations that make me uncomfortable in queer spaces are probably higher than a single allo person being targeted by an ace person in a queer space. 

Also: Allosexual in square quotes concerns me.
Could you explain what is being allosexual please?
I feel this too.
Fr! I did this once to my comrade...

I was hella tired so it absolutely was not on purpose but I had *never* done so before and NGL I think they quit our DSA because of it. 

They looked *hurt*. Sad part is, I think they and I were the only people who even noticed. 

I feel *so* bad. 💔

I do believe people about their identity but when my brain is dumb it 100% goes back to ""masc=he and femme=she"". 

I need to unlearn the gender binary but fuck that's a big one. (It doesn't mean I won't try but Gods it feels so daunting.)
Monosexuals?
>monosexuals
Ah yes, let us further divide the community into us and them. Very good 👍🏻
No, and it's not really the point. I've spent too much of my life correcting people (and plenty suffering in silence too!). I'm tired of cis ppls bs
No he called on my name which he only knew from reading off the zoom list which has my pronouns
it’s not fun to get fetishized by holding hands with another woman
K bye
As a queer person, have you never felt ‘sick of straight people’? I sure as hell have. As an m-spec I’m often sick of monosexuals too even if they are queer. If you are here to listen and learn then do it. I’m cis (more or less) and I wasn’t personally offended by this because I know I’m not like the person they are talking about.
My hands are bisexual.
Ngl I use they/them a ton and by default now.
uj/ Ya wow how dare u not use they you’re just begging to be misgendered snowflake 🙄(/rj) 

(actual uj/ sorry you’re getting this reaction fam it’s bullshit)
Based. If they do we will attack
FACTS and the thing that boggles my nuts the most is the fact that he would make a point tht his main personality trait was being gay and in the lgb(t?) community....
he tried to relate to my mom when she was visiting by saying ""us old folks just cant get these pronouns right haha"" or some shit like that after misgendering me and it was just ????? shes TWENTY YEARS older than u brotherman
I’m 31 and a teacher (so I spend lots of time around people 6-12) and I can assure you:

31 is ancient.
at 32 you do start to feel ""old"" around teenagers
Fucking classic
How woke of him 🙄
Are you a cis gay man? Is so, do you respect people's pronouns?
I am also sorry your therapist has a ways to go in learning about gender identity. 

Honestly, I would find a new therapist who has a better knowledge/understands you better and also just doesn’t straight up violate patient confidentiality.
I live in Mexico, so switching to a different therapist would mean risking more than my name. First off, I can't economically afford a different therapist. Second, my currenttherapist is both a psychiatrist and a licensed therapist, which means I don't need to go to two different people to get my therapy and my medication. And more importantly, I could end up with a homophobic and transphobic therapist. Or someone who says I don't really have adhd. I could end up risking more than I would win. My therapist was my teacher once, and I've built a good rapport with him. I feel comfortable with him and even with him it took me way too long to ask him for a consult because I have social anxiety. Switching therapists is not an option for me. It was also the only time he ever said something about anyone else.
it's like they get theirs and then forget everyone else behind them. tbh i feel like the cis gays called it a day after they got marriage equality...
Just because someone's a minority doesn't mean that they're allies, even to their own demographic. They're just like every other selfish person. Cishet society offers a devil's bargain, and some people are willing to take it.

I think the saddest people are trans people who are transphobic to help them pass, or who want to be cis so badly they take on a cisnormative mindset.
Yep
Sorry, I really put that in the wrong way. What I meant is that when a queer is going agaisn't trans/nb ppl, it's usually them.
Yeah I'm not saying all ace people but it's precisely because they are a minority of a minority that doesnt get alot of attention/social support, can open the door to incel-like behaviour and instead of going to therapy a vocal minority of ace people just create trauma Olympics, gatekeepy echo chambers filled with tons of hate towards people not in their group and even those in their group that dont fit their rigid standards. I've found this with other queer people too. Again not all queer people mainly the ones who lack any maturity or emotional regulation skills which is lots of people in a university or internet environment heck even in my mental health community queer space. Just because they're a minority doesnt mean they won't be dicks and doesnt excuse abuse of any kind from them just because the majority group has life easier. I've also experienced abuse from heteronormative straight people, but had more extreme and radical treatment from the echo chamber circles.
I'm sorry if you felt personally attacked by this if you are sex repulsed or sometimes feel this way yourself. Changed quotations mark allosexuals, mainly included it because it just reminds me of all the times radical reactionary feminists quotation mark men and just throw away all the substantive theory about dismantling the patriarchy and how gender roles also affect men, and just use their twisted form of identification as a way to incite hate and cope with their trauma with amab people in unhealthy ways, like be transphobic or sexist and abusive. But if it causes you concern, I'm willing to change it. I don't really have any problem with ace people, I happen to not be allo at all,  I'm asexual, a trans woman, demiromantic towards all genders, a person of colour, have multiple neurodevelopmental and psychiatric diagnoses. If anything i am more oppressed than many of the middle class white queer people in these spaces yet i dont feel the need to justify my intersectionality, cope with my trauma by hating other people. And to reiterate it isnt all queer/ace people ive found some really kind and validating people in these spaces too. Its just I've spent alot of time in a mix of queer and ace spaces and in either space experienced alot of vocal (predominantly white middle class) minorities that project a hatred of the 'other' and hurts/makes people uncomfortable with it. We shouldn't normalise hatred because all this does is make your social skills and opportunities suffer, no one really likes extremely hateful and reactionary views regardless of how oppressed the person is. Oppression and intersectionality opens the door to express feelings but not to incite hatred and really reactionary behaviour. I've learned this with not only queer people but with the radical politically involved people. It's why I no longer expect minorities to be safe or anyway superior to majorities, the possibility of assholes exists in every group.
People who experience sexual attraction. Opposite of asexual.
I’m guessing in reference to having a sexual attraction that only pertains to one gender (straight, gay, lesbian, etc)
>Monosexuals

I think that means people who are attracted to one and only one gender (e.g. only attracted to men or only attracted to women).
Yeah, i think if we care about things like this. We also need to be outspoken about them because they might not be the main attention of other people. People in general are more involved and busy with themselves. So I understand when people misgender me especially if my presentation isn't very obvious to what my identity is. People just look at visual cues of how we present and try to match a gender to that. 

But I understand where you are coming from and how it can be frustrating.
I had someone who claimed to be a ""linguist"" say that they can only be plural because it was in the past like language doesn't change all the damn time (if they were actually linguist they would know that as well as it being used singularly for hundreds of years)
I get it but I hope that if somebody tells you that they don't use they them pronouns then you will change which pronouns you are using. I do realize I am using they/them pronouns for my hypothetical who does not use they/them pronouns.
Sounds like compensating to me. Like people who insist that they aren't racist because they have black friends
unrelated. i really like the phrase “boggles my nuts”.
The fleshy prison sure does, I guess.
Jesus really revealed it all with the debt forgiveness parable, humans are so bad at it
Which is especially close-minded given that we've now seen how fragile SC rulings can be under future corruption. None of us should stop fighting for each other's right to live until this shit is locked in stone.
Thank you! :)
Yeah, that's correct. Strangely enough I've never met a bisexual, polysexual, pansexual, omnisexual, or other persons attracted to more than one gender that has an issue with pronouns, same with people on the ace and aro spectrums.
But what does that have to do with someone respecting your gender? There are trans lesbians and gays is it not disrespectful to imply we’re more likely to be transphobic bc we are bisexual?
Ik what it means. It doesn’t have anything to do with people respecting your gender.
And actually for longer than singular you. People are often so confused to hear that!
For sure, it costs nothing not to be an ass. I've thought about purposefully miagendering the ""I don't do pronouns"" people and transphobes to see how they like it
it was more the culture shock for me
For me lately, I've gotten the most transphobia from cis pansexual folks. I don't understand it.
I might've noticed something similar. 👀
Could not tell you, tbh. I’m just interpreting
Yeah I don't know what it is, probably just a coincidence."	y7b0lt	NonBinary	763	0.98	2022-10-18 16:02:16
My boyfriend refuses to use my pronouns	He absolutely refuses and makes it out to be an infringement of his freedom to ask, and I want to break things off becuase of this but im worried I am just over reacting maybe? That it isnt out of the usual for partners to do this. I just need others experiences with this because it hurts me that he won't and I want to know im not being unreasonable.	"Breaking up would \*definitely\* not be an over-reaction here. Freedom of speech doesn't mean that you can be a dick and experience no social consequences, just that there aren't legal consequences. Or, better expressed: https://xkcd.com/1357/
If he doesn't respect your pronouns, he doesn't respect you.  Break up now before he shows his lack of respect in other ways, such as your consent.
Don't you mean EX-boyfriend?
infringement of his freedom to ask what exactly??? shit, this boy sounds like a self-righteous ass hole. He is absolutely not worth your time or energy if that is how he treats you about something important like LITERALLY WHO YOU ARE. Sorry, OP. He's not worth it.
Kick him to the curb. You can definitely find better, and it's not unreasonable to be called what you choose to be called by.
Reddit is really bad with relationship advice and will usually advise people to IMMEDIATELY breakup with someone at the first sign of shitty behaviour...but tbh this is such a huge red flag.  


It's so easy for people to just try to use your correct pronouns after being asked once. If your pronouns were changing a lot as you discover yourself and they can't keep up, that's a different discussion. If you used neo-pronouns, I can see room for a discussion because those are less known.   


But refusing to use your pronouns outright and claiming it infringes on their freedom is so unbelievably childish that they don't deserve your patience. It sets a precedent that asking them to do anything they don't want to do is like some kind of personal attack. Dump them. It's not your responsibility to validate your own identity, if people can't give you the basic dignity of correctly addressing you, that's their problem.
There's a HUGE difference between using the wrong pronoun as a mistake, and using the wrong pronoun because ""freedom"". 

There are plenty of loving people out there who are capable of using the right pronouns -- or at the very least apologizing if they mess up. 

TL;DR - You're not being unreasonable. You deserve better.
My boss once asked me to not call him “sir”. It wasn’t because he’s non-binary but because he was in the military and he didn’t like the association. Out of respect, I stopped calling him sir. What’s the difference other than that arguably one should respect their partner even more than they do a supervisor?
Definitely not an overreaction. He is failing to give you baseline respect. I would break up with him.
Thank you everyone, its really nice to get imput and everything is appreciated! Im going to sleep on all of this, I hope everyone has a lovely night :)
Dump his sorry arse and be firm, he sounds like a borderline abuser
Dump him. Your gender isn't gonna go away and neither is his fixed mentality. He's not capable of growing alongside you.
Dump him and find someone who sees, respects, and supports you as a whole person.
No, your ex-boyfriend refuses to use your pronouns
Say goodbye and run
Sounds like you’ve already tried talking it out. If he still refuses, then there is a clear lack of respect for you. I’d move on, as difficult as it may be. If he can’t respect things like that, what’s to say he respects you when you don’t give consent?
oh him? he’s not your boyfriend 💅🏼
He doesn't respect aspects of your identity or your experience. He values his ""freedom"" more than your well-being, this is a giant red flag.   


He has chosen to treat your request that he respect your identity and sense of self as a personal attack on his ""rights"". This is shockingly entitled, selfish, and immature.   


Do you really want to be with someone who has so little care for you? So little respect? That's why you're upset by the way because his choice has made very clear how much he values his comfort over even your basic personhood.
Dump him
Hello, Whole Man Disposal Service? I'd like to schedule a pick-up.

There is no point in continuing a relationship with a partner who doesn't respect you and refusal to use your preferred pronouns is a mark of disrespect. It doesn't matter what he thinks about it, it should be important to him because it's important to you. You're not overreacting, he's being a disrespectful jerk.
breaking up definitely isn't an over reaction, you deserve to be with someone who respects your pronouns.

>makes it out to be an infringement of his freedom to ask

this is also deeply concerning.
even years ago when my wife, then gf, didn't understand or really 'get' me being nonbinary, she STILL used my pronouns and called me they. there is absolutely no excuse. if he is outright refusing, that is a sign he doesn't WANT to respect you and doesn't care about you or making you feel loved. refusing is far beyond not quite getting it, or having a hard time but trying, or having a lot of questions or saying the wrong things. those things are also tough and anyone absolutely has a right to not want to engage with that - but outright refusing is unacceptable, period. absolutely leave him. there are so many wonderful people out there that will see you as you and support you and love you and appreciate you.
You're not over reacting at all. 

This isn't a difficult thing for him to do, he's just decided to use political theater to be a dick to you. His lack of respect for your identity could be his first step into testing the waters to see what kind of abusive behavior he can get away with.

He's intentionally hurting you and aggressively invalidating you. You don't deserve that. Ever. 

He can take his ass and personal freedom right the hell on out. You deserve to be seen as you are and treated with love. He's refusing to give you either. 

He doesn't deserve you and you can definitely do better.
You're not overreacting.

""I'm refusing to be respectful of you,"" is what I hear whenever someone intentionally misgenders me. It's not an accident, they're doing it on purpose.

Move on.

P.S. You can end a relationship just because you feel like it, you don't need a reason.
Refer to him as a she from now on and see how quickly he starts saying you aren’t respecting him
Lol no, you aren't overreacting. Dump him with the rest of the dumpster fire bros.
DUMP HIS ASS, HE'S A BUM
My ex boyfriend (and still friend) offered to call me by different pronouns- they/them or he/him if I wanted, even tho I still present female. My mom and sister heard I was identifying as nonbinary through my grandpa (who found out bc he saw a comment I made online) and they asked if I wanted to be called different pronouns. Of everyone in the world, the person you’re in a relationship with should at least care and try. 

How would your partner feel if you used your free speech to misgender him? Do you feel it’s your right to call your boyfriend whatever pronoun you want? It doesn’t seem like it. My point is that most people care about the pronouns and gendered nouns we use for them. Gendering people correctly is just basic decency and you definitely should expect your partner to do so.
~enbies gotta stop dating straight men~

Break it off. You have no obligation to this man, he obvi doesnt see you for who you are, and most cishet dudes have not done near the level of work necessary to understand their sexuality and be comfortable enough with themselves to date nonbinary people *as* nonbinary people

Ive had this problem with straight women as an amab enby and it was fruitless; straight women are typically more openminded and still cant handle it, dont let the comphet nonsense get you, DROP👏 HIS👏 ASS👏
break it off. he's being unreasonable
No, he's treating you like garbage because either he's transphobic or homophobic (or both). The correct way to phrase that is ""my ex boyfriend is a scumbag and I'm looking forward to dating people who respect the most basic things about my existence"".
This isn’t just grounds for a breakup this is grounds for a mean breakup. If you’ve got anything cruel to say feel free to send him off with it :)
homie, you are *under* reacting (though understandably so, i get it can be hard to know your worth if this is the treatment you’re used to).

but absolutely, you deserve SO much better than someone who thinks “freedom of speech” = “i should get to mistreat my partner”. that is not love, that is someone trying to ignore who you are and make you pretend to be someone you are not. 

i get it can be hard to imagine if this is what you’re used to in past relationships, but please trust me and others here when we say, there are people out there who will love you for you, and treat you right. and you deserve that. even if there *weren’t*, being single and loving yourself enough not to let people treat you so poorly is still infinitely better than becoming a human doormat in a relationship where you should be equals
My boyfriend has a hard time adjusting to my pronouns since it’s just a force of habit for him to see me femininely. He does it around people that would remind him or have reminded him, but strangers he generally forgets. He’s getting better and we’ve had a few arguments over it- he would say the same thing, and that it would make him uncomfortable to do so. I simply told him that it’s my identity, and a word to him means the *world* to me. 

However…this is troubling. If he’s so vehemently challenging a simple request from you, it’s time to reconsider your relationship . If he actually loves you he’d make it about your collective feelings and not “freedoms”. You don’t have to coldheartedly dump him, but please have a conversation and try to understand why he feels that way. If it’s a situation where he rejects your identity and denies you, that is not someone you can stay with. They will constantly make you feel less than. 

Anything concerning how you wish to be perceived is never an overreaction. If your boyfriend had asked you not to call him a certain nickname anymore because it made him feel bad, you’d respect that, right? And anything less than support would be considered harmful. Just because this is about your gender doesn’t mean that it can’t equate to something else, and you should never have to invalidate yourself to try and please anyone else. 

Like another commenter said, “if he doesn’t respect your pronouns, he doesn’t respect you”.
DTMFA
If he can’t respect this simple request because of his fREedOm, then he doesn’t respect you. DUMP HIS ASS.
you are NOT overreacting; he is. i’m sorry but i don’t see how this will work out if he doesn’t respect your basic humanity.
I'd just be repeating everyone else at this point when I say ""leave,"" so I'll just say this. If he's refusing to use your pronouns, he only wants to be with a false version of you that he wants, not the real you.
Your identity is more important than some faux freedom your boyfriend is claiming. If he isn't your ex-boyfriend tomorrow because of this, he'll be your ex-boyfriend in another month or three anyway. He doesn't respect very important parts of who you are, and that will not be only applicable to your pronouns.
So two options here, 

One, break up with him. 

Two, explain to your girlfriend that she should be respecting your pronouns, and if she doesn’t, it’s very disrespectful. The only reason she wouldn’t is to disrespect you. And if I had a girlfriend who did that, I wouldn’t be ok with it (for context I’m saying use she/her pronouns till he stops)
I know it can be so hard reading ""dump him"" or ""he doesn't respect you, break up with him"" on something you're not even sure is that big of a deal. I felt the same way whenever I asked random strangers on the internet about aspects of my relationships that I was struggling with. Because they don't know me! They don't know him! They don't know all the great things about our relationship! They don't know how much I love him and how much he loves me! They don't know how hard it would be or how difficult it is to imagine my life without him.

But ask yourself this - if your friend asked the same question you're asking, what would your response be?

Because in the end, if you've talked to him about it and he refuses, he clearly has no respect for your identity and no respect for you. He can see it hurts you not to do this and he doesn't care, he's still deliberately misgendering you. To correctly gender you is the very LEAST and most basic thing you'd expect from someone you love and he can't even do that.
If he cant respect that small thing he doesn't respect you. Break up with him and move on there's tons of decent people out there who will
If you’re not having him arrested or sued for not using the correct pronouns, his freedoms are fine. 

It doesn’t seem unusual for partners to do this, but we know this because when this happens, posters come here feeling angry and hurt. 

You’re not overreacting to leave him. He’s doing a thing that makes you feel bad on the regular. A thing that he knows makes you feel bad, and you have asked him not to do. If nothing else, the fact that he doesn’t care that he upsets you, and feels entitled to do so, is a really worrying feature to have in a partner.
I think people have already said part of what I wanted to say, and that I think you recognize a bit as well, which is that it's weird and self-centering for him to try to make this a matter of his ""freedom"". What you're asking isn't unreasonable, and while it might be new or confusing to him, there are a lot of ways for him to communicate that in a way that respects you as an individual.

The second thing I want to touch on, as an agender person who has dated a lot of different people including cis men, is that who we are is so much more than just pronouns. You deserve to have getting them right be your minimum, not your ceiling, even if that can feel challenging after an experience like this. There are lots of complex and beautiful ways to be seen, respected, desired and affirmed in your gender by your partner, and you deserve to find that OP! Best of luck with everything.
Respecting pronouns is respecting you.
You mean he's your *ex* boyfriend, right?
While I don't think it's an uncommon experience, it is still a sogn the person doesn't respect you, and you should just leave. He's not gonna make you happy if that's the level of respect he's willing to give you.
you are not over-reacting at all. he's showing you that he doesn't give a fuck about your happiness. believe him.
your ex boyfriend***

i fixed it :b

nah but really my friend he needs to respect your pronouns to respect you. he probably is too scared to admit he’s in a mlnb relationship. he’s probably just trying to pretend you’re your agab. he can go fuck himself and all of us have your back. you are valid and deserve so much better!
When I decided to change my pronouns my fiance (boyfriend at the time) was very supportive because he will love me and respect me no matter what. Thats what a relationship is about. I can't tell you what to do, but think about how this makes you feel. Then think about the future. If it stays like this in the future will you be okay with feeling like this forever? Do what you think is best for you, because you deserve it.
My favourite phrase is freedom of speech isn't freedom from consequence. He is free to use whichever pronouns he chooses but that doesn't mean you have to put up with disrespect. You are not overreacting by leaving a relationship where you aren't respected.
Dump him
friend, throw the whole dang boyfriend out
Drop him darling. Never have the closest person in your life be someone that doesn’t even see you for who you are. Not worth your time.
Your boyfriend should respect your gender identity, break up with this douchebag omg
You are not being unreasonable. There's a big difference between a significant other asking for some grace while they get used to using your new pronouns and occasionally messing up... and then, flat out refusing to respect your pronouns. That's a big red flag. You deserve better, OP. If it was me... I'd leave.
The day I told my wife I was agender, she began using they/them when referring to me. Your bf is being an ass and you may want to rethink your relationship.
time to break up!
break👏🏻up👏🏻w👏🏻him👏🏻
Please drop his transphobic ass. If your significant other can’t respect you enough to address you properly, they shouldn’t be your significant other, or even in your life.
my wife struggles a little bit. She cried when \*she\* came out as trans because she realized she had been so shitty refusing to use they/them for me. but honestly? She's been pretty damn good about it since then. My mom even started calling me they/them. You deserve better.
Ex-boyfriend**
Not your boyfriend then. Case closed!
Drop his ass like a hot iron
He doesn't have to. Nobody *has* to.  If you don’t like it, he's not for you, find someone who will use your pronouns.
Dump him like the trash that he is! You're definitely not overreacting. He's being disrespectful to you, and you deserve better. Even if it's *not* unusual, that doesn't make it okay for him to do it. It's phobic, plain and simple.
I think you mean your EX-boyfriend.  Dump that creep.  I wasted my time with a straight dude for several years and I still feel gross about it.  You don’t need that crap
Please break up with him — this is a fundamental human right of yours (ours!) and his “freedom” ends where he is oppressing another person’s right to life, liberty, and (pursuit of) happiness. BEST TO YOU!
You're not being unreasonable. My partner is solidly in his 40s and has spent his whole life as a mostly straight male, he grew up blue collar in Chicago in the 80s and has been trained in every way by the culture he was raised in to not respect pronouns. And he has **never once** disrespected mine or my other enby friends. He realizes a persons pronouns are about *them*, not about *him.* Your boyfriend is being a self centered twat and you are not overreacting in the slightest. Listen to your gut and break things off.
He doesn't respect you if he doesn't use your pronouns. It won't stop there, either. Leave while you can
Your ex boyfriend sounds like an asshole
He sounds like a dick. Even if it was normal, if it is important to you then he should respect that. Sounds like he cares on for himself in your relationship, leave him and show him you're worth much more.
Use she/her pronouns to refer to him from now on. And also break up with him. Its just about respect. You are asking him to respect you and he is telling you he is too self centered to be capable of such a thing.
Acting like insisting on pronouns is an infringement on freedom is Jordan Peterson rhetoric. Jordan Peterson is, let us say, *bad news*. I would not be eager to trust one of his fans
Obviously everyone's different, and looking for different things from different types of relationships with other people. But broadly speaking I think that people generally want a partner who loves them, who respects them, who looks after them and has their health and well-being as a priority.

Having been told what pronouns you want used to refer to you, he has refused. Not that he's using the wrong ones without being aware, or that he's forgetting through habit but showing he's making some effort to get it right, but that he is making the choice not to. That's not a sign that he has your interests at heart, or that he respects you.

Now maybe in every other way possibly measurable or assessable, he's amazingly awesome. Or maybe there's been some sort of miscommunication (which I'm struggling to imagine), or he was having a bad day and reacted unusually because of those other things he was dealing with. But I suspect that if he's claiming that his ""freedom"" is more important than your comfort and mental health, then it wouldn't surprise me if there were other ways he wasn't being a great example of humanity. 

Whatever you decide to do, choosing to stop spending time with someone who places more importance on saying what they want and expecting no consequences than they do on looking after the people they claim to like would \*not\* be an overreaction.
break up with him. you deserve so much better.
Dump him
My bf started using mine day one and changed them later down the line when I went from they/them and partner to he/him and bf. My best friend immediately treated me like one of the guys. You can do better sweety lol. There are better people out there.
Dump his ass
Refusing to use my pronouns would be an absolute deal breaker for me. It's one thing if your pronouns changed during the relationship and he needed a bit of grace as he got used to them.  But refusing? And acting like respecting you is some how oppressing him? Gross, transphobic, would not touch with a 10 ft pole.
BREAK UP TIME
This is absolutely out of the ordinary for respectful partners. You’re being absolutely and entirely reasonable. Bye bye boyfriend
My good person it sounds like you should just leave him. If he doesn't respect your pronouns then he doesn't respect YOU.
D U M P  
  H I M
Right now, he doesn't see you as Non-binary and that's not cool. Maybe he can learn. Or maybe this is a sign. Sometimes it can take a bit for people to get used to it, but if he refuses to even try that's a red flag.

Me, I tend to date bi/pan people or homo/heteroflexible people. I've had too many guys try to 'straight date' me and I'm so done with that. It's demoralizing and invalidating. You deserve better.
I promise there are people out there who love and know you for YOU, and who celebrate with you in your happiest identity expression
This is not unreasonable at all! If he can't respect something as simple as pronouns, then what else won't he respect? How much will he push back on boundaries just cause he can? Not using someone's pronouns, the simplest thing in life, is ridiculous. So drop him quickly
The fact that it isn't out of the usual doesn't mean it's ok.

It isn't.

Dump him.

Find someone respectful.

If they mess up a couple times it's ok, but if they misgender you on purpose and complain about your pronouns then that's not someone you should stay in a relationship with.
So you set a boundary, he knew that this boundary is very important to you and disrespecting it means to hurt you. And he crossed it - assumingly several times already and instead of an apology you get a selfish explaination about his freedom of speech. So he knows that it hurt you and he does it nevertheless. I asume he want to hurt you. This is mental abuse and you don't have to explain anything to him - you have a right to leave immediately. You have a right to say no and go without an explanation. You're his partner and not his parent, coach or psychologist.

If this is his reaction than it won't get better imho.
Generally speaking every couple changes over time. And if it's right for them they change not in opposite directions. He decided that he doesn't want to make the slightest step into your direction. Boundaries and respect is the essence of being a couple.  So even if you would try to educate him (what is not your problem, not something you need to do or should do for your mental health), there would be other things, where he refuses to grow with you.

And even if you would give him the 100th chance to do it right (I wouldn't recommend it). He already proved that he is not a worthy partner by crossing that said boundary to hurt you. Imagine you 2 get married or have/adopt kids or want to make other mighty life-changing decisions together, some that involves financial decisions etc . Is he the one for that? Could you trust him after that all?

You deserve a mature partner that respects you and loves you for you being yourself. 💜
It sadly isn't unusual for partners to react like this. It is, however, very unusual to stay with partners for long afterwards.

People go through a period of adjustment when the people close to them come out. That is normal, and sometimes people come to terms with their loved ones' genders. But often they don't, and I must say by the sounds of it, this might be one of those cases (because he's acting like you don't even have the right to ask).
Dump him, it's such a small ask, and he won't do it. He doesn't respect you and you deserve better. Sorry you're dealing with this.
When I married my wife I used she/her pronouns but through doing some self development and evaluation I realised I’ve always been Enby and I use they/them pronouns have done for 2-3 years my wife always tries to get them right and apologises and says the correct ones , we have been together 14 years now and we always talk and I try to explain how things make me feel.
Big rock to his head?
Basic respect for others is ‘Infringing his freedom’ yeah you need a new boyfriend
You are not overreacting, you deserve better than someone who refuses to even try
You deserve basic RESPECT
I’d give him a bit more time to get his head round it and express how important it is to you and keep picking it up when he doesn’t use your preferred pronouns, if it keeps on happening you have to say that if you can’t respect this he doesn’t respect you as an equal and that this will just not work
I cut off my own parents for not trying. I'd have thrown him out and never spoken again the first time he complained about being asked to do better. No one is worth taking that kind of disrespect.
He's invalidating your identity, that alone should be more than enough reason to break it off.
I'm seeing a lot of people saying how your ""boyfriend"" isn't good for you. And I agree with that. He's simply refusing to respect you as a good partner should.

That said, I think we could be doing better to uplift your own self. You deserve to feel comfortable with your own identity, no matter what anyone else says. I, for one, am rooting for you. <3
No, you're not over reacting. He has no respect for you and is very selfish by making this about his ""freedom "".

Dump him!
You mean your EX boyfriend?  Anyone who continues to do something you say hurts you should be on the chopping block.  Period.  Sheesh.
I live in a country where language is totally gendered (like we gender words like chair or moon) and my boyfriend still uses my correct pronouns even though it may look/sound weird and new 
If he doesnt respect you, break up with him, its not worth it
Fire him, sorry
run, fast.
Honey if he refuses to use your correct pronouns then he's not your boyfriend anymore
you’re not overreacting. he needs to go.
solid red flag, run
You’re not being unreasonable in the slightest. If he continues to decide that he doesn’t need to respect a very core part of your identity then you’re wasting your time with him. I would definitely try getting him to understand first though before breaking things off, but that’s just me.
Dump him. This just proves he doesn’t really care about you
his freedom my ass. he should either use your pronouns or get lost.
Sounds like you got an ex boyfriend
“X makes me uncomfortable. Please do Y instead.”

“No.” <keeps doing X>
my partner always uses she/her with me (i go by they/them) but the important thing is they’re TRYING! if he’s not willing to even try, he’s not worth it sadly🥺
Holy red flags Batman, I see a reason to dump this motherfucker!
Talk to him, ask why he refuses to use the correct pronouns. It may be hard, but I’d advise dumping him. It’s NOT worth staying with someone who refuses to validate you. Your sanity is worth so much more than his comfort.
Yup. I had an ex friend that would always get my pronouns wrong. She'd apologize and switch, but when she came out as trans to me a couple years back, I would use her pronouns constantly because as an enby, pronouns are important to me and to other queer people and I wanted to show her I supported her. 

She barely returned that same respect to me when i told her several years ago before she came out to me. 
If people don't return the same respect to you, they don't care. I hope you find people that will respect that, op. It matters.
No, this is not okay at all. If he doesn't respect your gender then he will never respect you.
Are you okay?  The fact that you don't think his lack of respect is a big deal kind of worries me.   Are you used to having family and friends disrespect you and disrespect boundaries? It might be time to see a therapist
no deal for me. 

if he doesn't respect something as s simple as the pronouns you use, what's to stop him from disrespecting something else, like boundaries placed? 

don't wanna use my pronouns? fine. have fun finding a new partner, cos this one's out.
This is not reasonable behavior. Using the right pronouns is not the most one could ever hope to expect, it is the bare minimum respect for someone's identity. His freedom is not being infringed by you asking him to use the right pronouns, he's just being an asshole to you. Please leave for your own sake.
You are not being unreasonable.   This is a good time to assess your entire relationship then determine if he is worth it.  Only put your life beside someone who will respect you.
Don't waste any more time on someone who doesn't respect you.
Respect is a requirement - If he can’t respect your pronouns, he doesn’t respect you. You’re well within your rights to leave & you deserve to have your pronouns respected!
will you be able to deal with that long term? or will you feel like you're ignoring your identity and being invalidated when you're with your partner. if you feel like you can cope with that then stay, if you feel you can't then leave
There are plenty of people who would be interested in dating you AND will want to use the pronouns YOU prefer. You absolutely deserve to break things off with him. You are not overreacting.

It might be normal in a transphobic world, but it's certainly not right.
Youre not overreacting. Its one thing if he slips up sometimes but is actually making an effort to get your pronouns right, vs him straight refusing to use them and acting like it hurts him more than you. Break it off. Let him know that and that hes being unreasonable. Because /what/ freedom would you be infringing, exactly? Freedom of speech? Sure, he has the freedom to be a disrespectful ass, but he certainly does NOT have the freedom from being broken up with as a consequence to that.
If he isn't using your pronouns you are incompatible. And other than being a massive asshole, he isn't attracted to your gender, you aren't gonna have a good time trust me
There's a difference between adjusting to new pronouns and outrightly refusing to use new pronouns. My partner and kid constantly revert to my old pronouns, but I know it's not on purpose. I know they are trying and that they love me. From how you explain it, your partner seems to be doing this intentionally. If my partner was doing the same thing, I'd ask him if he feels he could ever use my pronouns correctly. If he says no, then I could be pretty certain that he doesn't see me as who I am. And personally, I couldn't be with someone who felt that way.
When I first got with my partner he told me it was difficult for him because he saw me as a female. But he loves & respects me enough to keep trying. If you don't have that minimal amount of effort from him, I don't think he's the one for any non-binary person, tbf. Find someone who loves & respects you, for you. No less!
this would personally make me very uncomfortable and i wouldn't want to be in a relationship with someone who does this. for me, there are red flags on multiple levels with this one, but two big things stand out to me. first, he is choosing not to respect a quite simple, harmless request of yours, which makes me suspicious of whether he respects you in general. secondly, he perceives you as a gender you are not and refuses to acknowledge you as the gender that you are. pronouns of course necessarily don't equal gender but considering the subreddit we're in i would assume you are not cis. i would not be comfortable in a relationship where i was perceived as a girl or a guy or anything that i am not, especially not a close romantic relationship. i don't think you are overreacting by any means. whether you continue the relationship or not is up to you, but i get the feeling this guy isn't that great for you.
Not overreacting for sure. He's not respecting your pronouns. Relationships are for both sides to feel better, not to put one down.
Listen, if he isn't respecting your pn, give it a bit of time, tell him how you feel, and if he still doesn't respect it, find someone who will 💛 My bf is starting to get there, I prefer the name Saturn, and he met me as Kyra, and he's still stumbling quite often, but he's trying. So find someone who will at least try, you got this hun 🥰😇
Never feel like you are overreacting for wanting common Decency
You’re not overreacting. Sounds like he’s drank the right wing koolaid. If being asked to respect his SO’s pronouns is an infringement on his free speech, do you think he’s going to react well when you ask for other things?

Break it off now. I’m not the type to be like “dump him” immediately, but if he’s repeating those right wing calling cards to a person he’s supposed to *love*, then idk what hope there is for him
He's not the one for you. Don't be with someone who hurts you and doesn't even try not to. You know you deserve better. You don't want to be unhappy like this in the long-term. 

  
Leave today. Be free instead. :)
More like your *ex* boyfriend refuses to use your pronouns

You deserve to be respected. If something like your identity and comfort aren't important to him, you deserve better.
If he were having a hard time, but making an effort, it would be one thing.

The fact that he's refusing entirely and making it about his ""freedom of speech"" means he's not fit to be in a relationship with another person. He should want to treat his partner in a way that makes them feel respected and loved. If that is a ridiculous limitation for him, then he can enjoy the freedom of being single.
Break up. It is out of the usual for good caring partners to do. He sounds like he cares much more for whatever he has for you in his head than actual you.
Dump the bugger. If he doesn't respect your identity then he's not worth your time
Dump him. If he can't be bothered to use your pronouns, then he doesn't have even basic respect for you, and why would you want to be with someone who doesn't respect you?
others have for sure already said this but you deserve better. 
you get to be treated in ways that don't hurt. 
he doesn't respect you, or your pronouns. 
you'll find someone better who actually cares for and respects you.
Please break up with him. This is emotional abuse.
Break up and curse out ngl
DUMP HIS ASs PLS
I’m hoping for an update where you refer to him as exbf tbh
If he doesn't have enough respect to respect your pronouns that means he doesn't respect you and in a relationship you both need to have respect for each other's wishes so I don't think that it's an overreaction. I feel like it's the correct reaction.
You are not overreacting or being unreasonable. Using someone's pronouns isn't about ""freedom of speech"" it's about showing someone that you respect and care for them. That you see them for who they are and you acknowledge it. Basic human decency stuff. 

If your boyfriend can't do this bare minimum of showing you he respects your identity, then he doesn't respect you imo. I'd dump him and find someone who does.
You are not overreacting. That is really rude. This has NOTHING to do with free speech, and EVERYTHING to do with respect. He is refusing to see you for you and disrespecting you. I'm so sorry that you are going through this. 

To quote someone who escaped North Korea, freedom is a responsibility.  You get to choose what type of person you want to be, and he has chosen to be an absolute jerkwad.

I can forgive and show grace to someone trying to use my pronouns and messing up now and then, but this is rough. You are not at all unreasonable for wanting to end things. It's def unusual for partners to do this. 

I'm afab nonbinary pansexual, and I personally rarely get into relationships anymore with cis het dudes for this reason.. Some have been really accepting, but some people's social circles are devoid of non-heteronormative people and their responses/reactions to anyone under the lgbtqia2+ umbrella are bigoted and awful sometimes.
When I told my boyfriend I was non-binary he was like ok lol. I mean he gets the pronouns wrong sometimes which for me is she/they but he’s learning. We’ve been together 10 years. I’d say that the only fights we’ve had were never about morals and values but stupid normal stuff like money/finances, practical things. He’s gone out of his way to try to combine binary labels to making up one for me sort of lmao (referring to empanada story on here). His cousin, however, whom was one of my best friends has been more or less against the idea (probably because he has/had a crush on me). He’s more conservative nowadays for sure. He doesn’t disrespect me but he just doesn’t care enough to try hard but it could be changing lol. 

This is all to say that love isn’t hard. It’s ever evolving. Nobody stays the same forever. Some people want to stunt their growth while others are constantly growing. I’m fortunate enough to have someone who loves growing like I do. I’d suggest you too find someone worth growing with. Unless he actually feels like losing you would be the worst thing in the world and he’s willing to try and meet you half way at least, it won’t get better unfortunately 💔 my heart goes out to you.
Nope, break that shit off. He’s refusing to do the bare minimum to accept and respect you.
He doesn’t respect you
throw the whole man away
Explain that he is choosing to hurt you and this is actively damaging and dehumanizing. If he doesn’t understand that, I’d dump him
FREEDOM OF SPEECH does not apply in a RELATIONSHIP. Your boyfriend can’t call you ugly and claim breaking up with him is an infringement on his freedom of speech. DUMP HIM. He clearly doesn’t respect you.
If he truly cares about you, he will use your preferred pronouns. It's obvious that your feelings are not a priority for him. This is a huge red flag. Dump him and find someone who is worthy.
""An anfringement of his freedom"" are you in a relationship or political negotiations
Don't ""break up"" *with* him. *Dump him*. There's a difference.
*EX boyfriend
Fuck him, you deserve so much better
He is denying your identity lmfao you can’t be with him unless .. idk
Ditch him. 

It's not an infringement of anyone's freedoms to, you know, respect basic human dignity.

A good partner respect your identity, not makes you fight for it.
Breaking up would absolutely be more than reasonable. If he can't give you the most basic modicum of respect by using your pronouns, then he's not worth your time and energy. I would never, in a thousand years, date anybody who had a problem with the pronouns I use; it suggests that he doesn't respect you.
Dump him
Run, now. My ex was on that whole kick about ""being forced to use bs pronouns"" and I wasn't even out as NB yet. It was pure disrespect spurred by hateful ideology and only made me feel worse about myself as I realized I didn't fit neatly into these boxes people push on us.
yes your partner has his autonomy, he doesnt *have* to respect you. but do you want to be with someone who doesn't? i dont think it is an over reaction to break up with him over this,though some might because ""its just a pronoun"". but this is your boyfriend, your partner. youre supposed to have mutual respect for each other.  it isnt just preference or an undesired nickname. it boils down to respect. does he respect you, your identity because if he doesn't then he probably doesn't respect your choices or your boundaries.
or you could spend a month or so calling him by the wrong pronouns, if you just wana be petty
yes it is absolutely fucking unusual for a partner to do this. this isnt a case of him not understanding, he actively refuses and says its an “infringement of his freedom to speak”… it’s also within his freedom to speak to say heinous hate speech against any demographic, but would you stay with him if he did that? i sure hope you wouldn’t.

he’s a fucking asshole. break up with him. you deserve better. if your partner doesn’t love you for YOU, then you won’t last no matter how you twist it.
I’m sorry your bf is being shitty. It’s certainly not an unreasonable request for him to put in the effort. The only thing I would constitute as normal is a partner needing more help and corrections at first (maybe a tad bit of frustration around it, but certainly not at you) until they can get it or self-correct. Outright refusing is a big red flag to me. 

It might be worth while (if you haven’t already) to be very upfront about the fact that this IS a dealbreaker if he continues this behavior. Also, laying out how disrespectful it is and if he claims to love and respect you, your new pronouns and gender journey are a part of that. If he can’t do that, I’d walk
Why do you think it'd be an over reaction to break up with someone who doesn't show you any respect or care about your feelings?
Sit him down and tell him how important it is to you. Ask why you asking him to do something for you as a favor is infringing on his freedom. If you asked him to not curse around your parents, would that be infringing on his freedom? Ask him how he’d feel if you started referring to him as she her. If you called up your friend and your friend asked and you said, “oh, Mark? *She’s* here right now. Want me to say ‘hi’ to *her* for you?” “Oh hAi MaRk.” Would she not like that? And ask her to elaborate on why she does or does not care. Can she see why someone would not like that? I’d be shocked if she didn’t want you to go back to calling her he/him.

My ex, before coming out as NB, didn’t like their given name being used, and insisted on the more gender-neutral nickname based on it. I really liked their given name but made an effort to not use it. You know why I did? Because I respected and cared about my partner’s feelings. Sorry, OP, it sounds like your boy is consuming too much rightwing political commentary, or otherwise exposed to it.
Not an overreaction at all, in any relationship especially in a romantic relationship you deserve to feel safe and accepted as you are.
Regardless of your partners beliefs the simple truth is this: you share your world with your partner. The most intimate details of you life. You should never settle for a partner who isn't respectful and understanding of your experience. You deserve better and can do better.  I promise you that.  They're not the one for you if they don't see who you are.
It is unbelievable that someone would choose to be that way to you. You deserve someone who chooses to respect you. Even if he didn't understand at first, but was willing to learn and grow as a person for you, that would have been fine too. If he is unwilling to even learn how to make you happier, you need to get rid of him. If he can't even respect a pronoun, what else won't he respect? Boundaries? Consent? I wouldn't wait to find out. He sounds like a selfish asshole. He isn't worth your time.
Dump his ass
Hey OP, this is super late, but I want to address a more general point besides the excellent points made by everyone else:

1. The point of dating is to get experiences with different people and to find out what you enjoy and what you cannot tolerate. Don't worry about if some behavior you cannot tolerate is normal or not, find out for yourself! 
2. Most breakups aren't preceded by a singular horrible event that necessitates  the end of the relationship. It isn't over reacting to break up with someone because you no longer want to be with them! That's normal.
3. ""Red flags"", like little disrespectful behaviors that don't seem relationship ending on the surface, are  red flags because they warn of more serious bad behavior in the future. The question isn't ""is this offense serious enough"", but ""can I tolerate this pattern of behavior in the long run"". 

All in all, the point I'm making is that you should shift your mindset from ""am I justified in breaking up with them over this"" to ""is this relationship healthy for both of us and something both of us want to continue"". Seemingly very small actions that indicate that is no longer the case are perfectly valid reasons to break up with someone. You are not unreasonable.
You aren't overreacting and you aren't asking for much. 

I'm married and discovered that I'm non-binary after being together many years. I'm bisexual but he is straight. It was a lot of honest communication from both of us. He respects me and basically said, I guess I'm bi too because I love you and want to be with you. 

He slips every now and then with my pronouns but that's okay, he corrects and we move on. It's better and better the more we use them. 

Calling someone by the name they want and use the pronouns they want is the bare minimum of being a decent person imo.
He's using ""free speech"" as a defense for emotional abuse. He'll do worse given time.
Honestly if you’re nonbinary and those are his views on ‘freedoms’, you’re probably not compatible
that ain't your boyfriend, that's a scrub
Break up with him if he won't
Dump. Him. You deserve someone who is going to respect you.
oh, you mean your EX-boyfriend? wink wink shove shove?
all the partners ive had that refused to respect my pronouns have coincidentally all been mentally and physically abusive to me, but thats just my take :P
nope. go with your gut! you’re not overreacting in any way, if they don’t respect you enough to see you as who you are they don’t deserve your presence ✨
Yeah no breaking up is *not* an over-reaction. He is putting his feelings over your deeply held sense of self. That is a massive act of betrayal and signifies that he loves an idea of you, but not you for who you are. 

Think about if you had a trans or nonbinary partner. Would you ever consider misgendering them? I'm gonna guess no because why tf would you deliberately hurt someone you supposedly love? Furthermore, why would you *defend* yourself for hurting them rather than apologise when they tell them you that you hurt them? That is not love.

Throw the dude away and find someone who doesn't think twice about giving you the basic respect you're owed.
You've got to stop making excuses for your boyfriends shitty distasteful and disrespectful behavior. If he's doing something, anything that upsets you and you make him aware of this and he continues doing the thing that upsets you that's a major red flag. It's unfortunate that some people are like this especially bigoted cishet people and I'm sorry your boyfriend is intentionally misgendering you that's not right. You deserve someone who will see you for the real you and will respect your wishes. Breaking up would be the healthiest decision. It might hurt now but later you'll be looking back at this being very glad you did and maybe even realizing all the red flags that were present that you didn't notice at first. Trust me on this one.
I am an enby who was with my cishet partner for 7 years before I realized I was ace AND transmasc enby, and he has been nothing but supportive. It’s been almost three years since then and things are GREAT. 

He immediately started using my pronouns and loved it. He even adjusted when I said I liked he/him pronouns, he even uses them when we’re intimate and doesn’t have a single issue with being perceived as gay or queer. 
That’s what you and every other trans/nonbinary or queer person deserve.
Respecting your pronouns means respecting you and who you are. If he cant do that he cant respect you and thats it, period. If youre aware of someones pronouns you should always use them, even if you despise someone. But the fact that he is in this position of closeness to you and refuses? Absolutely not okay. Find someone who respects you because I promise, someone will. You deserve a love you can grow in.
My boyfriend struggles A LOT with using the right pronouns for me. He's finally getting better with my chosen name after a year and a half of practice. He also gets upset sometimes when I correct him. But I know he is trying, so I'm doing my best to be patient. I think that's the important distinction, is your boyfriend trying or is he purposely misgendering you? If he's intentionally misgendering you, knowing that it hurts you in doing so then you need to protect yourself and end the relationship. I'm not sure what his reasoning is for intentionally misgendering you but if he cannot respect you as a person, then he doesn't deserve you
Break up with him
So he doesn't respect your identity and so you think you're overreacting?! Oh no, you need to leave this dolt - he doesn't see you for who you are. He sees exactly what he wants to see and nothing more. You're not non binary to him or else he would respect your pronouns and use them without needing being asked.
My partner went for she/they to they/them to any to they/them to they/he. 
You wanna know what I did? Respected their decisions and their expressions because I love him. They did the same with me. 
All this to say, your bf isn't respecting you. It isn't an overreaction to break up with him because of it. I hate to say it, but that means he doesn't love you, he loved the way you used to present yourself. Find someone who will respect you and your pronouns, no matter how many times they change. Gender is a hard journey. You don't need to waste that journey with people who will only bring you down. I wish you lots of luck and love.
You are not overreacting. Dump him.   
If he does not respect you enough to do something as basic as use your correct pronouns there will be other things he will not respect about you.   
In the words of the great Maya Angelou ""When people show you who they are, believe them the first time.""  
Get out!
My s/o uses my pronouns and corrects herself everytime she slips up , I'm not tryna intrude but prioritizing a friend that actually respects you is better imo than dealing with people who fight over your own identity ...
Break up absolutely. My ex and current bf always use proper pronouns and respect my gender identity even tho they are both cishet.
Using your pronouns is a form of respect. He's openly disrespecting you. Break it off. If he can't be bothered to adress you properly he might not be bothered to respect you mentally or physically, too. 

Do not sacrifice your sanity and joy for someone who doesn't love you.
important sidenote: just because it's average or usual for partners to do doesn't make it ok. analyze how you feel about something and whether you're willing to work with it, never think about what's ""normal"" - many things have been ""normal"" for relationships in the past (and even now) that are absurd and abusive in nature

edit: which isn't to say this is normal, i don't think it is. my point is even if it was normal that wouldn't make it ok or worth dealing with if it caused you distress
DUMP HIM
Dump him
Break up with him he doesnt respect you
This is where we tell you to dump him
It’s not unreasonable at all! He should respect you, which means respecting your pronouns. My wife borderline is ready to fistfight people who intentionally misgender me on the regular.
NTA divorce
Friend, you deserve so much better than someone who won’t respect your pronouns/identity. Breaking up is not an overreaction, and if I were you, I’d absolutely tell him to either make the effort to respect you or get out
You're not unreasonable. He's disrespectful.

Dump him. You deserve better.
Not overreacting if you break up, transphobes shouldn’t be with trans partners, that’s ridiculously unfair. Transphobes need to learn & you putting up with it is just gonna cause a power imbalance in the relationship, sorry OP :((

My guess is either: he’s just straight up transphobic for the sake of it, or he sees himself as gay/straight & either doesn’t wanna accept that he’s bi, or doesn’t wanna break up so refuses to accept you’re not a gender he’s attracted to anymore :((

I could be wrong but those seem most plausible
I respect the pronouns of people who abused the shit out of me, if we're in a relationship respecting your pronouns is easily expected
When I expressed my pronouns with my partner, he started to use them right away, he didn’t use my preferred pronouns around the people i didn’t want to know yet, and he reminds anyone who does know to use the correct one when they mess up. To me, this is the only way a partner should handle that situation. You deserve to be the most supported and comfortable around your partner. Breaking up with him is definitely not over reacting. If he can not respect and support you then he is not worth it.
Get a new bf
you have the right to be respected, if he refuses to, you should re evaluate your relationship!!!
My partner *immediately* started using my new pronouns when I came out to him, because he loves and respects me. I would take a refusal to use your pronouns as a lack of respect, care, and empathy. That's not someone you want to be in a relationship with. What will they disregard next?
#dumped
You are not overacting, he doesnt respect you and doesnt deserve you, you are too good for him.

Don't waste your life with a partner who doesn't love the true you, as if they did they would respect you.  


Please don't destroy your happiness by remaining with someone who only cares about their own and at your expense.
you’re not over reacting 

break up he sounds unsafe
My boyfriend accepted I'm nonbinary, before me. Because I had difficulties admitting. He started (wth my consent) using different pronouns because he could see my struggle with gender. We have a pretty open communication around it. He is cis/straight, though he recently said he things sexuality also is too strict in the society and he doesn't think he wants to label himself with straight though same-sex is not really his cup of tea (meaning, he is heterosexual but not homosexual, but also not entirely straight because he is in love with me).   
He once failed to allow me say my pronouns in an event he was leading, but he then publicly and privately apologized,multiple times because it was still hurting. the hurt isn't the important thing here, but him acknowledging, and trying his absolute best to show up, make me feel heard and loved.   


I can't imagine how it feels for you, to be denied for your identity, or unacknowledged. Messing up, confusion, etc. is fine, but clearly refusing to even try just shows this person might have some really conflicting values from yours. doesn't make him a bad person or doesn't make you ""needy/asking for too much"", it's just difference in values and in a relationship you might want those core/important values to be held commonly between both of you...   


and besides, wouldn't u want them to see you and refer to you the way you prefer to be referred to? like that's bare minimum
Dump him yesterday.
I think you’ll probably have to break up, due to “absolutely refuses” and “infringement of his freedom”. 🙁 He is not being reasonable or compassionate.

Normally I advise people who have recently come out as trans or non-binary to have some patience with their partners as their partners process the new information. They need to adjust their view of you. They might need to adjust their view of their own sexual orientation, in accordance with you not having the gender they thought you did. This can take some time.

But someone who refuses to process doesn’t support you and doesn’t deserve your patience. I’m sorry.
You are underreacting honestly. At the first mention of him not respecting my pronouns, I would have been out. I wouldn’t even argue my point because I shouldn’t have to. Someone either respects you or they don’t. You can argue someone into respecting you.
“Infringement of his freedom”? I may not have had a partner before, but I’ll say this. If this guy is gonna disrespect you like that, I say he’s not worth it. You deserve better!
The idea that respecting someone's pronouns is like a jail sentence for him is stupid. I can only say from my point of view but after being in a relationship with a narcissist, this is a BIG warning sign of borderline narcissism. Narcissists deny other's reality and will gaslight them. I think maybe if you thought about it, he probably has other warning signs but you just don't know it because you think it's ""you"" and not him. 

Dr. Ramani on youtube is a great source of information on this, her channel is highly recommended. I'm not diagnosing anyone but at the same time, you deserve someone who doesn't gaslight you which is what he's doing.
Why people care so much about their pronouns? 

Like, what importance it has?
Neo-Pronouns are foolish
Hahah

my pronouns:  
him her they them+++++++++++   
I'm binary   
I'm code 1001111001   
and it's none of ur fu\*king business.
I knew its been 2 months and all, but I just wanted to give you my opinion on the matter. Your boyfriend doesnt seem to have respect towards you. The fact he doesnt want to use your pronouns even though he's your boyfriend is beyond me. I believe he doesnt see you for you, just want to see you as your assignment was at birth honestly. If he doesnt see you for you he really just doesnt love you. I honestly see this as a start of a toxic or abusive relationship. No your not overreacting, he's not respecting your identity, that means theirs no love in your relationship. Its the same way as a trans binary person getting into a relationship with a cis gender, but the cis gender person calls the trans individual by the opposite pronoun instead of their actually pronoun and should they see that as respect? No neither should you, so I highly believe you should just end it with him. Hes suppose to be the love of your life, the one who is suppose to be their until the very end, not trigger your whole identity just like your parents most likely would. So yeah, just end it with him.
love that one. blew my mind when i read it many years ago.
Yeah... when did freedom of speech become a reason to hate? It's so sad, but so is most of America lol
I remember hearing the story of an attorney that would condescendingly tell people they didn’t understand the first amendment when people cited it. I thought, “how can you be friends with that prick?” Now after years of dealing with the people whom this comic was aimed at, I see why the attorney was that way.

Alternately, I like the argument that uses the first amendment against those people: the freedom of association has the corollary of freedom to NOT associate, and that’s what people are exercising when they don’t want to deal with your shit.
In my opinion it's an over-reaction.
Why does he need to use your pronouns and why is it that serious.
Well said. As an enby, this would be an absolute dealbreaker for me.
Literally came here to say the same thing, leave before it gets worse, speaking from experience.
^^^^^thissss
Preach! You can leave a relationship where a partner doesn't respect you. That can show up in other horrible ways.
Yes exactly! Just one thing to add, respect is crucial in relationships. If he does not respect you, then he is not being a good partner and he is causing the relationship to be unhealthy.
I was going to suggest OP stops having sex with him as punishment to see if he adjusts, but you are right that if there is a risk that the guy resolves to bypassing consent it is better to break up in advance.
""if he doesn't respect your pronouns, he doesn't respect you""
Wtf
 Ah yes “if they don’t respect my mental illness induced delusion they’re basically a rapist”
Consent is important. ""Pronouns"" are ridiculous
Crossing fingers 🤞
This a much better than my “dump his ass” response. Here, take my upvote :)
>Reddit is really bad with relationship advice and will usually advise people to IMMEDIATELY breakup with someone at the first sign of shitty behaviour

huh really? in the subreddits i'm in, I see way too much of the opposite, people advising to bend over backwards to stick it out when it’s clear to me this relationship needs to end

> asking them to do anything they don't want to do is like some kind of personal attack. 

That’s my family, lol
A part of that is certainly because people in good/healthy relationships don't often ask strangers on the internet for relationship advice.
I feel like a lot of the time, if relationship questions are posted anywhere other than r/amitheasshole is just because it's gotten just so horrible, which is why most of it is advice to break up.
No, not arguably. You absolutely should respect your partner more
You also don’t actually need a reason to break up with someone besides wanting to. So even if you WERE overreacting (you’re not), it wouldn’t actually matter.
You deserve to be respected for who you are. Don't change your entire identity just to make one person happy. There are SO many more folks out there who understand basic respect. 🥰
It's a poetic sort of justice, but I strongly discourage people from playing games with someone that's already actively disrespecting you for no reason. Do not give them a reason to escalate. Do not give them a reason to feel justified in expressing their ""freedom"". 

It is not your job to teach them, and they will not learn the lesson you want them to learn.
came here to say this
In all seriosness if he can’t respect your pronouns and gender identity, then he doesn’t respect you. Its the worst kind of objectification because he is saying with his actions that he doesn’t accept you as who you are.

Also if he is saying shit about free speech, he is a fucking moron with no intelligence and also probably a dangerous person to be around. Your gender identity has nothing to do with his speech, which if his speech is misgendering you, thats hate speech. 

Get away as fast and safely as possible
""Free speech will protect you from the government.

It does not protect you from getting kung pow penised on tumblr dot com.""

is my favorite rendition of this fact actually.
But wtf freedom of speech has to do with it 💀💀💀
I agree. I can live with my parents not using the correct pronouns, but a romantic partner? No freaking way.
Yeah this really is a deal breaker. I would probably dump him if he didn't respect another person's pronouns (e.g. his coworker) too.
That suggestion would be really weird.
It's literally just people complaining that Reddit doesn't encourage people to stick through literal abuse. Every thread has someone complaining about Reddit saying ""break up"" too often, but from what I've seen, when people turn to Reddit, it's after things get really bad, or the comments all say ""talk it out"" or some shit.
I regularly hear it referred to as “the Reddit special” lol. 

In subs like r/relationships or r/amitheasshole it’s a meme that no matter what there will always be people saying to break up.
Ummm I agree, I was trying to be cheeky by putting it that way
This is important advice that should be give far more frequently than it is
This is good advice, but sometimes you don’t *want* to break up with someone, even when perhaps there is cause for doing so. Or, at the very least, you have mixed feelings.

In these cases, asking “Am I overreacting?” can be more akin to asking “Is there any way I can maintain this as a healthy and happy relationship under these circumstances?” rather than “Do I have any justification in leaving?”
People like that don’t learn the lesson, period. They never change, so have fun with them while you can.
Lmaoo
How might one get king pow penised 🤔? Asking for a friend.
Came to say exactly this
Yes exactly. The “talk it out” comments grate me because usually the person has already tried that repeatedly.

People have a problem for not recognising abuse.
I agree most of the time, but I have seen some pretty aggressive takes about breaking up in AITA. e.g. One thread I recall featured a wife who was uncomfortable with their husband comforting their long time friend who was losing their dog to cancer in a room alone. The husband closed the door to be alone with their friend and one person I talked to suggested that was grounds for divorce, cause you shouldn't be alone in a bedroom with a friend of a different gender.

But, as you mention, on the flip side there are also people who defend abusive people and criticize anyone suggesting the OP doesn't deserve abuse. Reddit is a mixed bag.
Given the many bad situations I’ve seen, that’s reasonable go-to advice
Yes, true.  In those cases, I think it comes down to the possibility of resolving whatever the conflict is. Which sounds like a challenge in OP’s case.
Testing the grounds of how little your once-loved partner respects you isn't what I would call fun
I suppose we are different people, and I'll accept that you enjoy it and I do not without further commentary from me. I'd still caution against it for safety and honor reasons though. You don't want to find out if they are the sort of abusive asshole who can't take an L, and it's nice to walk away knowing you didn't misgender someone as a weapon.
K
Agreed. To be entirely honest, there is a small chance I was projecting a completely unrelated situation from my own life right now. Oops.

Main point being, even if there was a part of OP that wanted to stay, they should probably leave.
Fun is subjective, I might enjoy it, you might not enjoy it

*TRIGGER WARNING* All I said was I'm tired of reminding people who already know my preferred pronouns to not misgender me.		"Block them immediately. This person and their bigotry is not worth your time or attention. I know it’s easier for a removed party to say that but in the end if someone comes at you with this shit at this level for a comment like that there are deep seeded psychological issues that they won’t address, and they are not worth your time
Lot of self hatred inside this person. Take it easy, friend. I know this stings like hell but you are safe now 💛
Thats gotta be the biggest hypocrite I've seen this month
That was written by a horrible person who hosts horrible feelings. The insults almost feel like projecting, tbh. If this is what they spent their time on, they're the ones who don't have anything to offer to society.
Today I learned that pronouns are gay
holy fucking shit I'm so sorry this happened to you
Sounds like that person has no friends, and no life. Sorry they’re taking it out on you. I care about your pronouns if that helps
This is like, verbatim what my own brain tells me all the time.

Really sorry this person said all that to you OP. I can guarantee you bring a hell of a lot more good into the world than they do.
I'm sorry this happened but also this photo should be marked as spoiler/NSFW so it's blurred and you have to click through to see it. I saw the photo and its content before I saw your title because I'm mostly on subreddits where the post itself is the content and the title is just attribution/metadata/other unnecessary information. And it was very jarring :/
Oh no, those are words I've been thinking lately; fuck them you're beautiful and the world needs you.
Weird that they decided to talk about themselves in the last message...
They are projecting their own insecurities onto you bc that comment is way too specific to be anything but that. Block them and move on.
Define irony.
I Can Guarantee You The Person Who Wrote That Contributes Less To Society Than You Do, And Assuming That's A Representative Sample Of How They Think And Speak, They Definitely Make Life *Far* Worse For Anyone Around Them.
Ugh, transphobic bullying, they can’t even be original. Glad you blocked and reported them, but also take this time to remember that they are the social equivalent of unflavoured pasta and you owe them no mental time!
This person is miserable and most likely hates themself.. sad
\~\~\~Projeeeeeeeeeeeectioooooooooooooon\~\~

People like this have negative worth in life.
They can get fucked, no reason to attack anyone like that.  

You, on the other hand, are loved, welcomed, and deserve life, peace, and love.  I'm sorry you had to experience this, and may you have a many blessings this holiday season!
5 SPaG mistakes. I can’t help but think of a connection between a lack of education and the various -phobes
^Pronouns ^aren't ^gay^, ^they're ^human
Anyone who says stuff like that is a moron. If they genuinely believe that, then they don't care about you. Moreover, they don't actually care about anyone and are incapable of feeling close to another person, because they're too caught up in their own misanthropy to see value in others.

That being said, you valid girl.
Seeing messages like this just makes me think about how I have never, not even once, sent a hostile message with slurs and with the intent to tear down a *stranger* and try to make them feel bad. Whatever ""value"" this person thinks they add to society, such a message demonstrates that they're a net negative due to hate and bigotry, and how it's expressed in such toxic ways.

Even if I actually was a worthless nothing... I'd still be higher on whatever imaginary Social Credit scoreboard this weirdo thinks people are ranked on.
Time to share this behavior with your shared social network so everyone knows what a homophobic piece of shit this person is.
V rough what a dweeb I’m so sorry sweet angel! Hope u have good trans community around u 💖💖💖
I'm so sorry this was said to you, especially unsolicited. you deserve better than this and you should never let someone else's hatred bring you down, you will always be supported and loved here 🤍
you are not alone
Don’t people get bored of caring so much about what other people do? How do your pronouns affect them? If you ask to be called a nickname, would people call you by something that wasn’t that? I don’t understand people sometimes.
\*puts a mirror in front of this person and leaves quietly\*

Seriously, they seem to be talking about themself and their own feeling of futility and uselessness. It's still no time for sympathy though. Block that fucker and forget about them. There's nothing but trouble where this came from.
That person is 100% projecting.

All those things they said are intrusive thoughts they have about themselves.
When someone is that reactionary and aggressive, you have to wonder what they're refusing to deal with internally. And what you're reminding them of in themselves.
One could literally copypaste that last message straight back at them and it would be far more accurate.
Man, fuck what he thinks. All that comes to mind for me is ""You must have heard all of this said to you, too. Id pity you but you're as bad as the person who did this to you.""

Just remember that everyone. This dude is talking like hes all knowing and has his shit on lock. But do you know why he is putting so kuch energy into finding you and hating you? Its because deep down he is severely messed up. Again, I dont pity him because he is making it everyones problem but his own. I just say all this because he deserves to be forgotten and you dont. He is not and will never be above you. His views will always be inferior because he's doing hurtful things and youre just trying to be you.
“No one gives a fuck about your gay pronouns” says person who gives a HUGE fuck about your “gay” pronouns 😂 These people crack me up
this person is obviously not okay. you matter. they… clearly have mental problems and/or an echo chamber of a life because the majority of people do not think that way. you’re cool. fuck them
Mmm that reminds me of a conversation i had recently abt pronouns 
“Jesus didn’t use pronouns”
- “Who?”
“Jesus.. Yk Jesus Christ”
- “Oh I don’t think i know her”
“Him”
- “See you can care about pronouns good job *headpats*•
This person just feels like they're trying to cope with their own insecurities by projecting them onto someone else. There's a reason why people who struggle with feeling confident in their appearance's primary choice of insult is usually 'you're ugly'
You are valid, you matter, and you have a loving community that supports you no matter how you want to identify or present. Your heart is more open to love when you know and accept who you are, and the love you'll find will be deeper, more honest, and more pure.

I pity this person for being so closed off to the world around them. While they're still spitting vitriol, you'll be basking in the warm glow of your friends and chosen family. ❤️🫶❤️🫶
Honeslty if people like this dickbag began to ignore us and pretend we didn't exist we would probably be happier.
Reply to then and say this ‘you’re right. And in fact when I do what you’re saying I’ll staple this message to my forehead and send it to the press and all y socials so everyone knows it’s because you told me to’
Isn’t it sad this person told you how insecure they are? Message back ‘wow this came from the heart. Projection is real. . You matter. You have worth. You don’t make anyone’s lives worse. I was scared too in your position but the love of my community carried me though. I’ll be there to listen when you want to talk’
I'm not a violent person, but $h!t, this makes my blood boil, and do unpleasant things to this git.
OMG! How dare someone say those words to another human being??? They shouldn’t even say such things to an animal. 

And I understand you’re tired of reminding people of your pronouns and tired of being misgendered. In my case it’s gotten so bad I’m just sighing when it happens coz I simply don’t have the energy to always tell them: my name is …, my pronouns are…, don’t ma’am me, and so on and so on. Nothing wrong with stating you’re tired of it. 

Obviously this person felt triggered by you and your identity for some mysterious reason and felt justified saying such awful things. Of course they have no reason to be triggered by you and certainly don’t have the right to say that shit. But if there’s one thing I learnt, it’s this: what they say and do to you says more about them than it says about you. It tells me they’re an awful person I wouldn’t want to hang out with or even talk to. They’re the one with the problem, dear. Not you. Always remember that.
People like this always love to have their words and actions coming back to themselves, as it's the only logical thing to occur with statements this degrading. 

They are still at the starting line of understanding, while you are likely well on your way. We all walk this by ourselves but support is present along the right paths.

Wrong paths hold that classic self centered anger, echo's and destruction. Best to move away from this.
i'm so sorry you had to read this, i hope you push this person away from your life, they don't deserve you or your attention, you're so worthy and valid!!!! you deserve lots of love and care  :(
Fuck I'm so sorry you had to go through this...what a scum
Bet you they have nothing to be proud of so they take their misery out on others
Wow, someone has been brainwashed by capitalism to see value through the lens who ""what can you bring to the table"", sounds like a vary sad, and angry individual.

100% not worth the air they are breathing.

Also, really? Thats the best they had?

We have all heard significantly worse before.

Ignore this lowlife, he will never understand
God damn. How could someone be so hateful to someone who is just living their life? Hey, you are significant, and wanted, and loved, and valuable. They're just terrified of their bigoted worldview being challenged.
I hope you are okay and safe <3 you are valid beyond words
This person is simply toxic and hateful, full stop, no matter what your pronouns are or your gender you’re much better off removing them from your life.
What a sad, sad human. Imagine being this horrible. 
You’ll find your people. This person does not deserve to have you in their life, and you certainly don’t need them in yours.
This is whisper isn't it? A lot of people on that app have problems they need to vent. It's not the best place to go for support.
Fuck that dude all you asked for was common decency
The thing about responses like this is that they don’t really think this about you. This is how they feel about themselves, and when you were brave enough to live as your authentic self, they felt mad and sad that they are not as brave, so they lashed out. This does not excuse the behavior, but I hope it gives you some comfort. You are resilient, you matter, you are in the arena, and this insecure scared person is in the cheap seats. I love you 💖🏳️‍⚧️💖
Aw whisper, a complete and utter shithole
I am sorry mate. Some people are a pain
Fuck them. This is absolute projection. Miserable loser.
Delete this troll....
There's so much self hatred in them they end up projecting. No mentally stable person would say something like this. Just block them.
They have nothing better to do than to harrass people. I know it's hard but ignore them. They aren't worth it
You know what I find interesting? This person is telling you everything about their character, as if this person has a mirror facing them
So full of vitriol. No love, compassion, respect, decency. There are many roses in the world but just too many pricks
This person is going to die forgotten and alone. I'm sorry you had to bear the brunt of their shitty, damaged little ego
Garbage person projecting onto others. Brush them aside.  Don't need that kind of negativity in your life.
this person is projecting and i hope you know everything they said is a nasty lie and you deserve for people to recognize you correctly
Well that’s awful. But also like this person is probably going through a gender crisis themselves and is taking out their confused rage on you. I’m sorry for you
It’s mean but I don’t care, I always drop a no you, uno reverse card or please stop projecting on me before I block and report them.
I'm so sorry this happened to you 😔 Good thing you blocked and reported them. Please don't listen to them, respecting people's pronouns and not misgendering them is a basic kindness and should be normal. Do you need a hug?
I love the ""say something nice"" message the app tries to lead you to, and that this ps of sht has totally ignored (as well as empathy).
I’m so incredibly sorry this horrific bigotry and hatred was directed at you.  They seem to really hate themselves and their life, but I know that doesn’t make it any easier to read something like that - sending you love🫶🏽.  The world is a MUCH better place with your light in it🥺💙
definitely not a friend or a smart person
I’m going to be honest, reading this I audibly gasped at how disgusting what this (pathetic excuse for a) ‘person’ messaged you
Someone is projecting the shit out of here it's unbelieveable
I did block them.  And I reported them for harassment/bullying.
AMEN!!!
Yeah, this person belongs in a 90’s classroom, they’re projecting so hard.
I do love asking these kind of people “and what are you worth?” Just to have them tell me what they think of me by spouting ego-centric bs that totally isn’t how they perceive people who are happier than they are
This right here. That person is projecting their self hatred.
That implies that there are straight and bi pronouns
Yeah I had that voice too. It can be an aftrtimage of what you were told if you were a victim of narcissistic abuse. If youre dealing with that I recommend therapy, maybe Cognitive Behavioral Therapy specifically - or reading up on the techniques involved if you cant afford help. In general you cant just reject or dwstroy that voice, its something you have to kind of transmute through habotuating self love. For me it was a long process but it was worth it.
Thanks for pointing that out.  I fixed it so it's blurred now.
Yeah that really was a surprising and sudden manifestation of hella projection
Forgot to link this video: https://youtu.be/XuFGUVF3lEY

Admittedly, the situation is much lighter in said video. But, it's the same basic line of thought being made fun of.
I hate when people say Jesus didn't use pronouns.  Jesus literally said ""I am he"" at one point, meaning his preferred pronouns were he/him.
10/10 best reaction you could’ve had. You are valid, you’re pronouns and identity are valid, and that person should never have said shit.
PERFECT!!!
Legendary burn. Almost as bad as when you touch that projector near the light spurce lol
It’s giving “I’m not allowed to express myself, so neither are you!!! How dare you!!!”
There are????? Why was I not told about this?
Thank you for the advice, I appreciate it. I have been through a lot of abuse, and I do get therapy for it.
Im glad youre getting help. Its definitely not easy, but I believe that youre on the right path and it can get better for you. Good luck!"	zny41s	NonBinary	757	0.99	2022-12-17 04:32:17
Talking to my classroom soon		"As a slightly older enby this warms my heart. From experience there will be some people who might not respect your pronouns and you... DO NOT GIVE THEM A SECOND THOUGHT.

We are so proud of you for taking this step 💜 live it you awesome person you!
Good luck! 
I only changed my name with my classmates, but my closest friends knew before and know about me being nonbinary, so it's weird when other call me my deadname. Most people don't even recognize me like that anymore
Good luck! I’m so happy for you, you got this!
Good luck!!!
hope it works out. <3
Good luck! *virtual hug*
Good luck , you got this! 🤘🏾🎊
Very best of luck! Don't let the ignorant bastards get you down!
good luck! update us :) i’ve been hesitant to do this in my classes. i have my pronouns on my school email signature, but that’s the farthest i’ve gotten 😂
As an older enby that wishes they knew about it sooner, plz go for it. This is great!!! ♡♡♡
You will totally rock this!

Show the world how fab-uh-luuuuus you are! 💜
Best of luck to you!!
good luck !! so happy for you! ❤️❤️
That's wonderful! All the best wishes for you! 😄
Good luck 🏳️‍⚧️
my deadname is a noun/verb, so the amount of times i thought i was deadnamed before remembering that the person didn't know me before i came out,,,
*accepts virtual hug* thank you!
Thanks!
Thanks! I think that they might learn from the others that it isn’t right to disrespect someone in that way, especially since they haven’t seen anyone nonbinary before
I’ll update you guys in another post soon! Came out to my brother yesterday🤩
Thank you❤️
Lmao
congrats!! 🥳"	zf2j0v	NonBinary	745	0.99	2022-12-07 14:31:31
My partner (19, any pronouns) has been feeling a bit down about their hair after getting a negative comment from someone. I think it looks incredible on them and wanted to post some photos here to hopefully help cheer him up a bit!		"(don't worry I made sure they were comfortable with me posting before I did!)
Your partner's hair looks fantastic, OP.
To quote many guys from my younger years, I like ya cut g.
It looks fucking incredible! I really genuinely love it (:
The haircut looks amazing!!! ❤️
Whoever criticized your partner was probably jealous or being a phobic idiot.
The cut is attractive and complements thier bone structure by how it's framed. The layers add nice dimensions for their fine hair, which looks very healthy by the way.
Omg your partner is slaying and their hair looks so good
This is a fabulous haircut, ze looks like an incognito member of some famous boy band
their hair looks so good!!
Take this if it helps, but this is the hair sokka (avatar the last airbender) has when his hair is down. 

...the one that everyone thinks is hot.
that haircut is just...*peak* androgeny

it's really cute!
he looks amazing! i love it on her
Their hair is amazing!!! Girlboss moment!! Absolute King!!!
Their hair looks amazing, he totally rocks it and I think it suits them!!
his hair looks so cool!! i love the short back but longer bangs
That haircut was made for them!!! They look amazing :)
Does the hater have cataracts or something? Because that haircut is insanely flattering on your partner!
his hair looks so cool, i love the way it looks with his face shape and everything!!
who had the nerve to say something bad about it?? his hair looks so good
They look very gorgeous. ❣
Their hair looks so cool :>
Their hair looks so cool, one day I want to have a haircut like that :)
It looks cute! I wish I had such amazing hair game
i saw the pic before reading the title and immediately thought ""wow they have cool hair""
i have the exact same cut so maybe i’m biased but they look so cool and i would def be in awe if i saw him walking down the street
I would kill to be able to grow hair like that!! It looks great on them!
I like it, I think it suits them well and it really shows off how smooth and silky their hair is :)
You so pretty omg
What?! It's gorgeous! What a rich colour, and that beautiful shine is amazing.  I love the cut too, it shows off their striking bone structure.
Your partner looks amazing, even their fashion sense is great!
it's gorgeous!
Looks amazing 🤩
90s dreamboat hair 😍💞
Looks like my friend's hair but shorter

Your partner's hair is looking nice :)
So, is your partner single?
They look incredible. So badass and cool. ❤️ Don't let anyone tell them otherwise.
That hair looks gorgeous!
BROOOOO if i had straight hair i would use this as a reference pic for my barber
Their hair looks so good and OMG THEIR EYES
Before reading the caption the first thing I noticed about the picture was their amazing hair, so I hope that helps haha.

Regardless, the most important thing is that he likes it, there’s no point changing how you present/express yourself, just because you don’t fit the standards of a bunch of shitty people.
I'd fight for such glossy, healthy looking locks. People like that can only feel good about themselves by running others down. 
That's a fact. [why some need to be nasty](https://www.aconsciousrethink.com/12254/people-who-put-others-down/)
Who ever gave them that negative comment clearly has eye problems

Your partner's hair looks amazing
Oh man thanks for all the responses everyone!! As a bit of context: I asked them if they'd be okay if I ""theoretically"" posted these photos somewhere cuz of how amazing their hair looks. She said yes, and I waited a few days so they'd forget the conversation a bit. When I posted last night, after about an hour when I had a few comments, he actually stumbled across it on her own and was super excited to get all of the feedback. This morning, with the post now having like 50 more comments than it did last night I was super excited to read them all, and they were too. It's definitely helped him feel better about his hair seeing all the positivity and I'm so glad because it just looks so cool!! Y'all rock
It looks really good! I’m a transmasc and I actually have a similar hairstyle!

If you wanted a bit of advice, I’d recommend looking into getting a medium hold pomade (old spice medium hold no shine is a pretty affordable one that doesn’t make your hair too greasy), put a bit of it on your fingertips, rub them together a bit, then run them through your hair starting at the roots pushing it back a bit. Basically start at the roots at your forehead run them through your hair like you were slicking it back. Pomade gives your hair a bit more lift and hold and can help look a bit more masc by giving the appearance of a shorter, lighter hairstyle, but doesn’t make your hair hard or greasy like gel or wax. It just feels like hair. I’d definitely recommend looking into it, it’s a lifesaver for us!
He looks cool! Is there a way they wish their hair were different? If so, she could always cut it or restyle it, but otherwise just tell him whoever was negative is just wrong
It looks amazing on her!! I hope he feels better soon
Haters are just haters. Tbh I think it fit them very well!
Did you get their permission tho? And yes they look awesome!
The hair is fantastic, their skin is glowing and my crops are flourishing ✨
She’s gorgeous and their haircut is great. Whoever criticized it has no taste.
their hair is great tho he looks great in it 🥺. Not a haircut that looks great on everyone nessasarily but she pulls it off so well  it looks amazing
This is the hair I wish I had when I got a short cut.
They look SERIOUSLY so good!!
Their hair looks great! I'd want to have something nearly as pretty! Or short! He shouldn't be ashamed, she looks great!
Oh but it’s such a nice cut! They pull it off so we’ll and the bangs frame their face greatly.
bruh what?? i wish my hair was straight so i could have this style agsgsfafag they wear it so well!!!
The haircut really fits xyr face shape imo, it looks really nice :))
Your partner's hair is gorgeous! I wish I could have hair like that. U.u
i absolutely love it on them! they look super androgynous & a little edgy and it’s such and awesome cut
He looks great!!!!
Awesome looking, wish my hair was that good.
Your partner looks great!! Love the haircut 💓
It looks great tho and suits them!
i like it!
His hair looks really nice! I think it frames their face really well and it sits nicely :D
this haircut looks fun to draw
Their hair looks cool as fuck, super androgynous. I also like their earrings :)
so cute! i love it so much. it looks so flattering on them.
I love it on them! Honestly I feel like it fits so well especially the second photo
I think their hair is wonderful.
it looks great on them!
i think it looks great, but with their hair texture they'll get a lot more volume/texture by doing stuff like towel drying their hair after they wash it, using a light pomade and fluffing at the roots, and even a sea salt spray :)
They look fantastic. the cut frames their face perfectly. I genuinely don’t understand the negativity. He looks great
bro that looks so good what, who was complaining, it's amazing
I've always wished I could rock that style! You look awesome dude, not a lot of people can pull it off
Your partners bangs are adorable! I love how they cover their eyes just slightly, like curtains to a lovely outside world!
Holy fuck this looks too cool!!!!!
this is very gender
dang i think they look amazing!! i have a similar style and damn i wish my hair looked that good on me lmao
This is literally the hair cut I’ve been wanting to get. They look fantastic!
Very andro!! I'm jealous
They have the perfect hair texture to pull off this cut, it's super badass!!
It suits them so well /g 💕
I'm completely in love with this haircut on them. You two clearly have good taste
I used to have that haircut! One of my favorites. It looks really good.
that haircut was made for him!!!
It looks amazing! Whoever insulted it was probably just a Karen
I would kill for hair like that. It looks great on your partner and I wish I had hair like theirs.
Soooooo Cuuuuuute!!! 🖤🖤🖤🔥🔥🔥
Honestly love it.
bro that's the hairstyle that i want 😭😭
They look wonderful, the cut fits them very well! Whoever hated on it may be lacking a little something called a brain.
i think your partners hair looks amazing
They have the perfect shaped face for this cut, very cute.
I have a similar haircut it looks really good
holy shit that is amazing hair that complements their face shape so dam well
It was literally my favorite haircut before I decided to let it grow, looks so cute 🥰
That completely works. Very good looking as whatever gender I might imagine. AND, looks like any of the many  girls (pre high school, so ""girls"" is correct) I crushed on in the 70s, and many of the hot boys too. I wouldn't dare guess at your partner's gender, but love the hair (and that color polish).
Their hair looks awesome! Whoever was talkin shit about it has no taste at all
*SLAP*
I did! I did make a comment about it but it might have gotten a bit buried under all the others!
*SCREECH*
Oh sorry yeah I looked at the top several comments but didn’t see it. Good to know though :)

Just your daily reminder that it's not selfish to correct people on your pronouns! And it's not selfish to make mistakes either! Just try your best :)		"Thank you for the reminder!!! I always get weird correcting people on my pronouns bc I feel like I’m being too demanding > /// <
[deleted]
Guilt can be such a defense mechanism for cis people though. ""OH MY GOSH I'M SO SO SORRY. CAN YOU EVER FORGIVE ME? I'M SUCH A BAD PERSON!""

It's more about them trying to get you to forgive their sins than trying to make you feel better.
I love this, do you have a twitter so I can retweet it? 🥺
i honestly mess up pronouns a lot. even cis people. but there was this one time i messed up a trans dude from my d&d club's pronouns' and he was like super flamboyantly instantly pointing to his pronoun pin and i got really embarrased. i didnt really tell him. i use they them but im not really out in school...
Of course! You’re not! As the person who gets corrected I always feel like the jerk when I mess them up
Thank you!! My best friend is nb and this seems to be a common point of conversation haha
For some yes, but for others they genuinely do just make mistakes and never try to misgender someone or anything, as we are all people and everyone makes mistakes, which is what I was focusing on more
Thank you! I do :) I just started these little comics but I DMed you the link to the tweet :) 💚
Definitely agreed. We can't expect perfection from people.

I’d appreciate some affirmation 💙 trying out he/him pronouns (Aden, they/he)		"That Aden has style! He’s so photogenic and natural. The camera loves him!

Also I can't help but mention that you look like Klaus from Umbrella Academy, highly reccommend the watch if you haven't already :D

Edit: Just to clear up some confusion, Klaus' actor stated specifically that the character was an enby, so this isn't an attempt at misgendering. Have a great day :DDDD

why use “he or she and s/he” when you can just use they?	"idk if this rly is a non-binary topic post but as a non-binary person myself i hate when companies, people, etc. use “she or he” or “s/he” when describing smtn. like? you could just use they/them/theirs and there wouldn’t be any problem.

(EDIT)
i feel like i should put out there i’m not saying this as a personal pronoun choice. she/he / he/she pronouns are completely valid! i’m saying this as a frustration towards using it to reference the general public and referencing groups of ppl! (: just wanted to clarify! 

EX: “if the user is not selected in game, he or she will be displayed as offline-“ (via switch)"	"Grrrrr so aggravating. Way more concise, easier to say/write, AND more inclusive!!!
AFAIK, many of those companies genuinely believe this is the grammatically correct method. 

Many of them picked it up during second-wave feminism when there was a push to include feminine pronouns alongside male to fight back against the Male As Default culture, which created subconscious misogynistic assumptions/bias in workplaces. ""He or she and s/he"" replaced ""he"" and it became the new Politically Correct way to write for professional contexts. Anyone looking to become a professional copywriter in a particular era was then taught this method, had it drilled into their brains that any other method would be Unprofessional and Sexist.

And THAT male-as-default culture happened because some ""genius"" (/s) thought to replace singular they with he/him. You can see this usage in, ironically, The Left Hand of Darkness by Ursula Le Guin (Sci fi about a planet where all the people are genderfluid). She stated later in life that she would have used ""they"" if she'd thought of it, but she used ""he/him"" because of pre-existing conventions for he as a gender neutral pronoun. Those conventions have existed and fluctuated in and out of popularity between Middle English and Modern English periods.

That's my understanding of it all, at least. Of course, it's all bull and they should just use they; but for every practice of history that exists there'll be someone who swears by it, because humanity is a poorly evolved ant hive full of people who take it upon themselves to die on silly hills on the off chance it will somehow link back to our survival. Personally I think our species' psychology is ridiculous, and it's a miracle we've made it this far. But on the other hand, it does mean that once we get singular they back into common professional practice, a bunch of people will uphold it as the standard regardless of whether or not they have personal political stakes in it.
Roses are red

Violets are blue

Singular ""they"" predates

Singular ""you""
There was a time period where many of us were taught in elementary school that ""he or she"" was both inclusive and more grammatically correct than ""they"".
people who use that these days are actively trying to avoid using singular they to make a point (the point is transphobia)
Every time I read that in an official document, all I'm thinking is that I could probably get out of a lot of contracts because I am neither he nor she. At least, once my license says ""X"" that is
Growing up I always defaulted to calling things “it” but I was taught repeatedly how offensive that was. Honestly, I think calling things “it” or “they” as a default is superior.
IKR
It was taught by prescriptivist grammarians as the 'correct' way. Even as a kid I thought it was clunky and ridiculous.

And now I'm a specialist English teacher, I have the authority to say that 'they' is a far superior method of referring to an unspecified person. ""He or she"" can go in the bin.
IKR, this bothers me so much!!!! I ask this question to myself multiple times every day when encountering things in the world. Like seriously, the concept of they/them in English language isn't even a new thing.
Companies and such using ""s/he"" over ""they?"" Mildly annoying. Best case scenario, misguided ally trying to be inclusive.  


Individuals using ""he/she"" pronouns for themself? Totes fine.
i hear you. i just realized i'm living in a place that doesn't accommodate different gender identities let alone neurodivergent minds. it's weird because people leave us out, it's like i just made my gender up and it's only in my head for the rest of society, which is sad.
i feel like i should put out there i’m not saying this as a personal pronoun choice. she/he / he/she pronouns are completely valid! i’m saying this as a frustration towards using it to reference the general public and referencing groups of ppl! (: just wanted to clarify!
I made a post like this ages ago on tumblr. People purposely took it to mean that I wanted to get rid of every pronoun besides they. Transphobes suck at reading comprehension.
I use both he/she cause in my native language it would be too awkward to use they and so I just use he/she both in English and Italian
I think the gender binary is based fundamentally on control, so people sort of get in the habit of ordering and sorting things according to the standards they’ve internalized
True they really should just use they it covers everything that way
I've also seen ""he/she/they"" in articles. It was very strange. It felt like a way of saying ""I know about nonbinary people go me!"" while still not actually entirely fixing the problem with he/she. You're never going to be able to list every neopronoun someone could use and it would be extraordinarily clunky writing to try, but if you write out ""he or she or they"" you're kind of saying those are the only options, whereas if you just say ""they"" instead you mean anyone of unknown gender
It's so clunky. When I read it, I try to imagine some elderly person saying it, that makes me less angry about it.
LMFAOOOO my pronouns are she/they! But yeah I don’t understand why and tbh it’s stupid not to use they like?!
my fiancee and i just finished watching sherlock the other day. i think every ... two/three episodes we were both yelling ""'they!'"" at the tv. it *never* got less frustrating hearing ""he \[beat\] or she"".
People hate changing things they learned as kids. Pretty sad excuse, but that's more or less it.
I just default to they most of the time with anyone
I’m noticing it a lot in my college curriculum this semester as well. It’s so frustrating
As someone who is completing a degree in Writing, I can tell you that “formal writing” has for a very long time looked down on the singular “they”. BUT this is changing. My professor of professional writing has been teaching in her field since the 70s (she’s so old now but omg such an amazing professor), and she can tell you from experience how formal writing is so much slower to adapt to societal changes than informal writing does. She hasn’t always accepted the use of singular “they” in her students’ papers for this very reason; stating, “Those who receive your writing will not give you a chance to defend what they see as bad grammar, they will only see ‘bad grammar’ and set your paper in the bin.” But these days, she is accepting the use of singular “they” in formal papers because the idea of what is “formal” *is* slowly changing to fit our more inclusive society.
omg yeah this is a pet peeve of mine too. just write THEY for crying out loud! it's quicker, less letters, flows better when reading etc., with the added bonus of being inclusive. it's easy! the ""bUt SinGuLaR tHeY iS gRaMaTiCaLLy iNcOrrEcT!"" 😫 excuse doesn't even fly in most cases bc if we're talking about pronouns being used in things like instructions, guides, procedures etc, then it's the collective people being referred to, i.e. MORE THAN ONE unknown/unidentified person. but cissexism is one hell of a drug i guess!
Ugh I had that same thought earlier today without a comment someone left in the work chat. ""Send it through a ticket and we can do it really quick for him/her."" It was also edited, and knowing this person, it wouldn't surprise me if he only wrote ""him"" at first, then decided to try and be inclusive or non-assumptive by adding the slashed option. Like.... come on dude.
Every time I see a newsletter come home from my little brother’s school, it always says “he/she” interchangeably with “your child”. WHY NOT JUST USE THEY???? I ask my mom this all the time. She reminds me not to get so frustrated over it. It’s literally less work for teachers :/
Personally, I think it makes for better writing to use they in place of he/she, because not only is it quicker and easier to write, but it's easier to read and doesn't make the sentence sound janky and overrun. I find it annoying when he/she is still used, mostly because of this reason. It also sounds incredibly outdated because I feel like it's standard and widely considered politically correct now to use they.
Yes i fucking hate this they are choosing to leave out anyone who doesnt identify with he or she
Yeah, it squigs me out when ppl try to force a binary like that. They is literally easier to say, write, conjugate, and use.

If I see someone use s/he when a ""they"" would usually be used, I assume they're homophobic.

It's never steered me wrong.
I feel it is kind of like the oxford comma sometimes. Companies have a style guide that everyone who writes for them has to follow. These style guides are usually written by committee and can be absolute nonsense in practice. The style guides also tend to stay frozen and unchanging for way longer than they should.

The oxford comma is my fav example because style committees tend to have very strong feelings about it, and can be extremely strict about enforcing the presence or absence of one little comma. I bet there are a couple who are also weird butts about the singular they/them/theirs.
its because we live in a freaking society \*joker face\*
Yeah, I get it as a personal pronoun choice, but using it to just reference people in general is super clunky and people/businesses really should just use they.
At first I thought you were talking about what pronouns people use for themselves, I have a friend who uses she/he so I was about to start explaining
when i see it in my textbooks/texts/etc, i scribble it out and correct it. i’m also a writing coach and if i see it in a paper, i’ll correct it too. annoys me so much
Ignoring the issues specific to this sub, it violates one of the closest things there is to a hard and fast rule when it comes to writing:  use fewer words.  If you are using several words to express something said in one, you have made an *error*.  And there really is no basis for such an error.  While people might bristle at they as a personal pronoun because it is unfamiliar (the singular they is common, but it is usually an impersonal case where they is used because no more information is available), if you are at ""he or she"" you are perfectly in that common, *impersonal* case.  There really is not an excuse.
Lawyers might not want to use singular they on its own. My lease uses ""he/she/they""
I'm a Finn. In Finnish there's only one gender neutral word for she/he and it's hän. We do just fine without being gender specific. Quite frankly it was super hard to start considering people's gender when I started to learn English as a child. Unless the topic of the conversation needs person's gender specified, it's often not even considered in Finnish. 🇫🇮🤷
In technical or legal documents, it's often used to remove ambiguity between singular and plural they. It kinda makes sense in a situation where the difference between one person and multiple people could cost tons of money or result in abuse of a contract.

Are there better ways to do so? Probably. But at least in those contexts there's a somewhat valid reason, even if there's probably a better solution out there.

Now, situations where that ambiguity is acceptable? At best, ""he or she"" is pedantic tradition. More commonly recently it's intended to be _explicitly_ exclusive...
I go by they/them officially but since I live in Germany it’s pretty much not a thing at all. “They” directly translates to “she” here so that sucks.

The only German pronoun I really do identify with is “it”. But I’m way to afraid to actually use it for the kind of message it sends. I’m at my wit’s end, too. Because everyone I know doesn’t get that it’s “she AND he” not pick and choose what you think I look like to your perception.
I think a lot of cis ppl do this because I think they're referencing other cis ppl. Enbies & trans ppl are probs the last thing they're focused on. I usually only see he/she when it comes to gender reveals and such and honestly, why not use them/they? So much easier imo but I g they don't care or they think that's enough gender inclusivity for them lol.
Right?

""He or she"" = 7 letters

""they"" = 4 leters

you safe time with this!
I agree! I’m not sure I cared as much before coming out myself but unconsciously do it for everyone else now. Don’t know the author’s pronouns? They. Not sure how “Casey” prefers to be called? They. Generally unsure of or facing an unnecessary gendering? They. It’s so darn easy and universal.
At work or any other place where I required to being named using my correct pronoun (“elli”, in Catalan, it’s the translation of “they” in singular voice). Well, I’m still being misgendered by coworkers and non-queer people out there 🥲
I try to always use no pronouns if i don't know what pronoun a person uses. There are people that dislike being reffered to with they/them as well.
I just recently learned how to use ""they"" pronoun this way. I'm not native english speaker, and sadly it wasn't taught when I was in school few years ago. I bet most of us don't do this maliciously, we just probably haven't learned this yet. 

This is one reason for the ""sorry for my english"" thing lol
I used they/them in an English test once (I'm not a native speaker, it was in Germany)
The sentence something like: ""If a person wants a new hair cut, they can go to a hair stylist""
and it was corrected with ""he/she""
I had to explain the concept of they/them to my english teacher . My teacher, a person who studied English in university, didn't know it.
Constantly having to hear that shit in school makes me stare into the void every time and I think my friends just know
My university English textbook has never ONCE used singular they. Ugh.
This drives me *crazy*. Fucking use ""they"", it's so much easier to read, doesn't take as much space and it's much more inclusive
Shakespeare and Chaucer used they to address people so it really shouldn't be that hard to use it now, but some people just don't realise that yes them and they are perfectly correct to use!
This actually broaches into a hyperfixation of mine too: Pokémon Cards, there's limited space for text on cards and they still use ""he or she"" when they could just use ""they"". They have used ""They"" on a few occasions, but ""He or She"" pops up still
What I find really frustrating is when an author uses he or she consistently (usually its he) and then shows me they know how to use they in some example or something, and back to he or she. I would guess they might be thinking of a specific person?
I just ignore any content that doesn’t seem to want to say ‘they’ and uses he/she. It’s not like there’s a more concise term that can encompass multiple people and is also gender neutral. Glad to know I’m not the only one who finds it annoying!
I was having so many fights with my english teacher over this! It made me furious. But in the end I gave in. Why? Because it ruined my grade. I was an A student. Using “they” instead of “he or she” dragged me down at least a grade every single test…
I’m a technical writer. The answer is that this is how they teach you to write to avoid subject/verb confusion. They still teach it like this in my university, though most people in my class pointed out that it doesn’t work when referring to people nowadays because they could be nonbinary and not use either pronoun.
RIGHT???? Like, they know that there's a pronoun for when you don't know someone's gender, don't they?????
I mean, there's plenty of reasons, and contexts for why. For example, my english book in school uses he or she. It's from 2014, and the people who wrote it are pretty old. Even my english teacher, who is perfectly progressive still writes and says he or she instead of they because for the singular they wasn't really talked about much, or used in the materials he read and studied. I think in most cases, it takes time and discussion of the singular they. So if you have teachers who do this, just ask them about the singular they and how it's commonly accepted by the literary community and that it's much more convenient.
It’s prescriptively indicated even though people have been saying “they” in this context for centuries
Yes!! Your example is exactly what I think of when it comes to that. It's so annoying! Just say They/Them!
Giving the benefit of the doubt, i believe it's used when they know the person in question for a fact doesn't use a non binary identity, but doesn't know the person in question's gender
my fricking english book uses that and i always use they when i have an assignment with an email abt a friend to see how my teacxher reacts lol
The only time I like this is when it comes up as a rule in a game and I can say technically I'm exempt
I worked at a cub scout camp during the transition between ""Boy Scouts"" and ""Scouts BSA"" (when they started letting girls join) and oh my god.

As a closeted Afab Nonbinary person, it was agonizing. You could really tell recognizing girls at all was like pulling teeth for most of these old male scoutmasters. If they didn't blatantly outright hate the idea and tell you to your face, even if you yourself were (or in my case were assumed to be) a woman, they sure had a hard time remembering girls even exist. 

So many ""if a boy.. I mean scout"" or ""and then he'll have a better time at camp. OR SHE!"" With an eye roll or a laugh. 

And it's like. You know who doesn't have a problem with this? Me. Because I've been saying ""they"" this whole time, because even before little girls could join, there have still been mothers who were involved and female camp counselors for decades. Crazy, right?
the last time i was in school, singular they was the standard when writing essays. my experience i'm sure is exceptional though.
I’m taking a business communications course and they covered “un-biased” language where they explained to use he or she BUT also said the better thing to do is to rephrase the sentence to not need any gendered pronouns. They also mentioned using they/then pronouns for individuals who prefer them. Step in the right direction ig..
It always grinds my gears when exams say ‘he or she’, because it would be so much easier for everyone if they just typed ‘they’ instead.
Pronouns doesn’t equal gender
I hated this since I was learning to read and write. It sounds terrible and isn't grammatically necessary.
S(t(he)y)/t(h(im)e(r))m
Just about to say that lol

It's so true though, inclusivity is important!
Fun fact no one asked for but I hope will be enjoyed: the landscape of The Earthsea Trilogy was inspired by the San Juan Islands of Washington state, where I live.
It still bothers me that ""he/him"" was the default for writing and assumed ""gender neutral"". Like, if the meaning of words and professionalism can change so much it really shows how impermanent the English language is. Some people who were alive from when those changes were made are still transphobic and act like you can't change the meaning of words. Very strange.
Hey, thank you for sharing this. I'm not a native English speaker and I didn't know anything about this history
Interesting! That book sounds interesting too I’ll have to check that out…
People are dumb

I wish more of them knew

Why do they insist

That this isn't true

It isn't oppression

It's been here for years

We didn't just make it

Cause we want them in tears (we do, but that's unimportant to the story)
people should be able to update their language as it is no longer inclusive and is much more work than just saying “they”
This!!
I wonder how well that could be argued in court. Especially when government documents support your legal gender status
in finland we call everyone it and that and its totally normal

(also we only have one, gender neutral person pronoun which feels way too formal to use in speech)
As someone with it/they pronouns. Go ahead my sibling. I've had people prefer to use she over it/they wherever I go. I only casually mention I use she and only have it/they in my bio's. But noone except enbies uses them 🥺
It is dehumanising. It is often used to dehumanise minorities and marginalised groups—especially BIPOC. Please don’t use it as default.
You should do a edit to the og post so more people see this :*
Big truth
Singular they is older in English than singular you. People have been using it as an epicene pronoun since the 1300s iirc. It was just prescribed to use “he” and later “he or she” formally
That is cool!
I don't think there are many people alive who were part of the last deliberate push to turn ""he"" into gender neutral - wikipedia says that was 1745, reinforced by newspapers in 1985. Neutral masculine also traces back to Classical Greek and Biblical Hebrew, so when I say it's had on-and-off popularity, that really does go deep. I would say that's where some people get their confusion, if I'm being generous about it - they simply haven't or won't bother learning history and adopt a tokenistic understanding of what tradition is, how long it's been around and etc. So long as a bit of history exists, that's enough for them to pin their expectations on.

And plenty of others don't care that you can change the meaning or that it has throughout history. The point to those types isn't historical accuracy, effective communication or broad grammatical usage; the point is authoritarian control. Creating and reinforcing underclasses entrenches the power of the upperclass, and they want to feel on top. I think it's good to see that for what it is. Wastes less time and energy trying to ""figure them out"".
Ohh I highly recommend it! Ursula Le Guin is one of the most influential writers of her era, a peer to Philip K. Dick.  Her work is known for being deeply feminist, anti-racist and Taoist in themes. I could ramble about her forever, though. I hope you enjoy.
I know, right?  Maybe that's the key.  Appeal to laziness.  ""Saying they is a whole two syllables less!""
Language mostly happens below the level of conscious thought. It becomes deeply ingrained habit that then requires a lot of work to alter for people who were using different terminology for many years or decades.

I'm still seeing some people of my generation (Gen-X) struggle with Black suddenly becoming socially acceptable and preferred again. For our early lives there was a big movement toward treating that as anachronistic if not borderline a racist slur. It's more work to say African-American than Black. It's even greater work to think about it all the time to ensure you are only using the ""new"" terminology.
Probably not super well lmao! But I do have fun imagining that I can't be held accountable because of improper pronouns on documents
is finland a nice place to live overall?
I’m familiar actually. Although I live in the US my ex is a first generation Estonian immigrant. Languages are her passion and she taught me a lot about the relationship between your language and Estonian. Trivia for both languages as well as  cultural points were a special interest for her.
except dogs, they're hän (personal pronoun)
l identify with it/it’s pronouns myself. I know the feeling. People still call me he. Even my ex, who is a trans woman, rarely called me it. If we ever interact in the future I’ll call you it/they like you deserve.
I don’t call anyone it unless they ask.  I’m a historian who specializes in US history during the Civil War and Reconstruction eras. I’m aware of the history. I used it as a child, because as an Austistic person, assigning gender to most things, even people, already seemed strange to me. I appreciate that you’re just trying to help. Rest assured, I don’t go around calling anyone it by default as an adult. I certainly don’t do it to some groups of people and then not do it to others. No, this is me trying to explain my childhood instincts as a nonbinary and autistic petson. Nothing more. I respect anyone’s pronouns. I call most people he or she unless told otherwise. Regardless, thank you for your comment.
just did (: ty for the suggestion
😱 you know your stuff! Thanks for the lesson!
Back in the early 20th century many women were discriminated against due to laws using the ""neutral"" he/him pronouns when they/them was used previously. Lawyers were able to levee them against women to prevent them from accessing certain career paths. It's probably not likely to work now but there is historical precedent
Yeah I'd say so. Not the easiest country to immigrate to because the language is ridiculously difficult to learn. Not the most open minded country, but most people know to shut their mouths. 

I can live in peace.
Respectable. 🥹
I appreciate the clarity. I’m also autistic and nonbinary. Your last sentence made it seem like you still did so I was just trying to provide knowledge and warning.
Hmmm maybe there is a chance with a good lawyer haha
Why did the creator of Finnish decide to include consonant gradation and 10 zillion conjugations and declensions...
🖤
Of course. I appreciate your comment. I should have written more clearly, because you are absolutely right. It is dehumanising and has been used to deny human decency through scientific racisim and its decedents.
we didnt like all the small words like 'the' and 'of' and then we also decided we dont like most medium sized words so well just have a 1000 different ways to say dog xddd
“It” is also often used against disabled people :( especially intellectual disability
Once again, I appreciate your comment, my friend. But I assure you that I know. As we’ve established, I am autistic as well. I also suffer from the learning disability,dyscalculia. I can assure you that I was no savant either. I have plenty of experience being told I’m an “it” or a “retard” or a “subhuman/freak”.
Oh no, that comment was more lamenting *with* you about it rather than trying to tell you something new.

I did it!! Today I officially started asking friends to use he/they pronouns for me. I know it probably doesn't sound like much but it's a huge step for me, and I feel on top of the world! Bonus pic with my baby Mipha ✨		"Heck yeah, congratulations!
LETSGOOO
Congratulations! It can be scary, and it's great to hear you found the courage to bring it up! Also, may I say, in a completely non-flirtatious way, you are really aesthetically pleasing to my eyes (idk, still trying to come up with good gender neutral compliments)
Fuck yeah man, it feels great when you get to come out. Happy for you!
Congratulations! Your feelings of excitement are valid and please don’t give yourself doubt! I can relate with telling my close friends and relative about my pronouns (they/them) and when they use it, it gives me good feelings!
Yaasss
I'm super proud of you oml, it really is a nice feeling when you can get it out
oh my god that’s amazing! i’m so proud of you and you’re awesome! don’t let anything or anyone bring you down! <3
Of course that's a big deal dont play it down. Congratulations 🥰🥰🥰🥰
You and your pup are so cute 🥰🥰🥰
That's a fricking HUUUGE step! How did you find the confidence to do it?😍
Congrats, you look amazing!
So happy for you! That is so brave!
Congrats!! And please tell Mipha we all love them.
I'm so happy for you!! That's a huge step! Proud of you :)

Thats a super big deal! I got the urge today to get on reddit to support the LGBTQ community. We are awesome and brave and SEXY! I haven't fully come our as non binary....I want to but I present fem so much that I feel like it won't matter to anyone. I've asked some of my friends to call me she/they but...no one really used the they part. My husband kinda knows I think and when I have a day where I want to present androgynous he really tries to use pronouns that I feel comfortable with. You look awesome!
Congrats!! 🎉
Congrats, that is awesome
Let's goooo! Glad to hear it! Also Mipha is so cute I love them so much
YAAAAAYYYYY CONGRATULATIONS
Congrats! I'm so happy to see you're doing well!
Thank you!! The first few times they used he/him I was ecstatic. This has been a really big mental block for me and now that I've finally started to hurdle it I feel so relieved. ☺️
It was pretty scary but I'm so glad that I did it. And thank you so much, that's so sweet! I absolutely love the way you worded that, idk if it's my enbyness or my autism that prefers somewhat objectively stated, gender neutral compliments, but either way I greatly enjoyed that. Thank you. :)
Thank you so much for saying that. 🥰
Aw thank you! :)
Thank you so much! I'm not sure, I had sort of a bad day that forced me to really think about my gender more and what I wanted and I just realized this was what I wanted. I posted in r/transtryouts and the response I got made me so happy I cried. So I started by just asking my other trans friends to use he/they, and how good it felt when they did just boosted me enough to tell other people. :)
Awesome to read you have such supportive friends! I hope you have just as much success in continuing to learn more about who you are together!
I'm right tho. I get the same feeling whenever I tell someone new. It doesn't stop being exciting.
That's so awesome! I hope to be as brave as you someday🥰
Right?? I'm so glad you've felt that way too! And for me especially, this was something that I knew I wanted for a long time but that I was having a really hard time admitting to, so getting it out there felt like a big weight off my chest.
I'm not fully decided on anything yet (name/pronouns/identity etc) still flicking between my birth name and new name. Did you have this or did you just know?
I definitely felt that way about a lot of aspects about transitioning. I tried going with just a sort of gender-neutralized shortened version of my birth name for a while, but it didn't take me long to realize I just wanted to ditch my old name entirely. A lot of that had to do with trauma too, though, so your experience may vary. But I went from she/they pronouns to they/them and now to he/they, mostly just because I was scared to come right out of the gate with he/they. I was in denial for a long time about the fact that I just don't like she/her, because I was scared I'd be rejected by the people who knew me that way. Truth is, I'm pretty feminine in a lot of ways but just feel zero connection to actually being female, so it took a lot of soul-searching to pick those apart.
Yeah I guess it'll just take time. I'm still pretty new to it. At the moment I'm using he/she/they but that's probably just cuz I haven't decided yet haha
Totally fair, you've got plenty of time. Don't let anyone make you feel pressured into having yourself all figured out right away just to make things easier for them."	tkdeh5	NonBinary	699	0.99	2022-03-22 21:17:19
idk who needed to hear this but it’s never an inconvenience to correct someone when they use the wrong pronouns!		"This look is everything
It’s not inconvenient to correct someone but sometimes it is inconvenient to have to listen to someone self-flagellate for their perceived mistake when I’m just trying to supply them with information I don’t expect them to be able to tell just by looking at me. Correcting people who know me is my jam though.
your hair is fantastic
Let me hit that joint real quick. Go on with your bad self.
YES TO ALL OF THIS. Thank you for the reminder 🙏🏾
you look so cool omg 🥺
aaa u look so cool

You have great vibes and this post gave me such calm. 10 out of 10 🌈✨
It’s me I need to hear this I’m a serious wimp

Just here to tell you that you look amazing. Also, love the tattoo!

What gender is it where you just don’t care about pronouns because no pronoun can possibly describe who you are as a person
You're amazing 😍"	mwcikl	NonBinary	703	1.0	2021-04-22 19:22:43

How. Those are tangible things while the binary/nonbinary is ideas and feelings.
Yes but it’s second person pronoun not a third like she/they/he/xe/fae/ etc.

If you are in a conversation with a friend and you are talking about another friend you would never refer to that other friend as you because you are talking ABOUT them not TO them. Second person is used to talk to someone like how I’m talking to YOU right now. But if we are talking about your friend I am referring to THEM in the third person because we are talking about THEM

I turn 28 years old in three hours and I’m excited. Because during the pandemic last year, I taught myself how to do protective hairstyles and from then on, I started to question my gender incessantly. I recently realized that I’m non-binary and as of now, my pronouns are still he/him/his.		"Those look so cool! You look stunning!
happy birthday! also, you're gorgeous
Congrats!

What's a protective hairstyle though?
Happy 2h early birthday!!!
Happy birthday! You look beautiful!
Your outfit in the 3rd pic is fire
I love your hair 😍😍
Wow you look like a model
Shout out to all my masc-leaning enby’s who still use he/him pronouns. Your gender is not your pronouns and your pronouns are not your gender (although obviously for some they are aligned). We can still have absolutely wild gender expressions within our non-binary existence and be comfortable with being referred to as he/him <3
I want your hair T.T
Your hair is so beautiful! Happy birthday!
Omg you're so gorgeous!

Thank you so much! ☺️☺️☺️
Awww thank you!!
its a style that keeps the hair sort of tucked away from furthur natual manipulation. Braids, twists, and locks are examples, andncan help maintain the hair structure without damage from the day to day living - ensuring a healthy and harmonious hair growth

this type of styling is.typically resevered for the curlier/coily hair, such as type 3 and 4

My boss just lectured me about being NB.	"21: So I got hired at this ice cream shop in town because I'd been out of work for 2 months and was desperate for any kind of employment.  During the interview, I felt I should disclose that I identify as nonbinary and use they/them pronouns.  This was not me forcing anyone to use my pronouns and shoving my gender down anyone's throat.  This was simply me feeling the need to disclose something I think should be disclosed.  Luckily, I was offered the job, so it didn't seem to be too much of an issue.  Now my boss is from Iraq, and I know the culture there is very different than it is here in the grand old US of A.  I disclosed my gender and pronouns to the manager who interviewed me, unaware that she would tell my boss about it.  I haven't started working yet, so I stopped in tonight to see when I would be put on the schedule.  My boss took this as an opportunity to sit me down and lecture me about why me being nonbinary and asking him to use my preferred pronouns is ""too confusing"" and ""asking too much"".  His words were ""I can't disrespect English grammar, and I feel like calling you they instead of she is improper"".  Naturally, I was starting to get kind of upset, but trying my damndest to hide it because I need the job.  He looked at me and said ""I can see in your eyes that you feel upset right now, but you're the only one who can be responsible for how you feel."" before telling me a story about how he was racially profiled when he came to America.  To me, that story felt, not only irrelevant in this context, but incredibly patronizing.  He also asked if my goal was to be called they/them or was my goal to be a successful person.  Those two things are not mutually exclusive.  I told him I feel like my gender doesn't really matter.  It's ice cream.  No customer is gonna care who makes it, as long as it gets made.  I said if a customer calls me she, I'm not gonna care because I'm most likely never going to see that person again.  He got really confused when I said that and asked me why I disclosed it in the first place.  I disclosed it because it felt like the honest thing to do.  To be honest, I don't really know what to think about this situation.  Am I overreacting here?

Edit: I've decided, for personal and moral reasons, to not continue with this job.  I understand cultural differences, but this incident really left a bad taste in my mouth.  I could never be comfortable working in an environment run by someone who's openly transphobic and racist and almost wears their transphobia and racism like a badge of honor."	"My housemate uses they/them pronouns and has a master's degree in linguistics. The word ""they"" when referring to a singular person has been happening for literally centuries. Singular ""they"" pre-dates singular ""you"" (previously terms like ""thou"" and ""thee"" were used for one person). The ""respecting English"" thing is bullshit.
The “but grammar though” but is absolute crap and a means of avoiding the “but I don’t wanna” parts of these mindsets. Ugh. Tell him (and any future ppl who say this) that you are asking for *the most polite form of address* as per British English ;-) and feel royal as you say it ;-)
I'd gently remind him that discrimination against gender is a protected class. Be even more firm about your gender now, don't even respond when a staff member misgenders you. (Customers are meh) racism sucks but that doesn't mean he can now turn around and be a bigot himself.
i’m so sorry you had to go through that. i’m glad you were honest from the start (I usually have waited until THEY ask ME). but you aren’t overreacting, this would have made me uncomfortable too. i understand why he might want to stick to “proper” grammar, it’s just so frustrating because language and grammar change over time, it’s completely normal as humans evolve. I almost can’t imagine choosing between putting up with this or losing a job so soon.
Honestly, this would be a little bit of a petty move, but if you’re a native english speaker and he isn’t, I would take the opportunity to school him on the (long) history of the singular “they” in the english language.
Yeeeeee, I don’t trust people enough to disclose my gender in any official setting. I’ll boymode my way out of those uncomfortable situations. Mad props to you for being open with that tho!! I’m sorry, people suck
Not willing to disrespect the English language, but perfectly willing to not respect you🙃🙃🙃
You’re not over reacting-he’s transphobic, and probably mad you got hired at all. It sounds like him and the manager aren’t on the same page, and you’re gonna be the one to deal with the brunt of it. 

As a non-binary of color, I also wanna point out that there’s trans people in all cultures from all backgrounds and there’s transphobes from all backgrounds too. Intentional or not the “I know things are done different there” ends up leaning in to the trope of “brown people in third world countries don’t have the progressive understandings of queerness that we have in the west”, it’s like white savior mentality. 

So yeah, things *are* different there, however that doesn’t excuse him being transphobic. Transphobia’s bad in every culture, and although there’s nuisance to be had when communicating with someone from a different culture, that nuisance is for when both parties are trying to meet each other in good faith. That’s not what was going on here. So yes, different cultures different norms communications etc however this isn’t a cultural misunderstanding or difficulty, he’s a bigot. 

Harsh truth from an old poor ass trans: being out (especially in these times) at the work place is dangerous. You’re tying your income to whether or not someone feels like flowing with the status quo which can very easily leave you without money, which depending on your circumstances might leave you houseless or hungry. If you’re going to go forward with it, it’s wiser to gauge the environment first and to have a plan b lined up in case someone chooses to surprise you. 

I bring this up, because the way I read this (which may be a mistake on my part) it feels like you feel like you *must* be honest with them, but the reality id that your employer/co workers are not entitled to knowing who you are as a person. No one is entitled to that. If you want to be out, go for it, but don’t let people make you feel bad if you *chose* not to, and whatever you do, protect yourself. It’s always better to be prepared for the worst. 

Best of luck, friend. I hope the job works out well!
The bit that stuck out to me was the ‘you’re the only one who can be responsible for how you feel’. That sentence is just wrong. You cannot control how you feel, you control how you REACT to it and the way he’s using it is like someone calling you slurs and then being like ‘you’re getting sad!! Its not me using slurs, it’s you getting upset that’s the problem!’  It’s manipulative and I’m pissed off just reading it. 

Just because he’s experienced his own discrimination does not mean he truly understands or is an ally and it’s disingenuous of him to try and act like he gets it and then use that against you. You’re not overreacting, this guy is a bit of a bellend.
Perhaps you can reframe it in a way he might empathise with, if you want to try? 

For example - he's from Iraq, so his name might be different to most English names and harder for English speakers to pronounce. 

If he tells an English person ""My name is Quasim"" and they say ""Well I can't pronounce that as an English speaker so I'm just going to call you Jeff, because I can't disrespect the English language like that by using sounds that don't exist in it.""  That would be disrespectful, right? He isn't called Jeff, and by disregarding his name just because it's difficult for them, that person would have put their own comfort above respecting his identity.  

It may be difficult for some people to use gender neutral pronouns consciously (it's absolutely not difficult to use them unconsciously - most of us do it all the time ""someone left their umbrella, I hope they don't get wet in the rain"" for example) but it's not respectful for them to put their comfort above trying to be respectful. That doesn't mean we always have to get it right - I'm sure if an English speaker mispronounced his name while at least _trying_ to get it right, especially if they asked how he pronounces it and corrected themselves, he wouldn't be hurt, because they're at least trying. That's all you want from him, is to try. Not perfection, but an effort that shows mutual respect.
You’re underacting. Burn that place to the ground. (Legally)
You’re not overreacting. I was recently hired to pump sauces and take orders at the counter of a fried chicken place, and I had a separate page to fill out at my orientation that asked for my pronouns and any preferred name I might have. Every manager I met clarified to confirm. I listed she/they and everyone has rolled along with using both interchangeably. Two of my supervisors are NB and I’ve never heard anyone misgender them. 

It’s just fried chicken, but they manage to still give af about the happiness and safety of their staff, which includes not discriminating against us based on our gender. I’m not saying you’ll be able to quit your job and find a place like mine….Portland is a special town. But I am saying that I know from direct experience that what you’re asking for is a simple, reasonable and actionable request. If companies continue with bigoted practices, it’s not because giving a shit is simply too much work. It’s because they’re bigots.
Ask him for this in an email and then go and find a lawyer. That'll be funny.
Talk to the manager about your concerns and ask you boss if he wants some resources on how they/them pronouns work and how to learn to use them.  You are not overreacting. Everyone should be respected and it’s not okay for your boss to not respect you because they don’t know how to. Your boss can learn.
Oh interesting! It sounds like he was really expecting you to say ""if a customer calls me me she, I'm going to get really upset"". Because he thinks that would be like a customer being racist to him.

You're not overreacting. And I don't think he is, either. He's learning something from you.

Think of it this way: if he were in your position, he'd be closeted. Because that's the strategic move, and for him strategy outweighs honesty.

The grammar aspect here is probably part of his experience, too. A lot of immigrants who learned English under pressure to assimilate learned very quickly that if they did it ""wrong"" according to Customer Karen, they saw immediate bad consequences. When you build your life around ducking, being asked to stand up can feel like too much.

Keep going. You've had the talk, you both came out confused, now it's time to make ice cream and get a paycheck. People know what you'd prefer, now whatever pronouns they use is information about them and not you.
Keep that job for only as long as you have to. Immediately start searching for something else. If you can actually find another interview, its easy enough to say that you found out at the start of your current job that the boss would not respect your identity and you are looking for some place with a boss that does not harass you.
I think in general, business are going to secretly discriminate against hiring nonbinary
 This is not advise, but That’s illegal! but getting justice could be tricky. I feel for you!
Do you think his story could be him trying to talk about his situation with being discriminated against and ""look how I ignored it and that was the only way for me to be successful"". It's not an excuse. But maybe it's a explanation that will help make you feel a little better about it. My brother has an attitude like that and it makes it challenging to talk to him sometimes.
ah yes, the good ol' grammar trick, quickly followed by ""i've had it bad that means you can't have it bad"" saying, gotta love that.
Unrelated but god the ""you're the only one responsible for how you feel"" thing. Ugh, hate it (in this context)
He’s being a tool but it is sadly common. We often have to put up with nonsense. I just stay closeted at work.
You being upset definitely makes sense - You deserve a job where you're respected for who you are, but I also understand being desperate for employment. *Hug*
‘They’ as a singular pronoun has actually existed longer than ‘you’ so yeah, fuck that guy
You could always just leave the job and be broke.
Ugh that sounds like such an uncomfortable situation. I hate when people basically say things like “I suffered once and instead of making things easier for you the way I wish it was for me I will also make you suffer for being ‘different’” it’s so fucking stupid. 

I applaud you for disclosing and trying to get the best experience for yourself and try to avoid being misgendered, it’s not easy.

I also disclose at my jobs (I work gig based) and generally yep, when people don’t get it I’m like fine, don’t get it. I try to treat others how I want to be treated, and generally take notes for the future. If this person doesn’t respect me, I try to keep my distance, of course that can be hard with a boss, and if possible try not to work with them again. A job is a job most of the time. 

If it becomes a constant problem of him bringing this up out of nowhere or being very rude, then maybe other things have to change but I know it’s really hard to get a job right now so hopefully other than that one terrible interaction things will be okay
Hey, so as a brown person myself, it sounds like you have encountered a Classic Uncle in the wild. Common behavior includes: monopolizing conversations, patronizing, totally missing the point, feels like he owes the Youth (and frankly anyone who can be a captive audience) a lecture on sight, tone deaf at best and casually egregious at worst etc.

Of course, I hope this goes without saying, that not all South Asian/Middle Eastern/North African etc uncles act like this because they are not a monolith by any means AND humans everywhere are complex & complicated. However, there are enough of them out there that this behavior is very recognizable (and intimately so for me lol) 😅
It is shitty, there is no two ways about it. I can share some tried and true techniques in dealing with this type of Uncles though: 
I hope it is true that you never will see him again but in the meantime know that it is okay to 100% be petty about it (just make it seem respectful on the surface). I.e. carry a print out with you from some Official source with explanations of why they/them is grammatically accurate. You can choose to go on the offensive and give it to him outright when you see him next and veil it as you wanted to help him learn English OR if he ever brings this topic up with you again/you cannot stand his blatant misgendering…just quietly give him the paper and let your silence speak for itself.

Also be very spelled out and blatant about your boundaries (adding some slight passive aggressive twists can be effective) if he is to speak to you about your pronouns again: “I shared it so I can be honest about myself and I wanted to trust the place I am working at. I clearly cannot do that so please do not talk to me about it again. It is no longer any of your business.” Or “if you are spending this much time thinking about it, why can’t you use my pronouns? Don’t talk to me about then again unless you plan on using the correct pronouns”

Practice one liners and slightly stinging things you can say if you ever get caught in a lecture again (I really would prepare for that bc if he did this on the first day, the chances of it happening again are Not low). Like “sir, I came to serve ice cream, not attend a lecture”,
“Sir you seem to think a lot about pronouns, are you sure you don’t want to try using they/them too? 😂”
Etc.

Aka long story short, instead of just going the thick skin route, TROLL the hell out of him, confuse him, distract him, arm yourself with information (literally…or figuratively…up to you) and if none of the above stops it, see if you are able to find allies with other upper management. If he can’t call you your correct pronouns, the least he can do is to never speak to you about them again…gender discrimination is not legal so if someone needs to discipline him /remind him of the rules, they can do that. 

Hope this helps 💕 I am sorry that you experienced this and I hope you have solid supports irl too. Best of luck!
Yeah fuck that dude. Get it in writing and find a labor department near you. Discrimination isn't really a cool thing to do as a boss.
The fact he tried to use Racism comes off to me as, ""Hey, Your experiences with Discrimination is not Valid"" 
Coming from someone who is Racially Mixed it irks me knowing that unfortunately there are people who do use their own Experiences against our community because they ""Don't feel like we exist"" or that They feel like we aren't Valid"".  It makes it even more uncomfortable for the People who are Racial Minorities who are apart of our Community to know that there are people who genuinely want to use Racism they experienced to invalidate people in our Community, those are the Bigots who make groups look bad (Yes every group has bad apples unfortunately). 

Anyways, I can try to give some good Advice. 
If he continues to be a Bigot about your Gender Identity (Example:Harassment) I would check your States recording laws and if you're able to record him being a Bigot and report it HR or The Better Business bureau.
Me personally I’d look for another job. But I also understand the desperation. I’m lucky enough that the job I’m in right now is super accepting of my gender identity. They have slip ups and sometimes accidentally deadname me, but it doesn’t really bother me because I know they’re trying and they always apologize. It’s kinda the bare minimum to respect a persons identity in my opinion. It might be best for your mental health to be around affirming people instead of ignorant transphobes.
Learn about the history of singular they and then bring it to him. Thank him for giving you a chance to learn about your native language and say that you felt it appropriate to help him pick up more English since he wants to.
What a cunt. His example of being judged on his race (something he didn’t not choose and is discriminated against) should have given him some empathy. I hope he is more tolerable as time goes on, or you find more stable employment somewhere a bit more accepting
Man, fuck that guy for real. 
It's up to you, but I don't think I would disclose that at the interview. I would just bring up my pronouns to coworkers when I start the job. Just because of having to deal with bullshit like this.
Tell him proper grammar, is not misusing the English “sexist” language
youre in the right. i work in a vape store, very similar situation. my supervisor and coworkers know i go by theythem and refer to me that way. but when i see customers and they call me maam or she, i just shrug it off because chances are A) i wont see them again, B) they simply dont know nonbinary people exist (like older 50+ yo people), or C) socially conditioned to take someone at face value 

if they become a regular, ill tell them and they either say oh, okay! or, whats that mean? and i get to give a little lesson and hopefully increase their understanding and tolerance.

this boss of yours sounds super asanine. he doesnt need to understand, he needs to respect it. and if youre deliberately misgendered by anyone above you, paid less bc of it, fired for it/never hired at all, that goes against the fair labor act; thats because theyre either socially, financially or otherwise descriminating against you for your gender. 

there is literally no difference between sharing your name, and sharing your pronouns. both ways people refer to you. 

absolutely crazy, i cant believe people act this way espECIALLY people in positions of power
If he wants to use ""proper grammer"" thy and thee or one, should be perfectly acceptable. As a poc person I just wanna say his belittling your experience with his own like that is not cool. I'm sure he has been through alot too, but he seems to lack understanding of intersectionality. All our suffering is linked by a system of hierarchical standards. No one is free until everyone is free. It is true people of color are at high risk, but so are peeps like us.
I’m not defending him, just explaining further. So some of his “concern” has basis - in that you will experience prejudice and discrimination. 

It’s not just about Iraqi culture, it’s about Iraqi generational trauma and surviving at all costs with no backup options or support network… he’s in the USA because he ran. Assimilating and integrating and doing everything not to stand out more than you need to, is a do or die tactic. 

Explain to him that the America you want to live in and the one in your head is where people can be free to be who they really are. He doesn’t have to agree with it but he should respect other people and what they want to be called; it’s just kindness and good manners. 

And yes he should know Iraqi genderqueer people exist eg. https://twitter.com/glamrou  For some hiding themselves is itself a death.

You are not overreacting.  You may not have legal recourse, but are not in the wrong.
I think you did everything right, kept your cool, and had good responses.

I recommend working on your more accepting coworkers so they they use your pronouns in his presence in day-to-day interactions, which would make it very hard for him to deny your pronouns as an accepted English usage. I advice against confronting your boss.
100% this is queerphobia at its finest, but as someone who is perceived as indigenous first and queer second, I think he was trying to tell you that anecdote to relate that he’s faced discrimination and endured it to be successful, and that you will have to as well (not necessarily from him).

In an old world, that is compassion, but in the modern age it only teaches people to be complacent in their shitty environment and that bigots can do and say what they want. which you should never have to be complacent in that kind of behaviour. You’re absolutely not overreacting.

I’m so sorry that you are now employed by a queerphobe, and I hope you find success one day and a safe place to be yourself 💕
Literally nobody fucking cared about singular “they” until other people told them to. I’m so fucking sick of this asinine garbage. 

Good for you. I’m sorry you’re in this position, but I envy the courage it took to even say anything in the first place.
The way I’d walk out of there
>He got really confused when I said that and asked me why I disclosed it in the first place.

you can probably explain to him that you don't have to be with the customers for hours at a time but you have to with your coworkers. for me, being misgendered by a stranger really isn't a big deal, but being constantly misgendered by people I regularly talk to gets exhausting. I wouldn't correct a customer on my pronouns but I would with a coworker (if any of mine actually knew I was nonbinary) bc that's someone I see and talk to regularly. 

you also might wanna point out to him that the singular they has been used since the 1300s in the English language. I get people from other cultures not really understanding the concept of being nonbinary (I have quite a few friends from different countries who genuinely don't know) but it's not an excuse to deliberately not use your pronouns.
Even Shakespeare used ""they"" for singular pronounce. Okay, Shakespeare also made men dress up like women and women dress up like men and it was at a time where only men were allowed to play on stage but still.
It always takes my brain an extra minute to remember that people who have faced discrimination aren’t always against all forms of discrimination. 
I remember meeting this guy from overseas who in one breath told me about all the hardship he’s faced in the US because of his nationality and then threw out some slurs about all of our black coworkers. 😵‍💫
I've never seen anyone with advanced education in English or History have an issue woth singular They pronouns. The closest I've come across was my 9th grade English teacher who was really weird about using ""he or she"" instead of they to denote someone you don't know the gender of. This was nearly 20 years ago, so it wasn't the hot topic it is today, but she also made being hateful a very large chunk of her personality. She admitted to having a portrait of the founder of the KKK hanging up in her living room. I'm sure she's a big JK Rowling fan today.
Singular neutral predates singular feminine iirc, right?
[Singular they](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Singular_they) has its own Wikipedia page and is three centuries older than singular you, which replaced [thou](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thou), so OP is most definitely in the right on English grammar. But I have to advise against arguing with their boss. Much better to get everyone else on side and let gradual social pressure do its thing.

Be trans. Serve ice cream. Obtain cash.
But seriously though: “they” is absolutely grammatically correct ESPECIALLY when the speaker does not know the gender of the person to whom they are referring. “Someone left their gloves on the table; I will put them in Lost and Found” is accurate.
And a PS: if this is a national chain, let their DEI folks know. Also, consider an EEO report as this person is undoubtedly bringing their prejudice and preferences into the workplace.
Hearing It From Someone Who (I Presume, Although I Could Be Wrong) Doesn't Speak English Natively Honestly Makes It Worse, Although At The Same Time Hopefully It'd Be Easier To Convince Them That It Actually Is Grammatically Correct.
Yeah he also told me he once told an Asian lady to ""go cook her dog"" because she cut him off in traffic.  So not only is he transphobic, he's racist as well.  He really has no room at all to be talking about bigotry.
His bad experiences also shouldn’t affect the reasoning behind why he is being bigoted now. Him telling that story sounds more like “I used to be bullied in school, now I’m a teacher who bullies my students because that’s life.”
> i understand why he might want to stick to “proper” grammar

English isn't my mother language, but I had understand that using ""they"" as singular pronoum it's proper english grammar.
I'm gonna keep the job and just try to have thick skin about it.  I've been through way too much in my life for this one moment to keep me down forever, as much as it might have hurt me.  Besides, he said I'm probably never gonna see him at work anyways.
The “proper” grammar thing is horse shit anyways, as they/them have always been able to be used as singular pronouns for anyone of unspecified gender for as long as the words have existed.
Don't forget to start the lesson with ""umm, actually"" just to really drive the point home.
not to mention so much queer and transphobia only exists in its current form in countries in the Global South because of colonialism done by European countries, so..
Seconding this as someone transitioning later in life: do not come out at work unless you know that you have the support of your first life supervisor. You also want an copy of the company's code of conduct, with the section on anti discrimination highlighted. (If they won't give you a copy of the handbook or relevant policies, or if they don't include an anti-discrimination policy, you have bigger problems.) 

 Ideally, before you come out you also want to have the contact info for your employer's HR and/or DEI office, your state's EEO office, and that of an employment lawyer or legal aid office. Yes, it's shitty that we have to do all of this to get the basic civility that cis people and some passing binary trans people get by default. But if we want to see actual change, we need to be willing and able to challenge the power structures we want to change. Much harder to do that while homeless and hungry. If not disclosing is what it takes to be financially stable, do it till you're in a position to come out without getting harangued or fired.
I doubt this is going to work considering he basically told op that his attitude is to just suck it up.
> You’re underacting. Burn that place to the ground. (Legally)

With the blessing from the owners 😁
This was an interesting take and not how I immediately understood the situation when reading the post, but it seems reasonable. It's possible that he is open to learning. I say give this a chance, OP!
> She admitted to having a portrait of the founder of the KKK hanging up in her living room. 

  
WHAT. THE. FUCK.
At least in law I believe. A lot of issues came up because law makers said: obviously he includes women as well it’s gender neutral! But in practice people would point to it as a reason for not letting women do stuff
Sounds like he needs to be reported to HR if you have one. I'm so sorry he did that to you.
Imagine my shock.
English is my native language and I have a degree in 
English. I’ve only ever heard people say “they” is improper when people start discussing non-binary people. 

It’s just an excuse to not deal with the whole thing.
It is proper grammar! I bet the boss uses it in his Daily life too without realising it.
yeah you’re right!! i put “proper” it in quotes bc it’s a common myth that singular they is grammatically wrong
Absolutely, this is a really important point as well!!!
Yes to all of this! 

I’d also add: be familiar with your states laws regarding trans rights. The idea that trans people are a fully protected class nationwide is really not accurate. 

https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transgender_rights_in_the_United_States

I would also get familiar with your states workers rights laws. Right to work states, for example, are more hostile to workers as a whole. 

If money is a concern, it’s vital to have a realistic understanding of how easily you can be fired, for what, and with how much notice. You may not be outright fired for being trans, but you may be fired for having low sales, not being a “team player” etc. My personal favorite (right to work State) technique is: we won’t fire you, but we’ll literally schedule you for one hour a week on a day/at a time you’ve said you can’t work indefinitely. 

Thank you for popping on! I feel like the Debbie downer here, but I couldn’t keep my mouth shut in good conscious either. I’m closeted at work (my industry is dangerous and my earning potentials better if I’m not out), and the number of times someone’s realized/I’ve been outted which has lead to me getting bashed and fired is just too high to say nothing. It’s real out here, ya know
Ive closed establishments for less. Karens wish they could do what i do.
Side question how did you get my text above your text like that?
Yeah a lot of older southerners have this fantasy of the antebellum period being a time of regal chivalry and the Confederates as their noble knights, with Nathan Bedford Forrest being one of the best. She and others would say they and he wasn't racist, but she did move schools when it started to have more black kids. And even of you ignore the KKK stuff somehow, NBF was still a giant piece of shit.
Oh my understanding was 'thy' predated 'her' or 'she' linguistically
Singular They is older than singular You. It's plenty proper.
Also a native English speaker, was explicitly taught that ""they"" was only plural and that ""he"" or ""he or she"" were the only proper singular forms for an unknown person in primary school in the 90s. Neither singular ""they"" nor the generic usage of ""she"" was considered acceptable, and I distinctly remember my 2nd, 3rd, and 4th grade English teachers deducting marks from anyone who dared use singular ""they"" in an assignment. I don't think most of the kids were aware nonbinary people existed, and it was still ""wrong"" when a person used it to refer to a nonhuman (e.g. their pet) or an unknown person, so I don't feel like it was specifically targeted at us.

It was / is bullshit regardless - others have rightfully pointed out that ""you"" was originally the 2nd person plural, and only became common as a singular pronoun after older 2nd person singular pronouns (thee, thine, thou, thyself) which singular ""they"" is contemporaneous with if not older than fell into disuse - but it still took me some time to unlearn. Fortunately I get the impression that it's not common anymore. Moreover even if it _was_ still commonly taught it would still be a terrible excuse for refusing to accommodate others.

----

PS: I still can't imagine a grammar instructor teaching the current understanding of ""correct grammar"" from the field of linguistics - that no native speaker's grammar is wrong and that differences between an individual's production of their native language and its standard form (nevermind that English doesn't have one of those) are features of the speaker's personal register or dialect - but that's veering a bit off topic.
oh, i know! that’s why i said “proper” instead of proper

I'm up north, we have racist teachers but not to that extreme (from my experience).   


Besides my shop teacher who's... shitty but an amazing teacher and a good person if he was properly educated
According to google she and her were first used in 12th century while thy was used in early 15th. Obviously it was just a quick search but thats what google says
Interesting. I guess when I think about it, I was never explicitly taught any use for “they” other than plural. But I don’t remember any instruction that it was incorrect for situations when the gender of a person was unclear. 

On the other hand, while I can write and speak with correct grammar all day long, I’m rather terrible at grammar outside of using it in a sentence. For example, I have to think about it for a second if someone asks me if a word is an adjective or a verb. Or I was absolutely awful at diagramming sentences. 

So maybe I was taught it and it just didn’t stick. 🤷🏻‍♂️
Dont doubt you know! My comment was more aimed at the boss not even knowing it yet claiming that to be his reason
Oh no i mean the text showing that you replied to me
I learned English as a 3rd language in school in 2000s and I automatically used singular they as a gender neutral pronoun before I even knew what a non-binary person was

Help a dad out with terminology? Please?	"I have a non-binary kid, twelve years old. They use they/them pronouns, and have for a few years now. They have their first crush, and refer to this girl as their ""girlfriend."" It's Middle School, so I expect it will last a week, and being a girlfriend consists of sitting next to each other in the lunchroom... but for this week, and for the future... When I'm talking about it, what is my kid in this relationship? What is the non-binary equivalent for a boyfriend/girlfriend? Yes, I started by googling it - but mostly  I get answers like ""lover"" or ""partner"", and they just don't apply to a kid with a crush. Datefriend? (They haven't been on a date) Enbyfriend?   
Help a dad out here!"	"[deleted]
Sweetheart is a cute option imo. They’re her sweetheart!
I advocate a return to old-timey terminology. Sweetheart, paramour, beloved, suitor, admirer, beau… so many awesome options
Joyfriend, enbyfriend, datefriend, or datemate are all ones ive heard before. I like joyfriend best for this context, I think it's cute, but different folks have different preferences and your kid might also.
Sweetie is a nice genderfree term that feels ok for middle schoolers
Significant other?
sometimes shortened to s/o

the terminology is pretty up in the air and sometimes depends on the person. 

maybe ask them what they prefer?

and hey, maybe it'll last more than a week. communication is key. you're doing great :)
My nibbling has a sweetheart just like yours! As their nonny (non binary older relative), I am trying to be just as supportive of their relationship as I would be of a heterosexual relationship. When we talk, I ask about their girlfriend or their sweetheart or their crush. My nibbling is very giggly and very much happy with whatever their relationship, whether friends or more. The most important thing is to let them be happy, & celebrate their happiness with them. I can not tell you how important it is for many trans kids.
Honestly asking your kid is the best answer. Partner is a good default though. ""Would you like to call you [girlfriend]'s partner or something else?""
First off. You're doing great. Keep it up.  
  
To answer the question;  We're still settling on terminology, so there isn't a fixed answer. I've seen the options you listed (and, yeah, little mature in context for middle school), but I've also seen 'theyfriend'.
“Boo” is nicely age appropriate, it’s the modernization of beau
As an enby parent to a 14yo who uses he/they pronouns,  Imma say try ""sweety"" or ""sweetheart"" out for size. Both words still have a cute and more innocent connotation than ""partner"" or ""lover"".
You don’t question the validity/permanence of middle school “girlfriend” so I don’t see why question the term “partner” either. Middle schoolers have school project partners, too. Partner doesn’t have to mean lifelong or unchanging. Nonetheless, I’d just ask your kid what they prefer.
I’m nb and masculine leaning so sometimes I use boyfriend( but I’m afab so it can make me a little nervous) My boyfriend refers to me as his bf sometimes, and I do like it. But because I’m still a little new to this, I usually go with partner.
My Girlfriend calls me her Enbyfriend and that works well for us. 
My beat and strongest advice. 
Ask the kids. 
Let them lead the way. 
Enbyfriend, sweetheart, or be fancy and say paramour 

But mostly let your kiddo lead the way
I'm much older than your kid and I wish my dad had ever given this much of a fuck. Happy to see you asking
You can say SO (significant other), joyfriend, enbyfriend, partner

You should ask what they prefer to use
Wish I had a dad like you! I'm not really sure of the answer, but you are asking questions and trying!! Every time I've tried to explain my pronouns or anything related to my gender(transfem nonbinary, she/they), my dad just shuts down and acts like what I'm saying isn't real. ""You'll always be MY little boy"" is my dad's favorite thing to say now.... Don't be like my dad, keep up the good work you're doing with yourself and your kid!!
these are all of the terms i've heard so far, but it depends what they prefer: voidfriend, joyfriend, enbyfriend, and datemate
I'm not sure why you think ""partner"" doesn't apply; I don't think the word partner says anything about the strength or duration of the relationship.

Also, I'm sure you're not anyway, but please don't ever be dismissive about the importance of your kid's relationship in front of them. That's the fastest way in the world to destroy a parent-child relationship.
Aw ! It’s so awesome that you’re supporting your child this way ! 

Partner, joyfriend I’ve heard and like ! I would talk with your child about it and see how they feel ! I’m sure it means a lot to them that you’d want to know, and it can deepen your bond with them 💖💖💖
Totally depends on the person. I still consider myself my husband's wife, but I didn't come out as nb until 8 years into our marriage & I'm 35 lol
I always said significant other, tbh.

Also can I just say thank you for being a supportive parent to your kid. More parents should be like you. It’s clear you’re a fucking A-grade Dad!
As an adult I use partner for serious relationships, but I've also said ""I've got a new sweetie,"" or ""my ex honey and I used to...""
We say partner and ""my sweetie"" etc
What would your nonbinary child be referred to in this relationship?  


That's actually an interesting question. One of the more annoying aspects of being Nonbinary is having to deal with English' gendered language.   


Taking a stab at it? Your child is the girl's lunchroom crush? Object of affection? Partner in romance?  


Enbyfriend is interesting. I might have to borrow that one.
my partner and I(bigender and enby respectably) use partner, gf/bf(interchangeably), or moon/star. we are kinda weird tho
The whole point of “partner” is that it doesn’t define gender, legal status, length of time, or how deep the relationship really goes. 

Yes, you hear it most often used by adults in long term relationships these days, but it doesn’t exclude by age. 

People joke about what partner conveys or doesn’t convey by saying things like “partner in crime? Marriage? 2v2 basketball?” but that’s partially the point
I had an acquaintance that just referred to their significant other as they're friend, but that can be confusing
My bf calls me his enbyfriend
whatever they want

some people use themfriend or partner
I would ask your kiddo what they prefer. Some options are: joyfriend, datemate, theyfriend, and partner.
I use datefriend or lovefriend for me, but Kiddo might prefer something else, maybe even fine with gendered words for now, but ask them before labelling them.
Datemate is a cute option
Oh my god what a cool dad. I wish i had a dad like you!
I wouldn't be surprised if others have already said this, But there isn't really an answer: Due to non-binary consciousness being relatively new (That sounds weird but I hope it's intelligible), There isn't really a solid term as there is for Boyfriend/Girlfriend. There are plenty of one's that people do or have used, Partner, Joyfriend, SO, And numerous others, And basically all of which someone dislikes for one reason or another. Really the best course of action would be to ask your kid themself, If they've already found one they like they can just tell you, Otherwise they could make up one of their own device, Or just look across the internet or something to find one they like, Certainly seems a better option than calling them one of numerous words suggested by people on the internet pretty much none of which are in widespread use.
in college my partner and I used ""datemate"" as we both were enby
Sweethearts when they’re in middle school, once high school hits then partners. However, you could also ask your child which terms they’d prefer. My Spouse is Enby as well and uses He/They. They are ok with being called just about anything lol
I think friend or crush works until they're ""officially"" dating. I personally like the word partner, but I know many people have different opinions. The best thing to do is ask your child.
Personfriend!
What about significant other? It can be used now or in the future
Its usually just whatever word the couple, in this case your child, feels like using. It can be different. Partner is the common one. I dont really like to use the other ones because they feel baby-ish (to me) but datemate gets a pass bc it rhymes. I like the good old “s/o” title for me personally, and the full significant other if im feeling fancy.               
The correct one is really just the one they prefer to use, tbh. You could ask them or pick one and see if they correct you. Asking is always the better way to go about it though.             
I wish i had a parent like you
Partner is what I generally use, though that may imply a level of formality that isn't present to some
Joyfriend!!
Yep, had this problem too, and I'm the one dating

I ended up using either partner or enbifriend for mine
Datemate possibly if you’re trying to think of something that sounds younger? Most people I know say partner but I understand that sounds like a more committed word for someone in middle school while boyfriend and girlfriend sound more casual imo!
enbyfrienddd
Partner in crime
i personally i love enbyfriend and partner, but i think it depends on what your kid wants. don’t feel bad asking!! <3
1. it makes me so so so happy to see a parent supporting their child 
2. I’ve seen the term joyfriend thrown around for the younger kiddos and i think it’s absolutely adorable and fits well!
There’s this book “Can’t take that away” where the protag is gender fluid. They get a boyfriend and when trying to decide what to call themselves the boyfriend suggests “boofriend”
It depends what they’re comfortable with. Try to talk to them about this and figure it out together. I personally use partner/significant other/lover (that one’s more adult) but enbyfriend, joyfriend and alternating between boyfriend or girlfriend are what I’ve heard other people use.
I typically use partner, but I've also seen people use significant other or joyfriend. I think the latter is definitely cuter and more kids friendly, but it honestly depends on what your kid prefers
my bf calls me his ""theyfriend"" which doesn't even make sense but i love it
Ask your kid!  You can say that you know enbies have different preferences for how to refer to their role in dating relationships, like joyfriend or sweetheart or datemate, and you'd love to know your preference so you can get it right. I love it SO MUCH when people ask me stuff like that.

Fwiw I stuck with 'girlfriend'.  I feel physically sick when anyone calls me a 'girl', but I really like being my partner's girlfriend.  I even still use it now that we're married (I use 'spouse' more often but just occasionally I'll say something silly like ""I got you a coffee because I'm such a fabulous girlfriend"")
I scanned all, yes all 77 comments looking for someone to notice that 

>refer to this girl as their ""girlfriend.""

I suggest you follow your kid's lead and use the terms they do for their partners, while also asking them what they think they'd like their partner's parents to call them, partner term-wise. 

There are tons of good suggestions here, and perhaps since there are people this age already on Reddit they can correct me if I'm wrong, but calling a tween's partner a partner to their face seems...too serious? Like, When I Was Their Age the term was ""Life Partner"" and it referred to gay couples who adopted each other so they could give each other inheritance rights, visit each other in the hospital, etc. Now that I'm my age people of all sexualities use it but it denotes a commitment that I feel like doesn't fit a 12 year old. 

Anyway thinking out loud. As another person noted, we don't really have a set terminology for it yet so welcome to being a part of history! When we're all old, we can remember that We Were There. 

TLDR: ask your kid what they prefer at the time like you're doing now and listen when they ask you to change it like you're probably also doing now.
Theyfriend is a common one
i was gonna say partner as it's how i always refer to my own partner but i see a lot of people saying sweetheart and i think that's a lot nicer :)
I was about to type ""partner"", but then I finished reading. Well, good question. I think ""crush"" may work as a title as well, but ""love friend"", ""joy friend"" or ""date friend"" are really nice options imo
I’m a big fan of “joyfriend” tbh, it fits the boyfriend/girlfriend pattern and has positive, happy vibes.
I like (s/o) but pronounced ""esso""
s/o is my favorite term, partner next. i like lover too
there is no clear answer and you could ask 20 non-binary people who date and you would get 19 different answers. It really depends on the relationship to what time she would use for them.
Joyfriend is a good one at that age. A favorite tv show of mine, One Day At A Time, has a nonbinary character who is simply someone's ""significant other"" (though there's a play on words re: their name). 

If they're into anime, ""koibito"" works and is gender-neutral, means basically 'sweetheart' without a sexual connotation, just romantic. 

Asking the kiddo might be the best idea. I remember joking with a young enby I know who was dating a lot of people in quick succession (it's high school, two weeks is FOREVER!) who called themselves a ""whirlfriend"". 

On this one: Just ask~! Worst case scenario is your kiddo has been trying to figure it out and they won't have a clear answer for you.
I’m a little older I’m about 14 and non-binary I’ve had my fare share of crushes and if their not dating them their the crushei and it also can depend if your kids non-binary maskuline or feminine or just non-binary if their more fem and their ok with it then girlfriend if maskuline the boyfriend lover partner and enbyfriend are all good but try asking your kid what they would prefer it helps to know that you’re involved and care about them being non-binary the best thing you can do is ask and be there for them
Sorry but ur so wholesome and nice, kinda rare to come across these types of dads nowadays
i mean it’s up to the kid, most people like to be called partner or “significant other,” which abbreviates to s/o. also it’s so sick that you fully support your kid, and i give you mad props for that.
""Joyfriend"" is a good one! And good on you for supporting your kid!
I’ve heard some people say theyfriend but it’s very specific to the individual so it’s totally okay to ask your kid what they prefer to call themselves in this context.
I guess 'bae' was shorter-lived than I realized lol
my partner is afab nb and likes boyfie - it's like boyfriend x fairy. it doesn't make sense to anyone but it makes sense to us and they love it when i call them that so that's we're going with :)
However, I LOVE joyfriend for the Youngers.  I actually love it for everyone except me, because me finding it infantilizing has more to do with me and my issues and trauma.
Some terms might feel infantilizing if used for an adult, but it is specifically kids being talked about in this case, so those sorts of terms are probably appropriate here
I really like Sweetheart, it works for nonbinary and binary people
Beau does work for non-male people in the us? In French it could never
Sweetheart is a great one wow
I like this idea
Cupcake, pumpion (not a typo), and obviously ""punk-ass""
Aww I was going to say “partner” because I feel that nicely meets all levels of pairing up with other people, but enbyfriend is absolutely adorable.
joyfriend absolutely sounds like the person you do hand stuff with behind the gym
I like this one, that's my vote. Reminds me of Letterkenny
Sweetie/sweetheart is really cute imo!
Sweetie gets my vote! No set level of seriousness (or lack of seriousness!) baked in, already in frequent casual use among multiple age groups and generations, not weird to use for under-18s, and works for ambiguous or less normative relationship setups, too.
Oo I like nonny -- I've been trying to go by auntcle but it's kinda awkward
I love the concept of 'nonny' but as Italian it's highly confusing to me (with a different spelling, nonni, it means grandparents) xD
My last partner and I are both NB and we used theyfriend to describe ourselves
That makes it sound like we are a council deliberating on the new third gender terms. We're not. Everyone can decide their own terms
Boofriend
But beau is beauty for male people :( French is a terrible gendered language
I feel like partner doesn't really have that bad of a connotation, especially when viewing relationships as a partnership. You are working with someone to build a happy and healthy relationship, you're becoming a team and I think that's a great way to frame it for people just beginning to learn about these sort of relationships.
Damn, hope your dad comes around someday
Unless one is agender use voidfriend with caution 🙂
as a voidpunk enjoyer i love voidfriend
Wait. I think I’ve severely misunderstood joyfriend. I thought it was much more adult than it apparently is. 😅
Haha, I started going by partner when I turned 15, now I use partner, boyfriend and butch [butch is used in lesbian spaces. If someone says “That person over there is my butch” it means they’re talking about a butch who is their partner.]

I don’t think I have anything against it but at the same time I wouldn’t like to be called a joyfriend, and neither would I back then. It makes me feel… less butch?
I’ve literally never heard a cis-man use it. English has no rules, merely suggestions.
In anglophone Canada, ""beau"" is used for men, but it's old-timey. If we brought it back into use, I think we could make it for everyone. The people I know who used ""beau"" seriously are in their 80s now, so us younger folk could redefine it pretty easily.

I obviously do not speak for francophone Canada at all.
Beau is definitely more masc-oriented in English too, but could work for some non-binary people. I was possibly getting carried away because I think it’s an awesome word

Similarly I have never heard suitor or admirer for non-men, but they’re not explicitly gendered so it doesn’t mean other people couldn’t use them
Hey it’s better than cumrade. Though honestly I would use it if it wouldn’t make people uncomfortable. It’s to funny
I get that, & Nonny is just one I use because of the old English  ""Hey nonny nonny"" in some songs. I also use Auncle (Awn Kill) or Funcle (fake uncle).
By 'we', I meant society as a whole.
Talk it over with kiddo and see what their age group is saying lingo-wise. About 5-7 years ago in my area boo was used for girlfriends and boyfriends pretty interchangeably, I was a tutor at an urban high school at the time. Language changes so fast tho
and loan words change meaning over time. Once a word has been adopted by another language/culture it will develop independently from it's original language/culture.   


That being said, from what I can tell, beau is still used mostly for a male person in English as well, so it might work for a masc-leaning enby, I guess?
I would tend to agree, however to many people the term ""partner"" in this context can have sexual overtones and being as they are children those adults who feel that way may be uncomfortable using the word.
to me it reads very adult relationship, but not sexual, more like, ""We're in this as a team and we pay bills together"" sort of partnership, whereas middle school relationships don't seem, to me, to have that level of dedication or selflessness involved.
May I ask why??
Sadly, me too.
You can bring joy to another person in many ways! It's adult for adults, and not sexual for non-adults. It can be both :D
To be fair, I am asexual, so I might be the one misinterpreting.
I may have Cyber’d a bit too punk for joyfriend. All I think of is the word ‘joytoy’.
My grandmama and her wife were like that, only they were each other's ""bull"". ..... Ten guesses what THAT was short for, LOL.
I See. It means beautiful for men (French is heavily gendered) and I have never heard it used for anyone who isn’t a man. Like a women would use it to refer to her hubby but never a man to refer to his wife
If we're ever lovers, PLEASE call me your cumrade. I insist.
Oh
Absolutely!!!
Feels a bit splaining the first part and I just wanted to say maybe my text was read as if I wasn’t aware of what you typed (I was) or as if I was splaining, too (I was not)
Because my gender isn't void/nothing, it just doesn't fit in the binary.
Yay!
Ha! Maybe. :) 

I definitely am not ace.
Aww, I absolutely adore that. I’d be honoured to be called a bull one day. Us younger dykes really look up to our elders.
Unrelated question, totally ok if you can’t answer it! I’m a beginner at French and I’ve been wondering. How do you make French gender inclusive? In German i use she pronouns but masculine nouns for myself and it’s honestly not that great.
If I were doing that I would go old-school and say 'bel' instead, just to be confusing/contrary.
Ohh! I didn't realise people thought of agender being having absolutely no gender
There's iel instead of il/elle but it's a crapshoot on whether or not people reading it will know what you mean
I'm agender and I don't feel like I have any gender at all. Just a miscellaneous human lol
Sounds like the situation isn’t great for you, I’m sorry to hear that :(
Ok!!
Lots of people nowadays are more open to iel, so it’s slowly improving. At least in my social circle!"	10enjc9	NonBinary	675	1.0	2023-01-17 21:06:22
Lately I've been feeling a lot of pressure since my androgyny has been at an all time high. Existing in a binary world, I'm often called he/she and it sucks. Excuse my mess, I was feeling myself today and needed further validation. (Pronouns they/them, accepts gender neutral and masc descriptions)		"i'm sorry to to hear that. i hope you can find a space that treats you as the handsome nb you are without feeling the need to gender you. stay strong!!

You look fuckin rad, badass and also cute as hell! You shall cleft those who oppose you in twain from nave to chop with your stare alone. You shall halt tides and subdue the hottest flames at your command alone. Hope you feel better and have a great week <3
you're good fam. you're really hot and it'll be okay!!!
holy shit you are super, super hot
Dude you look fab! Digging those chunky ass boots.

The binary world sucks. I'm AFAB and currently identifying as agender, and because of my very 'feminine' body I'll probably always get read as female regardless of what I wear or how I style myself. I don't have body disphoria, because my body is mine and I'm not female so how can it be? But it means I've not come out because while my family are super loving and supportive, I don't want to change their opinion of me. I'm just me. I'm not a boy or a girl, I'm just me. I can be just me with female pronouns, they're just not entirely accurate - at least not when you exclusively use female pronouns. But I worry if I come out as non binary they'll see me differently, and I'll end up further away from who I am.

Sorry, bit of a brain dump there! Tl:dr I wish gender neutral terms were the default. Hopefully one day.

You look really good like really good
I love your boots!!!
So fine ♡
😍 lord help me
you look like you have great vibes. please don't let the haters bring you down- remember you're too awesome to even think about them ;)
You got this!😁
Sometimes in life you just have to bite your tongue and realize that there will be those who disagree with who you are as a person.. that doesn't make you any less you. No matter how many people purposely misgender you, you will always be you! As long as you know in your heart who you are, those who love and accept you will be there for you - and I think I speak for everyone in this community when I say that we're all here for you; we all know what the battle is to be anything other than cis male/female in this world, whether nonbinary or an ally, we all see the hate people have for certain genders, despite us all being human. We all stand with you and support who you are.. forget about what the others say, know in your heart who you are :)
You look awesome 👌
Looking good! Keep your chin up buddy! Remind yourself you're not what people say you are and only you can decide that.
You look amazing, hope things get better for you soon
Thank you! It might take a minute but I hope I'll find it soon!
Thank you! I'll do my best c:
Thank you so much!!! (Like really you described me as some sort of hero to my own epic tale! Thank you!!!)
Thank you!
Thank you 😁
seconded. damn, boi, yr fine af
You're all good! Thank you for the kind words and sharing. I hope you can navigate the binary world with better luck than my own! ❤
Thank you!
Thank you!
Thank you ♡
Lol thank you 😊
Thank you! It gets hard at times since I've internalized a lot in the past year especially since I'm not in queer bubbles a lot of the time. Thank you for the encouragement c:

Not Looking “Non-Binary Enough”	"So I’m AFAB. I “look” very AFAB. I feel like other trans and nonbinary people shun me over this quite a lot, because even nonbinary folks seem to secretly feel I owe them androgyny the way cis folks do. 

People tell me I’m just “changing my pronouns for attention”. But the same people treated me better when I was thinner/had a more androgynous body shape, was able to wear a binder and had my hair cut short. 

I have a really large chest and due to medical issues, I can’t wear a binder anymore whilst I try and save for full top surgery. People are always surprised when I say I want top surgery, like they treat me as some kind of cosplayer and are surprised I’m “committing to the bit”. I dress more feminine these days because the way my bust sits in clothes with more masc or unisex cuts makes me feel even more dysphoric and full of loathing toward my body, but dressing like this means people just write me off as a girl. I’m also a goth so I wear a lot of eyeliner n stuff, and that just seems to make it worse.

IDK, sorry for the rant. I just feel like absolute dogshit and I’m tired of getting downvoted and accused of being “a transtrender” whenever I post a selfie."	"Listen. A cis person can look as masculine, femine or androgynous as they want and still be cisgender, no questions asked. Your presentation is not your identity.
I’m amab non-binary and haven’t changed shit about my appearance since I “came out.” 
I wear the same clothes every day because they are comfortable and functional clothes. 
My body looks the same because I am not currently interested in modifying it. 
If anyone has a problem with it they can F off, whether they’re bigots or other enbys. 
The whole point of being “non binary” is you aren’t a part of the system. If non-binary becomes a gender of its own it will just be a Trinary. 
Fuck the binary, fuck the trinary.
Hey, I look masc and I’m a nonbinary with they/them pronouns. Nonbinary is supposed to be breaking the rules you don’t have to listen to them you don’t owe them anything
Yuck I'm sorry. I also look very feminine. Largely it doesn't bother me, but people's perception of me does. I also use she/her pronouns which seems to confuse people further. I've had other queer people aggressively use they/them pronouns for me. It's extremely annoying. But bottom line, you are valid, you are who you say you are. Anyone trying to tell you otherwise can Fuck off.
Like others have said, you don't owe anyone anything

I'm a bearded enby, so am seen as male, but I don't care because I know who I am

Be your fabulous, authentic self and sod anyone who tries to put you in a box!
I look like people expect someone of my agab. I know several other enbies who also look like people expect for their agab, including one who was recently elected to public office.

I can assure you that there are many enbies who look like people expect for their agab. Because we are less visible, this can lead to the over-representation of androgynous enbies in the minds of the general public and even other enbies, but this image of nonbinary people is inaccurate. We are not all androgynous.
I have a beard, I'm 340 pounds. I'm 6'1"" and lift up heavy things for fun. I'm nonbinary trans. I fight the idea of masculinity constantly and just want to be whatever I want to be when I want to be. You do whatever the fuck you want. And if your friends don't accept it, they aren't your friends. Threes always new friends to be made. You keep it nailed down for you.
People don't see me the way I see myself and it's just because of the body and face that I have, and it sucks. If I looked more masculine or androgynous in my appearance, people would see my fashion style as androgynous. But since I have curves and a soft face, I'm apparently femme presenting even when I wear men's jeans and a T shirt. 

I don't think most people take me seriously as a Nonbinary person. And maybe it's that they don't take Nonbinary people seriously in general. But I've been passively excluded from conversations about gender and transness when other Nonbinary people have been included, even though I'm very passionate and vocal about the topic. And I can't help but think it's because I don't look the part. Even though I have short hair and wear men's clothes half the time. I can't exactly do more without taking hormones
Howdy, I'm an elder they (as they call me at work) at 35. While I'm slender, I'm also AFAB and fem as hell looking because I too am goth and the eye makeup is always intense, so am usually called by she/her pronouns by strangers. 

Other folks have already covered all the bases, so I'm going to jump right to the comment about saving for top surgery. While this is awesome, I would absolutely encourage you to at least explore the possibility your surgery may be able to be covered by state or private insurance (I haven't a clue where you are, or if any sort of insurance is available to you.) I only bring this up because I saved the money, and literally two months before surgery, discovered my insurance would cover it with a letter from a therapist. 

I don't want this to sound like I'm pressuring you into surgery, but I'm fem presenting, never used T, never will, and top surgery was still available to me.

I also want to throw in at the end here that people don't get to tell you your gender. Your gender is for you. Be you.
Gender identity is about how **you** percieve **yourself**.

&#x200B;

What anyone else thinks about it literally does not matter.  Nobody else gets a say on that one.  That's yours and yours alone.
It’s very difficult being nonbinary in a world where people utterly refuse to understand it. You’re not alone- you’re nonbinary whether anyone else understands that or not.
Gender identity is different from gender expression I had a hard time coming to terms with it and had imposter syndrome for the longest time bc I’m afab and love everything a stereotypical woman likes my favorite color is even pink but ik that if I was Amab I would like the same exact things I’m enby and I’m me I just happen to like pink
I feel this post so hard. I also can’t bind anymore because it was causing back problems. And I go back and forth between presenting as more fem and presenting more androgynous, but seem to look stereotypically feminine no matter what I do. 

I always remind myself that men can wear dresses and are still men (if that’s how they identify). Women can be masculine and still be women. So we can present as more fem and are still non-binary. I’m non-binary because I feel it in my gut that that’s who I am. But its still so hard to not internalize the way other people see/interpret my identity 

Just sending you empathy and solidarity ❤️
A lot of people are saying really good points, so I just wanna say that this

> the way my bust sits in clothes with more masc or unisex cuts makes me feel even more dysphoric and full of loathing toward my body

is something I 100% relate to and don't see people talking about it a lot. At least fem clothing fits my body, not like the way I dress affects my passing anyway.
I'm in the same boat as you. You can be 100% feminine and use she/her pronouns and still be nonbinary and vice versa. Other trans people shouldn't be putting you down cause of your presentation. Gender roles and gender essentialism are things that unfortunately a lot of trans people uphold. It doesn't matter what others think, you know you best and if others don't respect you then it's best to ignore them and let them go.
Already been said by others but cannot be said enough: Only you get to define who you are - everyone else should focus on living their truth, not trying to enforce one on you.

Furthermore, any friend or associate who cannot manage that simple thing would soon find themselves outside my social circle.

To be fair, my social circle is quite small and I am okay with that - not everyone would be - but do take a stand as and if you can.
You don’t have to justify the way you dress, you’re allowed to just exist and do your thing and still be valid.
I am similarly built to you and when people bring it up I say, ""Have you seen well tailored men's shirt for F cups?"" which is the fast way to get people to  shut up.  

OR I go on my rant about how gendering and titles are active levels oppression people can change if they today with less effort than most, where in either they have to sit there and listen to me go on for 10 minutes or start to agree with me.

Mostly no one, NOT NO ONE after 16 years of being forced to wear a dress on Sundays gets to tell me what to wear.
People are arseholes, trans or not. Get them out of your life! There are plenty of people out there who will see you for who you are. I’m sorry you’re experiencing this and I know it always hurts more when it comes from your own community. Lots of love x
It seems to be an unfortunately common thing for people to demand enbys to look androgynous. Yet when cis people dress gender non conforming it‘s apparently okay 🤷‍♂️

I am agender. I don‘t look androgynous, most people call me he/him. I just don‘t care tbh. I know who I am and I dress and act the way I do. No one can tell me who I am and how I have to identify, how I have to act or dress. 

I am also autistic, so I have 25+ years worth of experiencing people trying to tell me how to live my life. But I only started to feel good about myself when I learned how to not give a shit about that and do what I feel comfortable with
Sometimes it feels likes we have to conform to some stereotype or what you ""expect"" for nonbinary/gender non-conforming. but the whole thing of gender non-conforming, non binary, or even gender-conforming is that your identity and expression don't have to match what others think it would be. 

&#x200B;

I had to explain that to 2 ppl (who are in the LGBTQIA+ community) that just cus someone has feminine clothes, a bust, and has she/they or whatever pronouns doesn't mean they are supposed to look androgynous. Just cus you think someone looks like (as they said, word by word) a ""straight cis girl"" doesn't mean that they have to be. there are also cis people or general binary trans ppl who use pronouns or dress the opposite of how you'd expect with their transition/lack of transition. 

 I myself love feminine-presenting stuff but until top surgery I am holding off on buying that stuff as its easier to dress down and bind(or excessively oversized plain clothes and hoodies in warm weather). 

It sucks you can't bind, I hope your top surgery money comes quickly ❤️
I've been having a similar experience. I keep having to remind myself that we do NOT owe the world androgyny, we are who we are, and anyone who says otherwise is just as bigoted and closed-minded as the rest of them 🙄
I'm sorry you are getting that. It's funny because that's the way people act on social media, but when I reached out to local nonbinary people - they all look completely different. Most havent transitioned physically in any way. The NonBinary Look (tm) is actually such a minority of what nonbinary people look like.
same boat, i use they/them exclusively even at my job, but i sit here and have all the same concerns as you. for me i almost feel bad when i dress more femme or put on makeup (i love some black eyeliner), like i must remain neutral or more masculine looking at all times. you're not alone in this, and it's societies binaries that are the problem, a lot of those binaries are nearly subconsciously ingrained cis and trans alike.
Transtrendster is a gross gatekeeper idea. I don’t  think the opinions of people who try to control you this way are worth any of your time and you do you unapologetically <3 because we got your back and support you here.
Im AMAB and I dress masc, mostly because the default useful clothes are all masc. I guess wearing jeans and a tshirt is masc.

Gender doesn't own you, it certainly doesn't own what you wear, how you act, what your body is like, or who you are. Being non-binary id about being authentically you without worry about what gender is.

Youre always valid no matter what!
reading this was like looking in a mirror lol i also haven’t been able to wear a binder anymore and i’ve chosen to grow my hair long  again, and i really feel like people completely disregard my identity because of it. i’ve been trying to lower my voice as a way to compensate, but it’s frustrating having to resort to forcing change to try and be seen as how i want. 
i try and channel this frustration into the fuel to keep going in spite of them, being able to rant about it certainly helps with that!
I’m AFAB and super femme and that’s just how I feel happy dressing! I’m still enby. If other people can’t respect you, it says a lot more about them than you.
fuck all that noise. If you say you are non binary you are non binary. I totally get where you are coming from, I am AMAB, and will NEVER fit the aesthetic that is often presented as the 'way NB people look' (Skinny, androgynous, long and tall). I am a large, muscle, bearded, heavily tattood person. I wear skirts and leggings when i want to, but often dress in a way that aligns with my agab. My therapist really helped me with this one, because the whole point of being nonbinary (agender for me) is that i dont fit in the typical categories. I felt like i had to dress a certain way, and they were able to help me understand that the way i Dress and look does not determine my gender. People that dont get that, can get bent. sorry that you are having that experience. I am almost always misgendered as male, which sucks, but as it has been said before, being trans is the lest interesting part of me, so i let it roll (have not dealt with malicious misgendering yet, ive only started coming out to people in the last few months)
Yep, this is a tough feel :/ sorry you're having these tough thoughts. 
I'm amab nb, and I'm conventionally masc looking in body shape - very tall, broad shoulders, muscular - veryyy difficult to 'look androgynous', even though that's mostly what I want. I like wearing really comfortable and functional clothing and surprise surprise there aren't many cute outfits that fit my shape anyway so the choices are limited. If I was afab and wearing the same clothes I'd very likely be viewed as way more androgynous... i don't like wearing makeup and would hate to wear it just so that more people realised I'm not a man. But yeah also sucks to have everyone treat me like 'one of the boys' 

In short - relatable, sucks that you're feeling this, but you are valid!
You don't have to look any way to be nonbinary and the people that are telling you that you do are ignorant and cruel, denying your identity like that... smh
Look extremely masc over here. Beard and all. Still identify with they/them pronouns and as trans though. I’d like too surgery as well, just don’t have the money. But I struggle with the same thing. The only feminine part about me is my voice and people just see that as me trying to be gay. Very little affirmation of my identity. I’ve almost given up completely on people using my preferred pronouns. (It/Its/They/Them)
Hey friend as someone who is AFAB as well I can really relate to what you are feeling. To this day I struggle with the fact that I love to wear dresses but then feel like a fraud when it comes to being non-binary. But that is just the thing non-binary just means you don't fall into one of the two ""norms."" 

On a side note, I have found one way to cope with some dysphoria is planning outfits that make me think ""Yah someone would definitely get pulled into another dimension to go on a magical adventure in this outfit."" It is not foolproof but boy it does help to plan my clothes into adventuring outfits versus thinking about if it makes me look too feminine.
I don't think it matters what you look like as long as your comfortable with it people should accept that. Also I went onto your profile to see what you look like and I think your really pretty/handsome, you look plenty non-binary to me :)
i’m sorry that’s happening to you. 💔 people really fucking suck sometimes. nonbinary bodies include every body, and nonbinary presentations include every presentation.

i’ve been asked to leave queer spaces due to looking like a matronly cishet woman instead of skinny and sexless and androgynous, like i’m “supposed” to be. my body has put me on the receiving end of transphobia from both cis people, and “better” trans people.

it’s absolutely disgusting that people in our community do this to us. bodies are meant to look different, and androgyny should be up to people that vibe with the word; if you identify with the word androgynous, then you are, without a binder, with curves, with ANYTHING.

fuck the haters so fucking hard. our bodies are nonbinary. you’re not an imposter. 💜
Androgyny is overrated and way too highly valued--you're you and that's all that matters :)
You are completely valid
i feel the exact same way. especially with summer coming along it’s so much easier and more comfortable to wear more feminine clothes. just means people still think i’m a girl. i wish it was easier
Gender identity and gender expression/presentation are two different things. You can dress and present HOWEVER you want, that doesn’t change the fact that you’re non-binary. I’m sorry you aren’t being taken seriously friend.
i totally get this as its the same for me. I'm cis passing to the max despite my identity. most of what I do is I remember I'm not doing this for anyone but myself and I don't owe anyone anything ever. I owe myself a piece of mind and to take care is my body and mind in the ways I need it. 

like many say, you're presentation isn't your identity. for me tho I find it to be a slight good thing in public bc its less dangerous for me but that's not the same for everyone. it gets better I promise.
I have huge boobs it really crushes my nonbinary aesthetic. It’s really hard to get a reduction or deletion but I’m trying. Good luck!
It sounds like they all don’t understand that there isn’t one correct way to be non-binary. And you are valid
It's generally wise to not care too much about the opinion of stupid people. If you interact with them just gray rock them. If someone legit says ""you're doing it for attention"" literally just reply ""ok"" or something and move on. You do not owe people explaination of justification for your gender identity or expression.
Shame on those other non-binary people for shunning you based on your appearance - those people should know best how it feels to be judged solely on appearance especially considering being non-binary literally has no look, it is the absence of a binary. 

you know your identity and don’t let anyone tell you otherwise !
I get this to a tee
I find a lot of questions here asking if they fit into a certain ""category"". Isn't the whole point that most people here don't fit a general category? Just an observation.
my advice is get off all trans subs that aren’t this one. they’re all awful. trans people on reddit are like, even worse than cis people
I really relate to this. It's definitely helped me having trans friends who I can vent too and who validate me.
Honestly, it sounds like you’re deeeep in your own head. What you’re saying may be true, but almost all your examples are your interpretations of peoples’ thoughts based on how you feel around them. 
 
You don’t owe anyone anything. The end. The rest is brainshizz YOU have to work out on your own, to persist in society (which reciprocally owes you nothing, btw).
I’m in a similar boat myself as an AFAB NB. I don’t mind the feminine side of me but it feels like by not “looking” NB enough I get cis-clocked a lot.
confuse them by wearing both traditionally male and female stuff  


but in all seriousness, this happens to me, too. im afab and naturally have a large chest. im not out to my parents because they say im not old enough so im forced to wear more feminine clothing. it sucks, a lot.
Those people are assholes, you are non-binary enough no matter your presentation.
I feel this...
People suck like that. You’re rad as hell though
I don't get the gatekeeping of gender non-conforming. It can be as simple as not conforming to expected roles it doesn't mean you need a mullet and an androgynous aesthetic in order to be part of it. 

Dress however you want, use whatever pronouns you want. People will perceive what they want to perceive and that says more about them than it does about you.
i know how exhausting this is and am very sorry you’re experiencing something i am familiar with. 

what consoles me is that at the end of the day, im a dude on a floating space rock. in the whole context of the universe it doesn’t matter, but that’s cool, not something anxiety inducing
If anyone is gatekeeping you just being your authentic self and how you share yourself with this world and are asking to be seen in it then i can only ever imagine it coming from a place of insecurity of themselves that they have to work though.

You dont have to be the fruitiest pop tart in the box theres varieties and differences in all of us and in all of our definitions, if they dont like your flavor tell em they can stay in the box they put themselves. All due respect, lmao. 😌
Sorry you’re dealing with this treatment. It sucks that some people think this way, and you deserve better. 

I hope that hanging with people online and in positive queer spaces irl can help you be yourself and feel good, even if physical goals aren’t where you need them to be just yet
Honestly I think it's sexy and fun to accentuate the masculine and feminine together. It does sound like your boobies are popular, there's no rule against pushing them up with a little mascara on any peach fuzz you got as fake stubble, can stuff your crotch too. Idk how well this sits with dysphoric feelings but as a bearded queen I thoroughly encourage busty dudes! 😁
You are fine to present however works for you. I’m also afab, but I’ve transitioned to where people assume I’m male in public. I use he/they and I’m sure if I told people that, a decent chunk would assume I’m amab and haven’t done much to physically transition. 
Point being, regardless of transitioning, people always try to categorize you, and then people assume what they “see” is your agab. Non-binary people don’t owe anyone androgyny or any amount of transition. 
However you are able and/or comfortable presenting is valid. The people who say otherwise can suck it.
I can definitely relate to a lot of this this, especially being more bothered by how feminine my body looks in masculine clothing than just wearing feminine clothing. That's not something I've heard of other people experiencing too, so it's a bit nice to know I'm not alone. (But I try to not let that stop me from wearing masculine clothing anyway.)

I don't have bad experience with other non-binary people though, even though I have never regularly worn a binder and prefer to keep my hair long (sensory issues plus I just generally love long hair on everyone!). My only strong dysphoria is around my voice, and I have decided not to go on T for that. Most likely, nobody thinks I'm not a cis woman unless they know my name, and even then a lot of people probably don't realize until I tell them I'm enby.

But enby people have been nice to me. Maybe it's because I have never posted selfies of myself? But maybe it's also because people who call you a ""transtrender"" are not non-binary people. I've never encountered a non-binary person who used that word and meant it. Keep in mind that transmedicalists and other people with shitty opinions sometimes seek us out specifically to pick on us, and they target people who they personally consider not ""trans enough"".
Just know you aren't alone in this. I'm experiencing this same sort of crisis, and I actually tried to post this problem on this subreddit just days before today before getting shredded by nonbinary people here, actually. Just know you don't owe people an explanation, and only you truly know how you identify and feel and how you are comfortable and don't let anyone else tell you otherwise :)
I certainly get the frustration of how your body fits in things and no longer wearing a binder. (I stopped because it was making me extremely anxious.) But heck, if anyone has an issue with you presenting in any which way for whatever reason, that's a them problem. And if they use the term ""transtrender"" they aren't good people to start with. Only truscum and transmedicalists use that term.
Felt this. I’m afab and just don’t want to change the way I look, and my partner is nonbinary and has a beard. We’re about as straight/cis passing as it gets, and in public it can be a nightmare. A support system of other queer people whether it be online friends or irl can make a world of difference.
ask them to describe what nonbinary is, most of the time they cannot because there is no linear nonbinary look, it’ll shut them up and then you can say it looks like this and gesture to yourself

(edited for punctuation)
I’m AMAB and thanks to genetics I look very masc. When I started telling people I’m non-binary I got a lot of “you’re the last one I’d have thought was a them/they” and even a few saying “just decide, are you a man or woman?”

People with preconceptions are the problem, not you. You be who you are.
I’m sorry you’ve dealt with people like that. I say dress how you feel most comfortable and confident. There is no one non-binary look.
Wow, I’ve never thought about it that way before! That’s really beautiful - thanks!
not really true imo. With the rampant transphobia and hyper-focus on binary trans people nowadays, cis people get ""clocked"" as trans if they don't fit the gender stereotype. Especially cis women who look ""too masculine"". 

and a similar thing where some enbies who ""look"" their AGAB, incl myself, get ""clocked"" as cis. Or worse yet, get things like ""non-binary? What? You look so masculine though!"". Especially maddening when even people within the community expect androgyny, because non-binary by definition has no set ""look""

so no, I agree with OP. It's not so much that WE don't believe we're NB despite our presentation, it's that other people invalidate people like OP as if it's simply some quirky attention-grabbing thing
Same; for me it's more about how I feel than how I present, but even if I presented in any of the infinite combinations of ways one could, that wouldn't have a bearing on how I identify. It's the same thing people have to deal with when it comes to gender identity vs. pronouns.

Presentation =/= gender identity =/= chosen pronouns. Yes, for different people all of these things can interplay, but for some they don't, or maybe only a little! Ultimately what it comes down to is what feels comfortable & right to the person in question. It's bizarre how even very ""inclusive"" spaces or groups can still end up being weirdly exclusive about some things.
Based.
I got a notification about a very strange response that is now gone… not sure if it was accidentally replied to me or if they got banned 😂
Lmao I'm exactly the same with clothes, i was dressing kind of androgynous before so i just kept doing that
Are you me? This captures my feelings completely
haha cis people are straight up scared to use my it/its pronouns and other trans and nonbinary people get angry at me for them and say i’m making the movement look like it isn’t legitimate or like a joke :’) can’t win
Also those people are also discrediting the validity of femboys. You can express your gender how you want who gives one if that doesn't align right in their brains
My entire post is my frustration that people want me to fit a category when that is not relevant or possible within a nonbinary identity. I don’t want to look how people want me to to be respected. I want to be respected how I am.
That was not a statement to say that GNC people don't suffer transphobia and abuse when they're cis. Just that they don't stop being cis because of being GNC. It is about gender not equalling presentation, not about who gets oppressed for it.
That might happen but in general it still seems to be uncommon.
It's expensive to redo a whole wardrobe! I didn't come out until I was 31, so I had that long to collect clothing of my assigned gender, but only 2 years knowing who I was. Can't just trade in the clothes for more femme stuff lol
Sadly true. We really need to normalize It/it’s pronouns. Also “CIS people are STRAIGHT up scared” lol. Idk I find the wording funny. Lol
depending on where you live you may be able to find clothes swaps/community wardrobe type things for trans and nonbinary folks! they do exist!!"	12ivwjf	NonBinary	668	0.99	2023-04-11 20:08:58
Heading to new job where I (they/them) can communicate my pronouns and everyone puts their pronouns in their emails. Admin also is replacing my name tags and emails with my new name and I feel seen.		"That's amazing! I hope you really enjoy your new job because it sounds so nice to work in such an accepting environment! I wish I could have the same ❤️
So excited for you! Our workplace just started giving out pronoun pins. I put my pronouns in my email signature and now others at my office have started doing it too !
That's wonderful news.
This is awesome. Congrats a
Awesome congratulations
Good luck, you're gonna do great!
Wow so so so happy for you!
I'm beyond excited for you!!!
That is awesome!!! Such a good feeling!! I just started at a new job, and on Friday I have to present to everyone a little bit about me, so I’m going to include my pronouns and then send an email explaining more about what pronouns are to everyone. I am afab but identify as nonbinary and everyone has used she her so far, so I’m nervous how they will respond :////// but wish me luck! And the best of luck to you as well!
Congratulations! Also, I love your hair!
Incredible
I wish you all the love! It’s wonderful you’re putting in the effort to educate. Remember your capacities and take care of yourself!"	cticdr	NonBinary	660	1.0	2019-08-21 15:23:35
Just smth we both find funny (sib-any pronouns, me-it/they/he)		"Dude your sibling stole your gender lmao
Perfectly balanced. As all things should be
I’m aroallo (aromantic pansexual) and my sister is demisexual biromantic and a hopeless romantic. We often joke that we’re polar opposites, she can’t imagine having sex with someone she doesn’t have a deep emotional bond and romantic relationship with, I can’t imagine wanting to form a deep emotional romantic relationship with someone unless I know that sex is a part of it. She can’t imagine how “sad” my life must be without romance and I can’t imagine how exhausting and generally fucked it must be to feel THAT many emotions over *everything* (I also have ptsd so that definitely plays a role)

We respect each other and enjoy spending time together but our relationship experiences are so different it’s funny. She’ll gush for hours over hearing about a gesture my partner made and I’ll just be there like “yeah. He says stuff like that. Look, can I go now? I have shit to do.”
my twin is genderfluid pansexual and im agender demi lesbian so.. not exactly opposites but close enough lol
Same!!

My sibling is pangender asexual, and I'm agender pansexual.
I’m getting “all or nothing” flashbacks rn lmao
Hehe me and my big sib are both enby but I'm like hypersexual and they are asexual and a romantic, they are so cool and helped me sm through out my life ✨☀
youre literally ""no"" and theyre ""yes""
you: no. your sibling: yes.
I’m the same as your sibling.
I'm just picturing you two in a family photo as a human-shaped void and some high-powered rainbow.
The sibling that gets everything vs the hand me down sibling
Non of it and all of it
Stole his gender and its sexuality lol

all AND nothing

Came out to my parents tonight. Mom is supportive, but a little confused about pronouns		"The little sheep are adorable! Go mom!
my nana (mom’s mom) has started referring to me as “you all” and “everyone” 

i’ve never corrected her, i think it’s adorable and i’m lowkey waiting for the day when she calls me her “grandchildren”
My mom did the same thing when I came out to her and used ""they"" in place of ""you"".
This is so fucking cute I can’t 😭❤️ Wish my mom would react this way
I just love how she ends the messege with 'mom'
Holy wholesome batman
your mom seems so sweet.. the ""proud of them"" made me laugh a little. happy for you op!!

That's adorable, I think I'd imagine her speaking to me as a temporal collection of trillions of cells, neat.
Lol glad she was supportive too
I’m so thankful that my parents have always been super supportive of me. Sorry to hear about your mom, you can share some of the love from my mom though ❤️

a top tip: if you're dying to try out a style or colour or heck even a pronoun or name or label then just do it, y'know? you don't need to justify it to anyone. have a go on yer own in a place you feel safe - you'll know if you wanna share it with other people.

My 10 year old is nonbinary	"They told me their pronouns are they/her. I am doing my best to support them and have always considered myself a strong ally. I am trying hard to not make this about me, but I am struggling to understand and I think their dad is struggling even worse. We need help! So if you have the time to read my long post I would love your take on my situation and any advice. Even if you must drag me through the mud in the comments, I probably have it coming...

My poor kid started their period at age 9 and already  has b cup sized breasts. So before she even thought about gender or sex, her body breached the topic for us. We live in a very conservative state and since we don't match the status quo religion around here, I moved my kid to a very progressive school the same year she turned 10. The school is absolutely amazing, it is a safe place that she has thrived at. It has a unique culture- there are more LGBTQ students than cis-gendered, which is so awesome but I also worry the school may glamorize being LGBTQ just because it is such an awesome place where queer people happen to flock to. 

During back to school shopping they told me they want binders. I am so happy that they are feeling comfortable enough to tell me these things. She doesn't tell her dad or any other adult and hasn't come out to anyone but us yet. BUT I am pretty much against the binders. I told them we can get just sports bras but changing your body is a big step and I think we need to do some more research first. I told her that among this research, I think she should talk to her pediatrician about it (who I mostly trust to be accepting).

My other big problem right now is that their dad insists this is ""just a phase"". He would never say that to their face and is as cautious about pronouns as I am. But how do I get him to realise and accept that this may not be a phase? That our baby girl is a baby them and that is totally ok and changes nothing with our relationship? Of course, it could just be a phase, they are only 10 YEARS OLD! 🙃

My therapist told me that non binary is the most difficult for people to accept because humans like to categorize and place others in nice little boxes where they think they should go, non binary is two or more boxes or sometimes no boxes and the human brain struggles with that. I find myself struggling and I need to get out of the struggle to help my kid and do the right things for them. How can I do better?

Edit: I am blown away with the responses and in tears. Thank you all for your kindness and wisdom."	"> BUT I am pretty much against the binders. I told them we can get just sports bras but changing your body is a big step and I think we need to do some more research first. I told her that among this research, I think she should talk to her pediatrician about it (who I mostly trust to be accepting).

Binders are safe and non-permanent. It is not a ""big step."" It's literally the smallest step one can take to see if having a flatter chest feels better. It's not medication or surgery. It's a piece of cloth. You take it off when you're done with it.

> My other big problem right now is that their dad insists this is ""just a phase"".

The problem here isn't that it's a phase. Everything in life is phases. You had a phase when you were single, a phase when you were childless, a phase when you were a child yourself. Those phases have ended, and new ones begun. You being a child in the past is what allowed you to be an adult today. Phases are a normal natural part of all life on Earth.

The issue is that this is used as an excuse to dismiss someone's needs. It's just a phase *so I'm not going to practice your pronouns.* It's just a phase *so I'm not buying you affirming clothes.* It's just a phase *so I'm going to ignore what you're telling me when doing so is convenient for me.*

It doesn't matter if it's a phase or not. Your kid is having this experience *now*. Regardless of how long it lasts, til death or til tomorrow, is irrelevant. Let's say your kid decides next year that they're cis. What will they have learned from their parents? From you, they'll have learned that you stand by them no matter what, that it's okay to experiment and explore the variety and complexity that life consists of, that it's okay to be themself and that being their authentic self isn't a burden or curse. From their dad, it sounds like they'll learn that they're an inconvenience, a nuisance, someone that can be dismissed because they're ""too young"" or whatever. One of these is good for your kid, and one of them isn't.

I appreciate you standing up for your kid and trying to learn how to be a good parent to them. I wish more parents approached this with the same zeal for their kid's well-being that you clearly do. Thank you for that.

We do get asked parenting questions here pretty often, so our search function may be able to give you some insights. [Here](https://www.reddit.com/r/NonBinary/comments/nq7d9n/im_writing_a_sort_of_guide_to_parents_of_trans/) is a thread we had a while back that I bookmarked as a good general primer for parents, including my comment there.

And [here](https://queerwoodworker.com/2022/04/just-a-phase/) is a blog post about the phrase ""just a phase"" that's a little more in depth than what I wrote above.

We're always happy to answer questions. :)
hi! first just want to say you seem like a great parent :)

a lot of folks think the big numbers of queer youngsters are because it’s “cool” to be lgbtq+ but it’s really just environments allow more people to explore their queerness from an earlier age, I say this as a femme non-binary 90s kid, who from a young age knew I was queer, tried coming out at 12, again at 15, and closeted myself until my late 20s when I was more secure, had less to lose

also being queer is amazing when you *are* queer because it feels amazing to be loved and accepted for yourself

being straight/het is great when that’s who you are, it sucks when it’s forced on you! gender and sexuality is a spectrum. gender is a social construct. gender is also a lived experience. let your kid explore

your kiddo knows something about themself, and that will change over time like all kids. a binder is not a permanent choice but they can be uncomfortable and you should check about the right fit. get some sports bras as well, let your kid decide what feels right on a day to day basis

ask your husband to do some research to broaden his understanding of gender. ask him to trust that he is out of his depth at this point, and that’s okay! like anything, when you are a beginner, start some research. listen to podcasts (anything featuring Alok), check out the videos of non-binary Jeffrey Marsh, maybe watch tv with non-binary characters living life (Feel Good on netflix is maybe a start)
Binders are like push up bras. They don’t change their bodies. 

Also, there’s no such thing as “glamorizing” LGBTQ. Our world celebrates and assumes cis/heterosexuality. A space where LGBTQIA kids can be themselves authentically and be proud of it doesn’t mean it’s “glamorizing”. Stop with this homophobic idea that queer kids must be embarrassed about who they are or uncomfortable or not talk about it.
I do want to comment that binders, when sized properly and used as directed, are safe. The issue would be if your child started binding with ace bandages or wearing so many sports bras that they constrict their breathing. Binding has honestly changed my relationship to my body. I still wish I didn’t have breasts, but I can free myself from a lot of that dysphoria for a bit if I bind. You’re doing a great job already by advocating for them, and using their pronouns. Just help them explore themselves and figure out what brings them joy.
hi, OP! my name is cosmo. i'm fifteen years old, assigned female at birth, and have been identifying as non-binary for about three years. first, i want to thank you for trying your best to respect your child and their identity, and for reaching out to our community to help support them better. i understand that you may not know everything about gender or what it means to be non-binary, but it's important that you take the time to research and educate yourself before you form opinions or make decisions for your child. this is a great place to start! there are a few misconceptions that i noticed in your post, so i wanted to address them.

1. you say that you worry your child's school may be glamorizing the LGBTQ+ community. so many people believe that the reason more and more people are coming out as LGBTQ+ is because the ""lifestyle"" has been ""glamorized"" or made to be seen as ""cool"" and ""different."" in reality, it's because being queer has become much more accepted over the years, and has gained a lot of REPRESENTATION through television, social media, the internet, etc etc. your child has been operating in a space where being queer is okay, or is even considered normal. they have probably LEARNED about different identities and labels that you have not, made friends her own age who are LGBTQ+, and found a way to acknowledge how and what they are feeling about their gender identity, which i think is GREAT! she is not being PUSHED to be non-binary, she is simply being taught what it means and that it is okay if she is.

2. binders are great, especially if they have a larger chest. chest binders do nothing to physically alter one's body; they are simply a piece of clothing that compresses against the chest area, which makes it appear flatter. they are incredibly safe as long as you are wearing them properly, and there are TONS of resources to help your child w/ wearing them. i have been wearing a binder from a company called gc2b for about a year, and it has helped tremendously w affirming my gender identity and making me feel more comfortable in my body. the only issues i've ever really had w binding were shortness of breath and a little bit of acne on my back. before i had a binder, i used to layer about three sports bras to try and compress my chest, and not only was it not nearly as effective, but it also hurt a lot more and was much harder to breathe in.

3. her dad thinks that it is ""just a phase."" i hear this one a lot from people, but honestly, who cares if it's a phase? if in a few years, your child comes to you and says, ""i think i was wrong about my gender identity. i am actually ____."" what does it really matter? they aren't legally changing their name, undergoing hormone replacement therapy, or making any irreversible changes to herself or her body, so there really is no consequence to letting them explore their gender. there really isn't! it's good that people have the liberty to question and learn more about themselves, their gender identity, and their gender EXPRESSION without feeling pressured to conform to their gender assigned at birth. 

OVERALL, i think you're doing a tremendous job parenting your child. i'm so glad they felt comfortable enough to talk to you about how she is feeling, because that can be very hard to open up about, especially to a parental figure. i want you to keep educating yourself and learning about gender identity and being non-binary. i also implore you to look into gender affirming care for your child and continue having conversations about what they would like to do (w/in reason) to make themselves more comfortable.

i'll leave a few links for you to look at, and you can also DM me for more information :)

https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/breast-binding
i want to add here, that binders are safe and nonpermanent and i recommend one for sure if they want one, but PLEASE make sure they fit correctly! do your research with them and get the one you think is best, but for such a young child, one from amazon or ebay can be dangerous and potentially harmful. only get ones from companies that deal specifically in binders, customized ones like shapeshifters inc or For Them are even better! it's better for them to get a real and safe binder from their parent than a dangerous one through other means if they feel desperate.
They’re likely not done developing physically. Would you consider puberty blocking medication for them? Even if this does turn out to be “just a phase”, puberty blockers would give them time to figure that out for sure before completing puberty. 

Binding done periodically is safe. Maybe not every day, maybe not 24/7, but sometimes. And puberty blockers would help prevent their breasts from growing more.
The top comment pretty much says it all but I just wanted to offer a little of my own experience on the trendy thing. When I was in high school I knew of ONE gay kid at my school of over 1500 students. At one point I really thought I was bisexual, and my (usually supportive) mom dismissed it as a phase. And at some point (after experimenting with kissing several boys) I realized that indeed I wasn't bi. I just wasn't into other boys. Huh. Go figure.

Around 32 years old, I realized I'm not a man. My mom is supportive of that thankfully, and transitioning, while difficult, has greatly improved my life and sense of self.

The thing is, when I was 14, no one *talked* about trans people. I can't help but think, maybe if I'd been given a little more room to explore my ""bi phase,"" I would have been able to figure out a little more about what my brain and body were trying to tell me but I didn't have the words for.

So, what was ""trendy"" in my case was being cis and straight, and that really affected my life in a negative way for a long time.

Sorry this was long, but I think what I'm trying to say is, whether they still id as nonbinary or not in 15 years, how the people around them react to this is going to shape a lot of their thoughts about how free they can be to express themself and explore their own identity. No matter your gender or sexuality, that's a really important thing when it comes to living your fullest life.
I just wanted to add that cisgender kids go on puberty blockers for many reasons, starting puberty too early is one reason. I think even going to the doctors out of concern that a 10 year old already has B-cup might be an easier way to get puberty blockers than requesting them because they are nonbinary.
Whether this is a phase or not, your child is going to remember. Whether this is a phase or not, your child is going to use this series of events to determine whether they come to you with things in the future. 

I told my parents I was non-binary at the age of 13, and they brushed me off. Told me it was a phase and refused to even consider helping me. 

I’m 24 now and still non-binary. I’ve been in the closet for 11 years because of my parents. And I’m going no-contact soon because of the way they treated me when I was younger. Because they made it clear they won’t accept me. 

Whatever you do, just remember that your child is a person. A person who will remember how this felt and will use it later in their life to determine how they want to go about their relationship with you.
If you deny your child a binder, you are forcing them to live with mentally damaging, prolonged states of dysphoria. Ask your therapist about what kind of damage that does. As an enby adult who had no support from my parents whatsoever in adolescence, nothing hurts more than knowing you need a thing and then knowing that you can't trust your parents enough to ask for and get it. Also, not getting your kid a binder may lead to them doing patently dangerous things like using duct tape or ace bandages (the most common harmful substitutes used).

Sometimes, it doesn't take a child long after they start school, even in a more conservative setting wherein self-expression and self-exploration are discouraged, to figure out just by being surrounded by their peers that they aren't quite the same. The locker room was a nightmare for me being forced to be around guys to whom I was attracted, my body giving me away about that, being insecure about my nakedness, having it made fun of because my body wasn't developing muscle like theirs in spite of me working just as hard... My parents thought just me being attracted to guys was a phase, so I never told them about my dysphoria. It took me until 5 years ago to make sense of and get support for my gender identity.

I saw that your husband thinks it's a phase. This phase hasn't ended for me yet. Even when our parents mean well, we can feel when we don't actually have their support. Anything that boils down to, ""It's a phase,"" is doubt, and even if your baby never says anything about it, they know. We hear our parents' whisperings beyond our closed bedroom doors regardless of how quiet they think they are. Hubby needs to get on board at least for your kid's sake.

*eta:* I said nothing about the fact that you get huge credit for being where you are and at least *listening* to your kid and *taking them seriously*. It's more than I ever hoped from my own parents in 1996.
This is going to be a long comment, I hope you don’t mind

Binders are completely safe if used and sized correctly and if you purchase from a specialized store, like gc2b (there are others but this is the one I use personally). They’re just a piece of clothing that flattens your chest, that’s all, you shouldn’t use them for more than 8 hours at a time and they must be sized correctly, if you do those things, nothing can happen and there’s no need to ask doctors (who are probably ignorant on this matter, at least most of them) unless your child has any specific conditions that would put them at risk. If your child is healthy, they’re good and they’ll be fine.

Don’t use the phase thing as an excuse to not give your child the affirming care that they need, even if it is, let it be, there’s nothing wrong with exploring your gender and your identity, if anything, it is one of the healthiest thing a person can do. Just listen to their needs, respect them and do what they ask you to do.

Aside from their chest, you haven’t mentioned about any other forms of body dysphoria, I guess it’s too late for puberty blockers because puberty has already happened but I might be wrong, maybe someone more qualified than me can give you a better explanation. Puberty blockers are basically used to delay trans children’s puberty until they have a better idea of what they’re going to do with their body. You can either start HRT after that, or you can just let your body go through puberty as it would’ve on its own, they’re completely reversible and do not cause any permanent changes to one’s body.

In conclusion, the most important thing you can do is to be 100% a safe space for your child, somebody they can blindly trust and feel good around. In order to do that you have to listen, always, aknowledge, respect their struggles and their needs and do everything that is in your power to fullfill them.  Don’t force anything that is uncomfortable for them, communicate kindly, patiently, politely and respectfully. If you don’t handle this correctly, you’ll lose your child’s trust and potentially cause them severe trauma.

Contact a gender therapist if you need (emphasis on YOU, if you’re the one struggling, or your child as well IF they’re struggling, but don’t force it if there’s no need as gender variance is not a mental illness) I say gender therapist because they’re the only ones who truly know what they’re doing when it comes to trans mental health, the others aren’t properly trained and have a higher chance of doing more damage than good.

Edit: when I said that it’s very important that binders are sized correctly, it also means that you have to regularly make sure you change the size and get bigger ones, just like for all the other clothes as your child grows, since they’re really young and their body is still developing, so remember to double chack their measurements every now and then
I'm sure it's probably in the comments somewhere, but you can get compression tops that are not as tight as a binder but will help with their dysphoria. 

 My sister is trans and in her thirties, and knew since she was single digits old. My niece is trans and knew since they were 4 or 5. My kid and I are both enby and feel like we've always known, even if we didn't have the word when we were younger, or for me as a kid in the 80's, any support. They can definitely know at their age.
My dad said it was just a phase when I was painting my nails and playing with barbies when I was in preschool. So naturally when I started dreaming about, and feeling weird when I was around certain people of the same sex, I didnt recognize it for what it was. 

If their school is giving them the tools that they need in order to recognize who they are, then I don't think it's all glam'd up as you say. As well, binders are a clothing item. They arent going to change their body for more than a few hours. You've already recognized a similarity in sports bras(not the same thing, but you're trying).

I think you're doing okay, and you're asking all the right questions... but I do think you need to be a little more open to the needs of your child. Even if it is just a phase, they're not asking for something that is going to cause changes, let alone irreversible ones.
>but I also worry the school may glamorize being LGBTQ just because it is such an awesome place where queer people happen to flock to

Even if that is what's happening here...

I grew up in a conservative bubble where being straight, Christian, and affluent were glamorized. But trying to live up to those ideals made me miserable.

*But* it took time, and trial & error to figure that out.

Teach your kid to be thoughtful, to value insight and reflection - how to empathize with others and they'll figure it all out when they need to.

.

All that said, I theorize that a *lot* more people are queer than are aware of it. It's only when we have the freedom and acceptance to explore do many of us discover it.
You sound like a very caring parent and your child is super lucky to have you on there side. But over thinking the hole non-binary thing is not going to help anyone because at the end of the day they are still your kid who you have loved for all these years and using a different pronoun isn't going to change anything. Just treat them the same way you always have.
So, um, here’s the best way that I can explain my personal experience of gender, and I cannot speak for any other nonbinary person, but it has been helpful for the people in my life.
For as long as I can remember, my life has been very structured around gender. I was raised in Texas in a Southern Baptist church to be a Souther Baptist minister. I’m 37 years old now and AMAB. When I am expected to perform a role based around my perceived gender, or listen to things that are labeled as gendered, I have always felt like I was a small child watching a play in an auditorium full of adults. All of the adults are laughing and clapping and crying alternately at the play but the play is in a language that I don’t speak. I ask the adults to interpret for me and they laugh because everyone should understand the story. But I never did.
For me, being nonbinary is about not having to speak that language any longer. Certainly, it’s made life difficult in many ways because I speak my “own” language, it that makes sense? There were many times when I was sure that it was a phase, but over the years the certainty that it wasn’t just became stronger. 
The worst that you can do by allowing your child to use a binder and using their preferred pronouns is show them that you are a parent that they can trust and who loves them enough to not only accept them but respect them. 
Even a ten year old knows their body well enough to know if it doesn’t “feel” quite right. Maybe they will change their mind and maybe they won’t, but if you are by their side, regardless, then they won’t be so scared.
Binders are safe as long as they fit properly and you avoid things like ace bandages. gc2b is a great brand to check out! There's also transtape.

It's great that you're being supportive! And to the dad, everything is in phases. Even if their identity changes, it's still best to support it. Gender and sexuality is fluid and can change, but that doesn't mean we invalidate people for it. Just support her.

This subreddit will always be available to answer questions too! I'm glad you're being supportive and trying to learn.
Even if it is a phase, so what? I’m a queer person in my twenties and I still question my gender and have tried using hey/him instead of they/them pronouns. It might be a phase but so is life. Your child might or might not change how they want to be addressed and feel but isn’t it worth displaying unconditional love regardless of their gender?
As a fellow parent who went through this with my child a few thoughts.  Your husband may be going through phases of grief because he’s losing his daughter. It took me a few months to realize that this happened to me.  He’s may be going through denial right now.  Grief, anger and acceptance might be coming too. 

When our kids are born we have all these fantasies about major events in their lives and our roles in them.  Finding out my child was non-binary trans demiboy meant a lot of those things were no longer in the horizon for me. Helping to buy a prom dress,  supporting them through a pregnancy etc…. But the reality is they are who they are.  Those things were never in the cards for my kid. My kid came out at 16. I really wish we would have known when they were younger.  

Many others have put it so well. Even if it is a phase they need your unconditional love.  One of the hard things about some people who are non binary is that what they feel can change.  Some times daily.  It’s so easy the think oh they’re changing their mind, it’s not real.  But it is real.  Cis gendered people don’t question their gender.  Even if it is a phase and they decide they are a female later, knowing that you believed them and supported them will be way more important than anything else. 

You’ve got this!  And buy the binder. It’s really no big deal.  And when you see someone one call them sir in public and they just light up, you’ll know it was worth it.
I hit puberty at the same age and my chest developed when I was 10. I remember throwing absolute FITS when I had to wear “normal bras” like “all girls do”. And the gendered clothes and short shorts and low cut tops all made it worse to the point where I just covered up my body to hide. I was told it was just a phase I would grow out of and once I was through puberty I would love my chest. Surprise, I’m now 25 years old and JUST figured out that I’m non-binary. The years of being told that I was in a “tomboy” phase halted my exploration of identity. Thankfully now I have freedom to chose what is right for my body and self expression.

My two parents can’t get their heads wrapped around this though. After 15 years they still think it’s a phase. Mine ended up being a core part of me, but even if it is a phase (because sometimes people try labels and they don’t work, which is fine) your child deserves respect and space to figure things out. No matter how much or how little they choose to explore this idea. I don’t know what you should tell their dad, but he’ll either need to get with it or deal with the fact that your kid will know not to turn to him when they are going through something.
You’re already doing a great job by being so open and listening to your kiddo, their expressions and needs. Researching binders is always a good idea, I don’t use one personally but there are many great companies out there. If I could, I would also recommend finding a good gender therapist in your area. They could help your entire family understand better what is happening, help your kiddo feel safe, and help your husband understand that this is more than likely not a phase. Children understand gender and gender expression, and know even at a young age when their gender does not match their biological sex. Just know that while it may be overwhelming now, it will get easier.
I will ad this here, as I’m not sure if it’s been said: 

Binders are generally safe, but when used incorrectly (IE too often, too long periods of time, too small, etc) it could end up bruising  your ribs and preventing top surgery in the future, if your kid so chooses to get it.

I recommend trans tape. The kind I get is on Amazon, but you can find them all over the internet. The most “injured” you can get from it is a couple scratches, but it’s more safe then a traditional binder.

You are a GREAT parent for trying to support your kid. The child may not realize it now, but having a supportive parent like yourself will benefit them so much and help their mental health. Even if they turn out to be cis, they will be thankful for the love and support they received. Not many people have that. 

If I was in your position though, I’d let them experiment. Do your own research on different ways to bind, and help them do the safest way possible for them. 

PS also tell the kiddo that a lot of NB people use two sports bras as a substitute as a binder as it’s safer generally
Everyone has already said most of what I would say as well. But I also just want to say how much I appreciate parents like yourself who want to do the best for their child and try to be supportive even if it’s personally difficult for them. It may be difficult for you but I can say without a doubt that the love and support of family makes a world of difference in the life of a queer person. I speak from personal experience as someone who did not have a supportive family growing up. So thank you for doing your best for your kid!
I know you're coming from a place of love and that you want the safety of your kid. Know that if they ask for a binder it is that they're feeling bad. If you don't provide a binder and help them research how to bind safely, they could use inappropriate stuff and risk damaging their health, and cause injuries.
I would say the safest bet is to research with them, find a good binder and just enforce rules you all agree on so that they are not wearing it to bed, to do sport or for too long.

Honestly, if it is a phase, they got a chance to explore and figure it out and that is great and super healthy for them. They are lucky to have so much support to explore themselves this young. And if it is not a phase, showing your full support is showing them they can always come to you with their concerns, that they can trust you. 
So, basically, supporting them and helping them is making you win as a parent whatever the situation is.
As others said, a binder is a temporary relief, it's not dangerous and it's not permanent so go for it using ground rules.
In regards to doctors, definitely look for doctors who have experience with trans patients, because most doctors outside of therapists, surgeons, and endocrinologists who work with trans people don’t know much about our healthcare needs. In regards to binders: they aren’t permanent, and if they fit correctly and aren’t worn for too long, they are a very safe option for an adult/older teenager. That being said, I’m not sure how safe they are for a 10 y/o whose bones are likely still changing. At the very least, I would make sure to check that the binder still fits properly on a regular basis. I definitely wouldn’t recommend wearing too-small sports bras instead of a binder, since sports bras aren’t designed to minimize the chest. I’ve definitely found that trying to bind with sports bras is more painful and unpredictable than using a binder. I’d probably recommend that they use trans tape - it doesn’t go all the way around the ribs, and its good option for someone who has a smaller chest. Also some people on here mentioned looking into puberty blockers - I’d agree with them. Puberty blockers won’t reverse or even stop your kiddo’s development, they will just slow things down and give them some time to think what kind of puberty will make them feel the most comfortable in their body. They may very well go off puberty blockers at 16 and just complete their natural estrogen puberty, but at least this will be a deliberate decision rather than something that nature forces them into. Puberty blockers are safe (as much as we can say any drug is safe), going off them is enough for puberty to pick up where it left off. They’ve been used for kids who start going through puberty way too early for quite a while, and as far as I’m aware, the only longterm side effect that we know of is that they might cause someone to end up being a bit shorter than they would have had they not taken puberty blockers.
>My therapist told me that non binary is the most difficult for people to accept because humans like to categorize and place others in nice little boxes where they think they should go, non binary is two or more boxes or sometimes no boxes and the human brain struggles with that.

Your therapist put it into words very well and I’m glad you have that support. Most of what I came here to say has already been said better, but I’ll just add that you’ve already taken some great steps and I’m sure your kiddo appreciates the love you’ve shown them already.
Y'all binders are safe for adults and older teens, but OP's child is 10. They have a TON of growing left to do, both soft tissue and skeletal. I remember rapidly changing clothing sizes when I was that age; so did my brother, so did my step kid, so does pretty much everybody. I think it would be incredibly difficult and cost-prohibitive to keep this kid in binders that are safely and correctly sized for their changing body, and I would be concerned about the effects that constant compression would have on a developing skeleton. I think talking to their pediatrician before binding is a good call, especially if they're in a trans-affirming area. It also wouldn't be a bad thing to talk about puberty blockers, since it seems like even without the gender issues, OP's child might be experiencing precocious puberty. A flat sports bra would be an excellent compromise while they're growing, though.
Looks like some great comments on here but just wanted to pop and and say my child she was assigned female at birth is 10 and non binary so if you ever need an ear feel free to
Message me :) . 

We found a trans youth group that was amazing it functioned over zoom and then in person as well and it allowed me to learn a lot. Like hormone blockers aren’t as scary has some have made them out to be and that gender can be fluid for some.
I don’t have experience with the specific body issues that your kid has to deal with, nor do I have experience with parenting, so please take that into account when assessing my advice. That your looking for ways to help and support them is awesome; at the end of the day having people around us that support and accept us is important (with us being “people” just as much as “LGBTQ+ people”).  


As far as binders are concerned, some caution is reasonable from my understanding. If used inappropriately, with wearing them for prolonged periods of time without breaks and during exercise being the times I’m most aware of, there is the potential for injury. That being said, when used following the guidelines that are out there and by listening to your body for the signs of problems before they become severe, they can be of great benefit and value. Think about it like medication: as long as you follow the dosages and timing for it - eg the medication might be “no more than *x* pills *y* times a day, don’t eat for an hour after taking it”, whereas the binder might be “wear it for no more than *x* hours at a time, don’t wear it while sleeping or any time heavy breathing is likely” - then any problems are unlikely to pop up, and will be manageable if they do.  


I want to talk about the glamorise/phase issue, because it’s the kind of thing that pops up in a lot of places and has the potential to be magnified and distorted by both pro- and anti-LGBTQ+ people. As a few people I’ve seen here have already said, it’s possible that despite your kid saying that they’re nonbinary now they may come to realise something different somewhere down the track. Maybe they’ll work out a more specific category of nonbinary-ness that applies to them (agender, demigender, genderfluid/flux, the list goes on….), maybe they’ll realise they’re trans, or maybe they’re cis and whatever feelings they had that led them to nonbinary were actually signs of some other element of their life. That they’re physically developing earlier than the other kids around them may be a factor that makes them feel like an outsider, wishing they weren’t the way they are physically that has morphed into a desire to not be as feminine presenting. Maybe this otherness feeling goes away as other kids start to go through the same sort of changes, but maybe it doesn’t. (I was the opposite, desperate to start shaving to show I was an adult, which I think at least somewhat got connected with the latent wish to not be a boy, resulting in wanting to be a man, until 20 or so years later realising that wanting to be an adult and not wanting to be a boy didn’t in my case mean being a man but being a nonbinary adult.) It’s also possible that they’re right on the money with what they’ve already told you: that they’re nonbinary and will identify exactly that way for the rest of their life. Regardless of any of that whether this is a temporary phase of their life or not, it’s real for them here and now. If there was a movie coming out that they wanted to see because it has their favourite actor, or it’s of a genre they enjoy, or based on some other property that they love… regardless of the reason they like it now, you wouldn’t deny them seeing it because they *might* like something else in the future.  


I’m not going to deny that kids can be influenced, and certainly will want to emulate people that they like and think are cool. Having said that though, they also often understand a lot more than we tend to give them credit for. Whether or not that understanding is as nuanced as it might be in an adult, and whether or not they can articulate that understanding as fully as an adult that tries to drop in words like “articulate” into a reddit post, they still get stuff. Is it possible that there’s a person or a group at the school that your kid thinks is just completely awesome, who happens to be nonbinary that they’ve latched onto and want to be like, and so they’ve decided to be nonbinary too? Yes it is. But if it’s just a form of hero worship, why did they latch onto that aspect of this person and not something else? It’s likely that there’s some aspect of themselves that connects with that idea.  


It’s easy to look around and see that there are more people identifying with more terms under the LGBTQ+ umbrella. More people are openly gay, more people openly transition from their gender assigned at birth to their actual gender, more people are changing their names and announcing their pronouns… more people are being open about who they actually are rather than who their “supposed” or expected to be. At face value, it wouldn’t be crazy to think that there was a fad element to all of this, and it wouldn’t surprise me if there were a handful of people out there who claim to be something they’re not for ingenuine reasons. But a big factor in this apparent explosion in the numbers of LGBTQ+ people is that more people are seeing that it’s okay to be who you are in more places, that there is less stigma and more support (though neither of those are where they should be yet), and that people are seeing more possibilities. There are so many aspects and moments of my life that I look back on now and can see that we’re signposts to me being nonbinary, but I had no idea about it as a concept for the vast majority of my life. I first came across someone in media several years ago, and when they introduced themselves as being nonbinary and using they/them pronouns I had no idea what that meant. I was in my 30s when I first encountered the concept. A few years later I’d come to realise that that’s who I was, and so many of those past moments made a whole lot more sense.  


You can see the same sort of trend (a term I’m using in the mathematic/analytical sense rather than the style/fashion sense) with left-handedness: there was a period of time where the number of left-handed people was sharply increasing, but then it plateaued and has been fairly steady since. It wasn’t that it became popular or a fad, it was that it stopped having the association with being bad and wrong and evil, so people stopped being forced to be right-handed, which allowed people to just be themselves. (In this aspect at least.) The experts that actually study these things say the same thing about queerness today: as fewer people are actively against us, with more people being of not actively supporting and accepting then at least no worse than being indifferent to us, more people are able to feel comfortable to be out as themselves. The more people who are out, the safer it feels for others to come out. The more openly things are discussed, the more possibilities are understood, the more opportunities there are for people to have a better understanding about themselves.  


Let your kid lead you in this, while telling but more importantly showing them that you love and support them. If they’re comfortable with it, talk with them about how they came to their realisation. If they’re name is particularly associated with a gender, ask them about whether there’s a shortened form/nickname that they might prefer to be used (eg “Sam” instead of “Samantha”/“Samuel”), and whether they want you to use a particular name/pronouns in certain circumstances. This is particularly important given you’d said they’d not come out to anyone else yet, as outing them before they’re ready is a huge no-no. Are there other gendered words that they are comfortable/uncomfortable with? At the end of the day, you know your kid better than we will. You’ll be better placed to know if they want it shouted from the rooftops or treated like it’s nothing.  


Good luck to them and to you in all of this!
Everyone here has already mentioned that binders are safe when purchased in the correct size, I just want to add that by telling your kid that they can’t wear a binder for now you are leaving them to wonder if a binder might make her feel better with her body as opposed to just giving the binder a try so they can know how it feels. It’s possible they might try on a binder and realize it’s actually not for them, or they might love it. They can’t know how they’ll feel unless you give them a chance to try, and some day hopefully they will appreciate your willingness to accommodate them when they were trying to figure themselves out.
I wouldn’t suggest a binder for a kid that young. Rib growth is incredibly necessary and you don’t want to get in the way of that. Binders are 99% safe but having an option that’s 100% safe, go with the 100%. I would buy your kid a compressive but safe sports bra, considering that they’re a small cup size and should be able to get results they’ll like. If they don’t like the results they get, spectrum binders are designed to be safe for the ribs, but that should be your plan B. 

It very well could be a phase. They could realize that their dysphoria was simply discomfort with a changing body, and that they prefer to present in a gender-nonconforming way. You know what’s the worst thing that happens if you support their identity? They realize about themself that they aren’t trans, and they know they have your support no matter who they are. If they come out as gay, or have scary news, or don’t want to go to college, they’ll think back to when they were 10 and their parents supported who they may have been. They’ll trust you more than they would if you’re unsupportive. 

The best thing that happens if you support their identity is they realize young who they are. Personally, as a trans person who hit puberty young, (eight or nine, like your kid!) I felt dysphoria when I started puberty that has only gotten stronger as I got older. Having the support of my parents meant the world to me. They didn’t always understand, but knowing they cared meant I had a place I knew I was safe. 

Talk with your kid about their feelings. Ask how long they’ve been feeling how they feel. Talk about ways you want to fix their hard feelings. Do they want a haircut? Do they want some new, more neutral clothing? I’d suggest trying the use of they/them pronouns more. I’m aware they use they/she, but you mostly used she in the original post. That’s okay! It takes time to get used to a change. But it will really mean a lot to your kid if you put the effort in, and take the time it needs. 

I recommend the books “How to They/Them” by Stuart Getty and “Life Isn’t Binary” by Meg John-Barker and Alex Iantaffi if you’d like to understand non-binary identity better. Even if your kid turns out to be cis later in life, you understand the world around you a little better! 

If you have any further questions, please feel free to ask. I really appreciate when folks ask questions to be better ally’s.
Edit for formatting, sorry for the long reply!
Binders aren’t a permanent thing. Think of them as a sports bra that flattens out the chest even better! Just make sure they don’t wear it longer than 8 hours. As for it being a phase, it’s possible your child may realize that they are cis, or maybe they turn out to be trans. Or agender. Whatever the case, you need to stand by them, and support them! I wish my parents were as accepting as you! You’re doing a good job so far!
As someone who had almost this exact experience growing up in the Bible Belt, but kept quiet about it to be safe, I’d have absolutely felt so much better with a binder back then. By the time I was in 4th grade I had a huge chests, and one of my teachers even told me I needed to wear a bra, when at the time I couldn’t find anything that didn’t hurt or that fit properly. 

A binder would be a fantastic help for your kiddo, and it’s not permanent or harmful, so long as you choose the correct size and make sure they’re not wearing it 24/7, as in taking breaks, not wearing it to sleep, etc.
Hey, I'm a non-binary LGBTQ+ activist also from an uber-conservative state. I'm going to just answer some of your questions/concerns in list form here. It's a long reply, but I want to answer each concern as thoroughly and correctly as possible.

1) When working on education or asking questions, don't get too caught up in guilt about not doing better or getting dragged through the mud. Nobody's born knowing everything, and in terms of education on gender and identity, good resources to learn are few and far between. Don't take not knowing things personally, all it'll do is stress you out and make things harder than they are.

2) Getting your kid to a socially progressive school environment is a very good thing. It'll likely have problems like all schools do, but any way to minimize the amount of transphobia your kid might experience is good at their age. As for the school ""glamorizing"" being LGBTQ+, I wouldn't worry about it too much. Kids always fixate and get super-invested in things at that age, whether it's dinosaurs and astronauts or cartoons and Pokemon. Fixating on being LGBTQ+ has some difficulties that other fixations don't, due to how prevalent transphobia is right now, but so long as your kid has a community to support them they'll be as fine as they can. I'd recommend seeing if there's a PFLAG chapter in your area; it's a support group for parents of LGBTQ+ people.

3) Binders are an item of clothing used to make a person's chest look flat while the binder is on. They're only dangerous if worn too tightly for too long at a time, but in the same way that regularly wearing shoes that are too small can mess up your feet. It might take some trial and error to find the right size, but once you do they're no more dangerous than wearing a tie to work everyday.

4) I can't give specific advice on what to say to your kid's dad, since I'm an internet stranger and don't know him or his personality. That said, in my experience, I think the question of whether it is or isn't a phase is kind of irrelevant. Gender, like every part of a person's identity, isn't a static thing that's the same at all times in all parts of the world. Arguably, every point in life is a phase; a person will likely be wildly different at ages 10, 20, and 40. **The thing to focus on is that your child is still the same kid; the word to describe them just changed.** Maybe it is a phase, maybe it isn't; at the end of the day it's still the same kid you both seem to love and care deeply about.

Let me know if this helps!
Okay so binders aren’t permanent but I totally agree with discussing things with a doctor first. Non-binary might be a stepping stone for your kid or it might be their home either way that is for them to figure out in their own time. It sucks that your husband is skeptical but I suggest reading some books on the subject, even if he doesn’t say it to the kid’s face the kid will most likely be able to pick up on his attitude.
first of all, your curiosity and eagerness to learn and understand is very heartwarming to me. don’t let your fear of getting things wrong get in the way - i’m nonbinary and i got it wrong when i was first starting out. it’s part of being a human and it’s obvious you want to support your child…that’s what matters the most. they’re incredibly lucky. i knew i was nonbinary at 7 but didn’t know there was a term for it at the time, which caused a lot of pain and confusion. your kid is lucky they have access to the knowledge that’s more mainstream now.

it all boils down to assessing and restructuring the way you’ve viewed gender all your life. it’s hard to understand this if you haven’t completely reframed your view of gender. it’s a construct. it’s something we’ve made and something that’s enforced. gender isn’t sex; it has nothing to do with genitals. ask yourself what makes a woman a woman and a man a man. intersex people exist, a lot more people are intersex than you think! it requires you to disassemble society’s view of gender in your mind, that’s what makes people so uncomfy. it also takes time.
there’s a podcast called Gender Reveal that talks about gender and how much of a social construct gender is. they have an episode called Gender 101 and highly suggest.
I was given this advice when I was in college and one of the members of our GSA asked what to do when their parent is struggling.

Your child struggled to figure out who they are. And you knew them for 10 years as one way. Don't beat yourself up. You're doing great by supporting them and respecting them. And if it takes time, that's totally fine. The important part is you're actively trying. You've even on here asking for help and to see if what you're doing it right. You're a great parent. I'm sure your kid knows it.
Binders aren’t a “big step” or “something that will change their body”. A binder is the smallest step you can possibly take with starting a transition. They aren’t permanent and do not cause any problems, unless worn while exercising or while worn in bed.
my thoughts while reading:a binder isn't going to change their body any more than spanx changes yours. my spouse was kinda cautious with a binder at first with our trans son, but we asked our kid's doctor and he said it was physically fine (when worn carefully- not during exercise, no more than 8 hours a day, take good breaks from it, take it off if it doesnt feel right etc) and we got him the [https://www.gc2b.co/](https://www.gc2b.co/) binder and he only wears it sometimes, but it works very well.

impermanence doesn't imply insignificance, even if it is just a phase. Your kiddo is ALWAYS going to remember how you treat them with this, they came to you and told you something very important to them, and this is going to define how much they trust you for the rest of their life. If you call them by the right name and pronouns, let them dress how they want and present how they want, and they DO change their mind... in ten years, it will not matter at all. There will be no long term harm that comes from respecting your child, and they will see that you are on their side, and supporting them.

Edit: you might also find some resources and people going through similar things on r/cisparenttranskid , I'm nonbinary myself, so not entirely a ""cis parent"", but I still find a lot of good on there!
Apologies if this has already been said. But I think the invalidation of ""it's just a phase"" is actually something that prevents young people from genuinely and holistically exploring their gender identities. Like, if someone says ""it's just a phase"" you're going to do everything you can to prove to them it isn't. So if you have some doubts about your identity, instead of exploring them you will shut them out because if you do change as a result of those doubts you will be confirming this premise.  
One of the things I learned about gender in my experience of coming out to myself and others as an adult was that the best way to figure out what I really wanted was to try things and see how they felt. I had the respect and understanding of the people around me, and that made it easier to try things like wearing new types of clothes, exploring makeup, using they/them pronouns etc. What I found in that experience was that I knew pretty clearly when something was or wasn't right for me. But if I felt like not being sure about everything was going to suggest to others that I ""wasn't serious"" about being nonbinary, it would've been harder for me to be honest with myself about various things. 

I think when you're exploring these things as a kid it's gotta be fundamentally difficult. Your parents may want the best for you, but they also want to ""protect"" you from the danger of not conforming to a particular gendered ideal. There is a grain of truth in that parental impulse, which is that it is safer to be cis than to be trans in this world for a whole number of reasons (obviously the big one is transphobia); however, you cannot ""make"" someone cis or trans. This form of ""protection"" really only holds people back from exploring their identities open-heartedly. 

I may be over stepping here because I have never been a parent. But what I would wish for myself is to have had a space within my family to explore who I really was (even the things that sat outside the bounds of my assigned gender). The idea of queerness as an either/or is a construct that I think makes this incredibly difficult, so it is really important to make sure your kid knows that there's no threshold they need to pass to identify a certain way. Your own identity as a queer person can take the shape of who you are, and it doesn't have to match up to a specific term or label; a label is a tool that can streamline the way you describe yourself to other people, but it is not a container that you need to fit neatly into. 

As is always the case, I have gotten ramble-y here. There are certainly more coherent and focused replies. But I hope you (or anyone else reading) can take some morsels out of this.
I wish I had the vocabulary for non-binary and other queer terms when I was OP’s kid’s age. 

You can see the non-binary screaming through my childhood pictures as I flip flopped from acceptable conservative WASP nest looks and what was actually comfortable and made me happy. 

Don’t be surprised when you’re asked about top surgery. I developed fast and the world is cruel to large breasted people.
The best thing you can do is support them, whether or not you personally feel comfortable with it. Because here's the thing: your kiddo may only be 10 years old, but ultimately they are the one who knows themself the best.

Up until this point and whether or not you knew it, you've played a large role in determining your kid's identity. You saw them as the gender assigned to them at birth and that was that. Now, your kid doesn't need you to do that for them anymore. They're maturing. They're moving into the next stage of life where they are becoming more intellectually and bodily autonomous. They're weighing what they've previously been told about themself with what they actually feel, and they've found out that it doesn't fit them. That comes with a real sense of loss for you, both from having to deal with the actual change your kid is going through, but also because you're confronting that they're not quite so much of a child anymore. But at the end of the day, this situation isn't about you and your needs. This is about your kid and what they need. They're telling you what they need. So listen to them. Let them have the things they need. 

Even if you don't like the idea of them wearing a binder, binders don't actually hurt the human body in any way. And if it is a ""phase,"" (which I don't think it is either) your kiddo will stop wearing them on their own. You have nothing to lose from getting them one, and the support that you show by loving them unconditionally will do so much more for your relationship than if you try to lay down a line that forces them to be something that's not who they truly are.
People have added a lot of great comments to this, so I won't reiterate what they've said. But I have to stress: your child will likely bind whether or not you get them binders. Think of it like sex education (obviously, there is nothing sexual about being transgender, but this is my closest example). People will have sex whether or not you give them sex education and/or access to contraceptives. The difference is that one way is **safer and controlled,** while the other can be **very, very dangerous.** Buying your child a binder will virtually eliminate the possibility that they break a rib binding with ace bandages because you wouldn't buy them a safe, fitted one.
I'm just surprised that they are having their period now, so idk if binders might be big or not. But even I'm waiting for one and I'm a teen. I just suggest do your best to help that growing kid best you can
even if it is a phase, you should still respect your child’s wishes. people go through phases all the time, what’s the harm in using different pronouns or a new name for a while. being unsupportive of them coming out will only make them want to rebel

Hi, non-binary person here. I first expressed that I was gender non conforming when I was in the 4th grade. Was not in a safe environment to fully express myself until adulthood. I am going to offer a bit of perspective. It is probably going to come across as a bit harsh, in all honesty. 

You call yourself an ally then spend the rest of your post trying to justify not adapting to the changes your child has asked you to make (pronouns, comfort in physical appearance). Have you even taken the time to research this at all before coming to reddit? Yes, it may take some time for you to mentally process your kids new pronouns, but it is important that you at least try, which you haven't done on here. Binders are not permanent, and there are a lot of companies that make a safe product or that can be used. Since they are so young I would probably suggest more of a compression top type binder (for them and tomboyx make some good ones), but for a full  binder as long as they are measured correctly, bought from a good company, and not over used (no binding for more than 8 hours, don't wear it overnight) they are completely safe and non permanent. Some good brands are gc2b, Underworks, and spectrum. Don't buy anything with clasps on it for a binder and don't buy off Amazon. 

As for the rest- yeah it may not be the identity they will stick with all their lives, but the way you and your husband act now will impact them the rest of their lives. The suicide risks for LGBT kids who have parents that are unsupportive are through the roof, and as much as you can say with your words that you are an ally, you need to show that with your actions as well. Just using a kids chosen pronouns and correct names significantly decreases the amount of suicidal ideation and attempts they will experience in their lifetime. It could be a phase. It probably isn't, as most people I know who have experienced gender dysphoria and are trans knew when they were their age. But it isn't your call to determine if it is a phase or not. If you react negatively when you think it is 'just a phase' you may find yourself with a kid who has broken off contact with you as an adult because you are no longer trusted with information with their life. 

I would challenge you, if you are an ally to unpack that mentality. It is incredibly dismissive and kind of homophobic to hold on to 'its just a phase' and keep that in your vernacular.
I think nonbinary is hard for people to wrap their heads around because gender is not a feeling, it's a knowing. In psychology, they teach you that there are 5-6 feelings. Joy, disgust, sadness, anger, fear, and surprise. You don't feel male or female or nonbinary, you \*know\* you are. While focusing solely on their internal sense of gender, it is VERY hard for cisgender people to describe that internal sense. If you ask yourself ""how do you know you are a man/woman? what does it feel to be a man/woman?"" you'll find it hard to answer. However, when asked ""when did you know you were male/female?"" you likely knew very very young. 

The best way I can describe it is this: ""I was raised a girl but I always knew that neither boy nor girl was the right way to describe me.""

The main thing I want all young non-binary people to have is acceptance from parents that let them explore and make gender presentation choices at their own pace. If they want to change their clothes, hair, name, wear a binder...etc. whatever. Cis people can do all that too there's no reason why it should only be allowed if the child is ""truly"" trans.

It's okay if they ""glamorize"" LGBTQ positivity at the school. I \*like\* who I am. Liking me means liking and embracing all of me, the nonbinary part included. It is not at all something to be ashamed of or hide. Being nonbinary allows me a great sensation of gender freedom and a unique perspective and open-mindedness that allows me to be more understanding and kind to others. This is something I like about myself. And there is nothing wrong with thinking you are nonbinary and then changing your mind. Gender exploration is allowed and provides people with valuable insights. 

The biggest fuck up my family made when I ""came out"" was that because I can hide who I am, they encouraged me to and never spoke of it again. I don't think we've talked about it for years. They wanted me to keep my name, my clothes, and my pronouns. Never to talk about it. And to live in stealth mode my whole life, never having a moment of gender euphoria anywhere but in private all by myself. The better move would have been to say to their child ""this is your life. what do YOU want?""

If it's a phase then so what? I bet you my parents still think being pansexual and nonbinary was a phase I went through in my teenage years because I present female and have boyfriends now. It's not. I've known that neither boy or girl describe me best since I was 5 years old. And of course, while my parents see that I have had a boyfriend, they don't see the gay things I get up to lol.

I was asking people how I could be made into a boy when I was 10. If I had known back then what non-binary was, if I had known there were opportunities to explore, I would have been over the moon excited! I present female because I like looking professional and put together and can't do that well with a masculine look because of my body type, even if I get top surgery. I'm never going to pass as androgynous or male and that doesn't matter. On the inside, my gender identity hasn't changed. I changed my name when I was 14 and I LOVE my new name. Every time someone has said it for the past 10 years you can just see me glow with gender euphoria. I gained confidence I never had.

The best thing is to just let your kid explore, and support the exploration. If you want to help yourself understand mentally the best thing to do is to read books and watch some docuseries on Youtube about parents raising gender-expansive children. There are actually a lot on there. That really really helped me when I was going through this when I was a teen. 

Also, it's best to order chest binders that are made for this type of thing. You can learn about safety with chest binders so that they aren't motivated to DIY it with tape or ace bandages or whatever else is lying around your house because that will cause problems.
I was 8 when I went through puberty and it was horrific and I'm left with lasting trauma due to how it related to my non-binary gender. I understand this is difficult, but your child NEEDS support and access to treatment such as binders and puberty blockers (if they desire; they might just benefit from them due to their precocious puberty regardless of gender identity. I'm abnormally short due to my precocious puberty) to prevent further damage to their body. Being forced to be a woman (especially when you're not one) that young is really, really difficult. My DMs are open if you're curious to hear more specifics about my experience with precocious puberty and being nonbinary. 

I highly recommend reaching out to PFLAG as a family to help understand what's going on in order to provide your child with the care that they need. Their dad especially. Be prepared to defend your child as ferociously as needed, listen to them, and provide them emotional and physical support. Even if this is a phase (recent data shows that in trans kids with a median age of 8, 92% of them remain their real gender identity into adulthood) wouldn't you want your child to know that they can come to you for anything and remain loved and supported? PFLAG had resources for families like you and can likely help you and their dad with the final hangups you may have. It saved my partner her relationship with her mom (the dad wasn't able to be open minded and she had to cut him off after he stopped participating unfortunately,) I highly recommend it.
I recommend getting them a safe binder that’s properly sized otherwise they might bind with improper materials that WILL damage the ribs and lungs. Either way your kid will probably end up binding, it’s better to give them the safer resources. Idk if it is a phase or not, but it probably doesn’t matter because being there and supportive in the moment is all that does matter. My mom bought me my first binder, and I still wear them (I’m 23), they’ve never damaged my body. I can even workout in them. Just leave it to 8~10 hours of wearing, so maybe only at school. Glad your kid feels safe with you btw.
Good luck

So many of these comments say everything better than I ever could but on the topic of binders I do want to chime in. Peruse around the nonbinary subreddits  a little more for binder recs (r/ftm and r/trans have some too). I've seen a lot of posts about gc2b not being good quality anymore and I know for a fact that they run small. I've heard good things about forthem (which looks more like a sports bra) but I haven't tried them. I personally swear by underworks.

As long as the binder isn't used during activity like sports or exercise it's as safe  (and less uncomfortable than) a bra. I wear one all day, every day and have done for a few years. Because of the all around compression, getting used to it a little at a time is important so taking breaks is key
I'd say it is smart to stick to sports bras for now, and maybe if they still feel the need for a binder then get it. As for your husband saying it's just a phase, I'm not really sure how to help there but maybe explain that even if it is a phase, it's still who they are now and time will tell
Binders.. don't change your body. That's pretty much the whole point. They're for trans, nonbinary, and gender non conforming youth and teens to feel more comfortable in their own skin without making irreversible changes in case they decide they wish to present more feminine when they're older. Let your kid get a binder. If you're worried about it causing damage, buy one that's adjustable.
Binders are perfectly safe and will not change your child's body permanently any more or less than a sports bra (a lot of us wish...) The only thing that causes permanent changes are hormones, and even not *all* those changes are permanent; obviously, ten may be a bit young to be taking T. If your child is having some body issues, I'd talk to your pediatrition about potentially hormone blockers; as far as I know, this just hits the ""pause"" button on puberty. With the fact they've already gotten their period and developed a chest, I'm not positive what benefits it has - I'm not a doctor and I didn't figure out I was NB until I was wellllll past puberty. 

As for your husband, it's perfectly fine for him to currently be under the impression that it's ""just a phase"" as long as he's still using proper pronouns and respecting your child. Could it just be a phase? Sure. But I also urge you both to come to terms with the fact that it's most likely not. 

As far as I can tell, your child isn't asking for anything life-changing. Get them a binder and support them in any way you can. And if you're not sure how, feel free to ask them. It's okay.
binders are completely safe and non-permanent. it's the same concept as getting her a push up bra, except they're going for the opposite look. it doesnt change anything, it's just a garment of clothing
You’re amazing for this, binders as safe for their body as long as they are worn correctly so make sure you teach her about how to safely wear one. :)

First I’m so glad that you are so supportive but I do have some suggestions to make both of y’all more comfortable😁
1.you can talk to them yourself and just ask them questions, like “I suppose you and id like to know more about how you feel so me and your father can better support you” or something like that
2. I am glad you didn’t dismiss the idea of binders completely because if can very much help their gender dysphoria which comes with a lot of non binary or trans people. Sports bras are a great start. And when y’all are both comfortable u can do some more research on binders since they’re relatively safe if you know how to wear them, I would suggest not putting binders off the table.
3. I think it would make your kid super happy if you could talk to their father to made sure he won’t say anything he’ll regret. I myself am non binary minor and I know what little things a parent can say that will stick with their child for a lot time. So try to educate their dad to try to be more supportive.

I honestly think you are doing an amazing job though, because you are trying. And that is the best you can do sometimes , and using their pronouns, going to therapy, and asking how you can improve yourself, you are being such a great parent !! 😁❤️

Good luck to you both !!!
If they want binders, you can get them some! They want to experiment with their looks, and a binder is really just a piece of clothing for those who want to have a try at a flat chest.

The LGBTQIA+ thing is not a phase, it wasn't a phase, and it will never be a phase! As a no-box nonbinary person, I say let them experiment with looks so that they can find out what look fits them best!

Me, I haven't gone to find a binder yet, but I want to try it sometime!
Much of what I’d like to say has already been commented on below but I do wanna say that I run a project that gives binders to people for free! Unfortunately it’s limited to the state and city we serve BUT i also give educations on the safeties of binders, wear and care, tips, do’s and dont’s as well as answering any questions and most importantly as well: how to FIND the right binder in terms of style, ability, and measurements. You are more than welcome to message me and I’d be happy to give the run down. Much info is on reddit and online as well and redundant but also varies some and I’ve condensed all that when giving educations. My DM’s are open or you can always email projectbinderfinder@gmail.com and I can provide a list of resources as well.
Even if it's just a phase, we go through many of them and all of them should be respected.
I was deep in the closet as a teenager because it was ""too early"" to express myself. Right now my mom also dismisses my identity because ""it's too late"" to change.

There is no ""right time"" to understand yourself, your child may choose a lot of ways to explore their identity. Maybe even they are seeing themselves as nonbinary because early puberty pushes us into a gendered role we are often aren't ready to embrace. It's awkward, it's uncomfortable, and they might feel they should be ""just a kid"" for a while longer.

You probably remember how scary is to ""become a woman"". If you grew up in a more conservative household you might have seen your parents becoming suddenly serious, having ""well so you're not a child anymore"" talks. It's a huge pressure that comes from changes you cannot control.

Just let your child be whoever they want to be. Respect the way they want to approach and embrace their own body and image. Help them feel comfortable and confident. If it's just a phase, that's okay.
Can I ask why you’re against binders? The only thing I can think of is a concern for safety which I understand, but all you have to do is talk to them about how to use it properly. 

Make sure they don’t wear it more than 8 hours a day, take a couple (or more) days off from wearing it each week, and don’t exercise in it. Tell them the dangers of not following those rules so they understand. Properly measure them to assure you’re getting them the right size binder. I can’t think of any reason to be against it as long as you use it properly?
First, since I saw you mention binders being something you're against, as long as it's used sensibly and you buy the right kind of binders, they're completely safe (personally I use GC2B ones, they're amazing to me and I like to use them as shirts sometimes too!). Usually, when binding, it shouldn't be used for more than 8 hours, and there should be some breaks between uses (e.g. 3 days on, 2 days off, but it's whatever works best for your child).

In terms of explaining non-binary, try seeing gender like a Venn diagram. One circle for male, one circle for female, and an overlap for some non-binary folks, and others can exist outside of all the circles.

So far, you're doing a great job with helping your kid. You're actually using her pronouns and they're comfortable enough around you to open up about what they feel like they need to have to feel comfortable. Try researching binder companies that are safe to wear while also being affordable, and feel free to ask any more questions here. I'm sure there's plenty of us to help!
Be supportive. I’m learning too as a parent and have a long way to go.  Whether this is their authentic identity or a ‘phase’, being supportive is the best approach.  I see a lot of girls my daughter’s age identifying as they/them/she/her.  At some level they are rejecting the notion and expectations that the binary concept of womanhood brings.  Whether that is their authentic identity or they’re ‘pumping the brakes’ so so speak from a place of anxiety in their perception of an over-sexualized society that they aren’t prepared to engage in… it’s all good.
Well, getting a binder would not change her body. It would just make her chest appear smaller. Only difference between sports bras and binders is the binders making the breast appear smaller than sports bras, and wearing sports bras would probably make her feel more dysphoric.

Also, their dad can’t assume that it’s just a phase. It’s try that sometimes people can be confused, and realize that they really are cuz. They are also a child, but if they truly feel like that, then it wouldn’t just be a phase. No one should tell her it’s just a phase or something like that, and people should always support her, no matter what they realize to be
You're a great parent, and you're doing really well. You're using your kid's pronouns, and letting them express who they are. From a non binary person whose parents didn't let them do these things... Thank you. ❤️ 

I work in mental health, and one of the biggest protective factors for trans and non binary youth is having people use their pronouns and chosen name. It's also widely recognized by LGBTQIA positive mental health providers that the only treatment for gender dysphoria is allowing people to transition. It's important that you let your kid explore their gender and access what she needs to do this!! 

As far as binders go, there is a safety concern, especially since she is young and still growing. I would encourage you to do some research on binder safety and communicate with your kid about how they can bind safely. I recommend GC2B binders! The ones with books like bras can be very dangerous. It's also important that they don't wear their binder for too long a stretch at a time! Please do your research, but as others have pointed out, binders will not permanently change your kids body unless worn improperly. They won't stop breast development, but they can lead to rib injuries if they don't fit well or are worn too long. I highly highly recommend you buy your kid binders and make this an open topic. If their breasts make them feel uncomfortable, they'll likely find a way to bind them, and it may not be safe. Also trust me, when you see how happy they are when their body looks the way they feel inside, the joy is contagious. 

As far as your husband's outlook goes, this kind of thinking is invalidating and harmful. The truth is, your kid might realize down the road that they're not non binary. They may be trans masculine, a trans man, cisgender, or simply queer. That's ok though!!! The important thing is that they're allowed to explore that and allowed to find relief from the gender dysphoria they're feeling. The damage done by not allowing them to transition if they are trans could be grave. If they aren't trans and this is just something they're exploring, the worst that happens is that they learn something about themselves... What's the harm in that? 

The Trevor Project is a mental health and suicide prevention organization that has lots of wonderful resources on supporting trans and non binary youth! I recommend checking them out and reading up on these topics! 

""A Guide to Being an Ally to Transgender and Nonbinary Youth – The Trevor Project"" https://www.thetrevorproject.org/resources/guide/a-guide-to-being-an-ally-to-transgender-and-nonbinary-youth/
While many people have already said this, I definitely encourage you to do more research on binding! It’s perfectly safe as long as you’re using a properly fitted binder and don’t wear it for too long at once, doesn’t permanently alter your body, and ultimately is way safer than not binding might be — if someone who experiences chest dysphoria doesn’t have access to a real binder, their dysphoria is likely to feel even more crushing and they may resort to using things like ace bandages to bind, which CAN be dangerous. Binding is a completely non-permanent way of managing dysphoria and is perfectly safe when done correctly.
I'm nonbinary. I always felt out of place in any gendered activity. I assumed this was how every body felt. I assumed it was normal to feel like I want to die when being told about being a girl and what girls are supposed to do and not do. At age 10 I realized this pain was because of having to by boy or girl and wishing I could opt out. Never had any concept of anything queer so I just went on assuming life was painful for everyone and at 12 I started regularly praying for God to kill me sooner. 

Learning as an adult some people reject being a boy or girl let me know there was a way to live life and not be in pain. 

If your kid seems excited, it's probably because it's pain avoidance, not because it's ""glamorized."" For every person that openly supports us there are 2 more that are openly against us. 

I understands it is confusing. Sometimes we're confused to. I'm confused as to how to wear my hair so I don't feel like a liar pretending to be a woman (I wish I was bald.) 

But please try to do what helps your child feel better. Because if you reject it there is a high chance you would be directly causing them pain. I think you don't want to cause pain
Hello, im max, a masc leaning nonbianary kid
I just wanna say you are an absolutly amazing parent for being so open as to hear our thoughts on how to help you understand this

Im assigned female at birth and i presented as such for many years. I only came out as nonbianary to my own mother as recent as a couple of years ago but i understand the fear of your child trying to change their bodies as such a young age. Or at least, the idea of them trying to change

Ill be honest, this story really hits close to home for me, i started puberty in the begining of 5th grade, and while gender identity wasnt a concept i was very familiar with nor cared to be, I did suffer from major dysphoria for years. I grew up in a mostly liberal but Very cis/het town, i never had anyone queer in my life to refer my experience to till midway through middle school. But even before then i was finding ways to keep my chest pinned down in very unhealthy ways.

Dysphoria doenst come from just wishing to be like ones peers, and it can be very dangerous. 
I tried to come out as a trans man to my mom when i was twelve, but all i really wanted at the time was just to have a binder.

Naturally she was just as scared as you are now, of me hurting my body, not only because i was growing but i also had asthma as well and she refused to entertain the idea of any kind of binding.
In the end i hadnt been able to wear a properly fitting bra for years until very Very recently. I still have the sports bra from middle school that would lock up my ribs and kept me from breathing deeply.
It was never a fun experience, and i didnt tell anyone for years. Anxiety and dysphoria can make you do a lot of things, especially when you feel isolated in that experience

But theres so many more resources out there now that i never got to have. And as everyone says, there are safe ways to properly bind ones chest without risk as long as everything fits properly
And even that little bit of acknowledgment and opportunity grow can mean so so so much
Perhaps it is a phase, but thats what we as humans do. We try different things, some work out and some dont, and we forge out identities through. Those expirences
And i think giving your child the space to learn and grown into whatever it is they may be is a wonderful thing. It really does warm my heart to know your kid is getting a supportive parent to help them through this new path they are trying
I think there are a lot of very good comments that give advice already, so I only have one thing to say:

THANK YOU

For believing your kid, for deepening your knowledge about this, for everything you do for them, THANK YOU
There are a lot of really long comments here so I'll keep mine short. 

I'm really glad you are being so supportive of them. This is a really difficult time for parents with trans children and it's always so heartwarming to see parents reaching out places like this. Your kid will thank you when they're older. Unfortunately, I think it's wise to be equipped to defend them. Understand the things people say about trans and nonbinary people (ex. ""it's just a phase"", ""sex and gender are the same"") and be equipped how to tell people they're wrong. 

While I don't want to say your therapist is wrong, psychology is a study of individuals and culture, meaning culture influences individuals behavior. Our culture is changing; being more accepting of our diversity, more critical of ourselves and our traditions. Nothing in culture is rigid. It ebbs and flows through each of us, from one generation to the next. Discovering the spectrum that is LGBTQ is part of the slowly changing tides of our human existence. It's discovering that we are who we make of ourselves. We decide who we want to be, and we create our destiny. 

That being said, people may have a hard time understanding, but not because of an innate human trait. Nonbinary isn't necessarily multiple boxes or no box, it could just be a third box. It could also be that boxes don't work for gender, being that men and women alike are called out frequently for not fitting in their box, or are pressured to always be in one. 

I hope this helped, though I know I probably made this bigger and more confusing for you. Still, I encourage you to look up more on gender expression. And keep supporting your child. Protect them how you want, keep them informed on their changing body just like normal, but let them be who they want and dress how they feel comfortable. I wish you the best of luck
There are teams kids that know at 4,so there's nothing weird about up or 10 year old exploring their gender identity! In fact if being queer wasn't ""trendy "" aka known to general public she might've spent years being depressed because they could tell something wasn't quite right but they wouldn't have had the knowledge or words to expresses what she wanted.
Firstly, you seem like a great parent. If everyone has this attitude, the world would be a much better place.

But aside, there's gonna be a lot of discovery here. I think the important thing to point out is yeah it *might* be a phase, but it might also be a huge part of their identity, and the opportunity to self discover now will save years down the line. If hrt or surgery is something they want to pursue in the future, then having explored already will save the effort of having to do so beforehand, both for making sure, and because legally that can be something that's required. This is *especially* important when you consider some treatments decrease effectiveness with age. Much like if they wanted to cut their hair or wear some new style, you should just let it be, maybe it'll be a passing thing, or maybe it's part of who they are. Ultimately they will remember that, and it will affect how they view you. Either you'll become the parent who kept them from exploring who they are, or you'll become a caring parent who nurtured and guided them through this, even if it wasn't truly who they are.

Also binders are harmless, just teach them good binding technique and it'll be fine.
Sup, anyways you are doing good, and I was Nb since I was 10(recently came out as trans boi)and I have experience with this stuff, usually sports bras do the trick coz binders can me constricting, I don't have much info to share, so good luck to you and your homo sapien spawn
If you don't help them with it, they'll probably go elsewhere and that's when they can get into unsafe situations. You don't want them buying t shots under the table and doing it behind your back. 

It might be a phase but that doesn't mean one should be any less supportive. Your child will learn through this who they can and cannot trust to be their real selves around, even if that self changed through time (which regardless of gender identity it will). 

Also Re glamorizing LGBT; I'm sure this has been harped on but can you imagine if we said the same the same thing about heterosexuality and regular schools glamorizing THAT? Because they are. So is mainstream media. In fact we're constantly bombarded with messages that heterosexuality and being cis gender is ""right"". I would take a good long look at your own prejudices you're bringing into these conversations. This forum was a great start! But now you have the task of unconditionally supporting someone through this process and that's going to require real, hard work yourself. It's pretty ducking cool you get to do this with your kid. In my day (lol) kids went through this alone and ashamed. I don't recommend that path unless you want them on anti depressants or worse
I’m 49, AFAB, non-binary. I knew I was different basically from the earliest point I can remember, but I didn’t have the language to describe it until about 2011. Thankfully, your child doesn’t need to go through the same fear, confusion, and self-doubt I went through, because they have the ability to experiment with terms in a safe and supportive environment. 

It doesn’t matter if it’s a phase. This is the point in life where it’s okay to try on new pieces of personality. A binder won’t change them permanently. New pronouns won’t change them permanently. Nothing here is harmful in the long term, so long as they’re treated with respect and given autonomy over these choices.

They may change their mind later. Or they may not. Either way, affirming their gender decisions now will also affirm their trust in their relationship with you.
Your better then my parents they call people like them and me It and completely ignored me coming out and use my dead name even more now

Your husband is wrong, my parents say it’s just a phase even though I’ve been this since 2018 that’s far worse then simply not liking your child cause that makes them think their feelings are genuine and can screw with them

And try and have a open mind, that’s how I got rid of my terrible ideas and misgendering friends cause I was to lazy to learn, it all takes time but I’m sure they’d appreciate the hustle even if their to young to truly understand (I tried rephrasing that but it only came out worse)
Is like to pose a warning. My younger sibling came out to our family as nonbinary about 2 years ago.

My step-dad was of the opinion that it was all just a phase and that my younger sibling was being influenced by their friends at school. So he refused to go along with it. He refused to use the correct pronouns. He continues to use very gendered language when referring to my younger sibling.

And guess what? My younger sibling made a plan. Since the prospect of coming out didn't go over well with their dad, they decided that they would intentionally act as if it was all a phase from the beginning. They stopped talking about gender identity. They stopped experimenting with clothing.  My sibling and I are close so they told me that they are going to basically pretend to be a ""good little girl"" until they turn 18 and can move out of the house and never be involved with certain family members ever again. 

My sibling has managed to learn that they cannot trust their dad to support them. And now at the age of 15 they have accepted the fact that they are going to have to break ties with many of their family members simply because no one has believed them when they've said that they aren't a girl.
As a genderqueer person, I’d say the best thing you can do for your kiddo is to love and respect them. Actively listen to what they say, without projecting your own experiences/thoughts on to them. Continue to do research when you have questions. Remember that everyone has their own experiences and just because something is true for one enby person, it may not be true for your child. If you and your husband don’t already have your own therapists, I’d strongly suggest finding someone. 

I didn’t find a label that fit my experiences of gender until my late 20’s and was super anxious to come out to my very religious mother. But she surprised me by responding with love, listening and educating herself. We had some great discussions about gender as she learned new things. That unconditional love and support is why we have a relationship now. 

Check in with your kiddo to see how different pronouns and other changes feel to them. Create a safe space of open communication and listening to one another. Let go of who you thought your kiddo would be and celebrate who they are. Gender is so personal, don’t allow yourself or your husband to push preconceived notions onto them. Explore your own gender identity with your kiddo, see the world through their eyes. If there’s something that concerns you or you don’t understand, tell your kiddo that you need to do some research and you’ll get back to discuss it further after you have more information. I’m not saying agree to absolutely everything, but leave your biases at the door. 

You’re off to a good start, keep the momentum going. And light a fire under your husband. Being a parent is incredibly challenging, but will help you grow as an individual and family cultivate true respect for one another and yourselves. The work is totally worth it.
One quick note on the binder - not body altering, but make sure you get one that fits properly and make sure they take breaks with it - they can wear it when they go to school or go out, but when they're home and relaxing especially alone they need breaks from it. Fucked up my ribs bad when I was younger by wearing too-tight binders for 16+ hours a day.
First, the binders are not dangerous like you seem to think. Definitely do some research on measurements and proper binder care before jumping into buying one (the wrong size can cause pain/discomfort and sizing too small can pose a safety risk) but binders are literally the least invasive, least permanent thing your kid can do when it comes to transitioning. When binding becomes genuinely dangerous is when done with improper materials like ace bandages, which can cause actual harm to your child. Binders are no different than any other piece of clothing. Also, so what if it's just a phase? Everyone goes through them, but claiming it's ""just a phase"" and not respecting your kid for what they are going through right here and now is only going to do one thing: make them understand that they can't come to you for unconditional love or support. I understand for you and your kid's dad this is a ""big change"" and ""difficult,"" but please realize that this isn't about you. You are allowed to have complicated feelings about something that you maybe don't entirely understand, but please still place your kid's wellbeing and needs first. They matter more than your comfort during this. 

You're on the right track and I'm glad to hear that you're trying and willing to learn. That's so important! A lot of the other comments I've been reading on this thread have great resources and are accurate/trustworthy. A lot of the links I would have posted have already been done. Just keep an open mind and keep learning, and keep loving/affirming your kid no matter what  :)
Everyone is saying binders are completely safe, I disagree. While yes they’re not permanent, they can be dangerous. Make sure they don’t wear one too small since they are young, they are growing and can easily grow out of one making it too tight on their chest affecting their breathing. It might be hard to notice because they might like how it looks but you need to keep their safety in mind. Also make sure the binders are not worn during physical activity or at night because it can be dangerous. It squeezes the chest and if it’s not the right size can really damage your kid. As long as it’s the right size and they understand when they can and cannot wear it, it’s completely safe. But I don’t want anyone overlooking the potential dangers if used incorrectly.
This is so well put. It also occurred to me reading this as a parent, thinking about this, kiddos go through phases all the time, and most parents still support that through purchases if they have the money . Liking Lego phase? Buy legos. Liking soccer? Invest in soccer stuff. So saying it’s “just a phase” in order not to buy affirming clothing shows internalized transphobia in a different way. Even if it were just a phase, as the comment or here says, we all have phases in life. Even if it were just a phase, support it. And as far as binders, maybe it will help you to just think of them as shapewear. As a non-binary person I felt a little weird about binders until I thought of it this way. All bras are shapewear in a sense, they’re just going for a different gendered shape than a binder. Bottom line is that supporting your child will help them feel good and feel good about your relationship. Not doing so can have pretty severe mental health and relationship consequences down the road as well.
Binding is safe IF done correctly! OP please make sure to research how to safely bind before allowing a ten year old to do it. There are health risks if not done properly. If you refuse to let your child bind, they may turn to unsafe methods. It’s important to make sure they know how to do it safely.

Well put together ✨
Excellent and well-put.

Binders were the first thing I ever did to affirm my gender, and there was a noticeable difference in how I felt about myself and my confidence.  If there is concern that your child may wear (or want to wear) their binder for longer than 8 hours, you may want to consider a compression top that is not as “binding” but still gives the flattening effect that your child wants.  [TomboyX](https://tomboyx.com/collections/gender-euphoria/products/adjustablecompression-chai) has a compression top, and [Girlfriend Collective](https://girlfriend.com/products/black-mia-high-neck-bra) has a sports bra that many trans/non-binary people have compared to a compression top (though it does appear that it is being discontinued 😢).

As far as it being a phase, I am 23 years old and I am not out to my parents because I have constantly heard comments like that about trans/non-binary people from them (even though they say they are LGBT friendly 🙄).  I have accepted that I will probably never share this part of myself or my life with them, which is honestly unfortunate for them.  Children are more perceptive than we give them credit for, so even though you and your husband are trying your best, your child may feel that there are things she feels are off-limits to discuss.  Tell your child explicitly that you are listening to them and how they feel, and that you are working on addressing your own feelings about the matter to better support her.  It will make a huge difference, I promise.

(Edit: forgot to include that TomboyX is a great brand in general for underwear etc., though it is a tad expensive)
You, my good person, get an award.
Exactly I wear binders/compression top sometimes and the rule is you don’t wear them for longer than several hours a day and you NEVER sleep in them!
My only concern is trusting a 10 year old to adhere to safe binding practices, I knew so many kids (including myself) who wouldn't even wear a bike helmet. If OP is confident they and their kid can handle that responsibility, full steam ahead I say! 

This comment spells it all out really well, a lot better than I ever could've. Good shit.
And even *if* it’s something the child will grow out of, the best way to help them figure out who they are is to respect who they say they are so they can learn and figure out what feels right. If you never let them live as non-binary how are they supposed to figure out that feels wrong if they’re actually cis? Or a boy? Or something else?
Thank you SO much from the bottom of my heart. I have read all your posts and threads and dont even have words for how grateful I am 🙏🙏 I've changed my mind on the binders and giving my husband some reading to do. Thank you for being such a kind and caring human ❤
The BBC also has a great podcast called NB that I found really validating!
I am 25, so relatively young. I have grown up in a relatively liberal, openly gay and trans place. I came out as trans at 22 and even though I “pass” as the gender I transitioned to, it has NEVER been cool or fun to be openly trans. I mean it’s nice to feel like myself and sometimes that’s cool. But society as a whole is definitely not accepting and I think even a 10 year old would pick up on that.
Thank you so much for your comment. We are both in research mode! Thank you for introducing me to Jeffrey marsh and Alok! I have been watching all the videos and ordered Aloks book off amazon. I am so grateful that such amazing humans exist! ❤❤
The shtick about ""glamorizing LGBTQ"" is often rooted in the idea of the""gay recruitment"" conspiracy. 

Basically, the accusation thrown at queer rights activists is that they where trying to lure children into the ""homosexual lifestyle"" by ""glamorizing"" it.

Tale as old as time...song as old as rhyme...
Exactly! 
If you don't give your child a binder (which, as stated above is very very safe!!) they will resort to an alternative that is easier to obtain, such as bandages, but it is also more dangerous
Oh my goodness Cosmo, you are wise beyond your years! You give me hope! Thank you so much for your comment and great links. I am doing all the research I can and have changed my mind about the binders. Thank you from the bottom of my heart for your great advice ❤
Yes! I would say the fact that improper binding can be dangerous is all the more reason it's so important for them to have a supportive adult in their life who will help them find a way to do it safely and comfortably! Binding is only dangerous when ppl feel backed into a corner and have to improvise.
It’s also better because it makes it clear that it’s important and worth spending time/money on. It celebrates them for who they are rather than just feeling like it’s “permitted” for them to be non-binary.
Thank you so much for your comment. I have changed my mind on the binders and am looking for a customized one. Thank you for the information and giving me a good place to look for the right one!
Exactly! There are even guidelines for safe binding. No more than 8-10 hours a day, take breaks, don’t sleep in it, etc, and you’re good.
Under the guidance of a pediatrician — i don't see why not
Thank you so much. I hadn't considered puberty blockers. Your comment and the one above inspired me to do some research and I am trying to get my kid into a pediatric obgyn who has experience treating trans and LGBTQ patients. 
(I also changed my mind about the binders 😉)
Thank you. This is something I hadn't considered. Your comment inspired me to do some research and I found a pediatric obgyn who has experience with treating trans patients in my area. I am waiting for a referral to be able to get my kid in to see them. I find it a bit frustrating that her current pediatrician never brought this up despite problems she has had due to heavy periods, etc.
Yeah. That's what I'm thinking, too. Ten really is on the early side for puberty; if I were their parent, I'd be seriously considering blockers just for that reason, to keep them from developing while all their peers still look like little children--to give them some time to be a child before they start looking like a grown-up. Ten might not be so young that puberty blockers are actually indicated for precocious puberty alone, but it IS on the young side. With both those factors there, it might be worth thinking about. They might already be so far into puberty that it wouldn't do much--but you won't know that unless you find a doctor and talk about it.

That said,young AFABs are not in nearly as much of a hurry to get on blockers as AMABs are, all things considered, because it's pretty easy to get a chest reduction later on if you need it, and everything else will change with hormones. But your kid isn't going to be thinking about that kind of thing for years yet, probably not until they're an adult. A binder, and maybe hormone blockers depending on just how early puberty is affecting them, is plenty.
Thank you for sharing your story with me. You are so very right. This is some of the best parenting advice ever. I am so sorry for how you were treated, I can't imagine how that felt and still feels now. I want you to know you really helped me with sharing this. I hope your future is the brightest, whether or not you have contact with your parents. ❤
Thank you so much for your comment. You are absolutely right and I changed my mind about the binders. I am searching for the right company that can make a custom one for them, hopefully in time for back to school!
I’d also like to add that saying that your child is supposedly being influenced by the presence of queer kids in school and almost being concearned about it is a little weird because queerness is natural and it’s human, also I don’t see parents worrying about their children’s gender and orientation nearly as much when they say they’re straight and cisgender, just a thought…
Thank you so much for your comment. I am looking into getting a custom binder for them and hopefully seeing a new doctor soon to discuss options like puberty blockers. So much great advice here. 

I really aim to be that 100% safe space for my kid. I'd like to think every parent does. Thank you for your insight and thoughtful comment! I just got some of the best parenting advice ever. ❤
If you do decide to let your kiddo wear trans tape or binders, I’ll leave a few links of brands that are generally well liked by trans and NB people. Another person left different resources that you should check out.

Also, DO NOT buy a binder from Amazon. They aren’t safe. The trans tape from them is fine.
also, pat yourself on the back. Your kid telling you their identity means they really truly trust you and feel safe telling you deep, meaningful things they know about themself. You seem like a lovely parent.
Binders are fine at any age. You just are only supposed to wear them 6-7 hours a day if you’re under 15
You get a greater number when enby kids like mine and other LGBTQ kids are pulled from the crap public school system where they're bullied, or here in Florida treated like the government wants to eradicate them from existence, and placed somewhere safe. Personally, mine homeschools.
If there are so many lgbtq kids in this school is probably because they know it's a safe school and all go there, not because they are pretending... I mean, each school does not have a diversity in gender, sexual identity or even race or social classes that parallels society perfectly! Usually in ""good schools"" you have higher classes, and ""bad schools"" you have lower classes for exemple.
So much this. Free award went to you because I *really* like your addendum to this other person's post.
Thank you. I will keep this in mind as an enby who wants to give binding a try.
I'm so glad I could help! I wish you and your family the best of luck on this journey. And remember we're here for support when you need us :)

Is this the guidelines for people still developing, or for adults done developing?
and don't exercise in binders \^\^
Yes! Please talk to a doctor before hand to see what can be done.
Oh yeah, depending on how far along they are in puberty, blockers can be a great choice to give them time to figure things out for sure. If it turns out they really are a girl, then they stop the blockers and puberty resumes, no harm no foul. If they turn out to be a man, then they switch to male-based HRT (testosterone, aka T) once they are mentally ready for it and their doctors determine they’re physically ready for it. And if they’re nonbinary, they consult with their doctor on just how femme or masc they want to be, and figure out the right hormonal balance for that.
Adult height and hip width are also things that are impacted by going through estrogen-dominant puberty and are not undone by later HRT.
Thank you, again, for being the kind of parent to hear that comment. It made *me* feel better about my own life just to read about a parent who's genuinely invested in their child's peace. I wish you and your baby the richest, most rewarding relationship.
Of course, you seem like a great parent who loves this child so I’m sure it’s going to be ok, you’re doing really good.

I don’t know where you’re from but if there is an LGBTQ+ center in your area, or even a Trans center (which would be even better), I strongly recommend reaching out because they could guide you through the whole process and help you find trans friendly healthcare professionals (endocrinologists, therapists etc). They might even have support groups for both parents of trans kids and even for the children who would like to make some new friends who share their experiences. 

Good luck, I really wish you and your child all the best, if you need anything we’re always here, happy to help :)

Edit: if you’re interested, you can go [here](https://www.wpath.org/member/search) to look for trans friendly healthcare professionals in your area. Also go through the site because it’s really useful, especially read the standards of care if you want to have a better understanding of how transitioning works; by the end of this year they’ll also update the document and include some chapters specifically about non binary people.
I’ve seen some evidence that they can possibly impair rib growth if worn for too long, and sports bras don’t do that. For a child that young, I’d personally go with the guaranteed safe option (there are even compression bras designed to flatten the chest) but I fully understand why someone else would feel differently. I just think a kid might not understand how important it is to bind safely. If it’s every day, sports bra, some days, binder, imo.
Hun, the thread is like early half a year old. Get a hobby or something.
Both, I’d even say 6-7 hours for youngn’s under 15, and absolutely no exercising in it
That's true. But hip width is skeletal hip width; the fat padding changes nicely with hormones, and it's pretty hard to tell the difference. And height--well, yes, that's true; but if they've already had their growth spurt--which usually happens earlier than the first period--then that's unfortunately water under the bridge already. A doctor could tell; on an X-ray you can tell if the growth plates have closed.
The kiddo should definitely be educated about the risks but imao there are also risks to them being left to suffer through dysphoria

that’s true! Just my opinion."	wihhh4	NonBinary	634	0.99	2022-08-07 14:50:49
Lost a job opportunity due to my pronouns	"Hi! so i'm not really sure if anyone here will have insight or suggestions for me but im open to everything. i had an interview at a local, family owned record shop that went extremely well. the owner admitted i was perfect for the job and that i would really benefit the shop. for the next week, almost every day, the owner and his wife made it very clear they wanted me on the team as soon as they could, and that they were excited to work with me. 
 
that is until one day he asked to see my social medias since i would be doing a lot of social media work, photography and marketing for him. my pronouns (she/they) are in my instagram bio which he saw. he said he needed to call and talk to me about a few things. he asked ""so i saw you had these pronouns, what's with that... what are your opinions on them?"" i gave a simple answer along the lines of, ""oh well it's not something too important, usually people im close with can decide how they'd like to refer to me"" he continued to say how sensitive society is and how he doesn't want to get in trouble for calling me a she. i kinda laughed it off and he ended the call saying he would keep in touch and suddenly sounding skeptical about hiring me. 

a week has passed and he let me know i didn't get the job because another employee asked for more hours. my brother thinks that's a complete lie and that i should consider it gender discrimination. i'm not really sure what i can do other than just be frustrated. if you have any advice or support it's appreciated."	"The most sensitive people complain about society being sensitive. This is abhorrent. Sorry it happened to you :(
the acceptable answers to an employer asking “can i see your social media?” are “i dont have social media” or “no.”
Hi. Please reach out to a legal local aide. 

You were openly discriminated for your gender and orientation. Never share your socials with an employer unless you signed anything stating you have to own the job.

A job discrimination complaint may be filed by mail or in person at the nearest EEOC office. You can find the closest EEOC office by calling the EEOC at 1-800-669-4000, or by going to the EEOC's Field Office List and Jurisdiction Map and selecting the office closest to you.

Queer people are a protected class so you have a case.
I dont know If you can do something (depends on the law) but I am certain that your Brother is right.
Funny the owner didn’t hire you because he was afraid of liability for possibly misgendering you, yet he likely actually discriminated against you by not hiring you. It’s probably a long shot to prove discrimination, depending on the evidence you have available, but you can consult your local ACLU office. If they can’t help you, always ask if you have a cause of action and can they suggest someone who can help.
I know it's frustrating losing a job opportunity, but if the owner reacted like that, you definitely dodged a bullet. He sounds like he would have been a bad manager or a nightmare to work with if he's worried about people being ""too sensitive"". If he were a stronger manager he would have read up on how to work with people with different pronouns, confronted any biases he could have, and hired you.
Being afraid of getting in trouble for calling someone “she” when she has made it explicit that it’s OK 😐

But in a way, he was right about society being sensitive.
I’m sorry this happened and I have been in a similar situation. Unfortunately, I believe it’s hard to pursue legal action bc he technically is not your “employer”. 

However, I think leaving a review on yelp, google, etc. will make an impact and effect his business accordingly. 

Keep being you and know that you are worth way more then this job and the owners’ ignorant opinion. 💙💚💖
your brother is absolutely right and I'd say the same thing if I were him.  Unfortunately, there isn't much you can do. That definitely sucks and I'm sorry you had to go through that
this is absolutely terrible and i’m sorry this happened. what a fucking dolt. your pronouns are she/they and he’s worried about getting in trouble for calling you “she”… literally one of your accepted pronouns?! wtaf

on top of that though it was completely unprofessional for him to ask to see your social media. imo that was a HUGE invasion of your privacy and he had absolutely no right to ask you that. what kind of record shop clerk is also the social media manager for the business…? was that even in the description of the job you applied to? did he always expect you to be their social media rep or what? and besides that, he should have a brand account for you to use for that, not your personal accounts… something seems very weird about this and i genuinely believe you dodged a huge bullet.

leave the worst review you possibly can and report the business for gender discrimination.
Flip it around: they lost an opportunity to work with a great team member because they were disrespectful.
If that's all of the context. Then I feel it's not enough to file for gender discrimination. Regardless, you're probably better off not working there if the owner is like that. You don't want to be in a toxic workplace. Trust me hun.
If you are in a country with an equal employment opportunities committee or something of the like, I don’t see the harm in notifying them of what happened.

At least it will be on record, and if others follow suit, there may very well be a pattern that may as well confirm what happened.
He... said he didn't want to get in trouble for calling you ""she""... when you say right there in your bio that you use she and they? Like... you're cool with she pronouns and wouldn't get upset if he used them, but he was being an idiot about it anyway? God, what cis nonsense is this lmao. Sorry you had to go through that, but it sounds like you dodged a bullet working for a douche like that.
So sorry that happened to you. Although you can't say definitively that is why they didn't hire you, it is not debatable that his questions and comments were inappropriate and transphobic.  Writing a review is a good way to let folks know that this organization may not a safe space.   
In your job search, try to look for companies that have publicly stated diversity and inclusion statements on their website and when you apply let them know that YOU chose THEM for this reason. Good luck on your search.
Please consider reporting them to the better business bureau! That's definitely workplace discrimination.
Think of it this way- if you were a cis woman and the guy had said ""I don't want to hire you because I'm afraid I'll get in trouble for harassing you"" what would you think? I'd think 1) you dodged a bullet, and 2) that's absolutely gender discrimination. Your brother is completely right.
I think you’d be hard pushed to prove this was the reason you didn’t get a job but it sounds like it almost certainly was the reason. My boss openly says that he bins any CV’s with pronouns mentioned, I think it’s depressingly common.
Ughhhhhhhh if there's any silver lining, you dodged a bullet not having to work with this asshole. There are legal aid places that do a free consults with employment lawyers if you want to look into that because yes, this is obviously discriminatory
Ugh I'm not excited for this. 

My last job was at a queer-friendly dispensary, but my assistant manager decided to flirt with me. I actually ended up liking her, and it sounded like she was going to wait for me to find a new job so we could date. Instead, she got back with someone she was seeing before and essentially tried to ghost me. And because that really hurt me and she refused to communicate, I decided that I couldn't do anymore shifts with her. So they fired me.

If I didn't have luck in a queer-positive environment...idk what the fuck I'm supposed to do. For now I'm just going to take out a student loan.
This is arguably illegal depending on where you live and you may be able to sue. You should not be discriminated against for having words in your social media bio.
Personally, I begin my resume with my legal name, followed by my preferred name and pronouns (they/them). It may hurt the rate at finding a job especially depending on area, but ultimately if they see my pronouns in my resume and decide not to interview me based on that, then that isn't a place I would've wanted to work anyways.
They violated your rights under the Fair Employment and Housing Act (FEHA).

Please contact your state’s Department of Fair Employment and Housing. You can find that info if you search online. I’d be happy to help if you need it.
Depending on where you live this could be a human rights complaint. In Canada, gender identity and expression are protected grounds and I think especially if you have emails back and forth you could have the basis of a case… but idk about other parts of the world
I also think i once got refused because i picket other on an ""anonymous"" form
1) The manager is rubbish and it's probably good that you don't work for them
2) That's a clear discrimination that worth reporting
3) Don't give employers social media
I’d sue
I've had a similar experience as a trans male /nonbinary individual.  They seem fine until they realize I'm transitioning or ""have pronouns"".  Then all of a sudden they become unsure and/or awkward
Kinda hope to hear an update about this after filing a discrimination complaint. Tho that may take a really long time.
Report them to someone. That's definitely  illegal.
bullet dodged imo, also depending on where you live I'm pretty sure that is illegal and I would recommend that you seek legal advice from a professional (if you can of course), Good luck in the future :)
I lost my job at a gas station for this exact reason, been looking for another job ever since
Well it’s 100% gender discrimination, but, at least you can be glad you dodged that bullet before it was too late! That is the positive sode of this. You will not be working eith those transphobes😌

There will be another job opppirtunity that will be even better soon, you see! You’ll get your dreamjob. This wasn’t meant to be
You will get there and find a place that appreciates you for who you really are. 

I thought it would be so much harder to get a job after coming out and changing my pronouns. But I just got my dream job - better than I ever thought possible, and they respect my pronouns and my identity! You will find the right place too, it’ll just take time and energy and maybe a LOT of applications and interviews.
Let us know how it goes if you can. Good luck.
no one wants to hire people that will end up suing the company because the minute they see pronouns they know ""this is trouble, its a liberal""
this. they call us sensitive for having pronouns, as if everyone (spare for those who actually do not use pronouns) has pronouns. they really get pressed over how someone is called and think they arent the sensitive ones.
Seriously. My private social media account is none of their business. I don't care if managing their social media is part of the job, my private life and everything to do with it is none of their business. 

And I won't add co-workers to it either... unless they genuinely transition out of the work-friends zone and into friend-friends, they aren't worth it. I have seen people suffer because they didn't keep those boundaries firm. You never know what some work only acquaintance is going to take offense to and get you in trouble with your boss by using something on your private social media accounts.
Yeah employers wanting to see the social media of their employees is pretty invasive. Like I'm not showing them my Facebook or god forbid my other reddit account, like that's none of their bloody business!
in hindsight i 100% wish i had just said no. i just didn't think much of it because my socials are mostly a place for me to share my photography, and that's something he liked on my resume. i thought he'd just be interested in seeing more of my work
Came here to say something like this. You have a pretty good case between asking to see your social media and the comment about ""getting in trouble"". I'm so sorry this happened to you. This is clean cut discrimination.
this needs to be the top answer.
100% this. What that business owner did is discrimination and definitely illegal. Report it.
thank you for agreeing with him and taking the time to read through. my brother suggested that i leave a google review to share my experience and recommend other lgbt+ friendly options in the area, in hopes to deter people from shopping there.
I mean normally it'd be harder to prove but there's a clear demarcation - OP was the stated chosen candidate, then there was a phone call to specifically ask about their pronouns, followed by a retraction of interest. The timing makes it incredibly sus even if they tried to CYA by claiming that another EE had asked for more hours. Especially if OP contacts the EEOC and it opens an investigation, I doubt these assholes have the forethought to *not* hire anyone else to support their story re not needing to hire another person bc an existing EE requested more hours, and if they moved forward with another candidate or have no evidence of the supposed request for more hours that makes it pretty clear that it was just an excuse. 

OP - I would encourage you to contact the EEOC about this.
she never signed a contract, so technically there's nothing on paper. Also how can ""misgendering you"" happen since he said ""afraid of misgendering you"". The court would side with employer knowing the pronoun person will just bring havok to the workplace. This is why I removed all my pronouns from all social media - I don""t want employers to think a blue haired leftists commie soyboi
I definitely dodged a bullet, but i had quit my previous job assuming i had this one (i had to quit anyways due to hostile environment) but i guess that just makes it more frustrating. im definitely looking into businesses that openly accepting and lgbtq+ friendly now :)
Fucc society
To clarify, an employer doesn't have to be *your* employer to commit employment discrimination against you. Employment discrimination laws apply to the entire process, including recruiting and hiring, and being passed over for a job bc of a protected characteristic is actionable employment discrimination.

But that's a whole Process and leaving reviews will be much more immediately satisfying, so.
i agree, my brother suggested leaving reviews as well, and i think that's my best option considering effort and outcome. 

and thank you, im looking for jobs now that are openly lgbtq+ friendly, so i do have the ability to keep being myself :)
since he's a smaller business with limited staffing i didn't think that much of it, he was going to allow me to do a lot of my work from home, mostly coming in when i needed to film more content, then going home to edit and post on his shops account. i definitely should have been more skeptical when letting him see my accounts, i just didn't think too much of it because my accounts are a mix of person stuff and all of my photography and video work, so i figured he wanted to see that. and i agree it's absolutely stupid for him to be worried about calling me she when that's one of my pronouns. i present feminine majority of the time, and clearly he didn't think anything different during the interview
thank you so much, you are so kind
no i agree, there's not enough proof or evidence for legal action, it's just frustrating because i quit my previous job, thinking i had this one pretty secure (i had to quit due to hostile environment anyways though)
oh wow you worded this really well thank you so much, i really appreciate the support. my parents haven't thought much of the situation because they don't really believe ""the non binary thing"" is actually like legitimate (im doing my best to help them understand), so maybe explaining it like you've said would maybe help them support me as well
if it makes you feel any better, my previous job was also queer friendly, but i had to quit because it was an extremely hostile work environment. 

but i have since been looking and interviewing at more queer friendly businesses here, and some have seemed really nice, accommodating, and super accepting! i tried looking for places where the staff seemed really comfortable being expressive in the workplace, and so far it has been going well!

don't feel like all hope is lost, some businesses and managers will be better than others, we just have to seek out the good ones :))
My previous manager actually sought out my FB based on my name. I only post Halloween stuff on there anyway, but it's a common thing. Managers want to know if you're a responsible person. I don't know how I feel about it. On one hand it's creepy, but on the other you're posting it publicly. (I wouldn't show an employer my Reddit though, that's the more personal stuff.)
Don’t feel bad about sharing your pronouns! If you wanted the job, then yeah in hindsight it was a bad idea to share them, but honestly do you want a job working for people who don’t respect you enough to refer to you the way you’ve asked? If someone can’t be bothered to use something as basic as someone’s pronouns they wouldn’t respect your time, mental health, financial obligations or anything else. Sucks that you lost a job opportunity but I’d see it as dodging a bullet in a way
I love the review idea. Probably the most pay off in terms of effort/result.
thank you, i wasn't sure if there was much i could do, but i think you're right and it'll be worth contacting someone in my state. i really appreciate it thank you.
The company must have at least 15 employees for the EEOC to have jurisdiction. That’s why I referred OP to the ACLU. This is potentially a case under Bostock and the ACLU can best make an assessment of the actual evidence and refer OP to the correct entity or take the case itself if there is a cause of action. 
I don’t disagree with your general assessment, but whether this case is clear depends on the actual evidence admissible under the Federal Rules of Evidence.
I know we are strangers, but if you need a convincing reference feel free to DM me. I have had management positions before and can make a convincing case if you don't have any references.
>my accounts are a mix of personal stuff and all my photography and video work

oh no no no… ok, well this is your sign to create a seperate portfolio account for your art. i’m sorry no one told you this sooner but it really isn’t the best idea to have your personal and professional/hobby/portfolio accounts be the same. pretty much for this reason, to keep your personal life private and personal.

i’d strongly recommend keeping those things separate. keeps you safer online and apparently will keep you safe irl too. 

but to be clear what happened isn’t your fault at all, bc you’d still have your pronouns on any alt portfolio account anyways 😂 but it helps keep other more personal things away from employers, since they have no right to know anything beyond your name age pronouns and what your capabilities are anyway
I’m personally completely against it. 

I mean, just because something is available to you, doesn’t mean you have no boundaries to pursue it. What I mean is, even if your BFF leaves their journal wide open in front of you, you wouldn’t take that as an okay to read it, right? I feel like boss asking for your Facebook is like my parents actively seeking out my social media (I’m an adult), I’d be weirded out. 

I understand bosses wanting to more if you’re responsible, but that’s what working hours are for. My boss doesn’t come and check if I did my laundry or paid my rent, so why should they be able to check what I do online? I can be the most irresponsible person ever after 5pm so long as I do what I’m paid to do before it
That’s why I keep any account with my full real name on it locked up like Knox. Sure, my employer could find my Facebook. But they’re not gonna see anything other than my name and PFP
definitely a dodged bullet just really irritating where i hadn't made a big deal about it before, he just saw the pronouns in my bio. she is one of my accepted pronouns and that's how i am typically presenting and received, so i truly just don't get all the fuss. but again, i dodged a bullet, and can now seek out places that will be accepting
I agree, but mostly because I love the idea of ahole business gets reputation destroyed on social media after discriminating against a perspective employee being hired to handle their social media. Poetic justice ftw.
yea i knew the day would come when i would have to separate my accounts, it was just easier at the time to keep it in one because a lot of people i went to school with, became my clients. it was easy for them to just go to the account they'd always recognized as mine and email or send a message from there. i don't post a ton of personal stuff anyways, just pictures from concerts or dates with my partner usually, but i think you're right and it's more than enough to constitute another account. thank you for the suggestion and the time, it's a really frustrating situation and it's nice to have the support :)

(Any Pronouns) For all the kids who called me gay for liking pink in school... Yeah you were right, and it's pretty fun		"this color looks amaaazing on you
Aaah you look so good! Great makeup!
ah 2004 in a small town high school in a redneck area.  
Pink wasnt the girly color, the real men wear pink shirts were popular.  
But fuck me sideways for liking sunflower yellow and purple (not together, i am not a monster)  
3 years later, i see pictures of that classes grad (Cause i had moved, but still had a friend there.)  


Every single guy had either a purple/lavender shirt or tie at the grad party, and the fucking color theme picked by the class was fucking sunflowers. FFS I AM NOT SALTY AT ALL....  


Also cute...your cute. thanks for being you!
Now I'm jealous,

I wish I could do makeup that well

(◕︿◕✿)
you look amazing! makeup, outfit, eyes...chef's kiss!
jealous of that eyeliner!! damn! you look fabulous!
love the eyeliner 💖
Damn, I wish I could do my makeup that good, you look fabolous mate!
:0

I absolutely adore the pink eyeshadow mixed with the sparrow-like eye shadow look! I envy you for having the freedom to do this lol, you look amazing :)
[deleted]
How do you find using any pronouns? I'm agender and when I initially came out I chose they/them but I had multiple uncomfortable situations where people appologised to me for using my old pronouns even though I didnt notice and don't really care. I tried to move to using any pronouns but I found it easier to just say they/them than get into a conversation about pronouns every time.

Would appreciate your thoughts and experience with this.

P.S. looking damn fine, I probably should have said that first because DAMN those are some great eyes!
PURRR AND THATS ONN PERIODTT
Thank you! I really liked it
Thank you! 🥰
Sunflower is a tall, erect, herbaceous annual plant belonging to the family of Asteraceae, in the genus, Helianthus. Its botanical name is Helianthus annuus. It is native to Middle American region from where it spread as an important commercial crop all over the world through the European explorers. Today, Russian Union, China, USA, and Argentina are the leading producers of sunflower crop.
Yeah I was in highschool post ""Tough Guys Wear Pink"" so it once again became an outlier. These fads are tough to handle. 

And thank you for the kind words!
Practice makes perfect!
🥰🥰
That was attempt number like, 50 so don't be too jealous 😂
Thank you 😘
Practice makes perfect! Thank you!
Thank you so much! Hopefully you'll get that freedom yourself!
Not really no
I just don't really correct people too much, I sort of take what I get, and if they apologize I just say like ""oh no worries, I'm good with whatever"". 

Although I'm thinking of going more femme across the board, maybe doing HRT, so I might swap to she/they in the future. 

And also thank you 😘
still amazing ;) also love the pink!"	rpqfb4	NonBinary	612	1.0	2021-12-27 15:54:04
Can I be NB if I only use he/him pronouns?		"What are we, the gender police? Do whatever you want
'Can I be NB if' 

Yes
Pronouns ≠ gender
nonbinary people don’t need to do anything besides simply be nonbinary. use whatever pronouns you feel comfortable with :)
yeah, of course, I'm not gonna stop you.
Ye, hello fellow he/him enby
Pronouns are part of gender expression. It’s how we present ourselves in the same way we choose what clothes we wear, our haircut, jewelry, makeup, etc. that’s why cis people sometimes use they/them pronouns, neo pronouns, or pronouns you’d normally see associated with the opposite gender (e.g. a cis girl using he/they pronouns or she/he or whatever). Gender expression is how we express our gender identity and there is no right or wrong way to do that.
What am I gonna do? Call the fucking cops?
who cares, gender is fake and reality is subjective, have fun
Absolutely! Being NB doesn’t mean you have to use specific pronouns. You can use any that you like!
I'm almost 80% sure I'm nb and I use she/her pronouns. Mostly because my language doesn't have they/them pronouns but shush
You don't need our permission, we're just a bunch of strangers. Do what you want and if anyone has a problem with it, who cares? It's none of their business.
Yes
Well actually if you’re nonbinary you hav…YES, YES YOU CAN what pronouns you use don’t determine your gender identity.
Yeah! :DD

I’m nonbinary & I only use she/her
Absolutely dawg, pronouns don’t equal gender 🥰
Short Answer: Yes.

Long Answer: ""Non-Binary"" Is Not Really A Gender In Itself, But Encompasses A Near-Endless Amount Of Genders And Gender-Identities, Literally Anything Other Than The Simple ""Male"" And ""Female"", And Additionally, While They Are Associated, Pronouns Are Not Directly Linked To Gender, So There Are Any Number Of Reasons You Could Be Non-Binary And Want To Go By Just He/Him Pronouns (The Same For She/Her, Although That's Obviously Not The Case For You), And You'd Be Far From The Only One.
why not?
Yes
yes
Yup, remember gender ≠ pronouns
use whatever pronouns make you happy
yes! i'm nb and i really only use she/her pronouns. it's just whatever you feel like
I used He/Him pronouns initally after coming out openly as non-binary, before transitioning to a phase where I'm open to all of them, so you absoutely could use them.
you can literally do whatever you want, you don’t need permission from us or anyone else to express yourself the way you want
I’m non-binary and use they/he :) Ofc you can
Yes of corse, Pronouns don’t equal gender.
Of course. There is no right or wrong way to be nonbinary. 

Don't let gatekeepers hold you back from being authentically you. 

You are valid, no matter what.
i mostly use she/her pronouns and I present feminine most of the time (i may act a bit tomboyish but otherwise) and I ID as nonbinary
Yes! Non binary mean out of the binary, which can mean litterally any combination of gender, pronouns and appearance. If any one tries to add boxes and rules for non binary then they suck
I have an enby character that mostly uses he/him pronouns. On top of that, he is amab and looks pretty masc. If anyone saw this guy (discounting the fae stuff) they'd just think ""normal cis guy"" but he is very much nonbinary. He looks, acts, and talks masc but his gender isn't. He isn't bothered by other's assumptions (mostly bc he's fae and doesn't really understand gender) and is unapologetically himself

I'm nonbinary like most of my characters. I use it/they mostly. I want an androgynous appearance. But Kaid (my he/him character) is just as nonbinary as myself, just in a different way. If i met someone similar to Kaid, I'd think them just as valid as myself

All this to say, you're nonbinary if you say you are, no matter your pronouns or expression. You are the one who knows your gender best, you decide how to label it
Yes
yes
It called a Character Creation screen, and you've unlocked it!
Do you identify as only male or only female? If not, then the answer is you are 1000% NB. 



If the answer is yes, it requires deeper probing on your part to figure out. 



Nonbinary just means that you identify as something outside the gender binary of male & female. Think of it as an umbrella that a bunch of genders is under. 


I am Nonbinary, genderfluid, genderfaer, and something else that I am still coming to understand. I chose to use they/them because that fits me, but for family who are struggling to adjust I use she/her due to them have a hard time with they/them. Someone else in my situation may only use she/her (genderfaer if fluid but never fully male) or some form of neopronouns.
Labels exist to help you and those around you- the only requirement to use one is feeling that it's useful for explaining your Identity.
Of course, no pronouns are more NB than others
Whatever you feel comfortable. For me, I don't get bothered which pronoun someone uses. I am easy come easy go. I wouldn't even want to choose a pronoun because what people choose to use at that instance is part of a feedback loop for me. There were occasions where someone used 3 different pronouns during a conversation. Sometime my friends use different gender words etc during a talk. I don't mind. Similarly if you are comfortable with one, go ahead, it is just a word choice, doesn't indicate how you feel.
Yep
Yeah! I do too
Of course! I'm nonbinary but grammatically I absolutely hate the idea of going by they/them (more power to nonbinaries who do choose those pronouns though) and honestly he/him feels more neutral to me and doesn't make me think about my gender
They/thems can be cisgender, too!
There’s no rules. YOLO
Absolutely.

To be real with you, you can be any gender you want and choose whatever pronouns make you most comfortable.

For example, I identify at genderfluid, and for l a long time I'd say my pronouns were he/she/they.

But over time I began to realize that being called ""she"" caused me a lot of dysphoria and distress.

It took me way longer to realize that I can enjoy doing and wearing stereotypically ""feminine"" things without actually identifying as a she/her.

Long story short – your pronouns, your rules.
Yes! You can use whatever pronouns you want. There isn't one way of being non-binary. You can use he/him. He/they. He/they/she/it. Any pronoun, or even neopronouns like xe/xer. The world is your oyster. 

There are non-binary men and demiboys. There are cis woman who use he/him. Gender is a spectrum. Pronouns do not dictate your gender and your gender doesn't dictate your pronouns. 

A pronoun should make you happy and comfortable. If a pronoun doesn't bring you joy, then why use it? If using he/him makes you happy then use he/him. Live your truth and don't let people stop you.
yes, shut up. “can i be enby-“ yes. yes you are. you are nb
Sure man
Where's tate when you need him
You can be NB under whatever conditions / questions you can throw at it, you've got this, sweetheart 💋
Yes
Yes you can. Absolutely.
Yes
Of course you can!
do whatever makes you confortable
Of fucking course you can! Pronouns don't equal gender. (:
Of course!
Yes.
just be who u are mate 👍
Yeah! One is how you want to be addressed as and the other how you feel and identity... No one is gonna come out and be like ""STOP! Show us your gender and pronouns card!"" (Well, maybe TERFS but they don't play)
Like you would tell people specifically *not* to use gender neutral pronouns? Or you would just be alright with either male or neutral?
I'm amab and use he/him. I also don't mind being called a guy or man etc. The way I see it in a male and I am happy with my body the way it is, but I'm not a male and while I may be masculine (in some ways IG?) I'm not actually a man. Even trying to explain it makes me feel a little illegitimate haha. But I'm nonbinary and that's that.
Joy of non-binary is any pronouns work and it's all up to you ^-^
Of course. I am and do.
you are NB regardless of pronouns.  pronouns ...  i just respond to her/she bc I have breasts & don't have time to explain my Self to the bank person, the xray & scrub staff, etc .  this is just me personally -  .  i would use 'it/that' hahaha you are beautiful
You know what they say, gender norms and expectations are kind of like the Queen of England
being enby differs from the ""normal"".  
what's the point in having any ""normal"" of our own?  
be as non-standard as you want about gender; if you ain't strictly a boy and you ain't strictly a girl you're one of us
Yes definitely!!!!
Yes
Sure but don’t be surprised if ppl say some shit
I am going to just start quoting tumblr when people on this sub ask ""can I do this/that/the other thing?""

You can do whatever you want forever.
You know, I was JUST talking about this. I only really use she/her pronouns, but refer to myself with almost exclusively masculine nouns like ""dude, guy, boy, man"" etc (i.e ""i'm not that guy, im just a weird lil fella, i'm definitely an ass man"" etc). Even when they're more fem associated, it's ""bitch, hoe, babe"" (i.e boss bitch, delicate hoe, badass babe) but never ""lady, girl, woman"". I don't feel like I have a box that wouldn't make the other folks in the box feel intruded upon. I'm not cis, but I'm not trans. I'm happy with how I look and don't feel like I want to transition, but sometimes present very masc as well. My friend said maybe I'm agender but sometimes I feel VERY gender. 🤷🏼 

 it's nice to feel like a space alien sometimes but sometimes it feels a little lonely I guess.
I use she/her pronouns as default because that's what I was called by for my entire life before I understood the nuances of my gender. But I don't mind being referred to as a him or they either, I'm indifferent either way.
If you feel non-binary, then you are non-binary. Pronouns and all forms of gender expression are just the tools to help you to take up space and be seen being exactly who you are (to whatever degree you feel safe/ready to do). 
Sending love !
Yes because gender ≠ pronouns
Yes. I do
I’m non-binary and use he/they pronouns but I go by only he/him in certain scenarios because it’s easier. 

Like at work I go by Mr. and only use he/him because I felt it would be easier for young children than he/they and risk someone adding in she
of course! do what feels right <3
Of course
Yes!
I mean is your gender not binary? Pronouns mean nothing really, they are just a way you feel comfortable being referred to. I mostly use he/him but I want to use others, they just don't feel natural to me as I didn't grow up around people who used like they/it pronouns. There are so many reasons why someone might use pronouns that don't perfectly describe their gender.
Of course you can
You can use any pronouns you want
Yes. Pronouns don't need to be linked to gender, you can use any pronouns.

Source: Me. Agender and exclusively use he/him pronouns.
Yup
Always. Gender is a personal thing do if he/him pronouns and the lable ""enby"" makes you happy, go with it. Anyone who says you need to be enby a certain way has a very big misunderstanding of what enby means and they need to fuck off
yes
Yeah of course you can
Of course you can!
yes
Yes ofc, just remember to get the correct permits first
I’d say, if you feel non-binary, you are. I use she/they pronouns and consider myself agender (but I’m actually still questioning and usually say I’m in the non-binary spectrum). 

The thing is, gender expression, gender identity, pronouns, and even the many types or dysphoria are all different things, and no matter what people tell you, you know what you feel about them and yourself! 💛💜
Something Vague Yet Hopefully reassuring in everything is a Spectrum. Colour, Sexuality, Gender, etc etc
Gender≠pronouns 
Use whichever you are comfortable with
I think only you get to say if you're nonbinary. We await your decision. 👀
Of course pronouns dont equal gender
Yes.
of course you can! pronouns do not equal gender
Do what you want
Yes! 
An example: Juno Steel in the Penumbra Podcast :)
yes!
yes
If you identify as nonbinary you’re nonbinary
Gender and pronouns aren’t the same thing. You can use whatever pronouns you like.

Just don’t use the NB abbreviation, that’s actually the abbreviation for Non-Black. Enby/Enbies is the more acceptable short version of non-binary.
Enbie manz r the best 😤 go for it!
Yes of course! Pronouns doesn’t have gender.
Yes, use whatever pronouns you want, or don't, it doesn't matter, people can't police your pronouns or gender
Of course, gender identity and pronouns are different, for pronouns it's what makes you most comfortable. Gender identity is an aspect of who you are. They can be connected but they are not always.
Absolutely, being nonbinary isn’t about what pronouns you use or anything like that, it’s about your own personal feelings towards and your experience with gender.
Yes
Yes, and if you identify as the gender assigned at birth but you don't conform with their role. Its called gender-non-conforming . FYI 🫶🏼✨
Pronouns don't equal gender. 


They may give insight on how the person using pronouns or no pronouns, how their experience with gender, or lack therfor is like.


Insight isn't the gender(s) or lack therfor of gender, it's just that, insight. To the complicatness that is gender and pronouns. Just 'cause you know some aspects of someone's gender or lack therfor, doesn't mean you know it. 


And sometimes pronouns can't give you insight at all into the person's gender or lack therfor. /gen

Does your language have any form of pronouns for groups of people? Also have you considered neopronouns?

Lmao, in my native language there is no ""he"" or ""she"", there is only genderless third-person pronoun, so they/them it is

The first NB one refers to non binary and the second refers to non-black. Gotcha!
according to certain definitions, everyone is non-binary
Not for me it isn’t. I prefer to just say the whole thing. “Nonbinary”. Or “unsubscribed from gender”. Or “agender”. But “enby”, while correct for you, isn’t for everyone. 

It’s impossible to navigate lol
I’ve heard people say this many times yet have never seen anyone use it that way lol. Also a lot of people (like myself) don’t like the term enby used on them. And initialisms can have multiple meanings, just use context /nm
You can't fool me! >:D I know the TRUE meaning of NB... BEHOLD

pronouns is simply how you want to be referred to. their relationship with gender, if there is one at all, is dependent on the individual, and sometimes the language, as not all languages have gendered pronouns
Like the other person said, it's how you would want to be referred to. Pronouns are a whole set of words to clarify which person is being spoken about (I, me, you, we, they, our) that are separate from the internal sense of gender that someone has. If someone prefers to be referred to with he/him pronouns, it doesn't necessarily tell you anything about that person. Although for the vast majority, it's a ""masculine"" pronoun, I also know people who love he/him pronouns that do not present in a stereotypically masculine way.
I Love How This Is The Only Reply You Made Here, As If Fear That u/Gavel_Guide Specifically Would Stop You Is All That Kept You From Doing It. I Mean I Get That It's The First Comment, But It's Still Funnier To Interpret This Way.
I don’t have much more I can think to expand upon. Like I said before pronouns are part of how we express our gender identity so should someone who is cis want to use different pronouns than what was given to them then they are more than welcome to do that. In the same way an AFAB non-binary person can use she/her, a cis guy can use she/they or whatever they feel fits because in both scenarios that’s part of their gender expression.

I am very aware of some transphobic people that jokingly say they want to use a certain pronoun set or identify as something ridiculous. Here’s how I see it. Use pronouns people ask you to use. Those that are joking and transphobic will likely ask you to stop because they are uncomfortable and those who truly use the pronouns sets they ask to use are being affirmed. Trying to decide who gets what pronouns is incredibly toxic and doesn’t do anyone (especially non-binary and gender non-conforming people) any favors.

(Also none of this is directed at you in any way. You just requested I expand upon what I said)
Not the person you're replying to, but drag queens/kings/monarchs might be a good example.
what makes them cis?
That enby named Arson 👀
Do you deliberately press the shift key at the beginning of every single word?
If you mean plural form of words then *attention* *attention* it's also gendered

Heard that there's some sort of ending that works as they/them (if i remember correctly it's ""-om""/""-um"" or something like that) but for me it looks really weird and i dislike using it. I didn't hear about neopronouns in my language (Polish) but at the same time didn't really make a research about it so I don't really know. 

Although I'm not 100% sure and if there's any other Polish person that has much more knowledge in this topic then please correct me
Which language is it???
I would play that game

The alternative I've seen is NBi to differentiate.
I see 'NB' used for nonBlack a lot. so really depends on what circles you're in and interact with
Ohhhhhh okay! Tysm this really helped 💟
I needed this today.
Right but, aren’t “non-binary”, “man”, “woman”, “enby”, etc are a way of saying your pronouns? I thought enby was they/them, NB is anything besides man/woman,  man is some variation of “he/him”, woman being a variation of “she/her”.
I have a lot of power in the enby community. I'm gonna have to take your yellow stripe just to make a point.


keep talking shit, I'll take the purple one too. fuck around and find out
Thank you for sharing! I was just curious to hear more and I appreciate you taking the time to type it all up :)
Ye, How Else Would I Type Like This?
What I was referring to is things like we, but said about a group of people you are not part of. I know some languages make verbs and regular nouns plural to indicate groups, but I don't really know the list of those.  




Neo are things like xe/xim or a whole host of things that are not traditional. I know someone who use fae/faer as pronouns as well as another who use pai/paint as pronouns.




End result, if nothing fits just make your own.
Idk if this will make any sense for your language but in Spanish when talking about a group the feminine ending is used when talking about all girls and masculine is used for all guys or a mix of guys and girls so using a logic like that I use the masculine pronouns for myself. Another option is to use a mix of both or just use she/her nothing wrong with that lol
Kyrgyz language! We only have gender neutral ""ал"" [al]

Love that 😆
croeso, happy to help!
no, very much not. I only answered their question above, and that's all I have capacity for. if you want to talk about this, you can ask in the main thread or in your own post.
Man and Woman are the nouns for those respective genders. English has pronouns for those genders as well.  


However, for non-binary, the chief point is a rejection of the binary choice between man and woman, for everyone that means a different thing. Some are still comfortable with just using pronouns that are easier or that they've grown to identify with (without identifying with the gender itself). That's why some people even say they're ok with ""any"" pronouns.  


Also to clarify, you seem to think that enby and NB are different things, but I'm under the impression they both are just shortened versions of Non-Binary (""enby"" just being the phonetically written version of NB).
Okay Okay I'll Stop I Promise, Just Please Don't Take My Purple Stripe! I Worked So Hard For That!
But why? Like that’s so much extra effort and all it does it make it harder to read and grammatically incorrect.
Neo pronouns are tricky though because they are “new” so people are scared of them and it puts a target on you so in a conservative area they put you at risk
That's exactly the case with Polish too

I tried to use the mix of both but it's a weird case (i think) cuz when I spoke with these pronouns it was fine but when someone else did it? Didn't feel right
I wasn’t being rude? I am just confused. Language is evolving quickly and I want to keep up. Not only for others sake but so that I know the proper term for myself.
Ohhh okay
i know i earned all four stripes but most days i just feel like a two-stripe enby, three at best
Makes it easier for me to read, maybe cause im dyselxic? It probably makes it easier for them to read. I like being able to easily read my own comments so I type in a way that makes sense to my eyes same as anyone else, their typing style is just a bit more unique than youd typically see. I kinda like it reminds me a bit of a character from a book (Margo Roth Speigelmen from Paper Towns to specify)
Capitalisation Isn't Part Of Grammar, It's Orthography. And While It's Not Standard (And Indeed Probably Rejected By Most Style Guides), Writing Like This Isn't ""Incorrect"" Because English Has No Governing Body, You Can Write And Speak However You Like. Ai kud wryit ít lyik þís íf ai wantíd tů, Ánd ít stíl wudn't bi ""Ínkorekt"". (""I Could Write It Like This If I Wanted To, And It Still Wouldn't Be Incorrect""), But Of Course It'd Be Silly To Do That, As People Would Have A Much Harder Time Understanding Me. But Still, I Think There's A Beauty In English's Lack Of Complete Standardisation, Although Of Course Partial Standardisation Is Essential To Allow People To, Ya Know, Communicate, Especially Across Different Dialects.
Never said they were for everyone,  just wondered if they had been looked into is all.
Yea thats fair enough I hope that new gender neutral pronouns become more popular in all of these very gendered languages but its so complicated. Its hard to change language intentionally
I didn't say you were. I'm being direct. reread my comment, please.
It makes it harder for me to read because I skim books by reading a little bit of the beginning of each sentence. So every time I see a capitalized word I instinctively skip to the next one
Funnily Enough I've Seen Some People With Dyslexia, Like You, Saying This Makes It Easier To Read, While Others Have Said This Makes It Effectively Impossible To Read.

Honestly I'm Not Sure If This Actually Makes It Easier To Read, As I Don't Tend To Read Back My Own Comments Too Often (Plus I'll Obviously Have An Easier Time Reading Them Than Someone Else's Because I'll Remember What I Wrote), And It's Not Too Common That I'll Come Across Other People Writing Like This. I Will Say In Very Long Paragraphs I Find It A Bit Troublesome To Read (As If I Don't Find Those Troublesome To Read Anyway), In The Same Way I Might Find An Insufficient Number Of Commas To Do So, Even If It's Perfectly Readable Or Even Easier To Read In Single Sentences Or Shorter Paragraphs.
Just because you can doesn’t mean you should. And remember, my argument wasn’t “you broke the rules,” it was that the way you write makes it hard to read.
Also Poland is homophobic so another problem...
I Never Claimed That I Should, Simply That It's Not Incorrect To. 

While It May Not Have Been Your Intention, I Read Your Argument As 3 Equal Parts, 1: ""That's so much extra effort"", 2: It ""[Makes] it harder to read"" , And 3: It's ""Grammatically Incorrect"".  
Based On The Fact That I Do It I Evidently Don't Care About That First Point, The Second Point Is Obviously Subjective (Different People Find Different Things Easier Or Harder To Read), So I Obviously Can't Dispute That; Just Because I Don't Find It Harder To Read Doesn't Mean You Don't Either. That Leaves The Third, The Easiest To Dispute Because, The Way I See It, It Is Factually Incorrect, Plain And Simple.
Yea I mentioned in another comment it can be dangerous to use unique pronouns in a  conservative area. Idk how much you know about the US sates but im from Texas and its very christian state and lots of people threatened me about my pronouns but no one could actually hurt me or anything over it (or no one would) at least not at the time. I moved and people are much nicer about my they/them pronouns here in Utah surprisingly.
You are addressing the points individually when they were intended to work accumulatively. It’s the combination of the extra effort with the lack of a benefit or functional purpose. 

And I deny that what you called “point 2” was entirely subjective. Whether something is easy to read is subjective, but whether this or that person finds something easier to read is an objective fact. My claim is that most people will probably find this harder to read because most people subconsciously associate capitalized words with proper nouns and the beginning of sentences. It would be like if a society of people agreed that red doors are fire escapes in a public building, but someone decided to just paint all of their doors red; it would confuse everybody.

And that brings me to your claim about “point 3.” Language doesn’t have hard and fast “rules,” but it does have conventions which exist for a reason. Now, it changes all the time because the needs of communication change all the time. But if we have a good mechanism in place, it’s not very helpful to violate it in a way that only makes makes writing less clear.
>You are addressing the points individually when they were intended to work accumulatively. It’s the combination of the extra effort with the lack of a benefit or functional purpose. 

Okay But They Don't Really Work Cumulatively If 2 Of Them Have No Affect On My Doing This. It Being Extra Effort Has No Affect On Me Doing This Regardless Of If Other People Find It Harder To Read Or Not. 

>And I deny that what you called “point 2” was entirely subjective. Whether something is easy to read is subjective, but whether this or that person finds something easier to read is an objective fact. 

That's Fair, Perhaps I Should've Phrased It As ""Varies From Person To Person"". 

>My claim is that most people will probably find this harder to read because most people subconsciously associate capitalized words with proper nouns and the beginning of sentences.

Well Neither Of Us Are Or Know Most People, So There's No Way To Tell If That's Accurate. I Will Note That Capitalisation Varies By Language (In German All Nouns Are Capitalised, In Spanish ""Proper Adjectives"" Like French Aren't Capitalised, Et Cetera), So People Who Speak Other Languages Natively Would Likely Associate Capitalised Words With Different Things. And even within English, It can vary based on Style Guidelines and the like, Or just personal preference. When not writing All-Capitalised, I like to write like this; Capitalising words after every punctuation mark, And Also capitalising what I vew to be Important Parts of the sentence, Because otherwise reading it back I'll have no flipping clue what I wrote, Which is a bit inconvenient if you ask me. 

>And that brings me to your claim about “point 3.” Language doesn’t have hard and fast “rules,” but it does have conventions which exist for a reason.

That's Fair, But Doesn't Change The Fact That It Has Nothing To Do With Grammar. Is This Just Pedantry? Yes. Do I Care? No.
But we have other conventions for emphasis like italics and underlining.
True. Which I Use For Different Things. I Suppose I Don't Often Use Underlines, But I Use Italics To Emphasise Things If I Would Actually Pronounce Them In A Certain Emphasised Way, Capitals Honestly I Don't Really Use For Emphasis, I Just Use Them To Mark What's Important (Except When Writing Like This I Suppose), Which To Me Feels Like A Different Thing."	11wn3yx	NonBinary	606	0.98	2023-03-20 16:14:35
Let's not forget that we don't need to look or dress a certain way to be Nonbinary and valid. Not only slim white AFAB presenting androgynous are Nonbinary. Being fat, wearing dresses and skirts, using She/her or he/him pronouns doesn't make you less valid.		"Thanks for saying this :)

I haven't felt valid since I realised i might be non-binary a few weeks ago since i still present as male and am too scared to come out as they/them. Seeing this makes me feel a whole lot more valid <3
So much truthness
Wearing dresses doesn't make you invalid. Being a Slytherin makes you invalid. Lol j/k.
I appreciate this. I think I’m gonna have to be female-presenting awhile longer, and needed some validation
Thank you <3

Sometimes I really need to hear this
Thank you for this. I recently started seeing a new therapist, who’s LGBT+ friendly but is really lacking on knowledge of the + communities IMO. When I told her I’d been questioning my gender (AFAB), she asked “then why do you dress like a woman?” And honestly, a lot of it comes down to aesthetics — I prefer “women’s” clothing options and aesthetics generally. Why do I have to go from living inside one very small box (the concept of “womanhood”) to another (the concept of androgyny) in order to be accepted?

I keep dwelling on my therapist’s question, and can’t help but feel some kind of way about it.
I needed this. I have a very very feminine body and it’s hard to look androgynous with a big bust.
We all going to just keep ignoring the fact that J. K. Rowling is a Terf
Thank you. I haven't changed pronouns and have been presenting AGAB lately and was feeling kinda shitty about it. We are all valid. Our gender is our own, no one else's.
THANK YOU. I am also AFAB. I have DDD boobs and some days I like flaunting my feminine side but most days I wish I was a comfortable C cup. 
Dresses and skirts are for any and all genders. This is my next step on my enby journey, is accepting that I can be feminine or masculine or whatever I please, whenever I please
It's nice to see this from a fellow Slytherin NB person

I consider myself an accepting person, but OP identifies as Slytherin. I have limits.
I'm glad I could give you a better feeling ❤️ remember no one can invalidate your identity, you're the only one to know it, completely independent from how you present 🌈
🖤💜💛🖤💜💛
Presentation isn't everything anyway. I hope you can start feeling a little better just having your NB identity! 

I have similarly only recently realized I'm nonbinary. I've started talking to my non-critical online friends about it and a couple of my closest people.  For me, it feels good just letting someone know. It's a journey of self-discovery!
I’ve been out for two years and still present very masculine. There’s no shame in it! You’re valid no matter what. That validity comes from inside :)
❤️
*hissing noises* 🐍🐍🐍
Lucky for me that I'm a Ravenclaw 😜
I wish I could look andro, but it's hard to hide my giant tits, so I usually just don't bother. No dresses for me though.
Go and rock the world ❤️
🌈❤️ Nothing can invalidate your identity
I'm living up to the mindset that nothing on earth is gendered. No clothes, no colours, no hobbies, whatsoever. Whatever someone enjoys is completely valid and fine, regardless of gender 👌
Would she question the identity of a trans woman for wearing pants and having short hair? Or a cis man who paints his nails and wears dresses? 

I hope she does her research but remember that it’s okay to fire a therapist who isn’t totally right for you. I know the process of getting a new therapist can be hell but being able to trust that person is so so important. 

It sucks to have to self advocate with people who could do better with a simple evening of google searching but you deserve quality care.
The very same here, I was also validating myself with that post haha
Jk Rowling being a TERF doesn't make the stories bad.
Wait, what? This is news to me.
> Our gender is our own, no one else's.

Thank you!!!! ❤️

Wishing you good luck with your way 🍀❤️
❤️
You always are 🌈
I have merch from like every Hogwarts house...watcha gonna do about it 😂😂
💜
thanks 💜 im defo feeling a bit better, one step closer to feeling 100% valid

for me letting my few friends know is hella scary, even though i know theyll just be like ""cool""
Caw caw! 🦅🦅
So you stole some Slytherin's shirt? That's a Slytherin move, not a Ravenclaw one.
Yes I've the same problem with my chest. But Nonbinary doesn't mean male looking or androgynous automatically, you're valid no matter what ☺️
This is my ideal tbh, but it’s so difficult to talk about anything with people still firmly rooted in a binary. It makes for a lot of erasure, at least
it has for me personally.
Very good questions, I don’t know what her take might be. I’ve only just started seeing her after my last therapist was either fired or ghosted her clients and so I’m willing to give the new therapist some grace (perhaps more than I should). However if it comes down to it I’ll simply tell her that I’m not comfortable in continuing my discussion on my gender with her and leave it at that unless she wants to know the reason why. And at some point I’ll try — again — to find a good match who takes my insurance and isn’t an hour away (hi, mental healthcare in the US is such a joke 🙃)
Not the point here. We shouldn't support people who deny we have rights.
So y'all going to just consume media by a person that thinks you don't deserve rights.
Yeah it hit me pretty hard to when I first learned about it. I was a big Harry Potter fan but just do a little bit of Googling and you can find out she follows one of Twitter's biggest Turf and husband caught interacting with other terfs online
Thank you❤️
I'd *maybe* buy you a drink and have a good time. Maybe.
 \* confused gryffin noises \*
No I got it as a gift, so I'm using it 😂
Yes I get that, it's really difficult 😅 I'm working in retail and hearing people say ""you can't have that because it's for girls/boys based on the colour or it being a car or doll"" regularly makes me angry. I tend to tell them it's bullshit 😅
Something I do to try to work around things like that is to say, as an example “clothes marketed to (women/men)” because it gets the point across while decentering the binary narrative.
If you live near any universities their psych departments sometimes offer sliding scale therapy to the public with their students in training. I’ve had four therapists at three different schools this way and it came out to about my insurance copay per session. The only real downside is they graduate out but all the ones I had were super tangible goals oriented which is great.

Otherwise, I think the important thing is being totally honest with a new therapist. 

So I’d actually advise you figure out a way to tell her about your reaction to what she said if you didn’t at the time—she can’t help you or adjust her approach if she doesn’t know there’s a problem and the worst that can happen is it becomes immediately clear she’s not right for you.

I know that can be fucking terrifying but personally therapy only started truly working for me when I worked up the courage to tell a therapist when I was anxious or concerned about the session itself. Maybe she can reassure you or ask you more about your concept of gender identity, or maybe she’ll prove to be not the right fit. 

Obviously, you need to do what’s best for you. If you need just any person to check in with even if they’re not great that’s not ideal but I think I get it.

But my best friend just today quit with their therapist after *8 months* of running into situations where it felt like the therapist wasn’t listening to them, with this woman calling them by their birth name instead of their gender neutral nickname *and* using the wrong pronouns. A lot of other non-enby related things too. My bff thought a lot of their issues with this person weren’t a big enough deal to bring up but if I’d known all this time she was using the wrong name and pronouns for my friend I would’ve told them to correct her at the least. 

You are your own best advocate and I hope whether it’s with this one or someone else down the line you get all the tools you need out of therapy. <3
No im going to consume something that helped me staying alive and accepting myself instead of drowning in self doubt and self hate and helped me making friends. Spread your mood elsewhere please :)
So this is something more than a case of ""oops I followed an idiot on twitter""?
That was not the reply I've expected 😂😂😂
I imagine griffins roar. If bravery made a sound it would be a roar. Screeching like an eagle is far too undignified for a griffin.

But I'll thank you for not roaring or screeching, I'm trying to study over here.

You liking it doesn't change the fact that it was written by a transphobe. I liked Harry Potter but now I don't cuz I don't want to consume media made by a hateful person.
Found the Ravenclaw.

And you trying to talk something bad other people like won't make them unlike it. The story isn't the author. I won't stop liking something I grew up with my entire life for things she did YEARS after the books have been published. Period. Have a nice day.
And proud!

Honestly this is a very good response and I agree but still purchasing Harry potter-themed content including clothing is still supporting a transphobe and I just see it as stupid for our community to continue supporting her
Apart from the casual fans who don't care or don't know that JKR is awful (or people that agree with her), most HP fans have essentially divorced her from the works and make it very clear that they disapprove of her.  I don't know any active HP fans that buy anything official anymore, and they all consume only fan-made works and fanfiction."	cnj3xx	NonBinary	604	0.98	2019-08-08 09:06:18

are they all the way down to your ankles or just over the knees? do they fit comfortably? I found that men's pants are difficult to find in a size that fits me cause I'm short and have wide hips.

Can we stop calling nb folks „they/thems“?	"Disclaimer: **I‘m not saying nb people shouldn‘t use they /them pronouns**, that‘s very obviously no issue.

What I mean is when people use „a they/them“ synonymously with a nb person. This happens a lot on the internet, especially tiktok. This feels weird to me for multiple reasons. It implies every non binary person uses these pronouns, even tho there‘s a multitude of enbys who don‘t, for example because their language only has binary pronouns, or they aren‘t put yet or they feel comfortable with binary pronouns. This leads to my main point: **your gender isn‘t defined through your pronoun!** so saying a person‘s a they/them implies they‘re an enby, but that doesn‘t necessarily has to be the case.

Another issue I have with it, is that it creates another expectation of what being non-binary means, further creating this thought of a third gender. And if we go on this route there‘ll be even more stereotypes and expectations for us, even tho (and I hope I‘m right here) most of us don‘t want this, and like this label because it feels more freed from stereoytypes.

Anyways, I hope my point was understandable, english isn‘t my first language. Thanks for reading."	"I don’t tend to use “they/thems” unless I’m referring to a specific type of non-binary people for a jokey jokey with other queer friends. I speak VERY carefully in non-LGBT spaces because I don’t want them getting the wrong idea.
Even being a person who is non-binary and does use they/them it's pretty uncomfortable. It feels like it is reducing my identity to my pronouns.
>your gender isn‘t defined through your pronoun!

Yes! And don't call people she/theys or he/theys either! Someone's pronoun isn't by definition their gender. 

People seem to find some joy in calling themselves they/thems or whatever, but stop using other people's pronouns to reduce them down to this gender convention!
I’ve started referring to my cis friends as my he/hims or she/hers just to highlight how weird it is
Yeah I’m nonbinary and I use she/her pronouns and the amount of confusion it causes bc everyone thinks nb=they/them is super annoying. I have my pronouns plastered all over everything and I still get people going “oh, what are your pronouns?” when they find out I’m nb bc they assume I’m going to tell them to use they/them. 

I also get people, even other trans and nb people, asking me “if you’re nb how come you use she/her?” I don’t have a f*cking reason; they’re just my pronouns okay. That’s like asking “why are you gay?” It’s just how it is. 

I see trans people on trans subs sometimes even arguing that “words have meaning” so why would you use a binary pronoun if you’re nonbinary? Why wouldn’t you want to use your pronouns to communicate your gender? Like can we *please* stop making up rules for each other. I’m just trying to live my life with minimal dysphoria thanks. 

Also saying “the they/thems” is not only an exclusive way of phrasing it, but also frankly, I think it’s dumb af to start describing nb folks by our perceived similar features/attributes when there’s already a word that includes us all without saying anything about how we present. It’s “nonbinary.” Just call us nonbinary people. It’s so easy.
It feels equivalent to the people who only refer to women and “females”
I don’t understand. Are there people on the internet calling non binary people “they/them” and like that’s how they’re referring to them? If so, w h a t?
I feel like this kind of falls under ""enby's don't owe you androgyny"". This is a neat take, and I'm glad you said it. :)
All pronouns NB here! I believe most of us are on your side of this. It's like they want to keep us trapped on one big new gender but... It's not like that at all what we want. Se might want the ""third gender"", but not to force everyone else who doesn't fit in the binary and doesn't feel comfortable by the 'third gender' or anything. We need to separate pronouns from gender.
As an nb person who doesn’t use they/them pronouns (it/he for me) this ^
i use they/them and it/it's and i freaking hate being called ""a they"" or ""a them."" 
it feels dehumanizing to me and makes me really uncomfortable. as if my entire personality and personhood is being reduced to the fact that i use nonbinary pronouns. 
it also feels patronizing and ""cutesy"", and as a 25 year old adult human i personally don't have time for that.
There was a post here the other day asking about harmful stereotypes about non binary people, and the one I mentioned was : Saying that non binary people are all the same. We are not a monolith. There are many different kinds of us.

Nor are we all they/thems. :) great post!
As a nb person, who uses they/them with a sprinkle of she/her the problem is people associating pronouns with gender. The whole point of non binary is we don't fit the gender stereotypes of today's world, it's beyond the binary. Now, nb could be anything...it could be all genders at once, no gender at all, a bit of flux between two or three genders.. literally anything!!! But for the sake of performative activism, people see it as a third gender. It makes me utterly uncomfortable seeing people use they/them for nbs who have repeatedly corrected others to use neo-pronouns too
I absolutely agree, however I’m also going to put out there that not all non-binary people like being called “enby” (myself included) for very much similar reasons. Like pronouns, it’s a weird personal thing to me—“non-binary” is an adjective describing my experience of gender, but “enby” is a noun to refer to someone of said gender. I feel like noun-ifying “non-binary” makes it seem more like a concrete third gender category rather than an umbrella term that describes an infinite amount of ways people can experience gender beyond the binary. Not sure if that makes sense.
yeah! i feel the same ‘cause i mean non binary people can have any pronouns, pronouns are just a bit of who we are
whenever my grandma messes up my pronouns, she always goes “oh yah, you’re a they/them.” it sucks, because i do go by they/them, but i am not my pronouns, they don’t define me but they are a part of me. it almost feels dehumanizing when she calls me a they/them instead of a person
As a she/her enby who hates all other pronouns (for me) THANK YOU!! I am not a they/them, I’m an enby.
Completely agree with this. I use it/they and always feel a little invalidated every time I hear that. And then cis people don’t see any other pronoun as valid for non binary people. It’s so frustrating having to constantly remind (even my queer friends) that pronouns ≠ gender! You can use she/her or he/him exclusively and still be non-binary! I really don’t get what’s so hard to understand here
like “girls, gays, and theys” is so /neg 
just stop
i fully agree, it feels so icky and i, as someone who uses they/them pronouns, feel like i’m being limited to my pronouns. it feels so erasing
100% agree, it's easier and simpler to just say 'non binary' if you are talking about non binary people. Unless a person has specified that they enjoy being referred to in that manner! I've noticed a shift away from calling people 'they/thems' which is good, but then again, I avoid tiktok so I have no clue what's happening there.
From what I know, singular they/them is used when the person gender is not known and it doesn't define any gender. Because it is gender neutral pronoun I think it is safer choice than using any of gendered pronouns like she, he. It's hard to not assume gender with pronoun.. because when you are refering to female as she/her - you kinda too assume that all girls use she/her pronouns, the same thing with male... Actually they/them should be more okay, because well, it is used when you don't know the gender, imo it is good default option for that reason.
YES EXACTLY I MADE A POST HERE A WHILE AGO ABOUT THAT
yesss, my boyfriend does this and i have trouble telling him i don’t like it lol 🥲
This makes a lot of sense and is soemthing good to keep in mind going forward.

I’m a non-binary person who uses they/them pronouns (although I don’t mind any other pronouns either) and personally don’t mind being called “a they/them” but that’s bc I do use they/them pronouns and bc personally, I don’t care. I don’t use they/them as a synonym for enby ppl tho - I moreso joke around and call myself a they/them with friends and family
and also like, “they/them” isnt a noun, its a set of pronouns
Thank you! That's a lot of assuming going on. I've only seen in come from binary people so that says a lot.
tbh my biggest gripe with people using they/them as a noun is that it sounds cringe asf lol
Yes. Yes. I agree but… SAY IT LOUDER FOR MY PARENTS IN THE BACK ROW. SCREAM IT. YELL IT LOUD FOR ALL THE IGNORANTS TO HEAR.
At my old job, someone referred to me as they in an email, my boss saw it, next day; ""omg Dallas, are you a they?"" 😔 smh
As a nonbinary person who exclusively uses neopronouns, it’s so othering to watch people refer to nonbinary folks as “a they/them.”

It reinforces the idea that pronouns = gender.
It has a similar vibe to calling women “females” for me
Both make me equally uncomfy as an afab nb person
I think it has its place in snappy catchphrases like ""femmes can be thems"" that are just trying to get a point across as quickly as possible. Otherwise, it probably shouldn't be used as a noun
Plus, some people use pronouns that aren't she/he/they. I use it/its mainly, with some neopronouns on the side for omline use.
I affectionately refer to my friend group as ""the they/thems"" in part because I'm a she/they but prefer mirror pronouns when with people who use one or the other. It helps to remind my friends how I like to be referred to. 

But I would never refer to someone I didn't know that way.
Yes so much. I like he or she but in a gender neutral way. I feel like people figured out that nonbinary people want to get they/them pronouns and thats the end of it. It’s insufficient and it’s frustrating.
Ikr, like, we’re people, we’re not just pronouns. It’s like calling men “he/hims” or calling women “she/hers”
Yeah, it’s really weird. No one would ever refer to cis women as ""she/her""s. 

The only context I would say something is for the ""they/them""s is if it was like a pronoun pin that said they/them lol
I agree, and for similar reasons I really don't like the words m'theydy or themperor, they're weird constructions and I'm not defined by my pronouns!
this is petty but i’ve started satirically saying “my she/her friend” (or he/him) to make them realize how stupid it sounds to reduce people down to their pronouns
Obviously I can’t speak for everybody, but they/them seems like a good option until corrected by another person if they prefer something else. “They” is inherently gender-neutral and can be used for anyone, it’s not something specific for enbys. Despite what a lot of people seem to think, it’s been used as a singular pronoun for many many years, decades at least, if not centuries.

I feel like they/them is less likely to cause offence than either he/him or she/her if you get it wrong. But I would like to know if other people feel differently? I’d hate to just assume what I think must be what everyone thinks.
Something my trans friends and I use is the term ""they/them-er"" because we don't necessarily identify with the term non-binary and it's just a fun, sweet little way to refer to ourselves.

I do understand what you're saying though- this just felt kind of related 🤗
I refer to myself as “a they/them” lmao and I hate when people call me an nb or enby. 🥴 I call myself a non-binary person or “a they/them”. Idk but I really don’t like nb / enby. I’d much rather be called “a they/them” by others than an nb / enby , fr.
I'm not sure if I'm even non-binary but I go by they them and I like calling myself that
As an NB I don’t see an issue with this when it’s used amongst ourselves u feel me
Well I am always happy when people don't refer to me as he/him since it shows me my gender is respected. If i wanna go by other promounce I can just tell them
Can we stop trying to enforce blanket rules over everything if you don't like it that's fine but others do, so just tell your tribe of people what your preferences are instead of trying to enforce something cross community that not everyone will agree with, tyvm
Tbh I’m cool with it. They/them is kinda like one of the main pronoun sets for enbys and it’s sort of like a nickname for them. It doesn’t inherently mean people are defining others by their pronouns when they use this. Now if they did do that AND call people “they/thems” then they need to be sorted out[especially if that’s why they do it]. It’s more of a coincidental thing imo [THIS IS ALL JUST MY OPINION]
Definitely not seeing how this is problematic.  There are bigger fish to fry.
A friend of mine put it well: ""I'm non-binary personally, but I politically align with women.""

I thought that was a great distinction. it's possible to not let gender define your identity while acknowledging the material power it holds over our everyday lives.
[removed]
I hate posts like this just saying “don’t do X” without providing any alternative.

Yes it’s not perfect. Yes single persons can have alternate preferences.
But that doesn’t invalidate the whole concept to use a gender neutral expression in English (simply because it’s an option in that language).
Your opinion is valid, but what you are asking for is not. You are entitled to feel this way, but not to impose your opinion on the rest of the world, which is what you are attempting to do. You cannot control what other people do, and frankly what other people do shouldn't bother you this much. You don't get to speak for an entire group like your opinion is fact. You are not asking nb people how they feel, you assume they agree with you. In your personal life, use the pronouns people actually want. When reading media, you cannot affect that.
They/them to me, always makes me thing of a group, as opposed to a singular. However if your nb society in general has now accepted these pronouns. As a nb I personally don't care what pronouns are used to describe me, I fully understand that some people do.
Truthfully, no, we cannot.

They are the pronouns to use when speaking of a group for starters.  The collective of trans women is a they/them even if the most common pronoun set of any individual in that group would be she/her.  They are also the *impersonal* set of pronouns used when you don't know more accurate ones.  Every other more accurate pronoun set is used by someone in the nonbinary group.  Finally, they/then is in the running for the most common set used by this group.

If speaking of a hypothetical single trans woman, supposing that she is a she is more likely to be accurate than not.  Same goes for a cis woman.  Trans and cis men are more than likely going to favor being he/him.  By the same token, speaking of a hypothetical nonbinary person is a case where *no assumption can be made*.  Being nonbinary doesn't tell us anything beyond that they do not identify as part of the gender binary.  No greater precision than they/them is possible given only ""a nonbinary person"".

It is only when we are talking about a specific nonbinary person that there is any possibility of *not* using they/them.
I don’t think nonbinary people are the ones doing this though… I’ve only seen people refer to enbys as “a they/them” when they’re intentionally being demeaning and/or invalidating
It's probably to fill the void of being able to call someone a man/woman but there not being an equivalent for non-binary people in the same way. Calling someone 'an enby' isn't really how we use that word. I don't agree with how 'a they' or 'a they/them' is used but I do understand the need for an equivalent word.
It feels about as cringey as people (usually dance mums or school run mums) referring to me as ""the mister"", usually as an unsubtle hint that vaguely male presenting people were unwelcome. Although knowing what I do know, my own discomfort was more than just that.

Bonus points for my eldest picking a fight with one of them by referring to her as ""the madam""
I actually feel validated when somebody says, “(my name) is a them.” When explaining that I’m an experience to others.
Hence why I like the sentence ""theydies and gentlethems"" (from paranormal park) yeah, they/them isn't a enby specific thing its just gender neutral.
Ugh yes I've been absolutely jumped on for saying I HATE the ""girls, gays and theys"" trend on tik tok. It's so vexxing and I'm glad nonbinary folk pretty much unanimously agree it's gross and reductionist
I agree it’s awkward for many reasons like the ones you listed and also you would walk into a room and say “hello he/hims” or “I love she/hers” it’s awkward and doesn’t work.
I’ve never used the term “they/them” to describe a non-binary person, only to describe someone’s pronouns which are they/them. To describe a non-binary person, I use the terms non-binary (obviously lol), enby, and enbies. I sometimes say stuff like “I’m a they/them pansexual” but never to describe someone else
I agree. I go w she/her or just my name.
I don't use any particular pronouns because I just don't give a shit. I'm 50 and have been called a whole lot of things in that time, much of it not very nice. So it's words...air....I am the same me that I have always been and people know me to be. All I want now is an easy life.
ok hey i'm on the spectrum and i have a hard time understanding what everyone has a problem with could you maybe explain again in less of a rant manner and with simpler terms, thank you :)
Yey, I'm not the only one have those thoughts. They/ them never quiet encapsulated it....to me I guess it is something that reflects that  dynamic oscillation of gender that's always in play.  


So I've taken to calling myself Indija-ka, with the ja and ka intended to reflect how I'm presenting myself.  


So those close to me can use one or the other to let me know how I'm coming off to them (Indika or Indija, or ja-ka, which means demon in the old tongue :P)  


I'm trialing it to ease the change, the pronoun though it's a tough one.
Am I the only one who likes this? I think it's funny and ironic. Also the people saying it, never said theyre referring to non binary people, they are referring to anyone using those pronouns. Its a queer and ironic and sarcastic use of language
Yeah.. like other people said, unless it's ina jokey manner with friends, it honestly makes me super uncomfortable.. like.. it feels very derogatory.. were humans.. not.. pronouns.. 

😤

 I use she/they/it as my pronouns and .. just dumbing people down to genetalia.. or chromosomes.. or  any of that stuff is like.. the worst thing you can do. 

 I get it if it's supposed to be in a joking manner and all that.. but if you're doing it intentionally to hurt someone..  that's a VERY bad look..  I'm tired of people who aren't trans or LGBTQ+ in some way acting like this..  when.. were more than just our biology.. and even our biology supports us.. (brain scans and how we can have more or less chromosomes, and how were formed in the womb)  like.. it just makes me so angry and stressed OUT. 😡😤
Surely you mean ""theythems"", we don't use the slash
Same. I was gonna say I refer to people as “they/thems” or “she/hers” but it’s based on their pronouns, not their genders. And it’s always a joke with people I’m close with or on my own social medias
Yeah. People REALLY hate when you ""stray outside your group"". Meaning like, they hate anything that Isint cis, straight, and  nondisabled/nonneurodivergent. I have  actual mental illnesses and am LGBTQ+, and I absolutely hate it when  my LGBTQ+ parts of me get compared to my mental illnesses, and the other way around.  And I HATE when people try to make their trauma or mental illnesses ""better"" then yours because theirs is """"worse"""" than yours in some way, and yours isin't real because you didn't suffer enough for it in their eyes. 

 It's absolutely fucking stupid.  It makes me get so stressed out and pissed. I have to continuously try to prove transphobes wrong in trans and LGBTQ+ safe spaces on yt, and it's tiring honestly, and being compared to my mental illnesses is a thing that happens a LOT.


How do these people have the energy to just throw their life away like this instead of getting help or being happy with their women life, or if they aren't happy, NOT HARASS OTHERS TO TRY AND MAKE IT BETTER, why can't they just put their frustration into something that's better? 

 UGHH
I‘m so glad you‘re saying this. As an enby who uses he/him since in my language there aren‘t established gender neutral pronouns it always makes me feel less valid, even tho I know pronouns =/= gender
i second this statement
It really comes off as what a overt transphobe would say
HAHA I hope they understand how much we hate that now.  Tbh that's honestly GREAT!
>I’m just trying to live my life with minimal dysphoria thanks.

Exactly this.
Nevermind that nonbinary can include bigender/multigender/fluid/flux and we absolutely can relate to masculine or feminine pronouns.
As a they/him, I feel all this.
omg yes i second this. i’m non-binary (?agender) and i use she/her pronouns. i used to add in they/them but decided against it since it doesn’t sound right to me, plus i’m at the point where i’m just tired of explaining pronouns to people. 

i get that people want to respect each individual’s pronouns and some really place pronouns as something important in communicating and relating to another, but for me personally i’m a person, a human being, don’t have to bring pronouns/gender onto the table whenever interaction occurs.
this, this, all of this ⬆️⬆️⬆️
Yeah I use she/they/it pronouns, and the ones I like more than others change.  I don't use they/them all the time, and it just feels .. I dunno.. kinda boxy.. thinking that all nbs are gonna have the exact same pronoun(s)?  Like.. that's not how that works lmao..? 

 

 And I totally agree, referring to peopem with pronouns, or genetalia, etc is a really shitty and dumb thing to do to people. We're more than our biology and pronouns and gender. There's more to our personalities than that..
>“words have meaning” so why would you use a binary pronoun if you’re nonbinary?

Idk, maybe because nonbinary just means you dont fit 100% into either binary gender. You can be masculine or feminine, or relate to being a boy or girl, or even be genderfluid in some way; it's stupid to reduce a gender that is defined by not being completely binary to being completely out of the binary or any binary for that.
was talking to a cis woman who was asking me questions about their nonbinary son who uses masculine pronouns, she brought this up to me. she was like ""he says he's nonbinary but uses male pronouns?"" 
the whole ""they're just words, people CHOOSE how they identify, and they CHOOSE the words"" didn't click.
it's just what feels right.
Yeah- there are people who colloquially refer to nonbinary people as ""the theys"" and also say something like ""[name] is a they/them"" and it's weird sometimes because what they actually mean is ""nonbinary""
Yes that‘s what‘s happening, people use they/them as a noun to describe enbys. It‘s happening a lot on queer tiktok and sometimes even reddit.
Thank you so much, you phrased the thoughts I have better than I ever could.
I also don’t like the term “enby” but for a different reason. I’m autistic so I have a lot of trauma with infantilism and someone calling me “enby” gives me that vibe even if they don’t mean it that way.
Damn i didn‘t think about that one and I have to let it sink in first but intuitively you make a very good point. Thanks for pointing it out.
Yes sure I get that, but that‘s not what I mean. I spoke of people who use „a they/them person“ as a synonym to „a non binary person“ which I think is not very cool.
OP is talking about people who use ""a they/them"" as a noun.  You probably wouldn't want someone to say ""I love this girl, that guy, and that they/them"".
This isn't what OP is talking about. They are talking about the phase ""a they/them"" being used as a noun that means ""a non-binary person"".
They/them is the default pronoun in english for when the speaker doesn't know the pronouns of the person they're referring to.
I've seen a few times in this thread that some non-binary people (including yourself) don't like being called enbies. I think that's fair. I can see how calling everyone under the not-binary umbrella that has some of the same problems as calling the whole group ""they/thems"". It reduces our complexity and diversity down to a single palatable ""third gender."" And enby is cutesy besides, so I can see how it's invalidating for a lot of people.
I 100% agree
Honestly, I find it more hurtful coming from other queer people, including other non-binary people.
Your gender might be ""non-binary"", but it's also an umbrella term. There are a lot of us who fall into the non-binary tent, and there needs to be room for that diversity.
Hey I get it, and I know I‘ll probably not change much with these thoughts. I just wanted to point this out (just like you pointed the things you think out here) and maybe change sone people‘s perspective.
What I think is, that the beauty of being nonbinary is, that there isn‘t really a rulebook. What makes me kinda sad is that the online community is creating some sort of rule book for being non binary, which for me is kinda jarring and in contrast with the label in itself. So I shared my opinion in hopes of seeing people agree with me with this issue. And besides, pointing issues out and trying to change them isn‘t something wrong, is it?
You see, the point is you say a group of trans women and not a group of trans she/hers. You say a group of men and not a group of he/hims. I‘m saying you should stop calling a group of enbys a group of they/thems and instead just a group of enbys, like you do with every other gender. Of course you talk about a group as they, but you don‘t usually personificate a gender as a pronoun.
Maybe just a person would do it.
[deleted]
Mostly it‘s heavily implied, for example I saw a vid where someone was like: I don‘t date men, I don‘t date women, I date they/thems. Do you see the imbalance?
Yeah! Exactly. I’ll even specify like “oh boy the he/they Supernatural fans who imprinted on Castiel are out in full force today”. Or “man, something must’ve happened in the they/them Steven Universe fandom because I keep seeing posts about the voice actors today”
I've seen transphobes etc say that  kinda shit on yt LGBTQ+ channels. 

 It's honestly exhausting  that they keep dismissing proof and  spread false information, and  just harass others for the sake of trying to keep thselves in their little boxes, no matter how horrible or stressful or titinr it or their life may be.  Like.. you can do ANYTHING, and instead you choose to harass people for a living in YouTube comments sections.  Congrats, you just proved how much of an asshole you are.  If that was your goal, it's working.
I'm right there with you, also agender. 

Honestly I don't mind ""he/him"" at all, what I mind is the relentless, ""Just the guy I needed to talk to!"" or, ""Thanks, brother,"" or the dreaded, *""That's because you're a man.""*

Cis, heteronormative people don't realize how they are constantly imbuing every interaction with gender affirmation, and I just find it gross personally.
Man, it’s almost like I don’t want my whole personality to be boiled down to the pronouns I use.
That’s like, fucking gross, for a myriad of reasons.
Yeah.. even on yt too. I watch jamiedodger and Trixie and all them, and it's everywhere. Jamie gets it the worst though, I've seen. 

 I've spent the past comple months of my life trying to debate and fend off the transphobws and such, but it isint really working. All it's doing is getting me stressed and mad. But its SO HARD to not tell them they're wrong. It's a cycle and I hate it. It's so hard for me to get out of this.  Once in a while, I'll get a notification from  yt that a transphobic etc comment and it just sets me off.
Ohh! Yeah. I get it. It's like instead of saying ""female person"", she/her person? That's actually very not okaaay and sounds awfully bad, and you are correct. Instead of gender, it impies the person is x pronoun user, which is not necessary true and reducing their gender only to pronouns.
Thank you for this, I was so damn confused 😭
In that case, I misunderstood, sorry. Although, I am having trouble trying to think of any situation where that would come up without it being intentionally derogatory anyway. Using any pronoun in that way seems very forced and unnatural, unless there’s something obvious I’m forgetting. Is there an example?
Yes exactly this. Using they/them as default or when you don‘t know is perfectly fine imo.
yeah I get how it bothers other people , like the way I use “they thems” is to kinda take the power back ? ignorant cis people wanna call us that to belittle us or mock us but I’m like “yeah I’m a they/them , so what” lmaoo , yaknow ? And I know most people who say enby aren’t usually meaning to make it seem invalidating , so that’s not completely why don’t like it. I just don’t like how it sounds and I don’t often like words shortened anyway. But yeah it kinda takes away from the identity I feel like.
[removed]
Why would you want to change the perspectives of others in the first place? I don't believe you understand the implications here, but the effect of your words is you look worse, not like a nice person. You simply do not speak for all nbs. It is not a fact that ""the online community is creating some kind of rule book,"" that is your opinion. You disrespect every single nb person when you treat your perspective as a fact everyone else just needs to be enlightened to - that inherently means you do not feel every nb is entitled to their own perspectives and opinions because they differ from yours. You are not pointing out an issue. Not everyone nb sees this like you, and that is valid. You cannot make your choice to erase the perspectives of nbs who disagree with you look rational or nice or pretty.
ah ok thank you you worded that very clearly, and now that i know what op was referring to i can totally agree, it has never happened to me personally because the only people i am open to about my gender identity and my pronouns are people that care greatly about respecting others and are very open minded in general, but i can easily see myself getting hurt by someone doing that. thanks again for taking your time in rewording ops post to where i can understand it <3
Yeah but it's difficult to categorize everyone under one umbrella that they may not identify with. I can admit it's not perfect but I think it's a playful use of language. And I've heard many niche jokes about they/he's or something as its a specific type of person, more specific perhaps than just non binary or genderfluid? I don't see it as any more wrong than dumping all GNC under the NB category. It is by nature a non-category
OMg bruh dont get me started with SU Fandom there was a character from Steven Universe Future that was non binary named shep some fan did a cosplay of them right........... .pls don't hate me but this was when I was 20 and didn't know Non binary peeps existed... I called shep a he and SU fandom attacked me for that......... I""M SORRY !!!!!!!! honestly  I'm 23 Ive matured and learned my lesson (Non binary peeps exists and never trigger a fandom)
 Yeah, THATS FUNNY! And not hurting anyone! 

 But when you do it intentionally to hurt people, and you aren't LGBTQ+ in some way, I feel you don't have the right to joke about stuff like that cuz it's very hurtful.  Same with people shitting on people with mental illnesses and transphobes telling people they aren't their ""real"" gender just because they don't ""believe"" or ""see them as such"". 

 It's hurtful, derogatory, harassment, and disrespectful. If you aren't actually that thing, you have no right to talk shit about it, or tell people what they can and can't do just because you don't like it or think it's ""funny"". 

 People will always be assholes unfortunately.

 Edit: spelling
Yes exactly. And really good point to make the example with the „he/her person“. I think it‘s easier here to spot why it feels weird to me with they/them. Thank you!
Yeah, it is forced and unnatural in my opinion. People use it as cute or edgy slang, and don't mean any harm. But it's very much reminiscent of transphobic language.
And it's great that that fits you and that that's your gender! But the piece you quoted talked about ""creat[ing] another expectation of what being non-binary means"" - it doesn't claim your gender isn't allowed to be non-binary. But those of us who are agender or whatever don't want people to assume that because we are non-binary we fit neatly into a third rigidly-defined group, rather than being part of a diverse collective that has something in common.

OP didn't say ""non-binary is never a gender."" OP said if someone is non-binary, you can't make *assumptions* about their gender.
No I think you misunderstand my problem. You could use your argumentation exactly to support my point. People tend to use a „they/them“ synonymously to an enby, which might be true for a lot of enbys, but not all use these pronouns. That‘s my issue. And I think I‘m not alone here. I hope you understand what I mean.
But is it a specific type of person? Or do the memes make them seem like on specific type of person? I get that it‘s kinda fun but if you really think about it, maybe it‘s slightly harmful. Not much, but a bit.
This is where context matters, when it's well meaning I don't see an issue. That's someone who has at least taken the time to learn that not everyone is a he or she and that is a huge step for most of the general public. 

If someone were to ask if I was ""a them"" with a more positive tone / genuine asking, I'd be like ""Yeah! I'm nonbinary and use they/them pronouns"". And if someone were to not use those pronouns, then it's at least an opener to the conversation of ""Well I am nonbinary if that's what you mean, but I use (insert pronouns) pronouns instead!""."	ybcp4t	NonBinary	582	0.92	2022-10-23 08:58:41
Need help with pronouns	"My child recently told me they want to use they/them pronouns and they have chosen a different name they would like to go by. I understand the importance of supporting these decisions so I am really trying. 

I do have a question though. When I am speaking to other people, what do I replace the word ""son"" with? I though ""child"" or ""kid"" but they're going on 15 now and that feels a little demeaning maybe?

Update: We talked at dinner. We are going with kid for now. And maybe loin-fruit when we are just at home together.  Thank you all so very much for all of your support and advice!

❤️  Keep being awesome and remember, you are enough."	"That’s something you might want to talk to them about, to see what they prefer and are comfortable with! Personally, I think child is fine and doesn’t necessarily mean they’re little. You could also call them your teenager.
just want to say it’s awesome that you’re asking! its up to personal preference but i’m an adult (24) and am comfortable with my parents calling me their child. maybe ask them if they are okay with being called child or kid and if not, if theres another word they would like to be referred by. really shows them that you care by asking 😊
You could say ""teen"" or ""teenager."" I've heard parents use that even for kids who aren't trans/nonbinary. Saying ""my teenager goes to (school)"" or ""my teen plays way too many videogames"" sounds fairly normal to me.

The best idea is to ask your kid how they want you to refer to them, though.
My parents often refer to me as their ""adult child"". Personally I think I like kid the most, as it's often casually used for people of any age who have parents. But your kid may have other opinions, so it's best to ask them.

You sound like a good parent. Thank you.
I know this is what everyone else has said but communication is key. Im a non-binary teen and would personally want my parents to discuss this with me if they were confused.
You can use birth order. (my first born, \*name\*) or age (My 15 year old, \*name\*).

But the best thing to do is to talk to them, and give them agency over what they want to be called, rather than trying to guess what they will or won't like.
child or kid they'll always be your child and you'll always be their parent nothing embarrassing or demanding about it just a fact
15 is a hard age. I was a hormonal kid at that age. I suggest being open to what your 15 Year old wants. Be open. Be supportive. 🙌❤️
I tend to use things like kid/child/teenager/spawn/offspring/youngling. One more year and I'll have to cross teenager off the list though.
I’m in my late thirties and my parents call me their child.
My parents primarily use child (I'm 20 lol) because that's what I feel comfortable with. They also sometimes use spawn to refer to me which I honestly think is hilarious. I would recommend just asking what feels the most comfortable for them. Not everyone is the same and they might not even know what they want to be referred to as yet which is totally okay. Just take it one step at a time.

Also you're doing such a fantastic job using their pronouns! Go you!
The best advice I can offer is to check with them.

Firstly, they may not be ready to be out to a wider group of people yet. If they’ve only recently told you this, you may be among the first to be told, and outing them to other people, even when it’s accidental with no ill intent, can be bad for them. 

Second, not all nonbinary people are comfortable or uncomfortable with the same words being used to describe them, and may even feel differently about the same word in different contexts. Given they’ve told you they have a different name and use they/them pronouns, it’s fairly safe to assume that they’d be more comfortable with gender-neutral words like kid and child, but that doesn’t necessarily mean they don’t like being referred to as your son. 

Third, checking with them about this, especially where it’s unprompted by them, and they’re allowed to decide when they’re comfortable doing so, helps to show that you accept and support them. 

Fourth, keep in mind that what works and doesn’t work for them now may change in the future. If that happens, it might mean that there’s (another) adjustment period as you get used to the changes, but the more you get it right and are seen to be making the effort to do so, the better off they’ll be. Likewise they may not have the answer for the best word to use: I’ve spent a lot of time trying to work out how my niece should describe me, as the usual gendered words don’t work, and the non-gendered ones like “auncle” and “parsib” that I’ve found don’t sound right to me. If none of the words like “child”, “kid”, “offspring”, etc fit for your’s, one possibility would be to reverse how you express the idea: instead of “You/they are my child” something like “I am your/their parent”. 

Fifth and final, despite your best efforts you may slip up at some point and use the wrong name or word for them. While it’d be better if you were perfect (😉), fixing the mistake and moving on without making a big deal of it is the next best thing. And if they spot the error instead of you and correct you on it, same thing: acknowledge the mistake, apologise and move on. A big song and dance about how sorry you are, how you’re really trying hard to get it right… can be embarrassing and may even ring a little hollow, no matter how genuine it is. Moving on and drawing as little attention to the flub as possible is the best way to go. 

That you’re trying to find the best way to do this is awesome. We’d all be better off with more people like you out there. Follow their lead in this and both of you will do great!
I don't have anything new to add, I just wanted to give you a shout out for being an awesome parent! Your child will be your best resource, and you have no idea what an amazing thing you are giving them with your love and support. Good luck xx
I like my parents to use child but I would definitely say just ask because it’s different for everyone
i, 17, would just prefer kid

but you should ask them! everyone is different  
communication is always important, especially in unknown/new situations
Offspring or progeny are fun! make you sound like a space alien :)  


but ask them, they'll be happy to work it out with you I am sure!
I go by child, and asking is probably the best choice, but child/kid are also ok too ;)
My mom uses spawn for me. Or child of mine.
I am 21. But it was a conversation we had before about it
as a nonbinary teen i'd probably like to be referred to as my parents' child, as i feel like the word is regularly used that way anyway. i would recommend asking them specifically though, as they are the only one who can really know
Child could work. Kid also works as they are a minor. I'm nonbinary myself and my mom doesn't know that I'm nb and she calls me her kid and she refers me at times as kid. I love it.
We love a supportive parent! - a nonbinary 19-year-old
My mom calls me her oldest child. I'm 30. It's fine. You get to a point where you know you'll always be her baby. 

Child, kid, spawn, offspring, expensive medical bill, all good gender neutral options for your youth.
You can call them a lot of things that aren't son/daughter without risk of misgendering: youngster, offspring, bud, youth, junior, munchkin, small fry, kid, spawn, successor, apprentice. Pretty much come up with a fun pronoun nickname between you, the choices are endless.
Yo thank you for being a good parent!  
  
My mom calls me and my siblings by our birth order a lot. I'm ""my oldest"" then lil bro is, ""my second kid,"" and so on.   
  
I'm 28 and my folks still call me their kid/child, and in private still use my childhood petname (Stinkweed)- I don't find infantilizing at all, it's just their way of expressing our closeness and I love that we speak to one another that way. Definitely ask your kid!
The ultimate answer is always “ask them”.  But child, kid, etc, are used by many people even talking about their non-trans, adult children!
I would honestly just say talk to them about how they'd like to be referred as. Maybe they have a preference, maybe they don't. You'll never know until you ask. And good on you for asking!!
Depends, but do speak to them about what they're comfortable with.  
""My teenager"", ""My eldest"" (if they are), ""My 14-year-old"", and you can use their name too.  


After reading these comments, I'm going to start calling my three ""offspring"" :-) even though they're binary (M, M, F).
""Spawn, come to the kitchen for dinner!""
Check with your child on what they prefer. Mine is still okay with daughter, but I usually use ""kiddo"" or ""child."" But, mine is going on 12 -- so still young.
I go by ""spawn"" or ""offspring"" jokingly
Honestly, my favourite one with my parents is just ""kid"" but I also love when my mom calls me her ""monster"" haha, so you can get creative with it too! Just ask your kid what they enjoy!
Jokingly: my offspring (your child will appreciate this joke)

But otherwise I think just using their name is good

""Ash did really well on their maths test recently! Yeah they scored 89%""
My parents refer to me as offspring and 
Progeny.
I am 35 and would like my parents to call me their spawn.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

jk my parents still call me their daughter, and I'm currently ok with that. I pretty much use she/they pronouns just for other people's comfort.
if you have multiple children you could call them your youngest/oldest.. or as others have said you could say your teenager. but ofc you should ask them these questions yourself
I have my mom use a mix of daughter and kid/child but like 80% child
You sound like such a good parent and I’m glad you’re trying for your kid < 3
Edit: Loin fruit is hilarious
I kinda like being referred to as 'my youngest' by my parents. It's still really personal for them, but isn't gendered. I'm 50+ so there's an added bonus for me which may not work for others quite so well :)
Seems like you dont need help, but I would just like to say thank you for being such a supportive parent
I'm going on 30 and I still identify more with kid than most other descriptors in general 😅 I definitely personally wouldn't mind being called my parents' ""kid"" in conversation. :)
Offspring or progeny (if that applies). I've used these in my life just to be odd.
As a nonbinary person that came out very young and I still live with my parents I had to have a discussion with them on gender neutral terms they call me there child when talking to others even tho I’m older (also it’s so good to see more parents be accepting
spawn is my favorite
I know you already gave an update and it's so awesome how supportive you're being! I wish I coulda come out at that age :' )

I'm an adult, but when I came out to my dad I still asked him to just call me his kid rather than his daughter/son. I also said he could call me his Eldest Spawn but sadly he didn't go with that one 😂
I know you e already gotten a lot of answers but, mom calls me her kid/child. I'm 25, and it doesn't bother me any. She still refers to all of my siblings as her babies when talking about us, and the oldest one is 30. Sometimes when specifying my, she'll say ""the middle one"", which also let's people know who she's talking about.
This might be my parent bc I’ve gone through this exact thing recently, but anyways- some parents try to say that « my kid » or « my child » sounds too young. It’s not.
Can I just stop by to say that it’s really nice seeing a parent actually support their Enby kid’s identity and pronouns, as well as make an actual effort!! 

Thank you, this has made my day better, and I hope your kid realises how lucky they are, amongst enbies and trans people, to have a supportive parent…
I'm in a similar position with my 13 year old and I often say ""my 13 year old,"" or ""my teen kid,"" or ""my older kid."" (I have 2.)
Cheers and thanks for being an ally to your kid!
My mom just pretends I'm not NB and still calls me her daughter to her friends because shes embarrassed 🙃 0/10 do not recommend
Laughing at loin-fruit

&#x200B;

Just to add to the collection, my parents called my sister and me their cuttings (as from plants). At least that's the best translation to english I can find
My parents have always called me their Eldest Spawn. Things like that are always good. I also don't think ""kid"" is demeaning or infantilising, but that's just me personally.
I’m so glad there is parents out there actually looking for help and respecting their kids it makes me so happy
So my dad has always called me ""kid"" or ""kiddo"" growing up, so when I came out as nb, he didn't really have to change it. My mom liked calling me ""girl"" or ""girlie"" so she has had a hard time adjusting. I like ""kid"" a lot, and I'm glad that you and your parents have come to an understanding.
If I was fully out, I’d probably get my parents to use kid or to say something like “my 15 year old” instead of “my daughter”
glad you worked it out! just as another option (I’m twenty) my mom calls me her twenty year old, so you can also go with that! It’s nice to have options :)
If you and they have a sense of humor about the whole thing, you could go with “spawn” or “offspring”. That’s what my mom uses for me :)
i tell my mom to call me her spawn, we think its hilarious
glad you’ve figured it out with them!!! (talking it out was going to be my recommendation lol)

my mother had the same dilemma (I came out as nonbinary/genderqueer when I was 15 as well, I’m now college-aged/young adult for reference), and we talked through terms (settled on “my child/kid/teen/eldest” as gender neutral ways for her to describe her relation to me)

but yeah, in general, I would just recommend keeping an open dialogue about this (and other things, ideally), and listening to what your kid is telling you about their wants and comfort levels. it worked out amazingly for me (I consider my mother to be one of my best friends, we text every day, and I feel respected and heard and loved in the way she treats me) and I am of the opinion that many people would benefit from more frequent respectful conversations about identity and comfort, most of all parents and children :)
As a piece of advice I’d say use their pronouns when you aren’t together, like just say sentences over and over using their correct pronouns and name, addressing them correctly etc. And eventually it should just feel seamless when you use them in everyday life.
Your child is always going to be your child no matter what so it would be normal to just call them your child, or you could just call them by their preferred name. If you’re not sure about it though, I would just ask them what they would prefer you to refer them by
I'm sorry, loin-fruit lmfao
Spawn
Creation, offspring, “nickname”/their name (“my Samantha, let me tell you..”
I know a parent that calls their non-binary kid ""spawn"" ... Seems to work for them
""my spawn""

Jr

Dragonborn

Hell walker

Child of the abyss (and me)

My rotten soldier

Others ;)
N/B 27yr old here- kiddo is my all time favorite from my parents. It's easy, and I know they're using it to help support me.
My dad calls me his “progeny” 😂
Enby teen here, just go for what they feel is the best, ask, communication is key, make sure you say they can tell you anything/everything and then show you do your best to work with them on those points.
My mom likes to say ""you'll always be my baby, no matter how old you are."" I'm in my 30s and she still does this.
Spawn works.
Lmao I love loin fruit
I use “kiddo” or “my oldest” (or youngest, middle, second child, etc) or “my 16 year old”. I hope this helps, and you are a great mom!
My dad calls me his eldest spawn
Ooh ok. Thank you!
This. Mine is 12 and has said they prefer child or tween. That could very well change as they get older in the same way a child might ask to stop using a childhood pet name later. (I about died when my grandma was still calling me ""Little Miss Muffet"" in public at age 13.)
Behold, my offspring!

But yeah, as others have said, ask them
Thanks! I'm glad I found this community. Yall are so nice.
Thank you! Seems like asking is the way I'm gonna go! It's in 3 for 3 so far. <3
Thank you. I try. I want my kids to know I'm always going to love them and I will never judge who they are.
Thank you so much! I love hearing that from you.
Echo, First of Their Name. I don't knownwhy, but the way you said it, that was the first thing that came to mind.

😄 

Thank you!
Thank you! I like kid but I'll also be asking. You all are so quick with advice. It's much appreciated.
Indeed. They've been through quite a bit in the last year as well and I just want them to be comfortable and happy. 

Thank you <3
Heh. I've used spawn before. 

Thank you so much.
not the younglings!
Huh. I wonder what my parents call me. 

Thank you!
Thank you so much. It is easier in text. They/them feels impersonal to me to say out loud. Thats.my baby, you know? It is a difficult transition. Not emotionally but just retraining my brain. I can’t even remember my own birthday sometimes. I'm so scatter brained. So I am so worried I won't ever be able to be consistent. But I recognize there isn't really any one perfect option. Our language is dumb. A lot of other languages actually already had really good gender neutral pronouns I recently found out.
Thank you. I appreciate the thorough response! I feels.like thank you isn't enough but I hope you all know I really really appreciate it. ❤️
😊 ❤️ thank you!
Thank you! I will ask when they get home. <3
Thank you. I like having feedback from someone close to their age!
Oooh progeny. Feels very powerful lol

Thank you!
Thank you!
Oh nice. I wasn't home when they got home from school so we will have that conversation this evening.

Thank you!
Perfect.  Thank you.
Thank you!
❤️
Thank you so much! 😊
Sounds good actually. To work on it together and make it special. 

Thank you!
Thank you!!
Thank you! 😊
Mhm. We talked about it at dinner. They said kid is fine. Thank you!
My favorite has bee progeny. We talked and we're going with kid for now.

Thank you!
""Alexa, drop in on Spawn's room.""
Thank you 😊
I call them all spawn jokingly. I don't know that I've ever used offspring.

Thanks so much!
I like monster. I use to call them stinky buttface buuuuuut... might be more embarrassing than anything at this point.

Thanks!
Ah. Ok. Thank you!
Super cute!
That is very considerate of you. I wish it wasn't necessary. 

My friend just suggested loin-fruit. We had a giggle fit.
Thank you!
Ooh I see. Thank you!
❤️
That sounds very sweet.

Thank you ^_^
❤️
Yeah it's certainly more on the affectionate side. I do like it.

Thank you! 😊
I think it's cute really. Progeny sounds powerful too. Thank you
I like hearing about other parents being accepting too. Thank you!
It does seem to be popular. Thank you!
Thank you. I haven't cleared reddit for my kids to use yet so if that's you, you're grounded. 😜
❤️  there is WAY too much hate out there. I just don't understand how people have the time. It is so much easier in life to just love and accept.

Thank you
Oh thank you so much. I appreciate another parent's pov too!
I'm sorry to hear that. I definitely won't be doing that. We'll have to take it slow with my mother. She still doesn't understand that they don't like to be touched and have a right to say that so it is one step at a time there, but otherwise we're fairly well set on an open minded family and friend group.
That is super cute. Thank you
Yeah they said kid is fine. I was just wary because I don't want to hurt their feelings. They've had a fairly rough go of the past few years.

Thank you!
❤️
Thank you
Oh I do like hearing from your age group. Thank you so much!
Oh yeah. That's true! Thanks 😊
I think kid in company and loin-fruit in the home is what we've landed on! Thank you!
I like a good sense of humor. Thanks!
That is really amazing to hear. Thank you!
Thank you 😊 I'll start doing this!
Thank you ^_^
We've been using it all day now. It's fun to say.
./nods

Seems legit the best option right?
>Ooh ok. Thank you!

You're welcome!
Mmm. The general consensus seems to be to ask. Y'all have been so great. Thank you 😊
Coming out is a difficult time for them. There are a lot of people online who have been kicked out, abused, prevented from transitioning etc by their parents when come out, and so kids and teens hear all these stories and they're scared it could happen to them. Make sure they know that's not going to happen to them, if you haven't already.
Ooh I like that.  And you are welcome!
No prob here to help
Thank you for making the effort to understand and be good to your kid! Wishing both of you well. :)
Remind yourself that it's okay to make mistakes. No one's perfect and messing up is totally normal. Heck, I've been out as nonbinary for almost 3 years and still mess up my own pronouns from time to time. It happens. As long as you show that you are trying, I promise, it will mean the world. All I ever wanted was acceptance from my parents. The fact that you are on here asking questions and asking for advice, shows me at least that you're trying and putting in effort. Take it one step at a time. You'll get it.
This suggested pronoun nicknaming is more for when addressing them, to others usually ""my kid, my child, my teen""  are all already in standard use
>Thank you! 😊

You're welcome!
You're welcome, and thanks for trying to make your kid feel the most comfortable possible! It's nice to see! 

I think stinky buttface would have been pretty embarrassing as a teenager haha, but id probably just laugh now and play along if my mom called me that now XD
I approve of loin-fruit
it’s really good you made this post! i can tell that you are a great parent :)
That’s- actually quite profound. I think I’ve just come to a realisation, or am coming to one. You say that it’s easier to love and accept — but it isn’t. People’s default is hate and fear… or is it? Maybe some people genuinely find it easier to love and accept? I’ll have to think on this, I’m not sure what it means. 

Maybe that’s what a good person is? Someone that finds it naturally easier to love and accept, than to hate and fear? 

Either way! You’re doing something right xD 
Thank you for the thought-provoking comment!
of course!
I think I have drilled that into all of my kids' heads for years now. That I'm not going anywhere and they should be whoever they want to be. I know it took Echo(formerly David) a long time to believe me. But thankfully we got there now.
Ok gotcha. Thanks again
Maybe what I mean is hate is letting someone live rent free in your mind. Not that it is necessarily easy to choose love over hate. Just that if you do, you have a clearer and easier mind. It really takes up way too much time and energy. 

Speaking as someone who had an immense hatred of someone(not unwarranted. He made my life absolute hell) I can absolutely say that I am way happier now that I just decided to stop giving him that space in my head.
Hi! First off major kudos for trying your best to be accurate and respectful. Might I also suggest avoiding dead naming them moving forward? I understand the attachment to their birth name but other people, those who didn't know them growing up, don't need to know their dead name. :) Also you can totally always go with spawn lol
Thank you! It's wonderful seeing a parent showing so much support and care!
Ah I didn't realize. I was going for clarity like how will people know im talking about them in particular but I guess it would have been implied anyway. 

Thank you!
Of course! It's a leaning curve for sure. It might help to think about it like Maiden names, most who take their husbands last names to introduce their maiden name only their married name. :)

What pronouns do you use?	"(P.S. If you're going to vote, you might as well upvote, it helps out a lot!) Hi there, I wanted make this poll to find out the different kinds of pronouns you guys use. I wish I could put more options, but Reddit polls have a maximum of 6, so I had to clump some options together.

In the comments, you could discuss about your pronouns and why you use them (just remember to be respectful). 

Anyways, Thanks you voting and upvoting! :D <3

[View Poll](https://www.reddit.com/poll/rg2619)"	"While open to masculine terms and preferring those pronouns when gender neutral is not an option, I only advertise my use of they/them. Gotta make it difficult for assholes to misgenders me.
They/them in english, none in native language cause we don't have any
I used to use a set of neopronouns ne/nem/nir/nirs/nemself, however currently I use they/them. Ne felt more correct and dear to my heart, but people pretty much refused to learn to use it for me and I gave up because I was getting they’d anyway when I wasn’t being misgendered. I’ve always been interested in neopronouns like com/per/ind/thon/ey, the old school ones from decades ago that have held on, even before I developed a conscious personal interest in not being assigned a binary gender by other peoples words.

When I first came out to myself, the word they felt very impersonal and not suitable for me. The way I describe the difference between these two pronouns which are both meant to be gender neutral and therefore don’t have a categorical difference is that they wasn’t incorrect because it could be used for anyone but ne felt like it specifically included me and people with genders similar to me. A key difference. Yet over time, with people using they for me anyway and that still being miles better than he or she, I decided that I wasn’t interested in trying to enforce usage of a neopronoun and I let go of ne back into the linguistic ether. Still my absolute favorite neutral pronoun.

More recently I’ve been struck by a couple times where sentences were constructed to potentially be referring to me as it if one didn’t realize the actual referential noun meant by it. It felt really good. I have had people weaponize that pronoun against me in the past, but in a safe environment with the binary pronoun I really hate most as the alternative, it felt correct and cozy.
he/they and im basically just a femboy bear lmao
I don't care what pronouns you use as long as you're not trying to be a dick in some way. I've been a she/her pretty much my whole life but I get a zing of euphoria when I get he/him'd. I'll take they/them but it feels a little clunky for me personally.
i mainly use he/her because my native language doesn't have a way to refer to someone as ""they"" without it sounding extremely weird :(
I'll go first. I'm Genderfluid (Currently Questioning). I use He/She/They Pronouns. 

I personally use this set of pronouns regardless of what gender I am, because of two main reasons:

My Gender Identity usually isn't one single gender. It's usually made up of a few different genders. Using these pronouns at once kinda accurately describes what I am at any given time.

I also use this set because, well, it's the one I'm most comfortable with and this is the one that describes me the best. That's the Main reason I use this set. 

But, that's just my experience, and anyone can use any pronouns they feel comfortable with! :D <3
They/xem/he !! I also love it/its but don’t see anyone realistically using them for me :/
I chose other:

They/them when speaking english & the equivalent of she/her in my native language. 

Kinda wishing my native language was equipped for gender neutral terms :/ We do have neopronouns but these just don't cut it for me.
where do it/its fall?
I use he/she pronouns as well as some neopronouns.
I'm currently experimenting with she/fae/they
They and it!
Any pronouns are fine by me, I think, as long as they’re used with respect. She/her, he/him, they/them, it/it’s, any neopronouns, no pronouns, if somebody wants to make up their own pronouns on the spot, that’s cool. Everybody uses she/her for me, and I think that feels the most “right” because I’m so used to it. But I think it’d be cool if people were more adventurous with the pronouns they use every now and then!
I use they/he/she but at this point in my transition I’m only really comfortable with close friends using she/her. When anyone else does it it feels like I’m being mis gendered still. I feel once I’ve been on testosterone longer and my voice is a little deeper I’ll be happy to use she/her with everyone again
Neo's all the way <3
Does e/em/eir fall under neopronouns
ayo where the any pronouns at
I use they/them in e glish and neos in my native language since it doesn't have a neutral pronoun
They/He
He/they, or he/they/fae, sometimes he/they/fae/xey, depends if I trust them to be okay with neopronouns
How does having no pronouns work? Do you just use their name?
She/they formally, but honestly as long as you don't use he/him I don't care. I love fae/faer especially.
They/them out of convenience. I'm very okay with he/him, too. But I'd really prefer basically any neopronouns with an x. (Also I only have preferences, probably because I'm not a native speaker and I didn't know about gendered pronouns until I was like 6
I started with he/they, but found I prefer he/him. I mostly don't care too much as long as it isn't she/her. I at least expect ""they"" if someone is unwilling to call me he/him
I use she/her/hers and they/them/theirs, but have played with the thought of using she/hir/hirs as a way to combine things and better reflect my embodiment. Oh I am a non-binary woman.
It/They
I'm born female, but I've had trouble fitting into the box of my gender for a very long time. In order to shake some stress off of my life I decided that I want to go with she/they pronouns. I mostly use them for myself to feel comfortable in my own skin, but are open for them to be used by my closest family members. I feel nervous about being out in public with it while there's still a lot of hate targeted against the use of pronouns.
I've only just discovered that I'm bigender, primarily female so I do mostly use female pronouns, but I'm open to neutral if someone doesn't know, and since there's currently only very specific circumstances in which I identify as male, I haven't played around with male pronouns yet but I'm pretty sure I'd enjoy them in those circumstances
They/them, or just my name.
How does one use no pronouns
They/It/Xe/He/She
I use she/her cuz am binary trans fem, but I 100% support enby pals
Guenein question how does someone not use pronouns? Do people just always use there name? But also referring to them without knowing a name how would I avoid using pronouns? ( Ik I used they them pronouns referring to someone who doesn't use pronouns. I'm genuinely confused)
[deleted]
No pronouns but I know that's not gonna happen, realistically, so I basically just don't care. Go with your heart.
I'm fine with either they/them or xe/xir
Any unless I’m near someone who I know will only use she. Then it’s he/they.
I use he/him in irl scenarios and when I don't feel like I can share my neopronouns, but I go by a bunch of funky neos in my circle of friends
Non-binary trans woman here, she/her.
Fae/Faer
In English I really like using they, but in my native language (German) I tend to go by the equivalent of it / its :)
way more he/she/they enbies than i thought :)
they/them in english but my native language doesn't have a gender-neutral alternative so I use pronouns ""opposite"" to my gender assigned at birth :)
I live in a predominantly french area, so I use french pronouns irl. In french, I use elle/la (equivalent of she/her) and iel/lo (neutral neopronoun) in circles that are accepting, which are rare. Everything is gendered in french and the whole sentence needs to be conjugated accordingly, so I use the feminine conjugation, no matter what, since there's no standard for a gender neutral conjugation yet, or it's very frowned upon if you use any of the new proposed neutral conjugations.

I use they/them in english irl and sometimes she/her, when not bothered to come out and in spaces where it is not safe. 

I use neopronouns in english on the internet only (cat/cats/catself, purr/purrs/purrself, mew/mews/mewself).
Good question
any pronouns are good with me, but i’d say my favorites are he/him and it/its
How do you have no pronouns? My friend has no idea what pronouns to use and I would like to pass along the information :)
He/him/they/them :) basically anything besides just she lol
Any/all. I've never really minded what people called me much, but I do prefer they/them. Just don't be an jerk about it is all I ask.
I use all of the basic pronouns and just snatch neopronouns
it's weird that it makes me uncomfy when a CisHet Calls me They/Them, I can almost hear them Misspelling it.
Genuine question how do you refer to someone who uses no pronouns?
Dang it I clicked the wrong one, I didn’t reread them so I chose “other” when I meant to choose “he/she/they”. :/
When speaking in English I use they/them but in my language I use the equivalent of She/They (ela/elu) because even the most progressive people I know here in Brazil tend to have a very hard time with the elu, since it's technically a neopronoun and my own close friends (also all queer) never really catched on to it. I find that even I only really feel comfortable using elu talking about myself when with other non binary folks, but I attribute that majorly because of my previous bad experiences.

Anyway, also dropping my very own hot take since it's on topic: if you think neopronouns are too much, just for attention, ""just use they already"", or anything in the same vein, shut your privileged mouth up, you fucking twat, go study linguistics and take a freaking second to remember that the US isn't even the whole America, don't get me started on the rest of the world ❤
she/they I work in IT so I feel a need to be a 'woman in tech' even though I'm a they personally.  My family insist I'm a miss, and they can diaf tbh (Mx, if you really must)
They, she and he are all fine by me, though in practice I’m limited to she in person (I’m closeted) and they online (If I use multiple most people just call me she anyway)
I lost my pronouns a few years ago, please help me find them
They/them, but I used they/he for a couple months

Edit: I used they/them from the start bc it felt good. Then I tried out they/he around when I started HRT and it felt good at first, but I eventually realized it only felt good bc it balanced out the feminine misgendering I got with more masculine pronouns too, but neither of them were right for me, so I switched back to they/them
Started with she/they, changed over to they/them and have stuck with it ever since.
I use He/It. It changes for day to day although mostly he
If asked I use they/them, but I’m not super strict about enforcing it in public/at work so I get “she”d a lot
I use they but also thon which I suppose is a neopronoun? Sorta. It's from the 1850s
Anything but she :D
I guess I use they/them but I’d prefer to just go by my name
[removed]
I use both he/him and co/cos, a neopronoun set ^^ I hope neopronouns become more widely used in the future
Literally anything. I might not respond to neopronouns because I'm not as used to them, but I really don't mind what pronouns people use for me. Of course this means the majority of people I know only use the ones I grew up with or just they/them, but anything is fine.
He they
I use She/They/Fae/Snow/❄️/Ey  


She/They cause genderfae and its easy for people to use  
Fae cause I like the sound of it  
Snow/❄️because Its winter and my gender sorta changes based on the season  
and Ey because its really close to They
They/them but I prefer neopronouns ey/em. Basically just they/them pronouns just without the th
AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
Yeah, would be good to have polls that allow multiple options with checkboxes. I use he/it (masc agender).
I prefer more of the neo types (xey/xem it/its) but i haven't the courage to tell my friends really so they mainly just use he/they for me
I primarily use he/they. I *very rarely* use she/her, and only with my fiance. I also want to try experimenting with fae/faer, because (to me) it feels feminine without having any connection to womanhood.
My AGAB pronouns of he/him. I’ve never tried out they/she but doubt I’d mind, were it not for potentially being outed that way. Having said that I don’t mind he/him anyway, neither being drawn to nor repelled from them. Of all the lifelong dissatisfaction of being in a solely male box, pronouns for whatever reason haven’t been a symptom of that drag.
I used to prefer neopronouns (xey/ze/ey) but now I prefer he/him. I think it's because i recently came out to myself as a trans man!
They/them to those I’m out to like friends and trusted coworkers. But to my religious Baptist family and most people at work, I’m she/her unfortunately. I cringe every time I hear it at this point, but I know I won’t be able to advance at the company I’m with and that my family will resent me more than they already do for my very non-conventional life. Sigh.
I use they/it
I like the 1800 pronoun of thon. It's a contraction of that one and it feels like a futuristic word.
he/him, i’m trans and present male in day to day but still identify as slightly nb
Pronouns are as follows: Null/She/they/he. No idea how to use Null, prefer ""They"" when I'm not present, and the others are dependent on how I'm feeling that day 😅

And I'm still not publicly out... So ¯\\_(ツ)_/¯
I use they/them, but I am also curious.. how does one refer to someone who uses no pronouns? (Not asking to be rude, just curious and want to be enlightened)
But my language doesnt even have gendered pronouns:(In English, idc but he/him works)
He they for meeee!!!
I usually prefer they/them but will accept she/her .
I use they/them pronouns in my day to day life but if I have encountered someone who I think is transphobic I will use he/him
I use they/them mostly but I also like he/him, and basically any neopronoun
I use it/it/its/itself, ro/rot/rots/rotself, and they/them/theirs/themself
Thank you for giving me a way to easily decribe it! I was never quite sure also because of some language difficulties my boyfriends parents who are well..also like literally ancient find it very difficult so they just use he/him for me but I don't mind it when they do that I think. It's just really confusing and difficult but I think your description is what I think I would go for. Thank you kind stranger! :D
What language is that?
Daaaamn, time to move to Finland
Hey, it's okay! There's people here who'll respect and use your preferred pronouns, even if they're NeoPronouns! You deserve to be referred to by your preferred pronouns, and nothing should change that.

Don't give up, one day you'll find those people who accept you for who you are. <3
I think if I could get away with it, neopronouns would work best for me as well.  I'm actually pretty distressed that ""they"" win the cultural war over neopronouns and those seem to be dying as a result.

I don't feel I can ask people to use neopronouns because they have become so rare it seems an unreasonable ask, now.

I absolutely respect those for whom they is the correct pronoun, but it doesn't fit me personally.  So I've gone with ""she/her or he/him"" as the next best option for me.
Damn, A Femboy and a Bear? That's a weird (in a good way) combination. Also Ayy, Another Femboy!
:D <3
This me inverted.

I'm never really put out by he/him, but when I get a she/her, something just *clicks.* 

Gonna see a therapist about that after the holidays. 😬🤞
This is me exactly. I don’t feel strongly about pronouns and I am used to being read as female. I’m only out as nb in a few circles, where people mostly they/them me which is fine although it doesn’t feel super ‘me’. But since I cut my hair short I sometimes get he/him’d and that always gives me a buzz! (Except when I first cut it SUPER short and got he/him’d consistently and I hated that too. Felt like just being in a different box)
It's okay. People all over the world are making gender neutral NeoPronouns in their native languages. Like some Spanish people are using ""Elle"" as singular They/Them. Or how some Swedish people are using ""Hen"" as singular They/Them.

Don't worry, it will get better. <3
Thats so cool! I’m also fluid, but don’t like going with a single pronoun at a time because it feels a bit weird. Currently i just stick to she/they, he/they and he/she because it fits the best for me.
I'll use it/its for you if you want! <3

Snow is Very Pog, and It needs to be recognised for its Pogness.
Other

I hope that helps! :) <3
Pog! :D

And Also, Wow, an Androgyne person! I finally found one! (I regularly fluctuate into F/M Bigender/Androgyne, so it's nice to find another person like me).
Aaaa I use those pronouns :D  


and Snow/❄️/Ey but like She/They/Fae are my main ones
Yes! It does! :) <3
You could use ""Other"" since it also includes ""Multiple of the Above Categories"".

I hope that helps! :D <3
Nice! :D  <3

What's your Native language?
Yes
By only being referred to by one's Name.

E.g. If someone named Nate uses No Pronouns, You address Nate like this:

Nate went to the Grocery store to buy Groceries. Nate got Milk, Cereal, and Fruits. Nate decided to get Oranges, Apples, and Bananas because Nate likes those fruits.

It's kinda weird, but some people want to be referred to this way, and there's nothing wrong with that. It might sound strange at first, but we have to respect them and if someone says that that person uses No Pronouns, then refer to that person by their name.

I hope that helps! :D <3
You do in fact, just use their name. 

Example:  If someone's name was Nate, and Nate didn't use any pronouns you'd refer to Nate by Nate's Name.

And If you don't know someone's name, well, just ask that person for that person's name. 

I hope that helps! :) <3
Yeah, if someone uses No Pronouns, you just use that person's name. It's weird, but still valid. :D <3

I hope that helps! :D <3
It will happen one day! You're still Valid and your Pronouns deserve to be respected! <3

Ocean's choice to not use any pronouns is completely valid, and Ocean deserves to have Ocean's pronouns respected. (Idk your name so I'll just use Ocean)

Anyways, You're Valid! :D <3
You just use the persons name. So if your name was ocean, you’d say: ocean went swimming today. Ocean got cold pretty quickly though because it’s the middle of winter and ocean didn’t bring any warm clothes. Silly ocean.
I feel the same

being fat and hairy while also wearing baggy hoodies and skirts and painting my nails? the entire thing just feels warm lmao
Ey thank you!! :) feels cool haha
Shoot I thought you were using Snow/Snows pronouns lol  


I use snow/snows pronouns, which is why I tripped
Yeah same, it's nice to find other androgynes.
Do you get people making fun of you for having a literal snowflake as your emoji pronoun?
*Sigh* German. It sucks a lot lol.

What pronouns do you use in German?

\- Another German NB
Well, it's nice that people like you are making an effort to improve it! :)
You're Welcome! :D <3
Heyhey, another androgyne here! 👀
Glad to hear that it was only your mum lol
I use dey/denen/deren. The best approximation/equivalent of they/them I've found so far (for me at least). I should clarify, I only really use them in my queer support group. I'm planning to come out to family and friends soon though and hopefully implement those pronouns as well
Thanks, that's very nice of you. :)
Ah, ok. Do they work well in spoken German?

I personally prefer ey, ex or x in written form but haven't had a chance to try neutral pronouns in spoken German yet. Hopefully I can come out soon to my partner and family.
You're Welcome! :D <3
They work well for me. ""Dey"" in Akkusativ sounds a bit clunky, but the rest fits nicely imo. Not a big fan of x personally because it doesn't flow as well"	rg2619	NonBinary	559	0.99	2021-12-14 07:30:55
A random student came up to me and asked if I used They/Them pronouns. After I said yes they gave me this pin. I nearly cried.		"That's amazing!
Aww how sweet. I e been thinking about getting a pronoun pin that said he/they. Right now those are my preferred pronouns.
Are you a teacher? Im thinking about becoming a teacher and I always worry about what title students would call me by, if not just my name. I'm a young adult and I just generally wonder what people will call me by in professional contexts in the future. Right now they call me ""miss"" and it grates like sandpaper.
That's awesome. Meanwhile I wear a they/them pin and still never get gendered correctly.
Nice. I have a ton of them I bought so I could put some on my work lanyard.
That's wonderful! I wonder if I can find it online. It's such a great design.
Am I the only one who's really bothered by the purple stripe not being above the black stripe?
Love this one! It’s came in a three pack from target last pride month with she/her and he/him ones
I love it when people can just tell from looking at you, it's the most validating, especially because I go to an ""all"" [agab] school, it has happened once on a day I wasn't feeling particularly pass-worthy, so it really turned that day around for me
This is so cute I wanna hug that student and make them my best friend.
I use mx. or 'mix'. I'm also of mixed heritage so it ties a bunch of my life together. I also think it may have gotten me out of jury duty because I kept correcting the attorneys 😂
No, I'm a student in a small town. Unfortunately not able to come out except to my closest friends. I just put Mx. if people ask a lot.
Late to this but I'm a 1st yr teacher, went by Ms. this year but going to see if I can just go by the surname next year. Not sure I could use mx, it grates on me a bit too unfortunately and sounds a bit too much like ms for my taste
Hah, I feel you, I always wear one on my pants but still get misgendered. The pin OP posted is awesome though!
It's from target, I have the same one.

I found one set on [Ebay](https://www.ebay.com/itm/SET-OF-6-LGBT-Pride-Pronoun-Pins-NEW/303447008263?hash=item46a6d9e407:g:JSoAAOSw8q9eH3kf), but they are more expensive than they where in the store.
That's blue, not purple. So it's probably not referencing the nonbinary flag.
I like the ""mix"". Haven't seen that before. I recently discovered I've always been NB, without really realizing it. However, I have to ask.. who isn't a mixed heritage these days? Now.. If we could all just accept mixed genders like we accept mixed heritages.. That will be a beautiful day!
Yeah maybe I need to wear one of my flashier pins at school...
Wait, what?!? Where do they stock them?
Yup. Got mine at Target last year and I've been wearing it next to my name badge at work ever since.
Amazing! Thank you so much for letting me know. I'll keep my eyes peeled!
I still think it's purple. Guess we'll just have to agree to disagree.
plenty of people! it's pretty common to have two parents with a similar cultural background.
They have different ones every pride month.
It's purple irl just looks blue due to the lighting."	fe1bdx	NonBinary	558	1.0	2020-03-05 20:17:32

Oh my god where did you get that shirt
I love your hair!! You look wonderful ❤️

wow just looked at their website so cool! im a us 10/12 do you think an xl would fit? usually i get 1x but they dont have it :(
Right? I need that shirt, it's amazing ❤️
ahh that's awesome! wyn(n)s unite!!
aw thank you!! nice to meet you too Violet!
[https://shop.morningwitch.com/](https://shop.morningwitch.com/)!
hmm I'm not sure. it's weird that you couldn't find your size :( I thought most items go up to 2 or 3xl, but I know the shop can sell out quick sometimes. 

did you check the sizing chart? that might help if you know your waist/height/etc measurements. I also like to look at clothes I already own and compare their measurements to the sizing chart, since that can give a better estimate for fit than the listed size alone. 

for reference, I'm wearing a small and I generally wear a us men's small or women's small/medium. it's a bit loose and long on me, but in a nice comfy way, not a swimming-in-clothes way.

idk if that helped, but I hope you can get a cool shirt (or pants or sweater) that fits well! I know you're going to rock it!!"	l20lhb	NonBinary	562	1.0	2021-01-21 15:28:42
Just found out Indya Moore is NB and uses “they” pronouns! And is the first trans person on the US cover of Elle magazine!		"Be sure to check out Indya’s acting work — ie. stream season 1 of POSE on Netflix!! S2 airs in a month on FX !!!! 🤩 Such a beautiful, nuanced show with an incredibly talented cast of queer and trans people of color. It deserves all the love and praise
too bad they're not on the cover of '[Leur](https://translate.google.com/#view=home&op=translate&sl=en&tl=fr&text=them)'.
It's so awesome! Though it is strange that Elle decided to use she/her pronouns for the piece...
Omg that’s so cool! :D
Should be the Iel magazine

It's funny cuz elle literally means ""she"" xp
Not available on Canadian Netflix 😪
Bahaha it's been a while since French class so I had to read this twice, well played.
in french it would be “iel” - “leur” is plural
We pretty much said the same thing but I got downvoted 🤔
From [the Elle article](https://www.elle.com/culture/movies-tv/a27378298/indya-moore-transgender-pose-interview/):
> A note on gender pronouns: Indya is nonbinary and prefers to use “they” and “them,” but is also navigating how that works in a society that has long oriented around cisgender or binary trans identities. Most people around Indya use “she,” which Indya says is fine to use throughout this story. 
Would have been cooler if Elle did it the right way tho
Exactly. Elle really missed an opportunity to show their support of the non-binary community. Indya even _said_ they preferred to go by they pronouns, Elle still decided to use she/her in the article...plus wrote a really awkward explanation about using not her preferred pronoun. Makes me sad.
I agree that I'm upset they Indya or Elle didn't use they/them, but it's ultimately Indya's choice what to use. I understand external pressures and what not, but if Indya felt it better to use she/her, then that's the right way imo.
The footnote makes it sound more like they said it was okay than said it was their preference
I feel so fucking bad for Indya because I'm sure they have to let things slide like this all the time and it's not fair. :/"	bnkgww	NonBinary	549	1.0	2019-05-12 02:59:55
I don't want my pronouns respected	"I usually work remote but I went into the office today and got misgendered a lot. And it sucks because I'm coming up on a year of being on HRT and my voice has changed a lot. But I still get misgendered. and my boss has been really good about getting people to respect my pronouns and people apologize for not but.... that's not what I want

I realized I don't want people to respect my pronouns

I want people to see me as my gender and act accordingly. 

now, I realize that genders don't come with set pronouns. but people call me the pronouns of my agab because they still see me as my agab. so in some ways it kind of does, at least in cis society. 

it's just so frustrating. I hate that I'm filled with anxiety every time I go into work. I shouldn't have to over perform gender just to be seen as myself. I hate this."	"totally felt that last line as an enby who’s trying to present more masculine even tho i have long hair. like why i should i cut my hair to be seen as more masculine. this society is in shackles when it comes to gender.
I understand what you mean. I want to live in a world where gender doesn't mean what it means here. I want to live in a world where people see me as me.

for those who don't want to click, it's a super short thread by @leannekmho 

""when i ask you to use they/them, i’m not asking you to indulge my pronouns while you still view me as a woman. i’m asking you to pay attention, question, unlearn your ideas of gender to fit me in your worldview, which,,, news flash! it’s 2021 you should’ve been doing that already

which includes thinking critically about how you use gendered language not just for me but around me—addressing groups as ladies and gentlemen, making jokes about how men are like this and women are like that, assuming gender stereotypes about other people in front of me, etc.""

They worded it a little harshly (which is entirely justified, it's extremely frustrating!) so I wouldn't want to send this to a confused but wanting to be allied person, but reading this helped me figure out how to explain it to people who are genuinely trying but don't quite get it
This!!! I agree with this. I don’t care if a person who still sees me as a woman respects my pronouns, cause that’s not the point. I just want to be seen as non binary, genderless. If they can’t even do that, there is no point.
Honestly, I want people to call me by my name  – not my pronouns. I present my birth gender, and while I've accepted male pronouns, it doesn't describe me enough. Sure, I'm male, but I'm also not male. I'm partly female, and I'm partly something else altogether. I am me. Not a  set of pronouns.
This!! Tired of people memorizing my pronouns instead of seeing me as non-binary. Sorry you’ve got to go through this friend
I’d like to add, some people may see your gender as non-binary but may accidentally say the wrong pronoun. For example, if your thinking not to call someone he/she, and due to the nature of the word he/she being on your mind, you might accidentally say it. It’s happen to me in the past with a friend, and I felt very silly for saying something I wasn’t trying to say.
I totally feel that. Especially when we get new people at work. And I'm 8 months pregnant at the moment so it adds an extra layer of confusion to everyone who knows. Sending good vibes your way, you beautiful human.
ill take any and all pronouns, i just dont want to be treated differently because of percieved gender. i want to be treated as a person, not a male person or a female person.
I would like a world no one would dare even guess. Pronouns are literally always asked for, or neutral ones used.
I like your username
Wow ... You worded that so well! It hit me like a train.
There is a ungenuine feel when people need to be reminded to not misgender you. I can imagine the self-doubt and frustration this brings.

Sending my love, I hope the future surrounds you with less idiots and asshats. <3
Yes this is what I want too
I feel like this exactly. I just want others to see me the way I see me.
To be honest, I wish gendered pronouns didn’t exist. It would be so much simpler. I recognize that it can be validating for people to be gendered correctly by the language others use, but too often I find that it starts to feel a bit performative.

We want to hear others use the “correct” pronouns when referring to us, because it shows that they recognize our identity. But at the same time, people can be instructed to perform respect without actually believing it. Or even if there is a genuine desire to be respectful, it hurts when people have to ask or be corrected because it means they already see us a certain way.

Unfortunately the gender binary is so deeply ingrained in society that we can’t really help assigning a binary gender to people in our minds based on their appearance and voice. Speaking as someone who fully believes that the binary is BS, I still find it impossible not to do this. And that really hurts.

I don’t want people around me to feel like they’re walking on eggshells, or pretending to see me in a way they don’t for my benefit. Honesty is really important to me and I hate the idea of being treated like I have glass bones, especially if it’s only because PC culture says people have to.

At the end of the day I just want to be seen for who I am, and cis society makes that pretty much impossible. To me, pronouns are just another symptom of a broken system and should be phased out entirely. Abolish labels, abolish stereotypes, abolish gender. Okay rant over, cheers!
I agree!  I don't think using the right pronouns always comes down to respect.  I mean, you don't call it respect to call a cis woman ""her"" or a cis man ""him"" so why does it suddenly become respectful to call a nonbinary person what they are?
On a related note, I have the same problem at school right now.  I'm AFAB and like pretty clothes and accessories and though I've had top surgery I wear bulky sweater in cooler months to keep warm.  I wore a necklace with my pronouns on it, but no one really noticed.
I worry about that so much. I try not to think about it but sometimes it by gets to me
I can get behind the ""I don't want my pronouns respected, I want my gender respected"" - I have a frenemy who acknowledges me as nonbinary and transmasc, but is otherwise just ""too lazy to use my preffered pronouns"" (his words, not mine)
So fucking true I really resent having to do more to make people understand or accept me
i get that 100%
every time my mom misgenders or deadnames me or my brother, she says ""im sorry, i didnt mean it."" the thing is, though, she does mean it. she still sees us as ""the girls"" when thats not what we are.
add this to: things I felt but couldn't put a name to until someone else put it into words
afab here, and just got a buzz cut in an attempt to look more masc. not only did it not work, it somehow makes me look more like a woman. 

its like I'm giving off ""40 year old lesbian in a committed relationship and a mortgage"" vibes if that makes any sense.
ME TOO and it really pisses me off. If I had short hear when I bind and pack I would probably pass with a mask but of course the long hair tips people off. But I don’t WANT to cut it.
Yes this 👆
Agreed. That would be the thing.
Ooooh yes! This 👆
sure, that may be the case for some people, but it was not here. it's not a matter of something accidentally slipping up once and then doing it right, it's them misgendering me consistently, apologizing, and then continuing to consistently misgender me.
Oh. As NB and having carried/birthed two mini humans. It can be so confusing for other people. Just cause I decided to do that doesn’t mean I’m no longer NB. I remember hearing other pregnant people say things like, “it gave me an excuse to stop shaving.” I didn’t shave before, so… “Oh, you get to wear men’s clothes because they’re more comfortable”. Or even my husbands’ shorts. Nope, these are mine. I also had someone give me a couple nursing dresses that were so frilly, pastel, covered in a micro floral print. Donated those without even trying them on. They belonged on Little House on the Prairie."	qinyj3	NonBinary	553	0.99	2021-10-29 22:26:19
my partner and i! we're both nb and use they/them pronouns!		"im really scared to post this because i do present very femm, but its just the way i look! Im still nonbinary and my appearance doesnt change that at all. 
Also, my pard'ner makes all of their jewlery themselves and they sell it on depop!
Femme 👏 presenting 👏 enbies 👏 are 👏 VALID 👏👏👏 (and adorable!!)
So cute! Never forget that how you present has 0 bearing on your identity.
Presentation isn't gender! Also you look so adorable and happy together. It makes my heart melt.
Omg hi friend! It's so nice to see ur wonderful face on here ❤️❤️❤️
I'm a Non-Binary but I look very male.

Y'all are such a lovely couple!!
Seeing people here who are very femme but still ID as nonbinary makes me feel better, it makes me feel like I count too and I'm not just some phony :) thank you for being brave & posting!
Hey, no need to be afraid! I present very femm myself but I'm still as nonbinary as anyone else who is! Nonbinary doesn't have a look, it's just who you are! Be yourself and fuck the people who say otherwise! <3

~~I am interested in your partner's jewelry btw~~
Which one is you? The blonde or the black one?
This needs to be upvoted more!

trying out new pronouns (she/her, they/them), but I do feel worried people will just use he/him since I have a deep voice and facial hair :( also here's a picture where I feel pretty ⭐		"I feel it my voice is deep too but i still go by she/they! You do you hun
Gorgeous curls, friend! What's your hair routine like?
You're so beautiful! Your hair is gorgeous! And you are so valid ❤️
Some people might try to gatekeep. I like to think of it as a super power: assholes cannot help but reveal themselves as assholes within seconds of meeting me. This picture is amazing and you look lovely :)
You look so beautiful! :D I adore the hair - head and facial :D  


I get misgendered a LOT as a hyperfeminine masculine nonbinary person. I sigh a lot and sometimes get snippy if I'm super worn out that day. Oh well. :)
Even with a deep voice and facial fair you can use she/her pronouns! If that feels right to you, then go for it, you look amazing and so so valid!
I too have facial hair and a deep voice, so I very often get misgendered. I am happier with they/she though!
You have the same hair type and haircut as me , I found my hair soulmate
you're so pretty!!!! 🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰💚💙💚🖤💕💕💞💙🧡❤️❤️💛🖤💕💗💚💗🤍💙💕💛💝💞💙💕💕💙💘💝💛💟💝💙🖤💖💕💙🖤🧡💕💙🖤❣️🧡💕🖤💕💙💞💝💚💜🖤💛
fuck transphobes❤️
Super cute!
Miss, (that works, right?) no matter what people assume, you do you.
You're absolutely stunning!
You have a very pretty face and gorgeous hair! I know a lot of people don't use my preferred pronouns but the people closest to me do and it makes me super happy. I hope you find your people.
Are, not feel! Also,.. yeah, same with the deep voice. But honestly, most people will respect your pronouns if you tell them. I live in a really rural, old-fashioned area, and even the designated a-holes respect my pronouns!
She’s so beautiful 💘
This outfit 
It’s everything
I get the voice thing. Mine is too high and squeaky but I still go by he/him. I'm glad I have such supportive friends and partners honestly 🥺
i'm afab and went on T to make my voice deeper and i still go by she/they! do what makes you comfortable. and you do look very pretty
Beautiful!!!!!
that's true, pronouns should be respected regardless of appearances and how we sound, dammit! 😊 thank you love
also your username... *chefs kiss*
thank you 💗 I simply follow the curly girl method. :) I have a post on the r/curlyhair subreddit and I have written out my routine in lots of detail if you'd like to read it ^-^
thank you cuddly cow uwu 💗
aw that's a nice way of looking at it!! instead of thinking you're gonna go through hassle for being who you are, just thinking well this is an asshole filter and it will reveal to me who's a good person. I really like that! thanks :)
thank you :) ugh that sucks. what pronouns do you go by? btw you're so pretty :)
thank you love :) it definitely makes me feel nice and cute when people call me she/her. thank yeweewwww
ugh that sucks. I often get ""bro""ed or ""man""ed by people who are like grocery store ppl or ppl I haven't told my pronouns to. but hey, twins! lol
oh slay :))) if you wanna talk hair, lemme know
thank you 😊😊😊 I love being called pretty 💗 (hope I don't get banned for using emojis lol) I hope I find them too :)
Whovian! I can't wait for the Xmas special - wait is it still happening now? 
that's lovely :) and encouraging to hear, thanks!
hehehehe thank yew 💖
I try 👸
I've heard about voice training, but I'm dubious on whether it works, maybe it's a long term thing - but also I like my voice, just not the misgendering!

My friend made me this because she used the wrong pronouns for me.		"“Llama make it up to you”
Wow. Most of my friends don't even realize, and it's either that or laughing in my face. Best Friend. Ever.
I have a friend who misgenders herself constantly and me as well. She, for some reason, cant get a hold on changing pronouns. I know for a fact theres no ill intentions behind it (since she does it to herself too) but you all know the feeling of not hearing the right pronouns. Also, I find our pronouns the hardest to switch to. Him to her, easy. Her to him, easy. Anything to they, super hard. I even misgender myself because I find they/them so hard to switch to. 
Apology Llama 💖
If it's heart felt be sure to show forgiveness, screaming and then silence. If not, 'caaaaaaarl misgendering hurts people.""
Teehee 
Reminds me of Carl from Jimmy Neutron 
Sweet! You're a lucky one!
This one's a keeper. 
I love this! It goes to show how someone is sincerely apologetic and will not forget the llama i.e. your pronouns
Apolollama!
Llama be there for you.
Not exactly ""friends""
Same here.
I sometimes misgender myself on accident sometimes.
Sometimes I think it’s just an engrained habit

Like the people who quit smoking but at times they reach into their pocket to grab a smoke?

Just nonbinary bean trying to live my best life! What are your experiences in coming out and discussing your pronouns with family and friends? <-- I'm scared to do this... so would love to hear other's experiences good or bad!		"I came out to my closest friends either in person or via text. I was just like - yo I’m non-binary, I’m using they/them pronouns. If you mess up nbd just do you best. I’m being chill about it and it really doesn’t change anything other than that. Then I came out to everyone else on Instagram or just not at all. When I come out to people now I just am like “hey I use they them pronouns, how are you?”. 

Most of my friends were chill and just memed- being like makes sense you have always been shit at being a girl. My family has been chill as well, I was surprised at how my mom hasn’t been super extra about it. I didn’t come out to everyone, like my in laws just because I’m still nervous but I don’t care if someone else tells them. I’m never going to come out to my dad because we have a bad relationship. 🤷 for context I came out at 27.
Nothing has really changed. I've said to my mum/girlfriend that I'd prefer people use they/them when referring to me, but let's be honest, most of the time when people do that you're not there.

I haven't even bothered to mention it at work, one of my colleagues still occasionally calls me someone else's name because we're the only two people of the same sex who work there, we look nothing alike.

If I tried to explain to her about being Non-binary I think her head would explode.

We have a work group chat so I could mention it but I think it would make things difficult.
I recently came out to family and close friends and everyone was very understanding and supportive. For context: I cut toxic and harmful people like my father out of my life before that, so that was on the one hand a big factor in being able to accept myself and on the other hand I have a supportive group of people around me. Was still hella nervous. Pronouns weren't an issue, since in my native language there isn't really a ""they/them"" option and in English I go by they/them as well as he/him (I'm amab).
I came out to my friends and my wife. My friends were crazy supportive, my wife... not so much. We're still together and working through it, and she's gotten a lot better, but I'm not sure I'll ever be able to forget her reaction. Therapy helps.
I came out to my friends first and they were really great at trying to respect my pronouns and use my new name.

My parents were really unsupportive at first (told me they didn’t believe in they/them pronouns for singular people). They looked into it and researched it and then started using my pronouns and new name - they slip up sometimes but the fact that they’re trying is all that matters to me!!

Coming out to my grandparents tomorrow - could go horribly or not 😳
My experience was mostly positive. I'm very fortunate to have a supportive family and group of friends. My family doesn't have much exposure to the LGBTQ+ community so they had a lot of questions, but they're well-intentioned.
Everyone who lives in my house (My Husband's family) knows, and I made a post on instagram, on which maybe 10 people follow me. Unfortunately its just not a conversation I'm ready to have with my family. They have a lot of homophobia that stems from a strict old school Catholic upbringing. When they found out I was marrying a Trans man, I noticed a distinct difference in the way they spoke to me afterwards. I don't think it will be that way for you, or at least I genuinely hope not. Its totally understandable you're frightened of coming out.

I would say it like this: Don't jump in the pool until you're sure you're ready to swim. And when it comes time to dive, jump with everything you are. And be ready for chance that the water is a little colder than you expected.

And of course we'll always be here to support you 💙 ❤ 

Much love

At first, my parents were not super accepting, but over the years, they have really come around and try their best to use they/them pronouns, and have even started using my chosen name! That means a whole lot to me. I came out to my close friends first, and then at work, I just changed my name in the system, which makes all my emails come from my chosen name, and changed my bio to my chosen name and used they/them pronouns! Literally everyone just started calling me Ellis after that, no questions asked, which has been so wonderful, and I feel very lucky to have such a great workplace. I'm 29, but came out as nonbinary in my earlier 20s. I'm also very grateful that all of my friends were so supportive and validating, because I know a lot of people have had to find out the hard way that some of their friends were toxic and shitty.
Sorry, I can’t help you because I haven’t come out to a single person over the 3-4 years of knowing my gender :(
I recently came out to my whole class and everyone was really nice and supportive
I like your face, it looks nice lol xD

With regards to coming out, the worst part was s bit of awkwardness here and there, but I've gotten though it without many issues so far really.
For me, it’s been almost 3 years since coming out and my family and friends have been supportive since day 1 which I am super thankful - and very lucky - to have. I just put it in a letter so I could say everything I wanted to say, and then had a conversation with my mum about it all after I had stopped crying. With my friends I sent a message via text and they were all just like sure no problem. Most of the time pronouns are fine with the occasional slip up but honestly for a lot of people it just takes some time and getting used to
I never really had the chance to come out at home cause 2 months after I realized I was bisexual they found out. But the reactions of me being non-binary and bisexual are positive so far!
The B E A N!
my friends who are all lgbtq themselves were all super supportive. My bf was at first mostly confused and a bit slow in accepting it (since he had no previous information or experience on that whle thing) but after learning some stuff about it he became supportive. My mum freaked out  even tho she is the only lgbtq friendly person in my family lmao so I haven't really talked to her about it anymore and I haven't come out to the rest of my family cause I wanna see how long it takes them to notice smt lmao

Honestly, coming out is scary and can go in a direction you didn't expect, but can also positively surprise you. Take as much time as you need and remember that the whole thing is about you, so its yoir decision in the end who and how you want to come out too, you're in full controll about that :)
I've come out to 2 people so far and it's gone well. But then I chose those people because I knew they would be accepting.

My parents don't understand people being trans yet, so I feel like the concept of nonbinary is beyond their comprehension.

My main concern is that I'm part of a really conservative church and most of my friends are from church. And while I know the majority of them think homosexuality is a sin, I don't really know how they feel about gender. But it ain't looking good tbh
Dude, ditto. 
I am 27 right now, and I dont think I can ever come out to my dad. He is very conservative and inflexible and just wants me to get married and give him grandkids, even though I don't want any of that for myself. 

I came out to my mom who is incredibly accepting and watches trans tiktoks with me lol and mentioned it to my brother, but I am scared to ask them and anyone to call me they/them. Not sure why. I think I am having trouble identifying if they/them is best for me or if she/her, they/them, and he/him is all fine. It's hard to separate being raised with certain pronouns from what is actually me. I think English just doesn't have enough ough pronoun options in popular speech. I don't know, maybe I'm not there yet, but I def know just she/her is not right. 

I really appreciate your comment. It has definitely been a weird but wonderful journey and I welcome all the input and experiences of others as I make my own way and try to be my best self <3
I'm so happy to hear people are respecting you pronouns and your new name! Even though your parents weren't receptive at first, it's good they educated themselves and try to do better. That's awesome!

Wishing you luck and sending positive vibes on coming out to your grandparents! 💛
Not at all ready to swim yet but that's a great metaphor. I just wish I had known these things about myself when I met my wife and not after years together. 

You would probably like this song by sophie:

That was wonderful advice. Thank you! 💛 
I have extended family as well like that I don't think I could explain that to... I'm not even gonna jump into that pond! 😅 

Positive vibes, friend!
I am sorry to hear that as this sounds like something you want for yourself. What types of barriers do you face?
I am so happy to hear that!
I think the awkwardness is pretty scary sometimes. Thanks, anxiety 😅 

Glad it's been pretty smooth for you otherwise though and thanks! 💛
I am a very anxious person in general so that makes it hard but mainly because I don’t know what my parents think about nonbinary people or of they even have heard of it. And for my one and only friend I think she might be transphobic but I don’t know because we never really talk about anything related to LGBTQ but I’ve picked up on small things that indicate that she is. So yeah I am too scared plus I think they will react badly.
Np yw :D <3
 I get what you mean, the anxiety is big for me as well... I don't want to impose on others even if it is good for myself. I'm so sorry you don't have the support in your current social circle. I hope as you grow you can reach out and find new friends who are supportive of you! <3"	lj4qd4	NonBinary	539	1.0	2021-02-13 17:21:34
Boyfriend thinks I am faking being nonbinary.	I’ve never had someone be openly aggressive to me about me being non-binary before until tonight. It feels really bad. This person said people think I’m a joke for using they/them pronouns, and that I am definitely cis because I present cis. He screamed in my face. I don’t blame people for misgendering me because I have long hair, usually shop in the women’s clothing section, and wear makeup. I don’t ever correct people when they use she/her to me, even though it makes me uncomfortable when people call me a woman. I like presenting femme. But to have someone tell me my identity is just… a lie… hurts on a really deep level. That I am being a bad ally for identifying as non-binary. That I am stealing someone else’s identity. That I am a fake. It really hurts. And that other queer people are also questioning my identity. I feel insecure. I want to cut off all my hair. I don’t want anyone to look at me or think I’m a woman ever again.	"Thanks everyone for your supportive words. I have decided to break up with the boyfriend. This has just been one painful thing on top of many other painful things, and I know I deserve to have someone in my life who respects me and loves me for who I am. I reached out to a few real life friends tonight and they all agreed too. Breakups are hard but it will be worth it to stand up for myself and show myself some respect. 💕 Thanks again all.
I’m sorry you’re going through this. This is emotional and verbal abuse. Massive red flag.
Hello I am a they/them, masc-presenting AFAB enby. I don't own any make up or dresses. I have short hair and work in a male-dominated field.

You can tell your boyfriend that I think your identity is 100% valid, and there is no such thing as ""stealing"" someone else's identity. I don't even know what that means. 

Go return your boyfriend and get your money back.
I'm sorri 🤗

Honestly it sounds like he's afraid of you being anything other than cis and this relationship might not last 😥
Boyfriend sounds like an ass.

Edit: congratulations on dumping the jerk
Hey that’s a huge red flag. That type of behavior is completely unacceptable and would make me afraid for my safety. I’m so sorry that you are feeling so invalid and insecure after what he did to you. Please consider the fact that your BOYFRIEND  is the one making you feel so bad about yourself. Is that something you want in a partner?

Please sit down and think deeply about what you want in a boyfriend.  What would a loving and fulfilling relationship look like to you? If your boyfriend is not living up to that standard then he needs to go. The bare minimum in my eyes is not getting in my face to verbally abuse and invalidate me. Please be safe and look after your own health and happiness. His behavior is horrifying.
Ahhhhhh congratulations on being single now OP! Sorry you had to deal with that stupid ex
As an AFAB fem-presenting enby, I'm gonna jump in and say OP totally didn't steal my identity either. 

The search to find the poor enby whose identity was stolen continues, but things aren't looking good guys, we might never find them. OP, on the bright side, you are on your way for a brilliant career as a professional thief cause I must admit this first heist, although amatorial, was absolutely flawless :)

(In case it wasn't clear i was 100% sarcastic pls don't blast me thank u)

Also I'm happy to hear you dumped him lol
that's an unacceptable way to treat someone. of course youre valid <3
Ditch the boyfriend. You should never be yelled at for your identity, and honestly should generally not be yelled at at all (barring being about to injure yourself or others)
Heard you broke up with him, which I am glad to hear, because you deserve better. It's never easy to leave someone you love though, or even just someone you care deeply about. I hope you're doing alright. Just know you are loved and supported here. Also, you'll find someone who loves you just the way you are eventually, don't forget that - how you identify is valid and there is nothing wrong with it.
Good that you're breaking up. Not accepting you for you isn't something a partner will suddenly change. 

> that other queer people are also questioning my identity

Those people are assholes. Nonbinary isn't ""one"" thing...

> I want to cut off all my hair. I don’t want anyone to look at me or think I’m a woman ever again.

You can't control others, only yourself. Don't cut your hair just because others are jerks if you like having long hair. Even if you cut your hair off, some people will just find another ""reason"" to misgender you.
Hey I’m an AFAB femme non-binary who solely uses they/them but doesn’t correct people when they say she/her. I have long hair and shop in the women’s section because I think women’s clothes are cute. 

I’m non-binary as fuck. And so are you.
I have a boyfriend who supports my gender identity and doesn’t feel uncomfortable about me being myself completely, autism included.  I hope that you will find someone like that for yourself.
So glad you're breaking up. You don't need that negative energy in your life
dump his crusty ass and block him, i dont understand why you still stick around. he doesnt give a crap about you or how he makes you feel. im sorry for what he's put you through tho, your identity is valid.
Update: the deed is done. The breakup text has been sent.
I'm sorry that happened to you, I'm glad you broke up with him, he sounds shitty. You are nonbinary! Doesn't matter how you present. Just in case you need to hear it again.
I’m so sorry this happened to you. Your identity is not up for debate. 

This is also kinda the reason I’ll stay in the closet indefinitely. If my boyfriend acted like this toward me, I don’t know how I could cope.
Good riddance to him, everybody should be supported by people who love and validate them 💕
Fuck him. You could be AFAB and dress like a 60s women straight out of a kitchen utensil commercial and that wouldn't make you less of who you are.
A lot of people are saying break up with him. Don't break up with him - dump him. There's a difference.
I’m sorry you are experiencing this. As a mostly femme presenting non-binary individual who doesn’t advocate for themselves, I feel this in my soul. I just take the misgendering and laugh it off. I won’t speak out because I am non-confrontational when it comes to matters about me but I will speak out for others. 

Does this make you or I any less of our identity? No. I think it’s more of a reflection of the society we live in. Should we have to advocate for our gender identity when it is known? Should we be in positions where others knowingly misgender us and laugh about it? It’s harmful and kind of abusive and not okay. But whether or not you’re comfortable to speak against it doesn’t make you more of a “woman” or a “man”. You are still what you identify as. Their choice to accept that and behave is a reflection of their character not on your identity.
Good for you for breaking up with him. 

People can’t seem to understand that non-binary does NOT mean androgynous. It’s not a third gender that rides the line between man and woman. It simply means that you don’t identify as a man or a woman. 

Non-binary is in and of itself an extremely vague label, and IMO that’s a good thing. 

Im a non-binary person who very much looks like my AGAB, but that doesn’t make me (or you) any less of a non-binary person.
I'm so sorry. These aren't good friends or partners if they can't make room for the fact that nonbinary doesn't look like one singular thing and one can present differ ways and be nonbinary. You deserve room to express yourself authentically and be affirmed by people who truly love and see you. 

You aren't fake and you aren't invalid.
What a prick. Glad you're dumping his sorry ass
I'm so relieved to come to the comments to see you kicked him to the curb. Good for you. I present femme 80% of the time, still an enby. You don't owe anyone androgyny.
Tell him the only thing you’re faking is your feelings for him. You deserve someone supportive.
Hi, Im also nonbinary and present femme because well, making myself appear androgynous takes time, money, and effort that I don't have right now. I use any/all pronouns and mostly just cringe when someone calls me a woman or girl.

I'm sure others have said it, but I will again anyway. You don't owe anyone androgyny. Present how you want to for whatever reasons you want to. You aren't stealing someone else's identity. A huge point of being nonbinary is that you get to define your own expression, whether that's within or outside of typical gender norms. 

I'm glad you're dropping the boyfriend.
I just wanted to drop a comment to say presentation does not equal gender, and you don’t owe anyone androgyny.

I struggled with my gender identity for a while, finally settling on gender-fluid (though my personal experience is somewhat bi-gender as well), and even on days that I am male, which is most days, I present femme because I don’t feel like I need to reject “women’s” clothing in order to be a man.  The fact that I have dysphoria and would be willing to get my tits cut off is proof enough for me (though I’m not saying that you have to have dysphoria to be under the trans umbrella).

I read through some of the comments, and I’m glad you’re cutting off your relationship with someone so judgmental.  I wish you the best of luck moving forward!
I apologize 4 the queer ppl whom say such and wanna assure you that you're 100% valid.
You mean ex-boyfriend
The boyfriend sucks a lot and I’m happy you are breaking up with him. If you have no attachment to your hair and like the idea of presenting more androgynous, short hair is something I’ve liked and has made me feel better about presenting femme still as well :) most importantly though present however you want. Non-binary doesn’t look like anything, non-binary breaks the gendered need to stuff everyone in boxes. You can be a femme non-binary person. It’s okay.
How are you doing? I think we are all here for moral support 💜
I can tolerate a lot of wrong assumptions because there's much I'm not ready to share, and even more I am not sure how to share and show; but not from a partner. A partner should hear me, not scream my wrongness.
This person sounds hurtful and to be honest abusive. Very glad to see you decided to end things with this person. 

You know who you are, don't let assholes dictate to you who you are.
I'm sorry that other ""queer"" people think this as well. They're probably cis gay dudes lmao
Tell him to eff off and stop being such an immature twat, you deserve better. Presentation and gender aren't the same thing, and nonbinary is an umbrella term for a bajillion different genders, anyways.
Sorry this happened to you. You should never have to cut your hair or get a surgery or not wear gender oriented clothes or not do gender oriented things just to be “more non-binary.” Anyone who tells you any different doesn’t even know what they’re talking about. Doing any of the above will never ever make you less enby.
Yeah sometimes friends and family for me are like this. I mean they don’t try to misgender me on purpose but it’s not like an active practicing either where they literally identify me using “they/them” as part of their speech to me and I cut off all my hair so lmao. I identify as she/they because I think it’s too hard for most of them to use anything else. I am very fortunate to have a partner who supports me and even offers his clothes to me. Sometimes I get very agitated where I have to say loudly “I’m not a girl” like I did a few times at game nights. It’s not great that you’re being ignored (too). I definitely empathize with you. Personally if my partner wasn’t able to accept and support me, I don’t think we could be together. I think your boyfriend may have issues with it because it may make him feel like he needs to question his attraction towards you, which isn’t fair. It’s just odd he’d be so belligerent towards you like it’s hurting *him*. He’s obviously embarrassed but he should be embarrassed about himself and his behavior. It’s been a journey for sure but just know you’re not alone. ❤️🏳️‍🌈
I am an afab femme presenting enby (although I’m not trying to be femme presenting but people tend to gender everything and think that I am… but I did get called a tomboy by a cis friend who didn’t know I was enby the other day so that was a nice change despite being gendered lol!) 

Anyway.. I completely get the fears of people thinking your identity is a lie and wanting to change things about yourself for people to see you differently because of that. And ultimately if that makes you the most comfortable and happy with yourself, go for it. But don’t think that you have to in order to be valid in your identity as non-binary. Because it’s called called non-binary for a reason. And outside the binary doesn’t necessarily mean you present androgynous or as the opposite gender you were assigned at birth. You can present yourself and express yourself however you want without assigning a gender to it. 

Who said that long hair is for femmes and short for mascs and that’s it for everyone? That’s the same as saying pink is automatically a girls color. Gendering everything is creating a binary. Wearing what you want and expressing yourself however you want despite traditional binary gender roles is non-binary.
Your boyfriend is not respecting you, and he is not loving you for who you are. You deserve a partner who truly loves and supports you.
That ain't your boyfriend anymore. That is a pile of refuse.
Oh bb I’m so sorry that’s just terrible. I’m glad I saw your update and you left because the level of disrespect here is astounding. Be kind to yourself, your presentation is yours and yours alone. Keep looking however makes you happy!! Sending love and validation
Cuz your boyfriend's a b*tch! No seriously that's some terrible treatment, you so deserve better! You are non-binary, you are valid, and if you can afford that, dump him as soon as you can.
pls just leave your boyfriend, you deserve better. Honestly be glad its not your parents assumed that they think know everything about you when they really dont. Last year, I told my mom that  my gender expression Androgyous and you know i thought she took pretty well or so  I thought. but  I still having those questions about it  because I wanted to feel comfortable in my own body despite me not experiencing any gender dysphoria. When I found out about Gender nonconformity made feel like I belonged int the LGBTQ community 

&#x200B;

The one thing that made me feel disappointed was my mom telling me That androgyous means non binary just  because I told her that I dont care which clothes I would wear whether if it for a female or male I would still both.............. but shockingly enough this after when I told her that I was Genderqueer.........and well It didnt go so well my mom told me that Genderqueer means that Im a lesbian  and that I was accepting theses labels for no  reason. parents are gonna make damn assumptions about you when they dont know everything about. I didnt say her that Girls, identify as nonbinary, all I want was for her to accept my gender expression and Gender identity
someone once told me something that has stuck with me for years: breakups almost always suck, but they're also almost always *good* things. the changing or ending of a relationship usually signals a time of growth or healing. in your case, it sounds like this is learning that you deserve to be respected and don't have to settle for people who don't love you the way you are.

there's no such thing as ""presenting cis,"" although I think we all know what is meant by it. having long hair doesn't make you less nonbinary anymore than having short hair does. doing makeup or dressing fem doesn't make you any less nonbinary than having a beard or dressing masc. what's ironic is nobody would have said you ""present cis"" if you were amab. why do they thing there are different ways to present nonbinary depending on our AGAB? that sounds, well, pretty binary. ignore them <3
I breathed such a sign of relief reading this comment, no joke. Anyone who is comfortable screaming at their partner, calling them a joke like that is not someone who will provide a healthy relationship. You deserve so, so much better. It'll be hard in the short term and so insanely worth it in the longterm, I am so proud of you ❤️
I’m so relieved to hear that. I’m also so sorry that you had to be let down so badly by someone who is supposed to love and support you. I hope this is just one of many steps you take to actively bring love and happiness into your life. Its a hard thing to do and none of us are perfect, but you don’t deserve to be abused in the way your boyfriend abused you. Please always remember that 💜
I agree that breakups are difficult, but if the person can’t accept you for who you are, then it’s not worth it. You’ll make it work, and you have our full support!
Good on you sweetie! If he's able to treat you like that once, he'd probably do it again, and you deserve better! Remember, no matter how femme or masc you present, you are 100% valid!❤️
Best of luck love, breakups hurt, but yeah, sometimes it's the thing which has to be done to preserve your self worth. 💜
I'm so glad to hear this. Sending all the good vibes your way.
Good for you OP <3
People suck 😥
Yes! So sorry you had to deal with that. You are valid as you are and your identity is yours to decide. Best wishes ✨
Life’s too short to stay with abusive and non-supportive partners. You made the right call. 💖
Proud of you!
Your identity is your own and I’m proud you stood up for yourself! I hope all the happiness to you, and thank you for being an inspiration in our community! ❤️🙏
You deserve happiness and supportive relationships - the right people are out there and are able to love you as you are. I’m 48 and have been happily with my wife for almost 13 years when I finally put the obvious pieces together that I was non-binary. She was and continues to be supportive and loving and understanding. And accepting as I slowly navigate my way through this, switching to he/they, etc.
It’s good that you broke up with him and tho it may be hard you don’t need that toxicity in your life. You will find someone out there for you I believe in you.
I'm so glad.  My first thought reading through this was ""holy shit why does the title not say EX-boyfriend?!?""  Nobody deserves to be treated like this, and ESPECIALLY not by their partner.  If your partner isn't affirming your gender identity, they don't deserve to be your partner.
Good for you OP! He sounds ignorant and hateful. Good riddance
I already know this sub has got your back, but I want to be another voice telling you that you are valid and you deserve so much more than what this person is giving you. Sending you so much love and strength- it will be difficult but you deserve better.
wdym ""red flag"". Instant Break up
This made me smile. Thank you. 💕
Afab, fem-presenting enby, here too. Nope, my identity is also safe.
Yes! Exactly! My most complimented shirt is from the boys section (not mens) does that make my 30 yo ass a little boy? 

I have to remind myself all the time too, especially when I wear makeup, there's no way to present nonbinary.
Honestly kind of shitty. I do feel super validated by everyone who has commented, I am not at all doubting my identity, but my feelings are really hurt by the boyfriend. I am a non confrontational person and I have been trying to work up the courage to try to talk to him to break things off, but it’s so hard. I am also worried he’s going to make fun of me to his friends (who are also my friends) and just afraid of everyone talking about me behind my back about my gender identity being fake. I feel a little traumatized tbh. I don’t want to be yelled at again.
> having long hair doesn't make you less nonbinary anymore than having short hair does.

It makes you more metal, lol. General length of hair being gendered is silly.

> breakups almost always suck, but they're also almost always good things.

To put it another way, breakups suck, but so does being in a relationship where both people aren't happy.
nah Life and people suck the most
I don’t think they disagree. A massive red flag definitely constitutes instant break up
Yesterday I neatly folded my identity and put it on a chair, but today I can't find it. OP must have stolen it. :P

OP, glad that you are getting away from this person! I think he is deeply misogynistic and loves feeling better than women. That is a reason why he gets so aggressive when you want to get out of that little box.
Crap, the mystery deepens
Exactly. There is only societies expectations, which the point of enby is to shatter 💜
Do you live together? If not, I'd say do it over text and if your friends get gossiped to, show then this post.
Yeah I know, I just heard ""Massive Red Flag"" for everything on r/Tinder
I as well, I swear I put it somewhere, but I just can’t find it anywhere, I have my sneaking suspicions about OP. Just kidding, what’s my gender (*can be*) your gender. Anyone who gets mad at you for “stealing their gender” doesn’t know how gender works. As long as your gender is what makes you comfortable, then that’s all that matters in this sense.
I did it by text. I completely cut things off and said no contact.
Alright, well probably don't take social queues from r/Tinder
Good for you! You doin okay?
Yeah, hanging in there. Luckily I have like three friends that have been talking to me through the process so I don’t feel totally alone. I have pushed people away a bit in the relationship… but luckily I have some really awesome friends that know I’m NB and support me all the way.
Good, I'm glad you have support!"	11pvntq	NonBinary	529	0.99	2023-03-13 01:03:47
Pronouns never really bothered me call me what you like just don't insult my outfit lol. Dresses and beards should be the social norm.		"Everything about this outfit is on point
People should be able to wear whatever they like, beard or no beard! I mean, people lost their shit when women wore pants for the first time but they eventually got over it -- I hope it's the same for AMAB people in dresses and things.

Also, that's a great cut on you. You look super cute.
I used to not like pronouns but then, in college, people asked me my pronouns for the first time. I said I didn’t really care but if I were to refer to myself I’d use they. And then someone else called me they for the first time and that was the first time I experienced euphoria
Cute dress. You look beautiful
Same attitude here, whatever pronouns are fine but please don’t ask in a condescending tone ‘why are you wearing men’s clothes?’ It’s not men’s clothes. They’re my clothes, I bought them!
>Dresses and beards should be the social norm.

Hell yeah they should!
Dude how could anyone insult your outfit? whenever I see you, you always look very fashionable and amazing!
Same. Literally i just don't care. Call me she, he, they. None of them MAAAATTEER. (To me)
You look stunning
I love this outfit.
I don't know why but my first thought was that you would look cute with a bow....
cute!
Oml you are absolutely right! I love your style and you look fantabulous!!!!
Credit to you it does look very grown up
You look great!
Thank you. Its not actually a top underneath its a mini dress thats way to small lol
I had this experience recently as well. I always just told people I didn't care about my pronouns, because I'm not out to most people and have gotten used to being misgendered. But about a month or so ago, a few of my closer friends got together and made it their specific goal to only use my preferred they/them pronouns, and to use them as often as possible to as many people as possible. I still rember the first time it happened in a conversation, the other person wasn't responding to it well (I live in a super conservative religious area) and my friend just kept pushing it. It was such a small moment, but seeing my friend fight for my identity like that in an everyday conversation meant the world to me. I still tear up everytime I think about that. It was the best feeling.

My future sister-in-law put “mx.” on my wedding invitation 🥺	"My partner’s brother is getting married later this year, and tonight his fiancé (and, assuming I marry my partner which I intend to do, my future sister-in-law) handed me my wedding invitation. I’m openly non-binary, but I look like what a lot of people think my AGAB (female) looks like, I use she/they pronouns, and I don’t really personally mind that most strangers probably see me as a woman. As a result I really only reveal my actual gender identity to people when I feel safe to, though it’s easy to figure out by looking at my social media. 

I’m currently visiting my partner’s family — we don’t live near them so this is only my second time meeting them. Obviously I’m not super close with any of them. My future sister-in-law must have picked up on me being non-binary, maybe through my social media or through my partner, because when she handed me the invitation my heart melted because she had put “Mx.” before my name 🥺😭 I don’t even mind “Ms.” to be honest but it was so thoughtful and I immediately thanked her for making me feel so seen. She said that she was excited when she wrote that because she had never actually used that for someone before. 

Cheers for wonderful, thoughtful allies like her, and for having them in your family ❤️❤️"	"That makes my non-binary but often cis-assumed heart so happy.
I'm new to all this but what is MX?
This is absolutely fantastic and amazing ❤️❤️
:D
This is so sweet :')
That's so sweet!
This is so sweet!! It’s so nice to know that your (future) in-laws are good people :)
Wow, that’s amazing!
Gender neutral version of Mr/Ms
OK thanks, how do you pronounce?
There are several diefferent ways to pronounce it. This survey from the annual gender census gives a pretty good overview on what is most used: [https://gendercensus.com/results/2019-mx/](https://gendercensus.com/results/2019-mx/)
I've heard it said as if it were spelled m-i-x

Hope this helps xxx
interesting. i say the schwa one, but i think ""mix"" is cooler. though thinking about it though, if someone is addressing me by title it means we're not familiar. therefore they don't know my pronouns or title anyway, so i never get to hear it said to me directly
It could be used by coworkers if you're not addressing eachother by your first name.

I also like the pronounciation mix better."	nl7hdf	NonBinary	529	1.0	2021-05-26 03:39:27

I mostly draw and paint ... I tried to commit to doing something art related every day or two this summer, but it’s been more like every two weeks if that :/ Hopefully the semester starting up will be a good motivator!
You guys are genuinely good.
Heee, I’m in babygotbacktalk! We sometimes play with Universe Ignore Her and Choked Up :) I’m glad to hear that you’re all taking the precautions to stay safe, the plague has taken a lot but it hasn’t taken our musical spirit thankfully 😅 gotta keep the talent safe! I’d love to catch a livestream of Gilt when you guys do one! Also, I have never been to a renaissance fair 👀 I had considered going to the one in NY this year but the plague put a stop to that... the food always looks soooo good

Cool! If y’all are ever in SoCal and venues start opening up my band loves play with different genres of bands!
I played for about 6 or 7 years, but I had to stop about three years ago. I would play occasionally and I tried to start again, but after I had stopped I realized just how badly it had affected my health. I am thinking of looking into mandolin, since it is the same string structure without the parts of violin that hurt me! Oh cool!
Awe thanks!! I've loved talking with you I hope you have a wonderful life and that all goes well!!♡♡
I can’t wait to hear them!
Yes! It’s mostly older work, but there is some new stuff! I’ll message you : )
Shared you all with some people I know. Yall keep up the good work.
You are so welcome!! Can you please share which makeup artists? I’m so not good at it and would love to get better at doing my makeup. 

You are so welcome. Your band reminded me of From Autumn to Ashes whom I love, so your band is awesome!!! I will keep a lookout for your IP on the 21st and I’d also love to be friends!!!
We played in SoCal when we were touring! It was a ton of fun, and hopefully we can play a show in the future!!
Oh gosh I'm so sorry it caused you difficulties with your health :( I'm glad you're looking into something else though that's hopefully a little bit better for your health!! I feel that way about guitar, if I play too long my wrists start to click :// I wish you the best with mandolin!!!
Likewise! You seem so kind and wonderful, and hope your life is wonderful and that you are happy and content in all that you do!!
Eeep! n__n
Thank you so much! That means so much :> <3
So I actually have pretty bad executive dysfunction so whenever I do my makeup I like to listen to stories, and this person, 
Bailey Sarian, is one of my favorites! If you do not like true crime stories, I would recommend not watching her, but if you do, it's called Mystery & Makeup! but she also does different types of videos that are just based on makeup stuff!!

And aaaa, thank you! That's so cool, we've actually gotten that before and it was super cool to hear different influences and stuff in their music! And yay!!!!!! Do you have instagram?!
Awesome :)
Clicking wrists suck! Thanks! I am still looking in to getting a cheap beginner one!

Oh interesting. I do like stories and true crime stories so will certainly check out Bailey. Thats so good to know I love makeup!!

Very welcome! Im glad you are cool with the reference for From Autumn to Ashes. I was hoping it would be a good thing but wasnt sure. I love their music! Sadly I dont but maybe I will start an Instagram account!!

One of my kids came out as non binary	Hello, I'm a mother of two lovely kiddos 🥰 My 15 year old son (Correct me please if I'm using wrong terms, I'm  not used to this and am looking to understand) has come out as non-binary and wishes to use they them pronouns. I totally support them! And I want to be the best parent I can for them, but they're very awkward about talking to me as they're closer with their father. Does anyone have any tips on what I can do for them to make them more comfortable? I've started using their new name and pronouns but I want to be able to accommodate them more. Thank you for reading if you came this far 🥰☺️	"With using their new name and pronouns, you are on the best way! Maybe try to not use terms like 'son'. Try to stick with more gender neutral terms like kid or child. But overall, everyone has different need and just try to listen to your kid if they don't like something you're doing. Or talk with their father about it, if he's closer to your child. Maybe he does know more about their needs :)
in terms of using son just ask, if they’re comfortable with you using son then that’s great and it works out, and if they aren’t maybe just ask what they would like you to call them.
I agree with what everyone else is saying here. It’s really best to just ask them what they’re comfortable with if you’re ever unsure. Open communication and acceptance makes this whole thing a lot easier for us. I, personally, wanted to change my presentation after I came out. I cut my hair and got a couple of new items of clothing. Your child may or may not want to do something like that, so it may be a good idea to ask at some point. Also, it’s a good idea to ask before you out them to anyone else. It’s always stressful to be outed to someone before you’re ready to tell them.

Also, I’d just like to add that you seem like a really great parent. Thank you for being so accepting. It’s really nice to see. My family weren’t great about this and it was really damaging to my already poor mental health, so I’m really glad your child will have better support. I wish my family had been more like you. 💙
definitely do some research and ask if they need anything, clothes, make up whatever. my gaurdian did research and uses my chosen name on birthday cards etc, i told her i bought a binder and she helped me with with sewing to make it fit better and told me she saw online i shouldnt wear it for too long etc. just the taught that she went out of her way to inform herself on my gender and safety binding made me feel more supported than ever.
Try to space out questions and ask if they’re okay answering them! People have great suggestions here on asking them, however, for me, I don’t like being bombarded with too many questions or questioned at not the best time so make sure they’re okay with the timing of your questions, too!

when i came out to my partner, they didn’t have questions at the time, but later asked if i was okay answering a few things they were confused about. i felt cared for that a) he wanted to ask questions and b) that he was allowing me the space to say no if i wasn’t up to it. 

i think it’s great you’re here at all, trying to navigate something different for you. thank you for being willing to learn 💜
Welcome to the sub. It warms my heart that you would come here to ask questions. I'm 29 and still deep in the closet stuck living as my agab due to medical descrimination and the fact that nobody I know in real life will even know what I'm talking about... ah well.

I wish one of my parents were like you.

Try to space out your questions for your kid, try to use neutral language whenever possible. Ask permission to ask questions, because sometimes questions can feel invasive and overwhelming. 

Maybe offer to take them for a shopping spree and let them pick out whatever they want for their new wardrobe. A lot of us want to change our gender presentation when we come out... but be understanding if they say no for now. Sometimes we want to take our time and do it piece by piece. 

And I'm afraid to say it... but your kid is going to experience harassment and bullying. There's no way out of it. It's just going to happen. The school might (probably, honestly) try to blame them for it so they don't have to deal with it. It'll be your job to go to bat for them. Be their best supporter, best defender.
Child*

Glad you're supportive, that's so sweet!!! 🥰
I’m just so thankful they have a great support system! You’re already supporting them in the best way you know how.

Your child is so lucky to have you and your husband as parents. Thank you!
Ask your child what words they want used for them (ie “son”)  who they want to know they’re non binary (don’t out them to extended family if they aren’t ready) and take them shopping!!!!
As many other wonderful comments have said, just ask what they’re comfortable with! It’s gonna be a bit awkward, but trust me, they’ll appreciate it so much
Fellow enby mom here. I’m a couple of months ahead of you in this. One thing I’ve found is to ask questions via text. Then, my offspring (their preferred term) can answer at their leisure and it doesn’t have to be awkward face to face. You could ask them if this would be an acceptable option. Or maybe you could write down all of your questions and email it or give it to them and they can answer as they feel comfortable.  Once my kid has seen that I’m very serious in my support, it has been less awkward for them to answer questions, although some of it probably stems from actually having thought about some of the questions I’ve asked too. Figuring out their preferred terms to be addressed as was the first thing we tackled. Next was who they wanted to have know, if they were going to come out publicly, whether they wanted my help coming out, etc. Third was dealing with their image via clothing and hair changes.  It is a lot for everyone to deal with, but you’re doing great. One thing I learned is how gendered and binary my language was. I’ve had to really work to not do that anymore and to find more neutral terms in many situations.  DM if you want to talk or want some online support resources.
the biggest and most important part of my transition as a nonbinary person was to let go of ideas i had about what being trans was like and what it means to not be male or female. the most important thing was and is to be myself and to do what I need to be happy, even if it's not what someone expects out of a trans person.

it would make my journey smoother if others would also unpack their ideas about gender! now is as good a time as any to ask yourself questions like: what are men and women? how do I know I'm the gender that I am? why do i participate in the gender roles and presentation (eg the clothes you wear) that i do?

you are already doing great!! using a person's pronouns and name shows you care. when I meet someone who doesn't use my pronouns even when they should know them i know they do not listen to me
You are already on the right path, supporting you child and creating that openness is the best thing ever. Let them know you support them and are inclusive. As questions from a learner space and not a challenging one. 🥰🥰🥰
Love how caring of a parent you are :)) Just ask them about how they want to be referred to. All nonbinary people are different and some might be okay with language that others aren't. Having an open dialogue with your parents is so important, especially as a NB kid.
I say, “my kid” when referencing them in general conversation. I try to refer to my child by their name they’ve chosen as much as possible to reaffirm both for them and my brain. You’re doing great!  You’re gonna slip up sometimes and that’s ok, they just want to see us trying and supporting them.
Just ask them! They know themselves best. If they are ok with son then keep using it, it they change their name then try to practice using it with someone else to get used to it. 

All in all, keep yourself in check, please don’t be like my parents where they speak incorrectly so freely that they don’t even catch the mistakes.
You can also refer to your child as your ""oldest"" or your ""youngest"" depending on how old your other child is. I'm nonbinary and I'm the oldest of two, so sometimes I'm my parent's kid, their child, or their oldest. 

You seem very accepting and I love how you immediately started using the right pronouns. You seem like a great parent!
Hi there! 23 year old nonbinary person here, thanks for being an awesome mom! If you want to know more about what nonbinary gender is and what it might mean for your child I can't recommend enough the zine ""How to Support Your Nonbinary Family Member"" by Alyssa Giannini. The author is also non-binary and expresses so many of the things I want my parents to know when I come out to them including how to navigate discussions about gender with your child. It's available free from their website [here](https://www.alyssagiannini.com/nonbinaryzine) Hope this helps!
You are an amazing parent for respecting your child! I wish more parents were like this!
As an NB mom of an NB child, might I suggest crotch goblin or womb fruit? Instead of son, daughter, etc. I sometimes just use kiddo too, or product of my loins, or Homefry to my hash brown. Honestly, I think the best way to handle it is just to find terms you’re both comfortable with, that convey your love to each other in ways that feel good. They don’t always have to be your typical titles, have fun with it! 💕💕
My child is 16, and they came out as non-binary about a year or two ago. I mess up, I used she/her with them, but we talked and I told them that I am actively trying. 

They loved that. They said if I use she/her, it’s okay, bc I was their daughter for 15 years and it’s a hard habit to break. But I correct myself without apologizing, and it’s getting a lot easier with time. 

I had to talk with their dad about things he’s said and such. Learning and being active about educating yourself is the best step!! Just let them know that you’re accepting and trying your best. It makes it easier all over if you don’t beat yourself up over missteps.
Just have a talk with them. Ask if they are okay with terms like “son” or “daughter” or if they prefer totally neutral ones like “child”. Ask if there is any ways that you can help them out, if there’s anything they have questions about (you may not know the answer but you can help them research and find the answer), or if there’s anything bothering them. The most capable person of answering a lot of your questions is gonna be your kid themself.
On top of what others said, sometimes there's a tendency for trans kids to be a bit self-conscious and expect the worst, like expect ignorance or transphobia from family, and when you expect it you might find it where there is none, or maybe there is SOME but nothing major, and something you could easily stop if they tell you.

So what I'm saying is, if you say or do something and your kid gets really upset and you don't know why, tell them something along the lines of:

""I love and accept you for who you are, and I'm not trying to hurt you. Just tell me what the problem is and we'll work through it. I don't mean any offense and I want you to feel comfortable being you at home and around me.""

And don't feel terrible even if they seem super upset. You sound like you're trying your best and that's all you can do - just don't add drama where there doesn't need to be any. Don't be upset with your kid - just be patient.
You’re doing great!! Among all this other great advice, make sure your kiddo knows that you accept them and are doing your best with pronouns and such. Maybe even show them this post! Knowing that someone is doing their best is a huge thing, even if they mess up sometimes
I am 15 and nonbinary just like your child. I can give some advice based on the stuff that my mom doesn't do;

I recommend not using gendered terms like 'son' (unless they clarify that they're alright with you using that term, some NB people are comfortable with terms like son, daughter, etc). use gender-neutral terms. My father always refers to me as his 'youngest' like ""My youngest is nonbinary"" or ""My youngest is really into KPop"" (can be substituted with eldest if he is older). 

From my experience, don't be sad when you get corrected. We know that it can be difficult to adjust and there's no need to beat yourself up about it, it's always about your intentions. Also, if you mess up and you happen to catch your mistake, you don't have to be overly apologetic, just a simple ""sorry"" and immediately correcting your mistake will do. 

If someone is doing or saying something that is transphobic, stop them immediately, no matter how small it is. It could be as small as simply refusing to use the correct name and pronouns. If they continue to be disrespectful then leave them immediately, don't let them have another chance to be disrespectful to \*your\* child.

The most important thing is to just \*talk\* with your child (or their father if they are unavailable) to find what's comfortable with them and what will make them feel heard, validated, and accommodated. Talk with them about what to say when someone who doesn't know about their identity change, like if they want you to correct that person or not. Ask how they want to be referred to. 

May I add that I think you are a very good mother! I wish my mother had done what you did and just simply \*asked\* me about stuff. I wish you and your family nothing but happiness <3
There is a wonderful Instagrammer named Jeffrey Marsh who is a great source of information, inspiration and loving messages!
Something I wish my parents would do is just sit down and talk about it with me. Every person is different and has different preferences.
Just showing your support and asking them what they want and need might feel awkward or uncomfortable, but it's the best way to know for sure that you are giving them the support they need.
Just being on here and asking questions shows how supportive you are and how much you're trying, I wish more parents could be like you. :)
It is important to make sure you do not out them to someone your child may not have wanted knowing. Have an open conversation with them and ask whether or not they want other people to know. They may want you to use their old name/pronouns around a specific person because your child may not want them to know that they are nonbinary. It is in your best interest to have your child have full control over who they come out to and when. This includes even the people closest to you.
Absolutely affirm their choice of pronouns, terms, and name. Another thing that I personally think is important for a teen is to tell them ""If after a while with these changes you decide to do something different, like use female pronouns or ones like Xe/Xer, or ANYTHING else, I will be understanding and follow your lead. This is your journey and I don't want you to feel trapped in one identity just because it's the first one that felt right. I love you and will learn whatever I need to in order for you to live as your happiest self.""

It helps because a LOT of Enby journies go in stages. Some kids eventually decide to go back to older pronouns or try new ones.... I like to think of gender identity as trying on clothes to find your personal style. Young people can worry they already asked a big change and feel like they can't keep evolving for fear that their parent will be frustrated that it keeps changing..... Being forthright and unconditional can be a huge weight off.
Using their name and pronouns is huge. That will build trust for them to talk more. Use it even when they aren't around and as long as they are ""out"" with others reframe politely when people get it wrong. 

Example, using random names: 
Them: When Jack said that he could...
You: Jay. 

Also, I'd ask:
I thought you might prefer a more gender neutral term that son- how should I describe our connection? Is child ok?

I personally still use my gendered terms like Mom and wife but use they/she pronouns.  

Try not to say anything about it being hard/difficult. Instead thank them for their patience and for helping you learn and grow. 

You've done the most important thing already: you've cared.
Communication is key! ask them if they want to be referred to as a sibling (if they have siblings) and maybe refrain from calling them your son
Nobody here can tell you if ""son"" is correct or not. Ask your kid.
The best way to know what they're comfortable with is  by asking them. you're already trying to use their new name and pronouns which is great. but you might want to sit down and talk to them to see if they would prefer gender-neutral terms like child or offspring . Or they still okay with the term son.
I’m so happy that you’re actively seeking ways to accommodate your child! Just keep in mind that it’s ok to make mistakes, you don’t need to feel like a slip of the tongue is the end of the world. Yes it can be painful for your child sometimes, but if they know you’re trying and especially if you immediately correct yourself, then just the effort alone will really make your child feel more comfortable and seen. Just a bit from my experiences as an enby (nonbinary person) who has been out since I was 16.
Another option to avoid using gendered language that I haven't seen brought up in this thread (that being said, I haven't read all the replies so I may be wrong) is to say ""my 15 year-old"". But as others have mentioned, the best course of action is to just ask them what they prefer 🙂 other than that, you seem to be doing well so far with what you have mentioned, so just remember to celebrate the small victories
With a lot of nonbinary people, gendered language like ""son"" for example doesn't make them feel all too good and I'm guessing your kid using they/them pronouns is a way to break free from gendered language so that's something you could keep in mind. But everybody is different and the only way to know for any individual what they're comfortable with is to ask so I'd say the best thing you can do is to talk to them and ask what words they're comfortable with and go from there.

And as other people also already said, research is good and it shows clear desire to understand. One important thing also is that they're probably also still learning about their identity and exploring what it means to be nonbinary. Which I think we all are tbh 😂
Ask if they want to expirament with more affeminite looks, if they want to go shopping for clothes, offer your help with makeup, outfits, and jewelry. If they want a gender therapist or to go on hormones, help them eith the process
Say child, not son.
Okay, I'll definitely talk to their father about it :) Thank you for your reply!
A few more: kiddo, youngster, love, dear,offspring, sweetie, my pride and joy.
Okay, will do. Thank you!
I'm really sorry your family wasn't accepting 😢 I can't imagine how tough that could be. And thank you for the advice! I'll definitely talk to them and their father more about this. You've been very helpful 💙💙
Noted! 💙 Thank you
I'll definitely keep this in mind, thank you so much 💙💙 You're so helpful! And I only wish the best for my kids, I wish to learn as much as I can about them 🥰
We will do whatever it takes to protect our kid from any sort of harassment for sure! We take bullying very seriously and will make sure they're only doing their very best when interacting with their peers. We have a strict policy about the kids telling us parents or a trusted adult who can contact us when they're experiencing any sort of bullying or harassment, and it's worked very well in the past, and I hope my child doesn't feel awkward or scared to tell me about it.
Ah, sorry, I'm so used to calling them that - will definitely try to get better at it 🥰
Of course, me and my hubby are very supportive of whatever makes our kids happy! 💙💙
We have just finished having that discussion 🥰💙 It went very well!
Yes, absolutely. We sat down and had a really good, deep chat about what their preferences were and they really opened up! I'm so glad they feel comfortable and happy 🥰 And I will definitely take your advice when it comes to neutralising my language 💙
💙💙
I love those ideas! I'll definitely discuss that with them later 💙💙
I showed them the post during our conversation and they were extremely happy to see that I was using their pronouns and that so many people had responded who felt exactly like them. They're beyond happiness!
I absolutely agree with you, and I'm so grateful for your advice. We've had a long talk about it but I'll ask them if they're up for some more questions later as I'm still trying to understand. Again, thank you!
I'll look into that! <3
Definitely!! Whatever would make them happy and comfortable 💙
Apologies, I'm very new to this and I'm not sure how to phrase myself. Me and my child talked about it though, and they said it's okay but they prefer child :)
You can ask if they want you to correct others as well. It can be hard doing it all on your own. It can be embarrassing at other times. You only know for sure if you ask them. It can also hurt if you use gendered pronouns when talking about them with other people, and other people might never get it right if the same pronouns aren't used consistently.
Advice based on mistakes my mom makes:

If they ask you to correct something- be happy to change, not sad you were wrong, so they can feel comfortable telling you again in the future!

If they complain about a problem, validate them and their feelings. If they say that something a person was hurtful to them, don't try to get them to ""see the other side"", focus on them and their feelings only. 

Don't ever let anyone say anything negative about trans people in front of them without being stopped. Seriously, every time even if it's only mild. Make sure they know your house is a place where trans people WILL be respected, or that person will be removed. If someone gives pushback about it, you really have to remove them immediately and not let them get a second chance to disrespect your child in your house. Your kid will internalize it if you allow if through passivity. 

Also, if a tv show says something negative or questionable about trans people, get it off the tv immediately.
Eldest or Youngest work great too! 

""My eldest is really into soccer"" 

""Oh my youngest is a dancer actually""
I always like the genderless term child, but you should talk to them and see what would make them more comfortable.
Yep! Write out a list and have them tell you which they’re okay with. This goes for compliments too—cute, pretty, handsome, beautiful... Also maybe let them know you’re happy to help them adjust their style (hair, clothes, etc) to whatever they’re comfortable with. Sounds like you’re doing great, keep up the good work :)
Thank you. 💙 I have accepting friends though, which is really nice. And work has been okay about it too. 

Of course! Thanks again for being such an accepting parent. All the best to you, and to your child and their father too. 💙
It probably won't do any harm to make it clear that the policy very specifically hasn't changed.
I call my little enby mini meatbag, kidlet, notspawn (we're not bio related), teen,  foundling, etc. They're cool with all of these slightly embarrassing choices

Your kiddo might not know yet what will be affirming to them-there are a ton of options out there if they want to try a few different ones

r/momforaminute suggests *duckling* for posts without gender indicated, and I think that's an adorable option as well
It's hard to remember sometimes but I'm sure they'll appreciate the effort! 💖
Not all of us were as lucky! 

Your support is saving your child years of hurting. ❤️
Oh one other thing! Non-binary people tend to choose names that seem silly to a lot of people but these names often are very important to the person choosing them, so if ur kid chooses a name you think is silly, please remember it might not be silly at all to them. 
For example, my partners Chosen name is Trash. I’ve met lots of people who have said “I’m not calling them that it’s rude and silly” 
But for my partner it isn’t, at all. My partner dumpster dives as a way to reduce food waste, they genuinely find Trash an endearing name because to them Trash isn’t just garbage, trash is food, trash is useful, trash is recyclable, trash is reusable. One persons trash is literally Trash’s treasure.
Aww I’m so glad to hear it!!! And seems like you’re doing really well on their pronouns, well done!! Your kid is lucky to have you❤️
No problem! It makes me so happy to see supportive parents <3
What ComradeVidali said, but that being said - definitely talk with them about it first! It's for them to decide when and to whom they want to come out, for example they might not want you to use the correct pronouns when talking with the neighbor who has a kid in the same class, if they haven't come out in school yet.
Or the dreaded middle
Unless you have only one.
That's good to hear! And thank you, we try our best 💙
Of course 💙 I told them at the end of our conversation about all of this 🥰

Why do we get hate on so much?	Why does everyone always hate on us? Like I swear to god I can’t even mention my pronouns online without people being assholes to me, and it’s the same way for other enbys I see. It sucks. Like, I hate how I have to misgender myself, I hate how people go out of their way to misgender us, i hate how people act like we aren’t living things just because we use they/them pronouns, and I hate how everyone thinks we’re faking it. Nobody has told me I’m faking it (yet) but it’s only a matter of time. We can’t even be ourselves without people feeling the need to be assholes to us	"I suspect its people projecting their personal insecurities.
It hurts a lot when binary trans people imply non-binary folk are harming binary trans folk. it's only happened once and I don't think the guy meant any harm. But it's also why I'll never set foot in the ftm sub reddit. 

&#x200B;

idk why people love the gender binary so much
“I hate how I have to misgender myself”— wow i did not actually realize I do this too until I read that.
I think the non binary people are just an easy joke for people to make similar to furries or gay people in the 2000s.

We live in a culture where gender is binary and anything outside of that thinking is confusing and challenging for people.

It's not fair and it sucks but old, ignorant people will continue to die out and younger, more open minded people will be understand the difference of sex and gender and understand how to empathize with people.
Real answer : people see us (at the same time) as children, and sexual deviants. Their is also an element of homophobia.

The first because they think that every non-binary person is a twenty something or teen aged person whom is extremely naïve and misguided often this is pared with religious fear (the fear that you as a non-binary person are going to hell), these combined to make them (or at lease a part of them) legitimately afraid for you and think that you can be guided back to a “healthy” mindset.

And a sexual deviant because they cannot separate sex(biological), gender, and sex(the action) and to them this is something shameful and very singular and binary, they see it as something that is very much set in stone and (often) a mandate set by god. Those same people see sex(the act) as shameful and something that is supposed to be mysterious and wonderfully simple, and the concept that it’s not scares them. Added onto that the fact that a lot of the people who come out as non-binary are children teens or young adults and you have a recipe for people to see non-binary as the same way they see a sex crime.

The idea that sex(biological) and gender are not the same things scares a lot of straight people because if their not the same thing  they have to take a hard look at them self’s and see if their really straight or if their neptunic/sapphic. This scares them because of homophobia, and ties into gender roles and heteronormative.

The fake answer: they know that non-binary people are too sexy and powerful to ever be allowed to be truly themself as if we where we would engulf the wold in non-binary magic and ascend to fight god themself and take back all the things that we rightly deserved like the ability to become sentient bogs and three rings nestled inside each other covered in eyes and wings and on fire
When online, I stay in my happy lil echo chambers and haven’t had any direct hate about being enby.

However, at work, (not directed at me), I have had multiple mediocre whitecishet men make HiLaRiOuS jokes about identifying and pronouns or simply throwing transphobic slurs about.

(Yes, I have complained to HR and the union.
No, nothing happened).

Does that count?
Because we represent the breaking of the obsolete power systems. Our existence is a revolutionary act. We oppose everything that so many have just accepted as truth until now. We threaten their comfort and they know we will not stop until we have the right to be who we want to be.
Not sure if it helps but it's not just us, it's anyone who is marginalized, and therefore vulnerable. 

It's a sign of weakness and small-mindedness.  Strong people don't need to attack weak people to feel powerful.
I feel its because hate speech against non-binary people isn't as derided as homophobia/racism/sexism etc, so people feel they won't get called out for doing it. Literally - some people just need to insult others to feel better, and we're an easier target.
I have to constantly wear a badge that says “they/them” and a enby lanyard inorder for people to respect me for who i am when i have been wearing it for (basically) 2 years. It is truly frustrating.
I struggled for a long time with coming out as non-binary because of this. Doesn’t help that when I cut off all my hair my mom said “I like it, but I’ll always see you as just feminine” thanks mom 😌
I think the hate comes more because of people that use neopronouns. Specifically, those that take certain object names and use as their pronouns. To others this is all viewed as the same group.
The majority of the time it's actually not personal IMHO.  


People like to hate stuff to make them feel superior in a life they feel inferior in.  


Also, when someone is hating on you, they're actually kinda hating on themselves more than you. You see nobody really knows you only you, the people in your life have an image of how they perceive you based on their own perceptual biases, so what they think is you they are hating is a construct of you that only exists in their minds
A lot of binary trans people will scapegoat us for why cis people don’t take trans people seriously…when to cis people we’re all the same
Because many people are small-minded and our mere existence shatters something they thought existed unbreakable: the gender binary. 

Sadly some people need to cling to their beliefs until their last breaths, whether it's religious hate, an entirely incorrect grasp of nature or an entirely fabricated reality of their own.

Don't hide because of other people's issues. I received hate in a safe-space yesterday. They were banned almost immediately. Be yourself. Be loud and proud. Anyones hate is their problem not yours. There will always be at least a few people who will back you up. Try to focus on the love, not the hate.
There are a lot of people who believe so strongly in the gender binary that they base their whole identity and worldview around it. Whether thats terfs and their ‘all men are forever and  exclusively bad’ trauma bs or the guys who think having a dick means they deserve to be on top of a social ladder, its the same thing. People who look at all that and go ‘nah’ are extremely threatening to them. Basically they’re faced with the choice of either acknowledging that the binary is oversimplified nonsense people made up and people can opt out of, or hurting you enough to get you back in line so they can pretend their systems are perfect and immutable again. Its way way easier to just choose to hurt us. 

Fuck ‘em.
then people go out there and say ""the nonbinary community is now the face of the trans community and is making a mockery of trans people!!! binary trans people are being drowned out!!!!"" when it's like... no. of course binary trans people experience transphobia and have it bad, im not saying anyone has it worse, but nonbinary people aren't ""oppressing"" binary trans people. it fucking sucks how some people think that. i like to think it's not a lot, though, just a vocal few yk?

people just don't want to accept that people can be different than them. they accuse of us not knowing, but we know. its them who can't understand, so they refuse to. i wish i didn't have to be, but ive tried both male and female and neither of them make me happy. its a lack of empathy and a refusal to understand, or even tolerate. it isn't our fault. people did the same with gay people, hopefully with time and world adjustment people will start to see us as real and human, just like them. one day 💜✨
In Poland.. there were stickers around city with anime bunny girl saying that ""you are not nonbinary, you are mentally ill"".. Also there is hate on people who use neutral pronouns.. also there is general hate on lgbt people, because we are ""ideology"", not people..
Bc the enforced binary is connected to white supremacy and colonialism, and a lot of our society is internalized policing — aka people running around “theres only two genders!” (Why tf does it matter? Because they are cops) as well as systemic enforcement, and the attitudes of the higher ups. 

Here is an article about it, if you would like to read more : https://aninjusticemag.com/the-gender-binary-is-a-tool-of-white-supremacy-db89d0bc9044
People hate what they can’t comprehend. They are just uneducated.
People are insecure and they’d rather push other ppl down than address their own issues. I care less abt the opinions of strangers than I do a family member but I’m working on that as well.
People don’t like what they can’t understand.
People just aren't willing to even attempt to understand. They see something that they've never experienced or been around before and they shut it out because it's easier than trying to actually understand. Also a *lot* of people just feel good getting angry about things, and a foreign concept like this is an easy target.
The worse is when transphobic right wingers work hard to take away the ability to transition and its somehow nonbinary people's fault. You know a lot of us transition too and if not are very sympathetic to people who need to.
Yeah... This Is Why I Try To Only Stick To Explicitly Supportive Places On The Internet, Although Even That Ain't The Easiest, As You Can't Exactly Tell Sometimes... 

Sidenote though, The first time I remember someone doing this to me it was honestly kinda funny (But still sad, Of course) because they were hardly even trying: I was on a Discord Server and had a role for They/Them Pronouns, But also one for ""Any Pronoun's Fine"" (Mainly just had the They/Them one because it was purple Lol.), And somebody was being a jerk and said something like I'd get mad if they called me anything except They/Them... Despite the fact I also had a role all but outright stating that I Wouldn't, And they logically would've had to see that too in order to check what the They/Them Role was...
I've been openly bi for years.

This is just ""pick one or the other"" crowd round 2

I've been prepared for these kinds of interactions by years of experience. I'm really not phased at all or surprised. 

My existence doesn't invalidate or hurt anyone but the insecurities of people who can't accept me do.
cus people dumb :]

but we're cool
I feel you so much... My CO wasn't long ago, that's why most people still misgender me, but I try to correct them. German is also very gendered and sometimes I have people who are like ""In your documents you still are AFAB, so I will gender you like that, cause your given name is female and I can't memory everything."" Pal, really? It's just cause in Germany it's so hard to get your docs and name changed 🙄

Edit: Typo
Because the majority of humans only allow for comprehension, not compassion. They convince themselves there is not enough time in a day to try and understand. In an absence of understanding comes hate.
I think most people are much too uncomfortable with confusion. That in itself is probably not that irrational, school and parents and friends socialize us into a mindset where mistakes are bad and ""self-confidence"" (meaning acting like you are sure of anything, regardless of your actual knowledge or skill) is rewarded. This trains people to be uncomfortable and afraid of loosing social status when the are unsure or confused, and to people who are used to binary gender, nbs are just really confusing. Unfortunatly that means they feel a need to lash out, to make the confusing and uncomfortable person go away. 

I'm sorry you have to deal with that. Remember that you are valid and there are lots of us! They wont stay confused forever.
Because they don't respect you.
Luckily I've only been misgendered a few times, but that's mainly cuz I never tell anyone that I'm enby

The main time I got misgendered was when my friend outed me on the bus in front of some homophobic redneck
Because people are stupid, they can easily be led towards hate, and some smarter people can use that stupid hate to get people to do stupid things.  

The fight for nonbinary people is almost no different than the fight for civil rights for minorities and the rights for homosexuals.  The fight shifted to something slightly newer and different.
Freedom is scary

depends where you live..it's pretty laid back here..it's not easy to meet you though
I assume it has something to do with being jealous of us living our authentic selves
I view it as more of a personal bias cause by not being insecure/feeling out of place with how your view your own gender and gender expression. If your 100% ok with your own gender be agab, and mostly lived with standard gender roles/expressions, it makes sense something you dont personally feel and understand wouldnt make sense.   


Combine that with the sense of anonymity and ""meme"" culture a lot of people live by. Heck I have a few people my age (32) that literally havent grown up past the 4chan phase.  


Combine this with the overall ""Newness"" of accepting non cishet existences, and bipoc being accepted (more so then previously). All this leads me to just accept people gonna be people, the part i dont get onboard with when people want to be assholes....  


Look, i dont care if you hate me/GSRM, but dont stand in the way of people looking for their own happiness. the world sucks enough as is
Sadly it's because many people are afraid of changes and things they don't personally understand. 
The changes part of it is a bare minimum as over 99% of the time it has no direct effect on them other than them hearing that someone identifies as non-binary and even that shouldn't affect them as much as it does.
From the beginning of time, there's always been those who believe if they don't understand it then it gotta be wrong. They don't try to educate themselves or strive for themselves to be better and not hate. They decide to push the hate forward and blame the group of people for their hatred. 
Wish there was an easy fix but there's not. History taught us those who have hatred in their heart for people's existence will forever carry that hate. We can help teach the next Generation to Love Everyone and never allow Hate inside your Heart in Hope one day we can fully eradicate Hate from this World. 
Never Give Someone the Power to Change Who You Are. Love Yourself as You Are Loved!
AIDS killed so many queer people that now everybody thinks we just popped out of the ground sometime between 2003-2006 so everything LGBTQ people do, as a class, is seen as “dumb shit for kids”
Because people cant mind their own beeswax and have to come butting in to yell at someone who is different
I came out as enby in 2014. I’ve done a lot of work behind the scene to get X markers on Driver’s Licenses, Birth and Death Certificates and honestly it’s getting worse. I feel as if we can solidly lay blame at Netflix Comedy’s feet as well as The second wave feminists that teamed up with the Federalist society to write anti-trans policies (they love J K Rowling) and it has emboldened Centrists/Liberals to bash us at every chance.
I don't hate u.  I accept everybody just the way they are
Ive honestly just reversed back to just being she/her. Im too tired and I dont want to think about it anymore
Someone called me a little shit because I used singular they for someone I didn’t know the name, gender or pronouns of.

The weird thing is, I didn’t know them either

And I was buying clothes with a friend

Some 30 year old walked up to two minors half the 30 year olds age to call us little shits over the word “they”

Tldr: intolerance is stupid
I don’t understand it either people get so mad when we are like plz don’t gender and I’m like why do we have to be gendered I hope the world changes society is at fault and honestly it’s weird cuz before society became a thing gender wasn’t even I thing so it’s like come on
People hate what's different. And if you're different and proud of it, they hate it even more.
i think its because people overeact what we are

they see the lgbt talking and making a big fuss (not that its bad) and then it goes like

´´now they think their are a banana´´ and bla bla bla

its actually simple but they overeact with it
I can’t mention my gender in non-LGBTQ groups without someone asking about my genitals
What I see the most is the idea that the non binary identity and existence is purely due to “I reject gender roles for men/women” which implies women/men are reduced to gender roles/stereotypes. And then there’s people whose brains implode upon being exposed to the concept of they/them pronouns. Theres people equating being gender non comforting to being non binary, and they think that if gnc presentation is now labeled as non binary then that enforces the idea of women/men not being able to be gnc. I understand that ppl want to be gnc without being labeled as enby by society, because women/men can present however they want while still being that. So when ppl see “I don’t like presenting feminine” they’ll be like oh so ur saying women have to be feminine or else they’re non binary??At least that’s what I’ve seen personally. I just think a lot is a lack of understanding and sometimes our experiences are too complex to feel comfortable being put into a binary which is why a spectrum is preferable.
It hurts so much. I see people just brutally rip us to shreds verbally in so many places online. Especially in gay groups for men specifically. I sometimes just wish I was cis. I even feel uncomfortable when someone uses my preferred pronouns and feel ""safer"" when I'm misgendered. I don't know why I'm Non-binary, but I just wish people would stop choosing to be ignorant and hostile towards us.
Because people fear change and anything aside from their basic mentality.
Some of the nastiest experiences I’ve had were with people who came out years later. It’s happened with two different people now. 

Obviously that’s not the case with everybody who acts like this, but there are still *a lot* of enbys living in the closet well into adulthood. That kind of self rejection messes with a person. Not saying that makes the ugliness okay, but it does explain some of it.
Getting outside of the gender norms can make people realize how much they are chasing an invisible 'rule' that they often completely hate.
Yeah probably
They've been brainwashed since childhood to need it. Without the gender binary, how are you supposed to use stereotypes to understand the world? *Clutches pearls*
I'm sorry you had that experience, it's so disheartening when it comes from within the community.

The ftm sub seems to have loads of non-binary trans guys and trans mascs whenever I'm there, as well as binary trans guys, but there are assholes in every community and I'm sorry you came across them :(
I've interacted with on eof those people they were an asshole it was not very pleasent
Yeah, me neither.
>The first because they think that every non-binary person is a twenty something or teen aged person

Them: You *millenials*

Me: That... no longer means what you think it means.
Yes
‘biological sex’ is just the medicalized taxonomy of gender and to uphold the distinction between the two is so fucking transphobic lmao how does your shit have 38 upvotes?
I'm reading this book for class: Gender(s) by Katherine Stockton. 

What she finds is that men are so disallowed to be compassionate by other men, that they need to make jokes about things to cope. ""Hilarity"" is used to dismiss the feelings of others so they can keep ignoring *their own.* Which you can imagine isn't healthy for anyone. To stay masculine in the eyes of the group, they must be sheepish and passive (and feminine) about these issues, to play along with their jokes.

I think this is my new favourite book tbh. I've only read one chapter so far, but I'm developing a case for the people who reinforce gender the most: they understand it the least.
Yeah true
Two pillars of western maleness are Dominance and Aggression. Aggression is caused by a lack of dominance, like an animal trying to shake up the pecking order.

Edit: Added Western, because I don't believe in biological sex determinism either.
>just feminine

Oooh boy if my mom said that it would piss me off so much I'd probably pack a erect dildo 24/7.

But in actuality my mom always tried to block me from doing sports because she was afraid I was too masculine already. If she ever said such a thing I think it would be just as a burn and not because she believed it for real.
I don't know about that. If you bump up against more conservative people in mainstream spaces, there's quite a bit of disdain for (enbyphobia) "">!blue-haired they/them chicks!<"" and more commonly actual picking on (presumed) cis people that have she/her and he/him in their social media bios. There's pushback against ever declaring a pronoun ever, let alone a non-binary one.

Solidarity with people who use neopronouns. Most of the people who want to tear down some of us want to tear down all of us.
>People like to hate stuff to make them feel superior in a life they feel inferior in.

This! I think when you don't have a whole lot going on in your life it's easier to put people down than to build yourself up.
Yeah true
I’m sorry to hear that. I’m just glad the person was banned. Imagine being so insecure that you would go onto a safe space just to bully people, it’s pathetic that someone did that

Also thanks, I’m gonna try to start doing this
Yeah, the german language can be really frustrating being the gendered mess it is. I'm pretty lucky  because I don't mind pronouns, I use er/sie, because none of the neopronouns in german I know really fit. 
How do you handle that, if I may ask?

Changing name and gender-marker will be way easier, once the Selbstbestimmungsgesetz is active. Really looking forward to that. 💜
Yeah there is, I probably said the “hate” like 5 times
Same
Yeah. 

Some of the comments I've heard have me wondering if a lot of this stuff isn't just resentment from people who haven't figured out they aren't cis or who have and have repressed the shit out of it. 

Not all of by any means, some people are just bigots. 

But some of it has me wondering.
Yup
Yep. 

I feel its usually a ""this says a lot more about you than it does about me"" situations.

Although some people are just genuinely fucking ignorant, too.
I can understand binary trans people really loving it to an extent. But i don't think anyone actually wins in a 2 gender binary.   


And this doesn't even include the other stuff. 

  
Some people just don't have time to be a boy or a girl.
it's accurate if directed at me

a 39 year old enby with 2 kids
How do we Intersex folk fair in that statement? There are 40+ variations. Are we just written off, only to be brought out by folks in the GNC and Trans community? I’m Trans and was born Intersex.
Amazing - definitely looking that up!!
I don't consider those traits as specifically masculine, either among animals, where there are plenty of counter-examples, or humans, which vary pretty widely both individually and culturally.
easier in the moment, but it fucks you in the long run.  


The dark side is quicker, more seductive
It was a space specifically for survivors of child abuse and my ""mental illness"" was blamed on my abuser. Like seriously, it's literally the main rule to be kind and understanding
Yeah I'm rooting every day for the new law...  But cause our lobby isn't big enough, I don't think it will really be done next year. Like, most people are still like: ""DoN't ToUcH mY dIeSeL!1!1!1!111!"" if you ask about climate crisis and that's something that effects really every being in this planet.

I normally go by what I learned as the ""American addressing"", with you (Sie or Du) and first name. It's the easiest thing I know to speak mostly genderless.

If I talk/write about a group of people, I normally use generic masculine, but disclaim it in the beginning, that every person is meant and it's just really hard to gender everything in every possible kind of way, cause German is so gendered.

The most ideas I heard about making new genderless pronouns are mostly very... ""interesting"" to be nice 🙈😅 Like using ""ens"" (the middle part of Mensch = Human), but it's very fast very confusing. If every pronoun is ""ens"" nobody can tell if my granny is in your basement and someone else called the ambulance, cause everything would be ""ens"".

It reminds me a bit of the idea of relationship anarchy.
Yep. One was convinced that me being nonbinary was *actually* me struggling with internalized misogyny, so they decided that refusing to use my pronouns was ‘helping’ me realize I was being a bad feminist and taking up space in the trans community that I didn’t deserve. 

1000% projection of their own insecurities.

There’s definitely just straight up bigots, too.
God so true, I see so many people say “why are you calling him/her they? There’s only one of him/her, it isn’t proper English!” But what they don’t know is that “they” has been used as a singular since like 1375
Even some cis people are incredibly fucking weird about it. 

I just wish it was all optional.
Yeah, I'm an enby millenial. But I swear people got in the habit of talking about teenagers/college-age young adults as ""millenials"" and never got out of it.
Also a socially constructed category. The prefix 'inter' literally implies how it's defined by being 'in between' the socially constructed dimorphism's.
Yeah, it's important that if we're talking about the culturally gendered traits of ""dominance and aggression"" that we don't fall into the trap of biological determinism.

Certain cultural groups place an emphasis on men displaying these behaviours in order to keep their status. That doesn't make them male traits.
But man-people *do*. And they're the ones perpetuating it, even if the studies prove that biological determinism is often wrong.
It's like your bully also lives in my brain and knows my own insecurities.
Singular they is so old the first written instance of it uses a thorn instead of a ‘th’.
What's Especially Funny Is, If Memory Serves, The First Recorded Complaint Against Singular They Was In Like The 18th Century, Meaning It Was Used For Hundreds Of Years Before Anybody Started Complaining About It.
For realsies though...

I ended up with a friend whose bs when I tried to approach gender was the straw that broke the camel's back. Like refused to even admit that boobs are generally considered feminine. 

""I don't see boobs as feminine."" Fuck you, Kim. You lying douchebaguette. 

Blocked her ass and zero regrets.
OH yeah lots of cis people are. I meant i don't wanna take awake binary trans people joy of gender but i wish they wouldn't try and get me into that. 

that or just not be a part of people's IDs an paper works. I mean i live in a place where you can get an X marking but i am worried about what that could bring me
Cool, just asking, to learn more as I’m a Trans elder trying to learn from younger folk. Cheers fren!
I was writing to support OP, not going to argue with you about biological determinism and ""man-people"", especially in a subreddit for nonbinary folks.
Haha yeah, I think that’s part of what makes the hostile closet cases so much more brutal than run-of-the-mill bigots. They know how to hit where it hurts, because they’ve *also* spent tons of time quietly agonizing over their gender, and come to the conclusion that they don’t deserve to be happy.

If it makes you feel any better, the person who said this ID’s as genderfluid now.
While I see where you come from, boobs and moobs are just sacks of fat and breast tissue and don't /really/ indicate gender. Like a fat trans man getting top surgery would still leave some behind because a fat man would naturally have breast tissue of some sort. But I do agree, society sees boobs as feminine.
I feel that. 

I got my x but I thought long and hard about it and I still occasionally worry 'cos we got some fashy shitbags out here.
I think you're misunderstanding me. I agree with you. I'm talking about people, specifically men in this case, who hold on to their gender roles like it's a life-raft. Like it's their religion. And therefore, telling them that their traits are not biologically determined (the truth) is blasphemy. They tout cultural traits as biological.
just saying, hostile closet is a totally metal band name
Yeah I am open about being trans but sometimes I know it's not a safe space. 

Makes me wonder what my gender would be written down a on places I need to have a gender listed and that gender has to be the same as my ID. Like the student aid BC site
I’d buy their album.
I wish they'd make all this stuff easier for everyone. 

I hate everything being a freaking jumble.
fr
Yeah. It's a pain. I've been lucky and have often had people help me with this stuff as well.

People just don't want to make things just stream lined and accessible.
Exactly. And its annoying."	xbce2n	NonBinary	512	0.98	2022-09-11 07:40:04
"My dad keeps saying that they them pronouns are "" grammatically incorrect and idiotic"" and it's making me really uncomfortable because I go by they them pronouns idk what to do"		"They/them is the default in the English language when you don’t know someone’s pronouns. It’s silly to pretend otherwise. Using they/them as chosen pronouns is older than you dad.
From Wikipedia:

This use of singular they had emerged by the 14th century, about a century after the plural they. It has been commonly employed in everyday English ever since.
Give him some reading material

Oxford English Dictionary:
https://public.oed.com/blog/a-brief-history-of-singular-they/

Merriam Webster Dictionary
https://www.merriam-webster.com/words-at-play/singular-nonbinary-they
Respectfully,  your dad is being idiotic. Ask him if he found someone's belongings but didn't know who left THEIR things. How would he refer to THEM? We don't know the gender or amount of people in this scenario, they/them is correct.
People use singular 'they' all the time without thinking about it. Especially for someone of unknown gender. This is not new.

Example:
""I went to the doctor.""
""What did they say?""
[removed]
if he harps on you for using they/them as a singular then be ready to harp on him every time he uses you as a singular. If that mofo isn't using thou as the second person singular than he's got no right to expect you to not use they/them as the third person singular.
I'd still use they/them pronouns. normalise that shit.
""You"" is plural too. 
English and all other languages are mutable.
Your father doesn’t believe this, he’s just transphobic and trying to manipulate you into being what he wants you to be.

You deal with it by not letting him, not by trying to change his mind. You cannot reason someone out of an opinion they didn’t reason themselves into. 

You can change his opinion by living your life in such a way that he is *forced* to change his mind.
Give him an English lesson. Singular they and them are very much grammatically correct. People use them all the time without really thinking about it.
My best friend is huge on grammar (herself, she doesn't correct others). When I came out to her as nonbinary online (we live far apart) she said. ""This is very hard for me because that's a grammatical nightmare. But I'm happy for you"" in the space it took me to read the word grammatical I died a thousand deaths. Then I yelled at her for phrasing it like that and scaring the hell out of me. 

Fast forward. Sometimes she messes up but she always corrects herself. In her defense we've been friends for 30 years and this is new for her. But we talked about this once. She said it bugs her from a language sense but she would never use that to invalidate someone's identity. People that do that are looking for an excuse to be hurtful. If it wasn't grammar it would be something else. Unfortunately the fact that they won't even try says everything.

 I'm sorry you have to go through this.
I'd just tell him to read Shakespeare. Those pronouns got lost and are revived today. As language is always changing and evolving. He doesn't have to like it, but it won't hurt him to call you that way. And it would help you to feel accepted.
So I'm guessing he thinks ""they"" can only ever be exclusively a plural?

""Someone left their wallet here"" one singular person did that, still a they. ""They parked their car so bad it's in two spots!"" One person parked the car, still a they. ""I wonder who made this, they did a really good job"" one person made it, still a they. Usually it's used to refer to an unknown person, but not always. And since people generally already know how to use they in a singular context, they're just intentionally acting like it doesn't make sense. For whatever reason, they're so vehemently against anything that doesn't fit their narrow view of what's acceptable.

People use singular they CONSTANTLY and still pretend ""you can't be a they because you're only one person"" is correct. That's the part that pisses me off. They don't have a leg to stand on in this argument to begin with and yet they act like they're firmly planted in ""logic and truth."" Even if singular they was new (it's not) that still wouldn't matter because language changes. English today is nothing like English 600 years ago. English today probably won't be the same as English 600 years from now, either. Change happens, and these people can't accept it.
Your dad is being obtuse and being a dickhead.
I mean. Understand that he is incorrect in his understanding of grammar (not that i think itd matter? Like language exists bc we use it. It changes sometimes) and it being an idiot might help? Like you dont have to convince him otherwise. You probably wont, tbh. At least not entirely. If he changes his mind itll be bc ppl other than you, the person he is trying to belittle, informed him otherwise when he happened to be receptive of that info.
Others have pointed out that singular they predates singular you and as a 14th century arising it is actually Middle English, meaning it predates modern English. Which means it's found in works of Chaucer, Shakespeare, and the Bible.   


Age doesn't make wisdom necessarily, since we know your dad is older than you, but point is, singular they is established. To condemn it is to go back before Middle English, which kind of condemns all of English.  


So Singular they is not grammatically incorrect, it's just old enough to sound so. To say so is incorrect. But even if it were, English is living, grammar both changes, grows, and isn't God, and in my view, you're dad is foolish to put his grammar discomforts, over you, an also growing changing living being he's supposed to care for.   


Am sorry for the pain you must be in...
A lot of others have already pointed out that singular they/them has been accepted in English for hundreds of years, and that languages evolve. Both these points are absolutely correct and I hope they give you some encouragement that you're not doing anything wrong and that you're valid.

Even if singular they/them wasn't grammatically ""correct"" you still wouldn't be doing anything wrong.
This is an argument people like to use even though it is simply not true. Unfortunately I don't think there's much you can do to convince someone, either by logic or demand. Staying confident in yourself is the best advice i can give. There are people who will use them or at least try. The way we use language evolves and if he is not willing to recognize that, it is a deeper issue than grammar.
so how does he refer to groups of people then lmao

“him, him, her, him, her, him, him, and her are all going to the movies later”?
I'm not a native English speaker and when I used to study academic English grammar, we had the singular they rule when referring to a generic person whose gender is not known or irrelevant to the context
he is categorically incorrect and easily proven as such. he is being willfully ignorant. I only have confrontational advice, so, if you don't want that, then ignore the rest of this--

if you want to put in the work, you could do a little research on the history of singular they/them as well as on the history of thou vs. you 2nd-person pronouns (notice how we only use ""plural"" you/your pronouns nowadays) and the very nature of language to change in order to fulfill its purpose---utility. you could present this to your dad as a pitch to change his mind. if he only responds with excuses, then here's my 2nd piece of advice: misgender him back. call him she/her all the livelong day.
If it was really an objective conversation about gramar, it might be worth pointing out that ""you"" and ""your"" are gender nutural plural pornoun that have come to be used individually as a replacement for the singular ""thee"" and ""thou"".

But I think everyone knows this is bigotry not grammar, so probalby best addressed as that.
In the house, start referring to everyone using they/them pronouns
there's a fantastic more updated video id recommend to anyone going through here, great sourcing and direct while also diving deeper into grammar

[video](https://youtu.be/gq5xLI77TGA)
They/them was good enough for Shakespeare. That's about about as official as English gets.
i convinced my dad by asking him “what would you do if you saw someone drop their wallet?” 

he said “probably pick it up and give it back to them” 

i said see you just used them for a singular person without even thinking about it, that kind of made it click for him.
Tell him the Grammarians from Victorian Britain made that he/she shit up.
Might be time to berate him every time he uses they or them when referring to a singular person. Unless he is one of those people who say he or she all the damn time, like very obnoxiously still. We use it so naturally that we miss that we use they and them in singular contexts all the time.
I wonder if he refers to himself as “one” or “oneself” because “myself” is too new for him?
Okay, I was writing this a response to someone who posted and then they took down the comment, so I am just posting the response here because it took me an hour to write plus two tachycardia alerts. 

So you know, I am non-binary, Autistic, I have a creative writing degree, a law degree, including a semester of linguistics and I have a minor in Japanese. So can see English from a native perspective and bit of an outsider perspective. This is important because of how it has shaped my relationship with language. Plus I will speaking from these places. Also, I will be referring to the use of “it” as how it is used by the general population, with no intention of any implications against people who choose to use “it/its” as one or only pronoun. It will just be too hard to write this if I need to write disclaimers every time write a sentence.

I personally wouldn’t use it/its to refer to myself, but I have seen people who have decided to use it, and I respect it, however, I mean this with complete respect, but their experiences and relationship with language is not yours. What you consider to be offensive or inoffensive is solely in relationship to you and your experiences, and outside of respecting your pronouns, no one should change their chosen pronoun because it does or doesn’t make sense to you. I hope this is helpful, and not offensive, because I really don’t mean to be. I just feel like this information could be used in broader gender divergent conversations and that is giving me severe anxiety, but if I am hoping I am reading your comment right and that this will help you. 

The reason why people have a problem with “it” and “its” has to do with cultural usage of the word and what is and isn’t referred to as an it. Basically, through the process of language evolution we have created nuances in language that are not really talked about, but are generally understood. One of these is the subtle distinction between people, fantasy/sci-fi creatures of humanish intelligence, and specific animals (mileage may vary), versus objects (including plants) and concepts in a broad sense. This nuance is also found in the Japanese language. “Imasu” is used for animate or living beings and “arimasu” is used for inanimate beings. 

So, how does that work in English? Basically it is the difference between using they, he, and she versus using it. We don’t really think about it, but he, she, they, it, that, etc. are substitution words used to represent another word. This is why reactions are usually in the subconscious and not the conscious.  When people use “it”, the vast majority of the time “it” is being used a substitute an object or an idea. “It” is not used for people unless they are intentionally dehumanising language. For example, a person might refer to another person as an “it” if they are referring to a person who that person does not see as human, which are generally minorities, including race, religion, disability (particularly people who have intellectual disabilities), etc. In present day, people will refer to pets and known sex animals by using pronouns, but use “it” if it is an unknown animal. As a result, “it” has a history in discrimination, violence, and oppression, but it also has an intuitive history of not being used to talk about people. 

As for the sentence about “John”, I see no issue with it when you use they. The reason for this is the first part. “John isn’t coming”. This denotes that John is the topic of conversation. As a result, a singular “they” is understood through context. After all, it wouldn’t makes sense to go from talking about John to talking about multiple, unidentified people. If that could happen, we would have communication breakdowns all the time, because that would come from a lack of understanding of general communication rules. In this case, once a subject is established, substitution words can be used to refer to that subject until the subject changes. As a result, no, you wouldn’t use “was”, because one, that does not sound right in the slightest and you would sound like you were speaking poor English, and two, because it is unnecessary. People would understand they as singular through context, without “were” to “was”.  Finally, English is a relatively stupid language as far as usage is concerned and any rule that is generally taught to children on how to use it, probably has multiple examples of when that rule is broken, so my advice is, just go with it.
Tell Him That The Only Thing ""Idiotic"" Here Is Thinking That Because 

A: Singular They Has Been In The English Language For Several Centuries, And Even Predates Singular You  
B: Even If It Hadn't, Language Changes Overtime, And Thankfully In English There's No Giverning Body Defining What Is Or Isn't Correct, So Anything That's Understood And Natural To Say Is Grammatically Correct, Which Would Include Singular They  
And C: The First People To Complain About Singular They Did So Hundreds Of Years After It Came Into Use, And Were Most Likely Doing It Out Of Misogyny.
he is wrong.
the Oxford English Dictionary has tracked the use of singular ""they"" back to 1375. people use the singular they naturally all the time.
for example: ""oh, someone left their wallet. i hope they come back for it.""
very very few english speakers on earth would say ""oh, somone left his or her wallet. i hope he or she comes back for it.""
so we all know how to use singular they. the thing that some people are bad at is using singular they when they're asked to do it.

the podcast ""Gender reveal"" discusses many arguments in episode 62. if you wanna check it out.

also the use of singular ""they"" predates the use of singular ""you"". like... ""you"" was only used for many people, not a single person. 

so again: your dad is the one who is grammatically incorrect and... well the other thing :)
""They/them is used as both singular and plural in the English language just like you/your""

He wants to talk about grammatical correctness, you can give a quick witty grammar lesson that will hopefully make sense in his phobic little brain :)

*If* you're willing to be so bold, of course /np
No disrespect to your dad but if he's more concerned about grammar than human dignity, he's got his priorities wrong
Send him the ‘Tim and Moby’ video on pronouns. (That’s my favorite thing to do)
Might need to educate him on it, because it is perfectly fine and valid :3 💜
""They"" has been singular for long than modern english has existed. By ~200 years iirc
Inform him that the singular they has existed in the English language since the 1300s, it's been used by Shakespeare, and that he should probably take first grade English again, so he can actually learn what a pronoun is.
Show him [this](https://youtu.be/5vQc5E_ZFk8) video
I  use they/ them and you dad is just being an asshole because he is closed minded and not accepting you as you are.
Tell him next time he uses singular 'you' that he's being grammatically incorrect, as singular 'they' has been around i believe several centuries longer than 'you'
You can tell your dad that Merriam Webster has listed they as a singular pronoun since 2017.
They/them is in fact grammatically correct. This is often used (at least in my case) to try and dehumanise people who use them as their pronouns.
Ask him this: Someone left an item (say a phone) and you are looking for the owner. When you hand it to the front desk or lost in found do you say ""someone lost his phone?"" No you say their phone because why? Because you don't know the gender. Non binary people are the same way just in a person. They don't have a gender so it's just they/them/their.
roses are red, violets are blue, singular 'they' predates singular 'you'
Tell your dad he's upsetting Shakespeare's ghost
Hey, my family is like this too. It's okay my sibling. Breathe. Education is sparse in some areas and communities. Let it creep into your every day language and he will do the same without question. Parents don't want to be questioned because it's them losing their child to growing up. 

Although uncomfortable, I'm sure he means no mallice xxx
You can hit him back with the actual it is grammatically
Correct
Educate your dad on how he is both factually incorrect and language is a constantly changing phenomena, not accepting changes will only leave him behind.
They/them can be confusing, especially when used in a sentence with multiple people, so instead, maybe use the persons name.

""Their my friend, with them."" (Who?) Them. (But who???) ""John is my friend and their with them!""

See how confusing that can be? 

Yea, I know, their they're there. But honestly, in English they sound exactly the same.
If your dad is the kind that will listen to evidence, the Oxford English Dictionary has this excellent [history of singular they](https://public.oed.com/blog/a-brief-history-of-singular-they/).

But sometimes it's not about facts. Very often, when people say that they dislike some ways of speaking, they are really saying is that they dislike the people who speak that way. And it sucks to hear that from a parent. I'm so sorry you're having to deal with that.
Get a sound button and everytime he uses they and them in singular contexts it goes ""eeeep""
Point out that they are grammatically correct. If he thinks they're idiotic that's his prerogative.
What I found helps a lot is an old word called polyandrogyny from Ancient Greece, where one's own pronouns are contextualized by the perceptions of others.

If one is seen as more masculine than the other, then he/him suffices, more feminine than the other, then she/her is fine, or if seen as truly non-binary then they/them or xe/xer/xei.

This frees oneself from the emotional burden of correcting others and allows one to simply be at peace knowing that they don't adhere to the center of a false dichotomous spectrum between masc and femme and instead are just...polyandrogynous.

Just don't call me slurs, that's pretty much my only rule.
Show him any Shakespeare play
Show him the Merriam-Webster dictionary info on the use of they as a singular word. And maybe show him the etymology and the origin. They has been a singular word for hundreds of years now.
Overuse ""he or she"" to death, to make a point. Like ""I was on the bus today and saw that someone had left his or her wallet behind. I looked in it to see if he or she had any identifying information inside that could help me get it back to him or her, but he or she just had a bank card for ""A Smith"".  I didn't want it to ruin his or her day, so I got off a stop early and handed in the wallet at a branch of his or her bank.  The teller said they would try to contact him or her and let him or her know to come and pick up his or her wallet from the branch"".

Your dad will realise how much he uses singular they.
[this video](https://youtu.be/f21t7DRKlg8) REALLY helped me understand it long before I started using singular they myself. maybe it would help?
Your dad is wrong - they/them pronouns are used as singular too. For example, if your friend told you that one of their friends got hurt, you may say 'Oh, are *they* okay?"" as you don't know the gender of them.

Quite ironic for your father.
If your dad thinks literary greats like Shakespear are ""grammatically incorrect and idiotic"" I guess you have to let them think that. You can't control what he thinks - but you should tell him every time he mentions it, you feel demeaned, it damages his relationhsip with you, and you would prefer to have a better relationship with him than that.
Your dad sounds like a grammatically incorrect pronoun. But in all seriousness, you could mentioned that singular they has been used at least since Shakespeare, or you could tell him that it's an adaptation of language to better describe something or someone. Both are true. We adapt non-English words into English vernacular all the time, why can't they/them be used exclusively to refer to a person if that's what they want. And if you think he'll listen you can tell him that other pronouns make you uncomfortable.
I had this issue.  You have two options - ignore them until you can move out and go no contact. Or If they're not abusive: force it down their throats - and I'm not being dramatic. 

You know those memes where it's like ""they them has existed since before singular you"", the posts about statistics on trans deaths due to isolation and denial of their identity, also every time you run across an article or a tweet discussing trans death or how they/them has historical accuracy . ALL OF IT.  because you can't just show education, you have to show the harm of erasing you.

Save it. Print it out or text it. Every time they argue, send more. When they misgender you - just correct it and keep going. If they argue simply walk away with ""there is reading materials provided already. my identity is not negotiable."" 

It will be hard. They will get defensive and argumentative. It is a hard line to break.

After a month of doing this you will know if it's worth the battle to keep them in your life or if going no contact is worth  more. It won't be easy and it will take potentially months upon months.
1.  Like others have said, there is historical precedent for singular ""they""

2.  Languages change and evolve over time. They always have and they always will.
Id send him a few links to a few different dictionary definitions saying singular they/them is grammatically correct
Jus ignore it
Dude same. So many people keep talking about how ridiculous they/them pronouns are and I hate that. A bunch of people use it all the time to refer to one person, but they keep on complaining because they don't like anything different. It's literally so easy. I hate living in a world like this 😫
tell him about an acquaintance, but don’t say the gender. some examples: ‘i made a new friend at school today and they like pokémon too. i heard we got a new neighbor but i haven’t seen them around.’ he’s probably used singular they before but just chooses to be a dick about it. i wish you luck homie ♥️
My dad says this. And then says if I have a right to say I'm Non-binary he's a right to say he's an aardvark. Both men should be ignored. My dad's lovely but not as funny or clever as he thinks.
„Oh Look, someone lost their wallet!“ im sure he says like this all the time. Listen carefully and remind him every time
“Good thing language isn’t prescriptive and never has been and never will be. The future is now old man.”
explain to him that singular (or plural?) you was used way later than singular they..
Ask him what he would do if he didn't know someone's gender and name
Your dad is grinding an axe, and it's not really about grammar. You can argue with him and be the whetstone, or you can note his issue and be about your business. I'm sorry it's like this. Be well.
Omg, someone dropped their wallet, I hope they find it.

Not
Omg, someone dropped her or his wallet, i hope she or him find it
Are you still living with your parents? If so, set a boundary by refusing to continue any conversation in which he refuses to use your pronouns. And if you aren't still living with your parents, this boundary is even easier. His childish behavior will only change if it's met with consequences.
My father is like this and I told him yesterday in a fight to fuck off as he was comparing me to a car and a MacBook. But you can give him reading material that could help (but was a better read for me and may be also for you ❤️):

How To They/Them: A Visual Guide to Non-binary Pronouns and the World of Gender Fluidity: https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/53443270 

Life Isn’t Binary: https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/43818540

There are more but this should be enough for now. The author is also non-binary so makes for a stronger case. And the first book will debunk flatly his belief because being nonbinary is not new and it’s not “American”. Everyone around the world almost has their own term for non-binary people and can even register as such in other countries. Not to mention Native Americans have their own term for nonbinary too.
Throw articles in his face proving him wrong.
dont listen to him, know in your heart that merriam webster thinks your did is wrong, and let him lay in the bed he's making. ignore him and later he'll come around or you'll outgrow him.

if he's acting like this, he doesn't care about grammar. he's transphobic.
Self report
Reasons I’m never coming out to my parents. I’m gonna boy-mode till I move out
""Oh no! Someone left their phone on the bus!""
We use it all the time without even thinking about it
Also it long preceded the singular you: up until the 17th century it was still thou, thee and thy. 

So singular they/them pronouns are effectively older than the singular you pronoun.
These new fangled pronouns! I just want to go back to the good old days in the 1200s. God I miss the plague.
>In 1660, George Fox, the founder of Quakerism, wrote a whole book labeling anyone who used singular you an idiot or a fool.
[deleted]
“Especially for someone of unknown gender” ah well people making the argument against they/them are already most likely misogynistic and will assign genders to certain jobs. 

Examples: “I went to the doctor.” “What did He say?”

“I talked to the nurse” “what did She say” 

It’s really annoying…
Even people who insist they only use he or she use they/them pronouns (I’m thinking of one particular tweet but unfortunately I can’t find it). They’re very present in the English language.
Then become a linguist just to spite him 😌
I Seriously Want To Learn Atleast A Bit Of (Reconstructed) PIE So Whenever People Make A Dumb Statement That Ignores The Fact Language Changes, I Can Just Respond In PIE Asking Why They Don't Talk Like That.
LOL I love this. Thou ftw
""Hey Can You Get M-"" ""Who's 'You'?"" ""Uh... You Are?"" ""Yeah But Who Are We? I'm The Only Other Person Here."" ""No One Else, Just You..."" ""But You Is Plural, Thou Canst Not Use It In The Singular, It's Grammatically Incorrect!""
This. Many parents simply do not respect their children even in the best of circumstances. The father here appears to be one of them. OP should make it abundantly clear that a future relationship after 18 is contingent upon respecting their pronouns at the *very least*.
Honestly I'd Just Say Ask What Makes Something Grammatically Correct Or Incorrect, I'd Be Willing To Bet They Couldn't Give An Actual Answer, Because There's No Good Answer That Would Indicate Singular They Is Incorrect, And I fact There's Hardly A Good Answer At All.
It is confusing too, tbf. Ever tried to write a story scene involving multiple characters when one of the characters uses they/them pronouns? Can be tricky.
Honestly There's No Good Argument That Singular They Is Grammatically Incorrect, But I Won't Hold That Against Your Friend As She Most Likely Was Just Taught That At A Young Impressionable Age, And Never Having Really Been Taught Otherwise Continued To Think It.
Unironically I'm Pretty Sure Half The ""Grammar Rules"" We're Told To Follow Only Exist Because 18th And 19th Century Garmmarians A: Forgot That English Isn't Latin, Or B: Were Bring Terrible People.
Good idea, I'll try this out :)
you don't have to convince anyone that your identity is valid, including your own parents. ppl like this usually dont wanna hear an english lesson. you can only be yourself and be confident in your own identity.
Fair enough lol I wish I never came out
also singular use if they/them predates plural
roses are red

violets are blue

singular ""they"" predates

singular ""you""
Do You Have A Source On That Date For Singular ""You""? I Know ""You"" Was Used As The Formal Singular For A Good While Before Being Used As The Default Singular (And In Fact I Believe Thou Is Still Used In Some Dialects), I'm Not An Expert But It Feels More Likely That's When It Became The Primary Singular, Rather Than It's First Use In The Singular.
This Lad's Brilliant. I Think He's Right And We Should Go Back To Only Using Thou In The Singular. (Nah Just Kidding I Only Support That As The Informal Singular, You For Formal All The Way!)
I appreciate striving for correctness, but they/their is grammatically correct in the scenario the original comment proposed.
You Can Literally Go Back, Look At The Earliest Recorded Cases Of People Complaining About Singular They, And They'll Say ""Since 'They' Is Grammatically Plural, You Can't Use It For A Singular Person, You Should Instead Use 'He' For A Person Of Unknown Gender, As Being The Greater Of The Two Sexes, The Masculine Encompasses The Feminine."" Or Some Sh*t Like That. So Yeah Definitely Rooted In Misogyny.

Although I Won't Ascribe That To Everyone Who Says That, Many Were Probably Just Told When They Were Young That Singular They Is Wrong, Without Any Reasoning, And Being A Gullible Child Believed It.
How would you articulate The Three Laryngeals though?
Oh, I love this. Stealing it.

why is every word capitalized
I'd Imitate The Sounds I Make When I'm Suffocating Due To Mucus Running Down My Throat And Preventing Me From Breathing, I Doubt People Who Don't Know How Languages Work Would Be Able To Tell The Difference.
I understand the desire to correct grammar anywhere. I have a degree in English. :) it/its are possessive pronouns. Furthermore, referring to people using it/its is pejorative in nature, as it is almost exclusively used to refer to inanimate objects/animals.
This is 100% correct I do just want to throw out for anyone reading that “it/it’s” are valid pronouns to go by if someone chooses to go by those pronouns.

Don’t call someone it if they didn’t asked to be called it though

ETA: I go by they/them pronouns and I’ve been called an it many times especially in high school it hurt, its not fun to be referred to in the way someone would refer to a freaking plastic cup.
I can't imagine being in one of my previous retail jobs and asking over the loudspeaker to the customer that left its iPhone 7 at the counter please retrieve it lol 

ETA because not the person this reply was for but chronic comment deleter I cannot respond to comments that are gone. I get you have a preference and that's fine. I get the reasoning from a grammatical prospective. But I'm an older millennial and still acutely aware of elder relatives using ""it"" as a pejorative for trans and nonbinary folks and friends and am thus also aware of the hurt it has caused. So for me, i am on the singular they/them hill.
There Are Some People Who Want To Be Called ""It"", But Yeah In General You Shouldn't Refer To Someone As It Unless They Specifically Tell You You Can, Because Generally It's Offensive And Dehumanising.
Reason I go by it/its as one of my pronoun sets, taking it back PLUS it's funny to respond to assholes calling me an it to be an ass with ""that's one of my pronouns so thank you""
True! Thanks for mentioning that!
I honestly prefer it/its over she/her like she/her hurts worse but I just cant get past the hate behind it but im super sensitive honestly. Love reclaiming those pronouns and it is funny"	11s487c	NonBinary	516	0.99	2023-03-15 18:07:52
My coworker refuses to use my pronouns, and it's causing distress and disassociation at work. Every time she does it, I'm not in a position to jump in and correct her, and reminding her politely just does nothing. I don't know what to do, I just started this job and it's already making me miserable.	UPDATE: I talked with my main manager and she apologized and encouraged me to correct her more if she slips up, which she did later but corrected herself almost instantly! We had a conversation and while she doesn't really understand nonbinary queerness, she said she'd try harder and told me about her gay niece and how she wanted to be supportive. I already feel so much better about the situation, as she can hopefully help with the others learning as well. Thank you all for your advice and support! Much love ❤	"I should add that I wear my binder to work every day (7 hour low stress shifts) and wear a pronoun pin with ""He/They"" next to my name tag. I even asked if I could wear it and she acknowledged it and said it was fine.
I'm sorry. Can you escalate this with your boss? Are trans workers protected from retaliation in your area?
Talk to HR and tell them your gender identity isn't being respected by your boss and coworkers. I'd look at your employee handbook or company policy on discrimination and what their stance is first to back you up
I heard someone have success with misgendering their coworker back. It sounds shitty, but that's kinda the point. The coworker realized how crappy it felt to be misgendered constantly and in front of others and actually stopped.
You could try and embrace the chaos and misgender them “accidentally” a lot. If they say something about how “I’m clearly [pronoun]”, you can say “sorry, maybe it would help me remember if you pinned your pronouns by your name tag, like me” and helpfully gesture to your name tag. Tho this is more of a *let’s start an actual fist fight* style of pushing back lol

/this is mostly a joke but like maybe a little serious
Call them the wrong pronouns back. Usually changes them pretty quick. Or ignore them until they call you correctly.
How this ends depends on how large your company is and what state you live in. Start creating a paper trail. You have probably already done so, but email the person asking them to stop, cc HR if you have one. If they don’t. Email your next line up stating similar, cc HR. Go up as far as you have to. 

Now that the document trail is out there. The state/country you are in matters. If they have laws that protect trans, then you’ll have the right docs for a suit. If not, they’ll just fire you. Either way, I’m looking for another position because you already aren’t respected there.
Trying requires the vulnerability of learning publicly—being wrong and correcting oneself. They’re not doing this at all, and you deserve to be treated with basic human respect. I’m so sorry this is your current reality OP. 

If it’s any consolation, I’ve totally dealt with this is several jobs. I calmly stand my ground and repeat people’s sentences with my correct pronouns, whether they acknowledge it or not. Doing that has helped me feel valid and seen by myself—respecting myself and being gentle with myself in those moments makes all the difference for me.
I have a friend that works at a restaurant and this happened to them. This is how they got their problem resolved.


Step 1-Ignore her. Anytime she tries to speak to you and is using the wrong pronouns, do not respond. Continue doing what you're doing

Step 2-Acknowledge it. If she confronts you or her boss about how you're not listening to her, start asking her questions like ""Well I thought you were talking to me, but then you said she/he. Who were you trying to talk to?"" Or ""Is there someone here with the same name as me? I heard my name, but you used she/he. That's not me.""

Step 3-Take this up higher. If it continues, report this to your HR department (if there is one available). Explain how she makes an uncomfortable environment for you to work in and how it's hard for you to work around her because she doesn't respect you. 


After discussing it enough with HR, they should start realizing how severe it is that they do respect your pronouns.
Would you have a code of conduct that includes pronouns/respect that you can rely on to advocate for your case?
I'm sure most people would get annoyed if you use kept using the wrong name or pronouns. You aren't overreacting, they owe you some basic human decency.
I am glad to hear the Update was positive. And yeah, that's the answer--if you're not being respected, talk to a manager. If the manager won't listen or you have concerns regarding them, go to HR.
You need to correct them in the moment. Be a broken record.
document everything. write a journal documenting how people are using the wrong pronouns for you, when you correct them, and them continuing to use the wrong pronouns, for both your coworker and your boss. go to HR, and see if anything happens, make sure to document. if nothing still changes, and you live in the US, file a complaint with the EEOC. I believe purposefully misgendering someone is considered harassment of a protected status. That is a federal law.
Find a new job. And don't give them 2 weeks. Literally just stop showing up. Every time a workplace disrespects me, I give them shit when I leave and quit without giving them 2 weeks notice. It's a mutual respect. Correct them next time they use your pronouns wrong, and if they don't correct themselves, look them in the eyes and quit. This way they know what they did. Want to keep your workers? Want your workers to respect you? Respect them. Everyone tells me ""don't quit without giving two weeks, you'll never find another place."" And it's the biggest lie people will tell you. I currently work for the best office ive ever worked at, and literally during my interview I told them about leaving my prior job without giving two weeks because the place was disrespectful and I view a respectful leave as something mutually deserved, and they kinda just laughed it off. Seriously. Don't be afraid to find search for new opportunities and tell them during the interview that you demand mutual respect at a workplace. If they don't hire you because youre non-binary and have a preference in pronouns, Sue them for discrimination.
If i was you id tell her straight up “its he/they” 
Dont even say sorry just be straightforward
You did nothing wrong and do not have to justify yourself. There is no burden on you to dress in a particular way or wear a badge. Once your coworker knows your pronouns, the burden is on them to use your pronouns or your name. This is not a you problem, this is a them problem. Good to see that it is working out!
My boss is even worse, and it's not like anyone is mean or aggressive about it. They just straight up never use the right pronouns and pretty much ignore me being trans entirely.
The problem is I've only been here a week and I really don't want them to see me as throwing a hissy fit or trying to cause issues. They said at the beginning of the job that they would try, and then proceeded to never gender me correctly. However, anytime it's brought up, they're ""trying"" and ""learning."" I want to believe that's true, but they will literally turn right around and do it again. I hate drawing attention towards myself, and it makes it really difficult to correct them, especially when they're not talking to me, only near me. It's complicated and maybe I should be putting in more effort, I'm just frustrated that it seems like nothing will change without causing any drama...
I probably will try this, it seems like the only thing that might make it click.
This is what I personally would do but I do realize I am privileged with having a union job and pretty well protected. Not everyone has the luxury of being an asshole back to them which is unfortunate.
This is what I was going to suggest
😂 That would be so funny actually, if it comes to that then that's an amazing comeback!
The problem is they aren't talking to me, always about me to a customer or coworker, so I feel like I can't butt in. If they were talking to me, it would be so much easier to quickly correct them. I can't ignore anyone without getting in trouble, but I might try casually misgendering them. If they actually notice, could be a good way to show how annoying it is, not to mention disrespectful 😅
Unfortunately, I live in the American Midwest and it's a very large corporation with lots of fast food restaurants, and in my experience, upper management is extremely dismissive. I don't want to go to HR just yet, and I don't even have the emails for any of the people I work with, but I do see them face-to-face 5 days a week. For many reasons, I will be stuck with this job for at least a year, so I really don't want to be fired. I'm going to try to be more insistent tomorrow when I say something, and if it still doesn't help, I'll see what I can do.
I have not tried repeating the whole sentence, that's actually a great idea and might get ignored less, thank you!
Yeahhh that would be lovely, but it's not that easy to get another job. I just found this one, and I don't have a vehicle, so I completely rely on working in the same area and at the same time as my partner. It's also a great job and the misgendering is the only problem.
Where do you live? In the US UK or EU this is considered harassment and discrimination. Trans people are protected under law (for now).

It doesn't matter if they're noticeably aggressive or not. 

If you are in those areas contact a pro Bono labor attorney and see what they say. There's a good chance you can sue and you get paid
That's not throwing a fit, it's asking for the bare minimum of decency. If they get away with it now, they're gonna keep doing it the entire time you're there
1)Gather evidence 2)Show that your complaint for harassment was ignored in writing 3)to a lawyer 4)get a payday
There's nothing to ""try"" or ""learn"" if you've been using he/they the whole time they've known you. Do they have this much trouble addressing new male coworkers as ""he"" or are you just special? 

That's a rhetorical question, btw. They don't care and this should go to HR.
Now is the best time to start things right. It's gonna be tougher later. Just know that no matter what, you will not lose your job if you properly bring this up with the right department.
You absolutely can butt in when they’re talking to a coworker, especially if they know you are there. And you really - *really* should consider doing so, I think. 

Since you mentioned you wear pronoun buttons in another comment, I think you should think to do it in front of customers. Probably makes life less confusing for them when an employee says one pronoun and then points to a guy who has another on their chest.
To be honest, what others think of you is none of your business. This is the hardest lesson to learn. I’m 39 and just finally getting it through my head…fuck everyone else. Be you. Do you. Ignore the haters and embrace those around you and those that are welcoming. Life is too short for us to walk around stressed about other people. You are enough as you are and that’s all that matters. Chin up friend!💜
I hope it helps, friend!!

That's true, I feel like nothing is going to change, but I want to make sure it doesn't go from dismissive to hostile because of how I go about putting my foot down. Even if they start gendering me correctly, if it's from getting in trouble with HR I have a fear of being stuck here for a year with everyone resenting me.
The customers are almost all very old or yeehaw so if they notice the pin, they just say *ma'am* with more conviction. The pin is, or was supposed to be, a helpful guide for my coworkers 😅 but you're right, i probably should just start being annoying with it until they change
Good for you if you can think like that, but for me it's about respecting me as the person I say I am. I don't mind customers misgendering me at all, it's not their business to know or my business to correct them. But I am with my coworkers every day for 7 hours, and every day it happens a handful of times, which is enough to make me want to crawl into the oven. I know who I am and that most people will not realize or remember that I'm nonbinary, and that's okay, but these people seem to be purposefully ignoring my requests to not be called she constantly and it does hurt me, whether or not it's ""my business.""
The thing about that is that a lot of trans and nonbinary people have really bad dysphoria and things like that that look super small make it so much worse usually. It's not a get over it issue for most, it's more of a this is causing clinically significant distress issue. And that leads to a lot of bad things.
Labor laws exist
Try to arrange a formal meeting with your manager maybe?
Maybe yeah. She's honestly been the worst at it so talking to her one on one again might help. I really hope so.
Look up the laws in your area about recording conversations you're part of. if legal, record your conversation on your phone. If it goes poorly, take it to HR with your recording
Thank you for the tip

MY MOM HAS STARTED CALLING ME KIDDO	I LOVE MY MOM SO MUCH, INSTEAD OF USING THINGS LIKE “baby girl” SHEs STARTED USING KIDOO. AND THEY/THEM PRONOUNS FOR ME. I AM OVER THE MOON. I LOVE MY MOM	"My dad has recently decided that the way to refer to my (male) friend and me (afab, definitely somewhere in the non binary department but not really out) is ""the boys"". As in ""wait a minute the boys will be here soon too"", and it feels pretty awesome.
Good for you! My dad is trying his best!
Yes! Yes! Yes!
Cool beans! My mum is just referring to me as her teenager now; she’s slipped up once or twice with pronouns but she’s trying really hard and it means the world to me

Edit: I slightly mistyped ‘pronouns’ and it got autocorrected to ‘Ron puns’. Yes.
Poggers
I absolutely love being called kiddo! Congrats fam
My mother has recently been calling me “demigod” cause I came out to her as demisexual, and my best friend is calling me entity and I love all of it so much. 
Woo!
Your mom rocks! My mom has always called me “kidlet” and added “child of mine” along the way. 🤗

I was asked my pronouns in a job interview!	"The first thing they asked me was ""so, your pronouns are they/them right?""

I was absolutely shocked since nobody had bothered to acknowledge this let alone ask me to confirm. I happily said ""yeah, that's right!"" and we continued with the interview.

I start on Thursday 🥰"	"Omg that's incredible!
[removed]
That's so cool! This should be a standard thing in interviews.
Wow! A friendly boss, how lovely! I hope you enjoy the job!
You know it's going to be a good culture fit when that's not even an issue. That's awesome!
That's amazing! I think a lot of people are realizing trans and non binary people are just as amazing as everyone else, and it really gives me (and undoubtedly everyone else) a lot of hope!
The world is moving forward!
That's so great! It's nice to see that employers are asking these kind of questions, I feel like it'll be a positive work environment for sure :) when I do interviews I usually ask whoever is doing it what their pronouns are, then I'll say mine
This is exciting! Can I ask what general professional field the job is in? 

I'm sure this was great to experience first hand, and it's also great to hear for the rest of us.
Humanity is evolving if only people asked me that at school everyone calls me a she and refuses to call me the name and pronouns I identify with
I absolutely love this! I hope this becomes more standard practice.
That's so great! I'm happy for you! Best of luck with your new job. (What is your new job?)
Yay that's great!
That's amazing, congrats!
[removed]
Thank you so much! ☺️
I definitely agree!
It definitely gave me a lot of hope! ^^
That's actually a great idea!
Sure thing, I'm working as a front-end website developer :)
Thank you so much! I work in web development. It's also pretty high paying so that's always good too :')
I'm kind of confused by your comment to be honest :') I'm from England and, like most places, people don't really bother to use my preferred pronouns unless they're also part of the LGBT community and/or a close friend/my bf. 

People who absolutely refuse to use my preferred name and pronouns annoy me, since it's just plain stubbornness and not caring about how I feel at all. It's different if they slip up or don't understand and need educating, but people who know it makes me sad yet still say ""no that's stupid, I'm not calling you that"" are not people I want to be around. Unfortunately my parents are like that but I just allow them to keep using my old name and stuff since they're used to it and I still love them.

If someone wants to be referred to as they/them and you refuse, using she or he instead, I'd say it makes you a bit of an asshole, especially being non-binary and having the knowledge that it can cause dysphoria etc. If I was going to a different country however, I wouldn't mind being called he/she since I understand that there are differences and things like that. I'm pretty easy-going on that note.

Anyway, I've kinda turned to rambling. Thanks for congratulating me!
[removed]
well, if you don't have gendered pronouns in your country, there's probably no need to call someone they/them, just like in my native language, we have a gender-neutral pronoun, so there's no need to call people they/them. And all pronouns are meant for when other people are talking about you, not with you. You don't address cis people with he/she either.
> liberty to address others with just she/he because they are used to describe what I'm seeing instead of what you are inside

The problem being that these aren't always the same thing and you can't tell just by looking
I typically get positive responses from it, along with ""that's a question we don't get very often""
Excellent! Thanks for sating my curiosity! 

Best of luck :)
[removed]
Has anyone ever responded negatively?
I would disagree, race isn't something you can change but your gender is (trans). You even stated that you are non-binary so you should understand this. If a trans girl is at the start of her transition and still looks rather 'masculine', there's no way in hell I'd still be using 'he' even if she looked that way. It's just about respect for people's feelings and not being selfish.
Not in my experience, tho sometimes when the interviewers are older people they'll be like ""huh?"" And then I explain and they're like ""oh okay "" and say their pronouns

She a little confused, but she got the spirit	"My aunt is trying to use my correct pronouns, and she has the ""they"" part mostly down. However, she no longer uses ""you"" when directly addressing me. She uses ""yall"" instead. Like I'm a group of people.

AYAB: assigned yall at birth 😂"	"This delights me!
It's hilarious. You can tell she is trying XD
Okay that's honestly so sweet? Please tell your aunt she's doing great for me
That...  Honestly makes a certain amount of sense.  Even the singular they is treated as plural grammatically, so if you treat ""y'all"" as the plural of ""you,"" it would be correct to refer use it for someone with they/them pronouns.
does this mean she knows you’re just three cats in a trenchcoat?
That’s adorable
I laughed so hard tears formed, I love it.
I love this hahahah. That's kinda adorable, I'm glad she's trying
That's so cute😂

Sure, but dialects that use ""y'all"" essentially use it as plural you, often in place of plural you.  I'm just saying it has some internal consistency.
Impossible. The maximum amount of ferrets in a trenchcoat is 5.

They aren't claiming it's regularly used like that.

About Demi Lovato...	"Just heard she changed her pronouns back to she/her after a year of being nonbinary. She said she just wants to feel human, and that recently she's been feeling more feminine again.

Help me figure out why this feels disrespectful to the community. Or am I being disrespectful by questioning why she flipped back?


Edit: Thank you lovely humans! I appreciate that people are allowed to try things and find out what is and isn't for them. I guess even high list celebrities struggle with gender identity and have to move through their truth to find it."	"She didn’t change them back. She simply added them to the existing pronouns she wanted to go by. Plenty of non-binary people go by she/they.
People are allowed to try things. If no one ever questioned their gender, these subs would be empty and we'd all still be miserable believing there were no other options. I think everyone should take a good hard look at their gender and make sure they're not just doing what they're ""supposed to do."" And if they look at it and go, ""yep, I'm cis"" at least they had Thoughts.

Now I don't know anything about Demi Lovato, the name is familiar but I couldn't pick her out of a line up or tell you what she's a celebrity for. Even if I could, I don't know her motivation or read her mind (and neither can anyone else) so I'm gonna assume she was genuinely questioning. This ""just a fad"" rhetoric is going to hurt everyone in the long run
She didn’t do anything. Experimenting with your gender should be encouraged to help relieve the stigma. I’m not sure how her journey with gender affects anyone but herself tbh.
To be fair she might still be nonbinary, but just... feeling more feminine and using she/her?
I did this a handful of times before realising I was just genderfluid
She uses she/they now according to her instagram bio, so she hasn’t exclusively changed pronouns back to she/her.  Regardless, I think people should be able to explore gender identities to figure out what makes them most comfortable even if they end up coming to the conclusion that they’re cis
Nonbinary people don’t *have* to use they/them pronouns.

Also let’s not forget that her overdose from a few years back along with the years of substance abuse beforehand caused permanent brain damage. Her behavior and thought patterns and even her personality changed substantially as a result of that.
It would be nice to also put in the main post that they actually still go by they/them along with she/her, and saying they ""flipped back"" is misinformation and probably damaging.
I feel like it could be disrespectful if we make it be. if we got mad at everything someone worded wrong we wouldn't get anywhere imo.
Like yea ""feel human"" could've been said differently, but there's nothing wrong with realizing that you aren't nonbinary or trans after trying to see if you were.

If we gatekeep the chance for people to figure themselves out in a supposedly safe environment, we'd be just like the transmedicalist who don't deserve to speak or have a platform.

But we all feel different about different things.
As a non binary person who goes by - and feels right being referred to as the pronouns that were assigned to me - I get where she is coming from. There is no correct way to be non binary and if we can’t change our minds or be the ones in charge of our own identity then what is the point
I can’t tell you how it feels to the community because I’m not the entire community and neither you nor I speak for everyone in it. That’s your gut reaction and it’s for you to analyse.

I used to think I was a binary trans woman until two years on Hrt and realized I’m non binary and have fluid presentation I just didn’t want an obvious masculine body. Does that mean I shat on and disrespected every trans woman who ever lived in spite of how sincere I was about my dysphoria and how I felt best described me at the time? No
I felt off about it too, but I realized my feeling isn't even about Demi. I just heavily dislike how any time a trans or questioning celebrity does anything public, it gets taken as representative of our entire community and then people assume we are all like that. Demi didn't do anything wrong by exploring her identity and my issue is with the culture, not her or other individuals in her position
The pronouns in their bio are “they/them/she/her.” Plenty of nonbinary folks use multiple sets of pronouns, and plenty feel “more masculine” or “more feminine” without it meaning they’re whatever binary gender is most commonly associated with those traits (same goes for feminine guys and masculine ladies, presentation doesn’t necessarily equal identity!). She’s allowed to explore their identity, and just because one of the sets of pronouns a person uses aligns with their AGAB it doesn’t necessarily mean they’re cis.
She may be  genderfluid. Tbh she’s still exploring like me. It’s fine . There is no reason why she shouldn’t be seeking .
Even if she did decide she isn’t NB isn’t that ok too? Not everyone is CIS/NB/Trans/etc. and some people need to explore a little bit to discover that .
its okay to experiment with your identity, she can be whatever the hell she wants and it's not disrespectful or any of our business. if she said something like ""nevermind nonbinary people aren't real im a girl again"" that would be disrespectful, but changing your gender identity isn't disrespectful at all.
Genderfluid people exist
Non-binary people can also still use binary pronouns and still be valid as non-binary
OP, do you just get off on lying about trans people or something?

[""It's also like I'm such a fluid person when it comes to my gender, my sexuality, my music, my creativity.""](https://spoutpodcast.sounder.fm/episode/demi-lovato)

And in the same podcast, from Demi themselves;

""I've actually adopted the pronouns of she her again. So for me, I'm such a fluid person that I don't really I don't find that I am. I felt like, especially last year, my energy was balanced and my masculine and feminine energy \[...\] I didn't feel necessarily like a woman, I didn't feel like a man Um, I just felt like a human and that's what they them is about. For me, is just about like feeling human at your core. Recently I've been feeling more feminine and so I've adopted her again. But I think what's important is, like, nobody's perfect.""

[She still goes by they/them, but *also* uses she/her](https://www.instagram.com/ddlovato/?hl=en). Just like plenty other nonbinary people do.
Can you imagine the lack of certainty in discovering your gender identity, only in the public eye? Like, don't get me wrong, Demi Lovato is out there, singing to ghosts and stuff. But, my personal experience as someone freshly out as non-binary is that I'm still not certain about what pronouns I'm cool with. Cut them a break, sometimes you don't know what your pronouns are until you experiment with them a little.
Pronouns = \ = gender. A lot of non binary people go by she/her or he/him, and a lot of cis people go by they/them. Many of us have changed our pronouns multiple times in our lives, it’s just that none of us are very famous (I think).
Can we all take a moment to appreciate the pun, that if Demi Lovato uses she/they pronouns Demi is a Demigirl. <3

It's obviously up to Demi to identify as such, but this is an option as a gender identity for she/they pronouns.

Sources (in case anyone isn't familiar with the term):

She's still nonbinary. Nonbinary people don't just use they/them pronouns. Some use he/they (like me). Some use she/they (like Demi Levato). Some use all and some use none. Nonbinary isn't a third box.
I think the headlines are sometimes misleading, I believe Demi Lovato is using She/They now. It's okay to get it wrong and have to try another option, I know a couple of my friends were well into their transitions before the realized they were non-binary rather than trans or the other way around. I'm glad she's acknowledged it publicly, because I think people need to see that it's okay to question and figure themselves out over time. I'm not upset, I'm happy that someone in the public eye is going through this so that it raises awareness.
perhaps put less stock into what celebrities do with their time and genders.
I'm assuming she's just exploring her gender identity. Nothing to be angered about.
Many of us try different pronouns until we find ones that fit best, and for some of us it can be a long journey 
Ms Lovato has my full support
I'm a she/they nonbinary demiwoman who typically puts my ""she/her"" pronouns first. It's very possible that she could still be nonbinary to an extent but is preferring to present as feminine.

But if she's not, then at least she tried something to see if it felt right. Lots of people don't get their identity pinned down on the first try.

I'm not even sure I've got the right terminology for my own gender ID or sexuality. I just kind of keep going with whatever feels right.

Identity is a weird thing.
I think most people have it covered here, but I get why the immediate reaction was maybe frustration(?) Demi is one of the most well known enbies and it's frustrating that this is something transphobes are going to run with saying that being nonbinary isn't real, or is a phase.

Also fuck all the headline writers who made it sound like she completely changed her pronouns back instead of adding she back into the mix along with they
I think because she's a celebrity all of a sudden it's a bad thing to be queer. I'm not trying to bash you or anything but would you question this is she wasn't a celebrity? Probably not. That's what I don't get, she's human just like anyone else. Why do we automatically assume someone has ill intentions just because they are popular?
I really don't see how her changing back is offensive. but I struggle to understand a lot of the view points on this sub so idk. people here seem very divorced from my non binary experience.

I'd just let yourself feel how you want to feel and not be so concerned with the overall narrative of the non-binary community because we simply don't agree on anything regarding these ideas anyway
Wouldn't she be considered genderfluid then? There's nothing wrong with that
Demi's identity is her business same as all of us. This doesn't feel disrespectful at all.
People can go by she/her only and be nonbinary. I know agender people who are like ""oh you know what, I do not have a gender just good vibes only"" (somewhere I was at for awhile as well) They still just used the pronouns everyone defaults too for them, they just don't particularly care. I know for me when I was still using agender I used all pronouns just because I didn't particularly care. But if someone asked, I defaulted to she/her.
People are allowed to try things. If no one ever questioned their gender, these subs would be empty and we'd all still be miserable believing there were no other options. I think everyone should take a good hard look at their gender and make sure they're not just doing what they're ""supposed to do."" And if they look at it and go, ""yep, I'm cis"" at least they had Thoughts.

Now I don't know anything about Demi Lovato, the name is familiar but I couldn't pick her out of a line up or tell you what she's a celebrity for. Even if I could, I don't know her motivation or read her mind (and neither can anyone else) so I'm gonna assume she was genuinely questioning. This ""just a fad"" rhetoric is going to hurt everyone in the long run
Pronouns have little to do with your identity as a whole.
Demi Lovato is still nonbinary, they just use she/her in addition to they/them.
They’re still non-binary! She’s using both they/them and she/her pronouns. Completely valid and I’m very happy they are becoming more and more themself.
People with this attitude who act like exploring your gender and deciding that it’s not for them lead to the harsh gatekeeping that gets in the way of transition for many
God, a lot of people in this comment section suck. People are allowed to question their gender identity as many times as they feel fit until they find what feels right for them. As somebody else said in this comment section, if we weren't allowed to question our gender identity than a lot of these subs wouldn't exist. A lot of these comments have the same energy as some cis person saying somebody isn't supposed to question their assigned gender at birth. 

And yes, you are being disrespectful for questioning why she flipped back.
I believe they still have they/them pronouns listed as well. It’s not our place to judge other people’s journeys in this realm. I get so tired of gatekeepers being like “You’re valid!!!! Unless you’re a celebrity I dislike in which case you’re probably faking”
I have gone back and forth and now I do they/them and he/him, gender identity is fluid, I would just say maybe worry about yourself and don't put so much stock into what other people do but respect her pronouns or I'll come at you because I'm Batman.
Forgive me, I haven’t read all the comments, but Demi still uses she/her/they/them pronouns, so technically, Demi is still non-binary. 

I don’t like how some media sites used her/them as clickbait. Let’s be real here, so many people don’t read past the title, so I think it was more disrespectful of the media sites to do that to Demi AND I think the media sites used her/them as a scapegoat to stir up controversy about the non-binary community.
You’re telling me you never experimented with different pronouns?
So many people have pointed out that you are wrong, and yet you ignore those comments. Do you just think she/they pronouns are not valid or something?
I honestly think most people probably never used they/them for Demi, and it probably just was a kinda awful feeling— might just be projecting though lol
I read the article for context, and she said she originally adopted they/them pronouns bc they felt like a human-as in not male or female, just a human. Now they added she/her pronouns back bc they’re feeling more feminine these days and she described herself as feeling fluid gender-wise. I honestly think the headlines were really poorly worded-I get your confusion. 

In case anyone is confused by my pronoun use-I alternated using both sets of pronouns for Demi Lovato-hope it reads alright.
They’ve been going by She/They pronouns as far as I’ve heard. Still non-binary but for many people using both is easier/more comfortable. She also may be continuing to explore her gender and being in Althea spotlight I wouldn’t be surprised if she got a ton of backlash for their coming out story which I imagine would make things harder.
Genderfluidity or the fact that anyone can be however far they're into identifying the way they are and yet still question it
[they say they are a fluid person in their life and her gender](https://www.huffpost.com/entry/demi-lovato-pronouns-she-her_n_62e98bede4b0c5501614cfe3?utm_source=facebook&utm_medium=news_tab&fs=e&s=cl)
They might be gender fluid, which still somewhat fits under the umbrella of being non-binary. I've heard from a few people that Demi changed their pronouns to they/she, which lots of people in the community go by. It's a valid question though, and thank you for asking!
[deleted]
Not disrespectful in the slightest. Essentially saying that identifying as enby allowed them to find their humanity again, giving them the mental space to find her femininity again. I don't know the person, but it sounds like the whole story might be a bit different than it first seems from headlines as well...
Nothing wrong with her doing this. Well, that would be the case if she didn't say the following.  I have a friend who thought they where Non-Binary, but turns out he was just a trans man. Thinking your non-binary and changing your mind is all fine and stuff, it's your journey afterall. But her saying what she did made it seem offensive to Non Binary People, whether it was truly meant that way is a mystery. (Edit: idk if this is important to say, but idk who Demi even is)
There’s nothing wrong with her going back or further exploring her identity. However there’s also nothing wrong with being upset about feeling as if you’ve lost representation. Both can coexist.
Your edit is everything. Thank you for prompting great discussion and truly hearing what people had to say.
The media is just tearing Demi down and spreading misinformation about the interview that happened today. It's so gross.
Sounds like she's just trying to use pronouns as a trend
There are 3 possibilities here.

1. She realized she was wrong/ she was just exprimentinf

2. She just prefers she/her to they/them

3. She was pretending to be non-binary to sell more stuff (I don’t think this is likely, but you never know. She has been fading from the spotlight for a while)

Edit: i didn’t account for the possibility of Demi being a she/they. Kinda weird considered I’m a he/they
Well, the human part I felt triggered, but sometimes you can question, and then find out you actually are a straight cis. Also, sometimes people might identify as a gender, and they really are that, but as time goes by, they can return to their original self

tbf, demi lovato does seem to he a bit of a nut, but that doesn't make their identity any less valid. even the ultrarich have a complicated relationship with gender, but because their platform is so much more public its held to much more scrutiny. doesnt mean your offense is misplaced, but celebrities are at the end of the day peiple too
I made a post about my concerns to her gender identity not long ago.. this only confirms it all.

Being non-binary is not a lifestyle.. nor is it the answers to all your problems. It's just a gender identity...
My pronouns are king and lord
Did she actually say she just wants to ""feel human""? Umm that feels pretty invalidating to be fair. Does she believe nonbinary folk are not human?
idk, i think it's pretty normal for your identity to change, it's okay to try out different labels and pronouns. it does feel kinda weird that she said she wants to feel human though... but maybe it's related to the backlash she was getting after the coming out, and referring to the fact people were disrespecting her because of it
Instagram still has both she and they

Going by they/she instead of they/them doesn't make you not nonbinary. It is totally valid to use any pronouns and still be nonbinary.
Yep, I use she/they and tbh I'm not really offended when people slip and call me he or use ""sir."" I've had people mistakenly call me ""your honor"" and really? I think that's how all enbies should be addressed going forward.
Adding to that, there are also people who go by she/they/him. Jonathan Van Ness for example.
Please upvote this to the top ugh. People need to read the articles not just the title of Reddit posts by someone that just straight up lied.
Exactly I use they/them/she/her and am *STILL* non-binary, I’m just fluid between feminine and neutral aligned genders
[deleted]
I have an NB child. If they are going through a “phase” (aka:questioning) which is what most family/friends are quick to ask:

Who tf cares? They can be any gender they want at any time they want. 

At least I was a fucking supportive parent. Damn.

The word “phase” infuriated me. So what? Why are we so worried about what our children are doing with the private parts we’ve spent their entire lives telling them are their OWN private parts anyway? 

Those parts, feelings, identity, gender norms…

Those are NOT *** my business regardless of how many times you change it or how many “phases” you go through regardless of if you’re my child, friend, or a celebrity…

Just be supportive. It’s not hard. It’s not about anyone but the person you’re supporting. 

I wish people would get this. It seriously makes my blood boil.

Edit: NOT *** my business.
It's totally fine, the problem is that radicals are going to equate this to the ""It's just a fad/the popular thing to do"" rhetoric, even if it was just trying on something that didn't fit in the end
they still use they/them, but also she/her. she’s still non-binary, the actual article wasn’t saying they changed their pronouns, but that she added to them.
This, Demi just happens to be a celebrity so every move she makes is extremely publicized. She should still be allowed to explore her identity
I saw an article where Demi Lovato literally said something about feeling ""fluid"" when it comes to their gender. I think maybe she could possibly be genderfluid and is still figuring out what labels, terms, and expressions feel comfortable.
and this change happened quite a while ago, unless I'm missing something.
Maybe OP just read a news article that unfairly uses this to promote a transphobic agenda. 

I think that’s the real invalidating possibility of this, not Demi Lovato, good for her, she has done no wrong. 

But what might be a problem and invalidating is articles and media using this to say “see it’s just a trend,” or “she regretted it, so will everyone else when they wake up.” I think that’s the real negative invalidating fallout that might happen from this.

Friend, I don't even like Demi Lovato 😂 

I was, however, very excited when she came out as nonbinary last year, simply because she's a popular and outspoken artist. What a chance for some NB representation! Like yasss please we need more NB people in those positions! Even if she is next gen Lindsay Lohan, it's still something. 

I'm just sad that I'm losing that chance.
she's a singer btw, she's been around for quite sometime, since like 2007
You stop spreading opinion based information. Genderfluid is under the non-binary umbrella. Also she didn’t go back to she/her only, they use she/they pronouns.
GENDERFLUID IS UNDER THE NON-BINARY UMBRELLA. THEY ARE NON-BINARY
https://www.reddit.com/r/NonBinary/comments/welwz3/about_demi_lovato/iipjycp?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share&context=3
absolutely agree
[Demi still uses they/them alongside she/her](https://www.instagram.com/ddlovato/?hl=en), [they're *still* nonbinary.](https://spoutpodcast.sounder.fm/episode/demi-lovato)
AND it kind of makes the NBs look bad. If Demi Lovato 'went through a phase' and detransitioned, imagine how many people will start questioning the validity of other NBs.
Wow that post aged well in only 2 weeks. You are very right, all her interviews about being NB were like ""I threw off the shackles of gender because I want to do what I want, oh and also religious trauma made me ashamed to be a woman""
""I didn't feel necessarily like a woman, I didn't feel like a man. Um, I just felt like a human and that's what they/them is about. For me, it's just about like feeling human at your core.""
Demi Lovato absolutely believes nonbinary people are human, the OP was taking the quote out of context.
WAKE UP SHEEPLE
Your honor?  That's glorious and I'm insisting on those pronouns from now on.
My nonbinary friend and I (I'm genderqueer) always refer to eachother as ""m'lord"" and it's honestly my fave
Omg exact same for me. Although I've never been called ""your honor""! Lmao
How about “your excellency”?
Are you a judge or something?
I prefer ""your highness"" but will settle for anything (except ""it"") really so long as the person is polite.
That'll be me too
Yeah I saw that Reddit post and commented basically this same thing on it too. Because when you click the article it clearly says “added pronouns” not “changed back to”.
Also, my pronouns are she/they as well, although I prefer they. We exist!
Everything I’ve read literally says they/them and decided she/her is also acceptable because they’ve been feeling more feminine lately. But ok.
insta says they/them and she/her

I wish my parents were like you, they completely invalidated me and called it “a fad” and I’m only doing it cause all of my friends are. But I thank you as a Enby Child for being supportive of your child! 💛🤍💜🖤
[removed]
okay, but you should have a problem with them, not her. You going to point fingers at every person who experiments bc the “radicals” may use it against us?
Yeah they changed it a while back. They just talked about It in an interview for the first time today
If only we had something - like a globe wide mesh - that we could access for free in order to fact check one article against the reality. God, that would be so nice.

Also, *Demi is still nonbinary* so 1. there's no ""phase"" and 2. why are you blaming minorities for our oppressors actions?
Transphobes don't fucking care what we do, how many boots we lick, how much we conform to their view of what we should be; **they still hate us**. So why the *fuck* should we have to cater to them? Who *cares* if Demi defining themselves a little more gives them a little ammo for a week? *They've been shooting at us the entire time anyway.*
Hi, there! :) Not sure what part you're confused about in my statement.

I don't see me defining how pronouns work, for there to be an issue. What I did mention was a possible gender identity that exists, is valid, and an option for those who use she/they pronouns.

Hope that helps! <3
not exactly, there's always a possibility that she might actually be non-binary. it doesn't even matter though, it's her gender and it's not right to get upset over it
You don’t have to use only they/them pronouns to be non-binary… so her adding she/her back to her pronouns isn’t losing representation.
Trans umbrella***
oh ok. I didn’t even know who Demi was before today so idk their situation or anything like that.
Oh, I was completely wrong. Thanks for the info
[deleted]
Yup. This. It's ""your honor"" or GTFO
If anybody ever tips a fedora at me and says ""m'they'dy"" I will leave my physical form and ascend to nirvana!
There's still time!
What do they use with the Pope? I want that one!
I'm a lawyer, so people will come up to me in court to ask a question or something, and I guess they figure since you call a judge ""your honor"" that this is what they're supposed to call everyone to be polite?

There’s always room for more NB kids (and everyone else, too) in my heart. If you need a “mom” my inbox is open. 

Thank you for your kind words ❤️
… but I’m literally doing the opposite? 

Do you understand what grooming is?

I’m so sick of that word being used out of context. It creates issues for children who need parents and law enforcement to take the word seriously and it’s now so over-used, it can’t be.

JFC get ahold of yourself.
Let me add that these are not *my* viewpoints, but what I believe some people are equating the situation to
yoo happy cake day !!
I’m sorry if I didn’t communicate my intentions properly, but all I meant to say is, your original comment was that “OP why would get off on lying about trans people?” 

And all I meant to say was that, depending on where OP got the information, it might be better to place the responsibility on biased transphobic media, and not directly place it on OP, who could’ve easily read an article about how “Demi realizes she’s a woman after all!”

I said in my post that Demi has done no wrong, good for her. So I don’t see why you think I’m saying we as a minority should be responsible for what transphobes do. I don’t see why you say that I’m saying that Demi adding to her identity is a problem? Where do I blame minorities for our oppressors actions? 

All I said was that OP might’ve gotten this information from biased articles, not everyone fact checks every single thing they read. And the responsibility of the “lie” you point out in your comment could easily be transphobic media, and that that’s the most invalidating aspect here that this can be unfairly taken advantage of. I was careful to say that Demi has done no wrong, good for her, it’s not her fault if transphobes misinterpret her words either deliberately or deliberately. 

So sorry, I don’t really see why you see the reason to call me out for “blaming minorities for our oppressors actions?” I was just trying to say in response to you that OP might not be directly lying depending on where they heard this…..

So please, I don’t know why you decided to send such a demoralizing comment, in a place where we are supporting eachother against oppressors, but I would appreciate if you would realize that I’m not blaming minorities and that perhaps OP was asking an honest question and not lying

Am I really saying anything wrong by saying the only problem here is transphobes?
[deleted]
Obviously. But their argument was specifically that Demi isn't non-binary
No problem; OP has written this post in absolute bad faith.
[removed]
she may not have realized that she was just experimenting. it may have felt very real and permanent to her at the time.
🎩 m’they’dy!
“Your Holiness” I think
Genderfluid is under the umbrella of non-binary genders..
genderfluid falls under the nonbinary umbrella tho
This would be like saying non-binary ppl aren't trans, enby is under the umbrella, and gf is under enby
>Same umbrella category of queer, still not the same thing.

.....do you even know the definition of non-binary? non-binary is when your gender identity is ""neither fully male or fully female"". genderfluid, due to the fact that the person's gender fluctuates (and not even always just between the binary genders), is by definition a non-binary identity
if you read past the headlines it literally says Demi uses both they and she pronouns and that this is common among non-binary people. we’re allowed to evolve.
Didn’t know you were such an expert on how other people feel about themselves. Also way to throw genderfluid nonbinary people under the bus lmao
>She is fluid. Not non binary

genderfluidity *is* non-binary. quit gatekeeping
and who appointed you here to speak for those people? and if you don’t agree, why are you speaking on some other people’s opinion’s behalf?

Edit, for clarity: Not trying to be rude. I just don’t understand the use in replying to seemingly defend or explain a viewpoint that you don’t even agree with.
>**Comment One:** But what might be a problem and invalidating is articles and media using this to say “see it’s just a trend,” or “she regretted it, so will everyone else when they wake up.” I think that’s the real negative invalidating fallout that might happen from this.  
>  
>**Comment Two:** I don’t really see why you see the reason to call me out for “blaming minorities for our oppressors actions?

You're literally saying that Demi exploring their gender is a reason media will accuse us of faking. 

Newsflash: ***Society has been transphobic long before any celebrity ever explored their gender in the public eye.***
Right. As I said. So if I'm technically right, as you say, then there really isn't any need for mockery of how I type ""hope that helps <3"" nor is there a need for a debate here. 

At this point you're just entering troll territory, which I'm not investing any further of my time into.
Well she's not. She's gender-fluid. Which is under the trans umbrella.
I've reported them to mods. Seems like they're intentionally invalidating she/they people at this point
Of all places to see people being gatekeeping, I never thought it would be here.
""Your Holiness"" makes me feel like a top-tier pornstar with the best holes in 4k. 

&#x200B;

I'll take it.
[removed]
True, but we need to understand what we are up against on the road to acceptance. Memes are posted all the time showing those same points from unaccepting people. What they say angers us, becomes very tiring and I’m sick of the disparaging, but public commentary is relevant to celebrity news. Demi is going through something controversial and on balance it’s beneficial that celebrities are treading this path for us in front of the world.
I’m not saying that’s Demi’s fault or her responsibility. But that the transphobic media is a problem. I’m not saying Demi shouldn’t have given an interview adding she/her pro nouns, I only meant to say that OP might’ve been mislead by transphobic media unfortuently taking advantage of this. 

I was just trying to give OP the benefit of the doubt, to say that maybe it’s a bit of a rush to say they’re getting off on lying about trans people. Of course society and patriarchy has always been transphobic, and that’s not the fault of us trans people that speak out about our experience. 

Why is it so bad to say that a beautiful thing like Demi talking about adding she/her pronouns in an interview might be unfairly used by the media and patriarchy? I said that to give OP the benefit of the doubt, I don’t want to discourage people from asking questions about things they may not know here by saying they’re getting off on lying about trans people.

ETA, Beautiful things that trans people do are often unfairly used by the media and patriarchy, you say that’s always been the case so what’s the point in mentioning it, but if it’s true what’s so bad about mentioning that it exists? Isn’t it okay that some of us mention it, without blaming Demi or putting any blame on her?
Genderfluid is under the non-binary umbrella, *which is under the trans umbrella*. They're *all three*
You’re just being a gatekeeper. Gatekeepers, in the queer community nonetheless, are shitty. If you don’t feel like you’re strictly a man or strictly a woman, you’re probably non-binary. That’s literally it. That’s the one qualification.
I’m pretty sure we all get what we are up against without someone replying to a reddit comment about why we can’t get mad at the celeb. 

It was just irrelevant to the point I was making, and it’s not what OP was asking either.
You can give whoever you want benefit of the doubt. I'm quite happy with knowing fact checking is free and easy, and calling people like OP who are too lazy to do so out on just that. You can check their comment history to know just how [absolutely](https://www.reddit.com/r/NonBinary/comments/welwz3/comment/iip2ysi/?utm_source=reddit&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) [disgustin](https://www.reddit.com/r/NonBinary/comments/welwz3/comment/iip22i7/?utm_source=reddit&utm_medium=web2x&context=3)g they've been about Demi and [how little benefit they actually deserve](https://www.reddit.com/r/NonBinary/comments/welwz3/comment/iiozque/?utm_source=reddit&utm_medium=web2x&context=3).

&#x200B;

... It's almost like fact checking can save a whole lot of issues here, or something.
Oh shit okay

I'm non binary and I didn't know that fluidity was under non binary, thought all 3 were subtypes of trans identity tbh. Thats 100% where I'm coming from and why I deleted my comments when I realized they were wrong
So as not to offend other nbs I will leave it there.
Yeah I didn’t see all that, but that doesn’t make my original reply to you wrong or bad? 

If this is just about that every single person posting here should fact check their post before asking a honest question then okay, we just have a difference of opinion about asking an honest question on a sub for non binary people.
Oh, glad to help then! 😁
ain't an honest question if you're spreading misinformation.

im done here. you either get it or continue to be willfully obtuse, but im out.

Yes, thank you very much for your patience. I have what was once called asphergers so my social skills arent quite the best lmaoo
I can totally see it being honest if they don’t realize they are spreading misinformation and it’s an accident. Which happens all the time, and I’m sure you and I have both done before getting the education we currently have. 

But okay, hope you have the capacity to tell everyone who asks a question on this sub that hasn’t rigorously fact checked their question that they’re lying about trans people. Glad to have this conversation over, have a great day"	welwz3	NonBinary	500	0.87	2022-08-02 20:17:17

Don't worry, you can't misgender me easily, my gender is as fluid as a waterfall and the knife-wielding voidcats only go after people trying to be malicious. (⁠◕⁠ᴗ⁠◕⁠✿⁠)
Exactly (⁠≧⁠▽⁠≦⁠)
I got them off of Etsy, from the seller EDIParker
Ive seen them on etsy, so many different sellers im not sure who the original artist is

Just search ""cat pronoun pin""
They're definitely worth it! Just note sometimes they'll be more notably flawed and have imperfections, but otherwise they're still cute even with mild-moderate flaws and good quality pins. 😊
I approve of this pun. ಠ⁠◡⁠ಠ
Sadly no, the seller only sold these 5, if they had more I would have gotten it. You can contact the seller EDIParker on Etsy, and ask if they can make a special one, but there's plenty of beautiful & cool affordable customizable pronouns pins on Etsy if they can't/won't.

This is my first pic on here. I am an intersex non-binary transfemme 🌈 Yesterday I decided to stop HRT after almost 6 months. I love my body, I love myself. Not here to fit any standards. Just feeling myself, happier and more free than ever before. Love u all in here 💖🌹 My pronouns are she/they.		"You look wonderful! So happy for you! Love your outfit too :)
Hey, don't have to answer if you don't want to but can I ask why you stopped hrt? I'm ~2years in and  I've been questioning alot lately if I want to continue. When I think about it there's definitely things about my body that I want changed but I haven't had a desire lately to take it? Ive kind of felt apathetic lately about it and it's had me worried.
just stopping by to say I love your dimples :)
YOU LOOK GORGEOUS SWEETIE ❤️❤️❤️🏳️‍🌈
Yay, this made me so happy! Love this so much! You are such a shining example of what I strive for! 🥳💜🙏
damn, you're really pretty! you're such an icon!
Thank u so so much <333
Hello beautiful 🌹 Sure, no problem!

I started HRT on my own since doctors were taking too fucking long and I NEEDED to start asap. More than half a year of waiting I decided to start on my own. During that time I also learned that here in Spain doctors prescribe shitty treatments, they refused to prescribe and didn't even know about Lenzetto (E spray), which is actually the safest and best alternative here atm. I didn't have any control or help within my treatment, I wasn't able to reach good levels and I was starting to feel a bit ill and weaker lately. 

Above that, there's this thing which I have come to terms in the last months. It took me so long (I am 23) but I deconstructed in a lot of ways and came to the conclusion I don't care about gender. I now understand it as a social construct in which they throw us and force to fix in some silly standards. I am a very femenine person, I like girly things and feel more comfortable presenting with long hair and all that. In a way, I have always identified as female. However, and taking into account I am a very lucky person, I can say I manage to make my disphoria disappear. I don't care if I have boobs or curves, I don't care about what anyone thinks, I am so confident of who I am. Society expectations and influence did hit so fucking hard on me, specially the early HRT months. I wanted to be accepted, I wanted to feel validated and seen as a woman. Now I refuse to look at myself throught society eyes, my body is so beautiful no matter its shape. It will always be MY body, and I am who I am. 

I'm not gonna lie and say I don't have fears. I don't care about my shape changing, or about sex life (I fucking loved to orgasm being on E, it was magical. But I am aware my disphoria was a big thing on it before HRT, feelings have already changed but I am really enjoying sex to be honest), but I do about passing in safety terms. The situation in Spain is getting a bit turn on and retrogradal hateful minds are getting bigger in bravery and number. I consider myself a brave and strong person, and all the good makes the cons disappear.

I know that aphatetic feel, I been experiencing it for a while. The best thing I can tell you is to always listen to your mind. Don't you ever have in mind anyone else but yourself, what you decide is up to you and your happiness. For me, these 2 days have been the happiest of my whole transition, I feel like this is really who I am.

Wish you all the luck and happiness in the world 🌅💖
🌹🌹💖
THANK YOU SO SO MUCH YOU TRULY A SUNSHINE ❤🧡💛💚💙💜
You all are an amazing example and the biggest influence for me! Thank you so much love 💖💖💖🌹🌹
Oh god I can't deal with all your love 💖 Thank you from the bottom of my heart darliiiiing <3
Thank you so much💜 im also 23 and relate so much to what you said. I live in the south in the US and even the most liberal city around (where I mostly hang around) is extremely cis normative. I also recently had a moment where I realized that I too started HRT because I so desperately wanted to be validated, and that alot of the hate that I felt for my body is because of the unmistakable idea around here that a cis/binary experience is the only experience.

I quickly gained female friends, but I've yet to feel like I belong with them, because most of their experiences are ones that I can't relate to, and ive felt that if I talked about my experiences Im only pointing out how I don't belong.

Thank you for reminding me that I don't owe other people space in deciding who I am💜

Much love, Soph

PS I think you're beautiful and you made me blush😄
it's all good!
Hell yeah, we are so oriented towards cis and binary experiences we are unable to reach self-love or confidence most of the times. It is a tough road and requires a ton of work for us trans people, specially because our bodies have always been rejected and society has made us believe we can never, for example, be a woman if we have a dick, no boobs or a hairy body. However, they are fucking wrong and we are here to make them break all their schemes 🤟🏿

Talking about friends, I've always surrounded myself with female friends, since I was a little kid. It's been a while since I didn't feel connected or not accepted, but I remember that feeling has been a VERY strong one during my life. Nowadays I understand we all as women share most of our lifetimes experiences, specially those regarding misogyny, gender and cultural expectations and power relatioships. I also understand I am trans woman whose experiences are always gonna be more connected with all trans women more than any other cis woman. I found my childhood memories, my puberty and adolescence, sexual experiences, etc. were way similar to other trans women to whom society impacted on the same way as it did on me. 

Wish you all the luck, you are truly a wonderful being and a must to the world 🌹 

And btw you definitely made me blush too 🙈 Sending you all the love in the world 💛🧡❤💛🧡❤💛🧡❤"	dqkmva	NonBinary	483	1.0	2019-11-02 14:07:31
hey small wins for me: introduced myself in classes with my pronouns (they). is anyone respecting them? no lol💀 but i’m proud of myself for no using “ella” just to make others confortable 🥹		"*not using “ella”* lol sorry english is my second language
Proud of you! I've made the transition to they/them in English but still feel wildly insecure about using neutral pronouns (and nouns) in Portuguese.
We had this activity of getting to know each other and I told my partner in the activity to refer to me as they/them. I was so fucking embarassed, but I did it. And she did refer to me correctly. Uhhhh, so embarassing and so haarrdddd
After reading about all those times pronouns have not been respected I just thought: if you visibly lean one way, just anounce the opposite pronouns so people might use they/them for fucking once.
whooo congratulations! \^\^
Super proud of you, buddy! It's a fucking nightmare but you're paving the way for those behind you, and, of course, doing it for you.
Amazing! So happy for you, finally being out with pronouns is a lot but I bet you did great! you look amazing btw
Yay for you, friend 🔥
Hello! First of all I'm proud of you too!! Ahora estoy aprendiendo español, y tambien tengo este problema en clase. I'd love to use the neutral as well but oof is it hard, I'm going to use it to try it out. I hope it gets better for you, sending love :-)
muchas felicitaciones, tienes más valentía que yo :)
My gender neutral pronouns in my birth language are ones I chose but they sound exactly like feminine pronouns when said out loud so I legitimately don’t know what to do with them 

… they’re in my Pinterest bio I think?
español, no? felicitaciones por presentarte con pronombres neutrales. es *dificil*
Felicitaciones por haberte presentado con pronombre elle :)! . De verdad que es bien difícil hacerlo con tanta gente que aún no lo acepta. Tristemente no lo respetaron pero  siempre es genial dar un paso más en tomar espacio y no acomodarte a lo que esperan los demás solo por  ""no incomodar"".
Hey cool what’s the neutral pronoun in portuguese? morei em porto há muitos anos acho que esqueci como falar mas eu percebo tudo 😌
In my experience, they'll ignore what you say and just use whatever they assume your pronouns to be anyway. It's a good idea, though!
Hahaha that’s funny but i think it’ll only work in english, spanish is too gendered + the neutral pronoun is kinda new
Thanks 🥹🫶🏼
Aww yes that’s so true! Hope there’s some egg in that class that starts breaking after seeing me hahaha 👀♥️
síii en español es mil más difícil que en inglés:-((
Sou Brasileire, mas faz muito tempo que moro nos EUA. Os pronomes são ele, ela, e elu ou ile. Elu e ile são os mais comuns para gente não binaria. 

De onde vc é?
Just don't recognise they said anything when they do it, that'll show them.
Yes sadly same for german. We've got a long way to go

just quit my job cause my boss (my aunt) said i’m not allowed to use they/them pronouns in the workplace 😛😛😛😛		"Cute asf and deserve all the respect ✊🏿 You’ll find work again soon and still be fabulous 👏🏿👏🏿👑
I think that might be illegal. Either way it’s definitely rude af. I’m so happy you have the confidence and self love to advocate for yourself and leave an unaccepting environment!!! <3 you are powerful.
[deleted]
I feel so sorry for you! How are you doing now? Whatever happens, know that you are valid, and worthy of happiness. 

Stay frosty friend!
I saw in another comment you couldn't do anything about the legality of the situation and thats so frustrating and I'm so sorry. I had a similar situation with my epilepsy and it's the worst. You're valid and good on you for not giving in and using other pronouns than your own. Stay you!
That's harassment and fucking vile
Hell fricken yeah you’re cute!
is that even legal?
Work at an art store?
thank youu😌💕
yeah i’m pretty sure my aunt brought this up before the business officially opened so i couldnt legally do anything about it :-) but thank you sm<3<3
thank youuu❣️
i wasn’t really a “legal” business to begin with so there’s not much i could’ve done ;/
I don't know where you are, but gender identity is a protected class in a lot (I think at least half) of the US states. You would probably have a legitimate discrimination case, though since you quit voluntarily you might not have standing now. Might be worth asking /r/legaladvice
oh big oof. report her to the Small Business Administration or the IRS
Chile this is they’re aunt... as upset as I’m sure they are, do you think they wanna ruin their aunts business?
Their aunt does not seem to be a particularly considerate person herself so
Yea definitely but maybe her mind can change in the future though. People in general are not informed on non-binary genders. Don’t get me wrong, she’s definitely a dick, but I don’t agree with telling someone over the internet they should ruin their business family’s business. A lot of family members have very negative rejerk reactions to things but maybe she’ll realize she’s wrong. Don’t make permanent mistakes over temporary feelings.
She knows what she’s doing by running an illegal business. You cannot expect people to be courteous to you if you are not courteous to them"	icvrgj	NonBinary	484	1.0	2020-08-19 20:31:16

"Wow, I'm sure glad this very qualified person on Twitter helped me figure out what's wrong with my pronouns! Apparently ""they/he"" is embarrassingly incorrect, but I got blocked before I could beg for the grammatical help that would solve all my gender problems :("		"They/he is perfectly correct. The problem is that this weirdo has no idea what they're talking about. If a person has one pronoun set, they list the subject and object pronoun - he/him, they/them, etc. If they have more than one, they list the subject pronouns only - he/they, he/she/they, et cetera. You and I know this.

It's this person's fault for getting their panties in a bunch and blaming *you* because *they're* out of the loop.
Ew and they threw in an ableist slur
I wish more pre-set gender options represented They/He. I actually prefer it to He/They (I know it's a small difference tho)
“Seek truth, speak love and stay humble” in his bio…and he failed miserably at all three.
i think this person was trying to say you should list it as “they/him” rather than “they/he” i suppose ? but even then… why does it matter ?

also, in modern day english, it is perfectly acceptable to use a slash “/“ in place of the word “or” so… “they/he” is meant to be read as “they or he” so the “not grammatically correct” argument this person is making is trivial and inconsequential at best.

lol some peoples kids
I’m jUsT HeLpInG YoU

Some people need to tone it down.
Musk just gave them a promotion. They're now the only moderator left for the western hemisphere. East is handled by a part-time bot running on a raspberry pie.
What an absolute moron. I'm sorry you had to deal with them :(
I would say that this person is being a pendantic asshole, but that is just an insult to real pendantic assholes.
that person is definitely weird and wrong but from how i read it, i wonder if they wanted you to have it as (they/him) and that would be “correct” in their mind
I think this person believes that you must pick one set and one set only, and is confused, maybe thinking that you want specifically they/him/theirs or he/them/his or some kind of mishmash instead of both hahaha

Like, their point is specifically grammatical, thinking you're gonna go ""This is HE item"" and ""THEY name is thewhiskeyrepublic""

They're picking on you for no reason other than not knowing the convention of showing pronouns hahahahaha
you: ""here is how grammar works""

this nitwit: ""no its not because i said so""
should've said ""okay then, what about they/him"" and whitness him losing his mind
People out here so overly confident when they barely know their own language.
Ready for the truth?
There is no correct way, whatever people use, is correct.
Words are made up anyway...
What a jerk. I'm sorry. Your pronouns are not only correct, but they are valid. Don't let anyone, especially not a troll on the internet, tell you otherwise. :Hug:
We need to stop spreading the disinformation that the trans movement invented the singular they/them/theirs, because it has actually been in use for centuries and has been well documented by the Oxford English Dictionary, which is nothing less than the definitive authority on this subject.

""The Oxford English Dictionary traces singular they back to 1375, where it appears in the medieval romance William and the Werewolf. Except for the old-style language of that poem, its use of singular they to refer to an unnamed person seems very modern. ...
Since forms may exist in speech long before they’re written down, it’s likely that singular they was common even before the late fourteenth century. That makes an old form even older.""

I have this link bookmarked for moments when people want to debate me about pronouns ;)

https://public.oed.com/blog/a-brief-history-of-singular-they/
Okay Honestly This Guy's Either Stupid, Or Intentionally Misinterpreting.

Also, We Didn't Start Using They/Them Because There Was No Gender Neutral Singular, We Started Using They/Them Because It *Was* The Gender Neutral Singular, In Use For Literally Hundreds Of Years.
But you missed the opportunity to say ""hi, I guess you're not educated, but (they/he) is a perfectly valid and correct use of pronouns"" 😭
Wait, there are rules how i need to write down my pronounces?
Amazingly this person seems to be not necessarily openly transphobic but mostly just a pedantic piece of shit. (Ableist af though.) It sucks they were a dick to you, and it’s also kind of funny how badly some people need to be right.
What.
those are my pronouns too. personally i think they're pretty cool
The moment they use the r-slur, I stop listening to everything they said.
ugh that’s so annoying omg
As a neurodivergent person the final sentence is filling me with rage.
Maybe you should change your pronouns to he/they 🤔 in case they/he is not grammatically correct(tho I'm assumming the first is preferred so maybe not)
For real! I even googled it _for_ them and sent them the link :D Nothing says ""I'm an open-minded and reasonable individual"" like ""let me casually drop a slur and block you instead of reading up on the issue"", right?
One Could Argue ""They/He"" Is Short For ""They/Them/He/Him"", Just As ""They/Them"" Is Short For ""They/Them/Their/Theirs/Themself"". Because You're Listing Multiple Pronouns, You Don't Want To Put As Many Forms, As It Saves Space. That's Simply How People Speak.
Once I told a workplace to put they/he on my name tag, but they changed it to they/him I guess cuz they thought they were being helpful. Didn’t know how to explain why that was incorrect other than the fact that I, The Queer (tm), said so. Which, tbf, should have been enough, but seeing your explanation is helpful for future reference.
Maybe they felt like they hadn't made it obvious enough that they're a horrible troll :D
[deleted]
I know--I like to put them in order of preference. Not picky, just a nice little thing!
The louder you have to say it, the less likely it is to be true!
I was legitimately going to ask what they suggested but I was promptly blocked for, I imagine, knowing what I was talking about :D
Not even a Raspberry Pi... a literal raspberry pie :D
Thanks for the support! Assholes on the internet are nothing new, I guess :P
I'm also curious! I was genuinely going to ask until I got blocked
I was actually open to a civil discussion about the grammatical implications of pronoun conventions :D
That's where linguistic prescriptivism gets you, kids!
Haha right? I seriously thought maybe they were a second language learner trying to help out a fellow student for a minute. Their Twitter page was definitely not any grammatically better.
unfortunately bigots are so braindead they refuse to hear this
❤️❤️❤️
Oh, that's fantastic! Thanks! I was so caught up in the other stuff that I barely even registered that problem with this exchange. I mean, it wouldn't make the usage any less legitimate if it was started for gender non-conforming folks, but it helps that we also have history on our side :D
I mean, they didn't strike me as the most literate person ever, but if they know the difference between subject and object pronouns I feel like they've got the faculties to understand how people are using them :D So yeah, I'd go with ""intentionally misinterpreting""
Oop nevermind multiple pictures
Only if you're an incompetent grammar fascist :D
They really are! Keep it up you amazing they/he enby you <3
Oh gosh, yes--it's 2022 and there's no excuse for it.
Yeah, they didn't really seem to have an issue with the order--more the subject vs object nature of both pronouns. Maybe they/them he/him would have made this person happy!
they were just helping you out /s
Exactly this. What would this person like you to do if you accept multiple gendered pronouns? Does this person really think someone who is bigender put (he/ they/ she/ him/ them/ her) on everything ??
No. No slur is worse than any other. They’re all equally fucked up.
I've seen this and others do this as well. It actually helps me by saying ""oh this person would prefer ___ so I'll try to remember to use ___."" Also since it can change from time to time it's a good reminder for me to check to see if it's different.
So if you have a preference for they/them over he/him, why not just use they/them instead of listing both? I get that some people use multiple because they don’t have a preference, are genderfluid, etc., but why would someone with a preference do that?

Not trying to be rude btw, I’m genuinely curious.
sometimes people just want to argue over nothing lol
Since it's been so hard to get ahold of the computer lately they had to make do, presumably
Totally agree! And that's the other point of this article--language is fluctuating and evolving. Even if we were changing it, that would be totally normal <3

Another longer article for our arsenal: https://www.mentalfloss.com/posts/singular-they-history
That's Fair. As A Self-Proclaimed Expert At Intentional Misinterpretation, I Must Say This Is Not The Way To Go About It. There's No Humour, Nor Do You Gain Anything From It. Basically Just Going Out Of Your Way To Be A Jerk. Would Not Recommend.
So no, it doesn't respect me so i don't respect grammar neither
you too!! :) <3
~~I Mean I'm Bigender And I Just Don't Put Pronouns In My Bio, Then If Someone Asks Either Say ""Guess."", Or ""All"" Then Specifically Instruct Them That I Mean *All*, Not Any, Or Just Whatever You Feel Like, But *All Of Them.*~~
I know but since they're talking to a nb person using that one would've been a bit more personal or something
No worries! It's mostly for the convenience of others, tbh--I'm signaling that I'm not bothered if they choose to go with he/him since that's what they'll likely read me as. Especially for people who don't know me very well or meet me in person, I'm pretty much fine with it. 

The pronouns don't bother me so much as being treated, stereotyped, or expected to act like a man. I've always been pretty uncomfortable with gender stereotypes, separations, and general ""man this woman that"", but casually being called he/him doesn't usually bother me too much, unless it's overemphasized or clearly done in some way to box me in."	zvs579	NonBinary	472	1.0	2022-12-26 17:34:56

Thanks! I'm sure you do too!
Thank you!
Thank you!
Your support and respect are way more than money could ever get me, thanks! Also the shirt is from New Yorker, but I'm pretty sure they don't sell it anymore, as from the day I bought it, I couldn't find it anymore.
Of course! I'm not gonna lie I kinda want the hat. I'm not normally a hat person as far as wearing them myself but that one looks really good. As I said you look fantastic. I wish I was half as photogenic as you are 💛🤍💜🖤
Ah yes, I helped collect about 40 of them for newsies before the person realized that they were from a different time era! We had to return them, but they are so cute!!!
It's from terranova if you'd like to buy it! I also don't usually wear hats, but this one just called out to me, it have me JoJo vibes so I just had to buy it
That's what I was thinking! You're awesome, I just want you to know that!

yooo that's how i got here too! welcome!!
Welcome.
Welcome, friend!! I’m so excited for you!
It is! Sadly being in a spanish-speaking country means no neutral pronouns but my online frens are using they/them for me and it's really neat
Thanks! Sad thing is that its borrowed and if I were to wear a bag I wouldnt hear the end of it unu. Time to time tho!
Someone should make up they/them pronouns for languages that don't have them just so us they/them users can be included in all languages honestly lol.

feeling rly comfortable w myself but also misunderstood.people keep calling me a guy or a lesbian and this makes me rly confused when im none of both. its also complicated to present myself as enby since portuguese doesn’t have any neutral pronoun :/ anyway i just want to send love to y’all 💞🌷		"Romance languages suck for us :(
Another portuguese-speaking enby!! Same Hat!!
That’s rough. You can do this though; you define yourself. Sending love right back 💖💖
I know they aren't the same, but I speak some spanish and replacing a or o with e is always an option. For example, instead of amigo or amiga, it would be amige. Hope this helps!
I know Spanish and Portuguese have many differences but i read that Spanish speakers will use the letter x to indicate gender neutral. Example: librx instead of libro for book or bonitx instead of bonita or bonito for pretty.
It looks like you've got it where it Counts ❤
Cool t-shirt. 
I saw a thread on genderless on Twitter and I think they mentioned a gender neutral way in Portuguese.
Looooove that outfit! Sorry you're dealing with ignorant people 😔

it only works when you’re writing, we can’t pronounce words written like this
but thanks for the suggestion anyways
😉😉
ty!! i’ll search it, thanks for letting me know
thanks!! its hard, my country is rly ignorant when it comes to gender. ur president (bolsonaro🙄)have strong opinions about it. but i hope i’ll find people that accept me and we’ll go through this difficult period together
I heard someone suggesting e as a suffix in spanish, which makes sense in the language and is thoroughly pronounceable. It also just sounds and reads better.
Bolsonaro is a fucking monster.  I hope you stay safe out there.  Shit's really scary in Brazil right now.  And we (the U.S.) certainly aren't helping, as if we ever do.

But the people of Brazil, at least the ones I've known, are just incredible.  If anyone can survive and fight that monster, y'all can!
Yes! In Spanish we use the letter e (guapes instead of guapos or guapas) and in catalan, since the e would be femenine we use i (guapis) but the i sounds so weird to me
agree!! tbh i didn’t remember about it, it works in portuguese too
once i “come out of the closet” i’ll probably start using it

Made these little pronoun earrings to wear for a new school program im starting today		"Those are really cool earrings!! Hope everything went well!
Oo, i love the colors you went with :)) could you please tell us more about the program??
I love these earrings!  They are super cute 🥰 

Hopefully this new program will be amazing, especially with you doing it.
These are awesome
That's really creative and a genius idea! It's normal to loon people in the eye when talking to them so having those earrings near people's point of view makes it easier for them to notice.
🤯
I love these earrings! Good luck with your new program!
Totally brilliant!  I sense marketing potential.
They were the closest I had to the NB flag! And sure, it’s a professional diploma in clothes making. So, sewing, alterations and other cool things like that. Seriously can’t wait to start and make my own clothes!!
Aw thank you!! Gonna learn to make clothes so I can dress myself!

Hey guys! Any name suggestions? My pronouns are they/them I am coming out soon and want to tell my parents what name I like. Thanks!		"Ooh Emery?
This whole thread reminded me how non-binary names are a whole lot of things found in nature, just by the modern day word for them.

And that my own name is just an Old Norse word for Eagle. I have a non-binary name. This makes me so happy. Trans for anything to donwith transitioning, but nb at at heart.

You look like a Birdie
Ray?
Dylan or Jackson!

Meadow , first thing that came to mind!
Papillon is French for butterfly. Maybe some derivative of that?
Charlie or Leone
Lou, Ash, and Aster all came to mind :)
Grayson
River or ocean? Sounds nice and might fit you
My name is Niko. It can be yours too.
Atlas?
Hey uh just be careful posting your face online you never know what can happen and you’re clearly on the young side- I was on reddit at your age and definitely regret some of my decisions so just be safe.
If you’re anywhere near as young as you look, do you want to think about the wisdom of having your face in a public forum, linked to an account describing your gender and sexuality, whilst not yet being out to your parents?

Whilst I was out to some people at ~15, there were certainly some people at school that would have made my life miserable had they found out. 

Are you sure it’s a risk you’re happy taking?
Sorry to sound like a dad but I’m a dad and…are you old enough to be on here?
Jamie/Jacks
Maybe seasonal?  Like Summer or Autumn. Btw you’re gorgeous!
Arden?
Sam
I was thinking Don, because it can be short for both masculine and feminine names
hmm Jayden maybe?
Nolbryn
I'm thinking Alexi or Kris.
You have any preferred letters or past nicknames you want to use as a base-name to play around with?
What about Kai or Fae? they're kinda simple, but I think they'd work well.
Ender
You kinda give off a nature vibe so Rowan, Forrest, faye, or atlas.
arrow or roe!!!
I went to jace
Tyler
What about Flure (?) I think it’s the French word for flower

Ash, Ivy, or Prince would all suit you. Also good luck on coming out!!
I’m getting Ollie vibes. Idk why 💁
You look like a Rain/Raine!
Adara. I'm not sure where it came from but I think it fits you
Mabye Nevin
I always liked , for unisex names, Rocket, Star, Aspen, River, and Wolf.
You look like an Ari, Eli or similar to me. Something short with a vowel at the start. Maybe Evan? Andy/i ? Elliot or Asher/Ash?

Whatever you pick I hope it goes really well! I finally came out to one of my parents a few months ago and it is so nice :)
Davey
I'm thinking something ending in an 'ee' sound. Maybe Riley or Kennedy.
Oh! Or Elliot!
You give me water and earth vibes something like rain river basil sage or clove
Ive/Ivy
My name is brick, and I’m down to share :3
Arugula
Kirin!
Sam
Taylor, Maddie, River, Birdie
My enby roommate just found a name of a chaeacter they vibed with. So you could do that too if you have one.
fwiw i don't think that it's necessary to tell them what name you like immediately. depends on how understanding they can be, of course. but finding a name can be a long journey, and shouldn't be rushed. 

I think letting them know that you're nonbinary and letting them know your pronouns is a good stepping stone for them to know you better, while giving you time to search for your name. If feels like a good option for you, you can tell them that you're non-binary and you're still trying to figure out what name you want to go by. 

while it's great to get options or ideas from others, I wouldn't worry too much about figuring out a name by the time you plan to come out. take your time to discover yourself. 

all that said, i don't want to leave you without a name suggestion, especially since i said getting inspiration from others is good. I'd like to suggest Remi as a name. good luck to you whenever you do come out to your parents! i hope all goes well.
Sky/skyler?
I noticed your profile name is Story and I loved that.
I saw the comment for Emory, and I really like that one, but maybe Ember?

I do want to say though, you don't have to change your name. My given name is Kali, (like Callie, very fem), and while it was a source of dysphoria when I was first discovering myself, it's not anymore. I was convinced that I needed to change my name to something more neutral, but that's not true. I've reclaimed my name as a nonbinary person, and I couldn't be happier.
Pheeny
Brick
Steve
Bob
Sam
Alex
Colt.
Cole.
Dale came to mind first
Axel?
Lara
Everest
Logan or Nate if masc. Abby if fem. Chris (christie/Christine/ Christian?) if neutral
Ash?
fawn was my first thought <3
Aj or Tay
Jules? Théo?
Cade (short for Arcade or Arcadia)
I know it's common but honestly Ash or Asher
Cloud!! It's a very cute name and it feels so soft
I’m enby and my names Ash
Maybe Ash or Shay/Shae?
Riley?
I can’t explain why, but you look like a Rowen
😱that’s such a nice name I really love it I am for sure considering it
Seconding this one
I like this one too!
emery for SURE (imo obvi) i’m really biased towards it, and love that the first reply is it. it fits you well (:
Took my name from a common name used in France which took its origin from German. This name means Glory. And it's prononciation have the same as Wolf in French. And Wolf is one of my symbol for my Friends.

So my name is Lou.

My second name is Murphy, took from Murphy's Law, m'y favorite character in Interstellar and... That was my pseudo on video games.
Oooh that’s a great name!
Omg I love that
This suits them perfectly! So dreamy!
Thanks! 😁
That’s a nice name I will consider it
Those are great names I am totally putting them in my options list
LOL thanks I like the J idea
Jayden was my first thought
Thanks for the advice
That’s nice, I will keep this name in mind thanks! 😃
Thanks
Those are really amazing names I will consider them all
Ooh that’s a nice one! I think my family would like it too thanks!
That is a gorgeous name, now I wanna make a character based on that haha
I like that! Thanks
I like it I will definitely think of this one too
YASSS I suggested this one too!! I LOVE that name
better call?
That’s nice I will consider it
That’s a really cool name thanks I will consider it! 😃
I would say they are, some people just look really young. If I was a different person and saw myself i wouldn't think I was 15 lol
Close, that would be fleur, regardless, I like this idea
Thanks I like that name! 😁
Thanks!
Thanks
Or Emory! I named one of my non-binary characters Emory :D
You will hopefully expect the infinite ""Winter is coming""-puns at any and all opportunities then :)
It's a very cool name isn't it? I'm glad you like it!
I like it a lot, but that's just because I have a character by that name, who never saw the light of day... 

Should start getting serious about that writing project again.

I’d like to show y’all my first pronoun pin 😁		"Can't use the wrong pronouns if you use all the pronouns *taps forehead*
Congrats!!!

Can I ask where you got it from? I love it!!
Love it! Where can I get one?!
Congrats!
ok i feel like it should be this way but for me, it’s the intention, like, i’m not a girl and if someone uses she/her when they see me as a girl or if someone uses she/her with the intention of misgendering, it... still feels like misgendering???
This one i got on Amazon, from the vendor PiratitoUK. [Link. ](https://www.amazon.com/Pronoun-badge-button-magnet-LGBTQ/dp/B07ZHQ4ZNT)
I ordered this one off of [Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07ZHQ4ZNT/ref=cm_sw_r_cp_api_i_isiOFbMBH8APX), which has a customizable background. But if you want to order them from the vendor directly, they’re a UK based webstore, [Piratito](https://www.piratito.com/product-page/she-he-they-pronoun-pin-back-button-badge-round).
yeah i totally get that !! i’m comfortable with both she/her and they/them, but when people only use she/her it feels off and uncomfortable for some reason lol. i just wish they would acknowledge the they/them ??
Correct. When people message me and say “hey girl, you be looking fine” i tend to block them.
That's why I talked about pronouns and not gender.
Thank you 🥺
Brilliant thank you so much!
Ordered! Thank you so much kind soul!!! I feel so seen!!!
yeah, exactly
If you like being called a combination of she and they and someone only calls you she, even if they aren’t intending to misgender potentially, they aren’t using your pronouns correctly.
ya i know that wasn’t my point
That is true.

MY TEACHER APOLOGIZED FOR MISGENDERING ME	"Today, in my third period science class, I asked a question and the teacher (an older male) said “Yes, ma’am”. I thought nothing of it cause I get misgendered all the time and forgot about it pretty quickly. 

Five periods later, I see the teacher standing outside my ninth period class. I say hi and he says “OP, can I pull you aside for a second?” 

Then he says, “Today during class, I said something and I’m not even sure if you heard it but I’d still like to apologize. I said ‘Yes, ma’am’ after you asked a question. I know you go by they/them pronouns and I’m sorry. I’m old but I’m learning.”

I nearly fucking cried during class. The fact that he remembered what my pronouns are when I only communicated them through writing them next to my name on homework assignments, noticed that calling me ma’am is misgendering me, took the time to find out what my ninth period class was, and apologized IN PERSON! Amazing. 10/10 teacher. I love him so much."	"I know this sounds like a weird suggestion, but as an education major I have to say it: if you're comfortable with it, email your compliments to the principal and his department head. Administrators love to see this kind of thing because it helps them advocate to their school board about different types of resources. An email like this could help that teacher get grant funding or the show that their is an interest in LGBTQ+ trainings and programs. And if it doesn't do either of those things, it also just looks really good on that teacher's record.

Some schools have students nominate a teacher of the month or something like that in order to find out which teachers are doing things right, and emailing is another way for them to find that out.

I know this is way longer than I probably needed, but when I was out in high-school, emails and contacting people in administration was always the way to get things done. While admin are busy people, they always appreciate seeing compliments of their staff rather than complaints. Then, if they see your name later for an issue, they'll be more apt to help.
What a mega win for you and your education system!!
This is awesome
Well done! I am a GSA advisor and presenting to the entire faculty today about LGBTQ student rights (Calif Ed Code) and that students will report when their rights are dismissed by teachers (or peers). We encourage all our GSA students to advocate with their name and pronouns and expression on day 1 in class. 99% of teachers respect it even if they don’t “get it”! I love positive stories like this. Thanks.
i had a similar experience w a TA a few days ago, i corrected him but he was super nice ab my pronouns and apologized for misgendering me. sometimes it rly is those few ppl who care who make a difference <3
My heart is absolutely melting, this is such a glimmer of hope and I love both you and your teacher
Thanks for the suggestion! I’ll save your comment and try to do this.
Wanted to flag this for you: do this if your school and district are LGBT Affirming.

You know your school and local politics better than we do— and if this is something your school has expressed as a value— go for it. But if you feel your community is less than supportive, maybe run the idea by a trusted mentor or adult in your life. The way that kind of letter will be received will vary and depending on who is in charge it could help or hinder the teacher"	q1iumg	NonBinary	457	1.0	2021-10-05 00:05:30

Husband doesn’t remember my pronouns.	"My partner (36m) doesnt remember my pronouns: they/them. 

He says he makes a very big effort around coworkers, but he legit calls me “she” all the time in front of me and our kids. 

I realized im nb summer of 2021. 

We’ve been together for over 15yrs.

I’ve corrected, I’ve expressed how i feel unseen and overlooked when incorrect pronouns are used, im being patient. Our children 6+1 dont hear from him about using my pronouns.

We’ve talked, I’ve given information, I communicate… I’m at the end of my leash …

He says he really doesn’t remember. And im like — ive explained and expressed how it bothers me… and he says he just doesnt remember.

How do y’all deal with this? Im so frustrated that the person that’s supposed to be my person “doesn’t remember” yet makes an effort in the outside world? Seems really inconsistent, more about him then supporting me…"	"If he doesn't even bother to correct himself I would seek couples therapy. If he can't see it as important enough to remember and put effort into then idk, you've expressed your position at the reoccurring problem. He acknowledges that it's difficult for him to remember but it doesn't seem like he's doing anything to fix that problem.
For people that have a lot of trouble, practice seems to be key. If you have any photo albums you both could sit down and go through them, the goal being for him to describe you accurately as he goes through the album. You could ask him to pretend you're a third party unfamiliar with your history together if that helps. 

You: ""What's happening in this photo at the beach?"" Him: ""I just splashed sorry-public-346 and they threw a crab at me, we both laughed so hard we peed."" He can go as slow as he needs during these practices to get things right. ""And here it was our first child's 3rd birthday, they (pointing to you in the picture) made a pinwheel themed cake just like jr. wanted, but then they tripped over the dog and spilled their creation into the fireplace."" etc. etc. etc. 

I was occasionally getting my youngest siblings pronouns wrong despite us BOTH being non-binary and using they/them pronouns. I don't think of them as a gender other than their own but when thinking of them as a tiny, before they were able to assert their gender, I will occassionally default to how they were referred to then out of habit, since I let people refer me by what it ""looked like"" for a very long time. It's stupid. Going through their baby photos and using the correct pronouns has helped. Hope your hubby puts in some effort and fixes this asap. There are techniques to fix it, it's reasonable that it might take some time to find them, but he should be invested and willing to put in work to figure it out.
You didn’t mention if he attempts to correct himself or when he slips if he acknowledges it so I’m going to go based on that not being the case.

To me it sounds like he does not take it seriously and that is why the effort isn’t there. It’s not that he doesn’t remember, it’s that he doesn’t care to learn. My partner had to adjust to using they/them pronouns and would slip up and immediately correct himself and now doesn’t ever slip up. Adjusting pronouns is not a hefty task unless you don’t take it seriously, in my opinion. 

I hope you have others in your life who are acknowledging and referring to you the proper way. 💕
Use an airhorn every time he misgenders you
Honestly, that would be the start of a harder conversation for me. Because he has known about this for over a year and isn't making a change in a way to support his person who he married. The fact he isn't trying sounds like there may be a lot of other small ways he disregards your feelings and other boundaries.  


My partner and I had been together for 7 years when I realized I was enby and started using they/them pronouns. He got it over night. This was while we were engaged and not married yet.
Have you seen him around coworkers?  If you're just going off his word, you don't know what he's actually saying to people.  If he can't even give you respect to your face, there's a good chance he's still just completely regarding you as the wrong gender at all times.
When he uses the wrong pronouns:
-Scream
-Spray him with water and vinegar
-Ask, ""who? Who are you talking about??"" And when he says you, tell him, ""oh no, I'm not a she.""
-Ignore him entirely. He's ceased to exist.
-throw rotten tomatoes at him
-ring a bell
-leave the room
I had to cut out my favorite aunt recently because she refused to accept my gender identity and pronouns. When I asked her to respect my pronouns she replied with ""naaaahhh"". I cut contact with her and haven't spoken to her. Today she reached out and said she'd be praying for me for my top surgery tomorrow. I reinforced that I expect my gender identity and pronouns be respected and all I got was radio silence. I've resorted to cutting contact with those who refuse to respect my gender identity and pronouns,  mostly conservative Christians. I'll cut anyone out no matter how long I've known them, friends and even family.
Memory test? Sounds like some issues going on upstairs if that's genuinely the case.

Sorry you're going through this.

Edit: I am genuinely suggesting you suggest a memory test. I didn't make that clear. I don't think it's his memory, but maybe if you start taking that seriously, like he has memory issues that need medical attention, you'll find his memory suddenly working again...
He doesn't see you as non binary. He sees you as a woman and I highly doubt this will change.
Honey, he remembers, he just doesn't care.
He's not forgetting. He's not trying
Start calling him Steve or change his pronouns. It’s (probably) not his name and use it consistently for a short time to illustrate that despite how long you two have been together, one can make an effort to change. If he protests, tell him you will return to normal when he shows your the mutual respect of using your pronouns.
IME people who say they’re “trying” but keep fucking up are actually not trying.  i had a colleague who kept fucking up, we had multiple conversations, but until it got brought up to the bosses THEN they finally got it.  The day after our collective meeting she got it wrong like once every other week rather than 5x a day.  It’s like, “now you’re trying, jackass.”
I’ve heard that as a short term thing from friends of mine - that they gender me correctly in social situations I’m not in but not to my face. This only ever lasted a month or two tops tho.

One thing friends said helped them was to replace my pronouns with my name? Idk tbh I’d start physically separating. Maybe start staying some nights at your parents or friends place. Start not including him at dinner. I’m not saying divorce him right now. Mild separation.
As someone with asd, I am super bad with people I have known a while changing their pronouns. A lot of the time my brain exists off previous knowledge, which means if we have been around each other a long time...its harder. It took 3 years before I got used to pausing to ""read"" my gender fluid friends efforts before using a pronoun and...it makes for some awkward pauses every conversation. Hell same vein I was describing a friend we were gonna meet up with as short blond hair...forgetting that for the last year and a half they've grown it out and dyed it red.

15 years together, and 1 year of change... I can actually understand, to a point, someone trying harder with strangers then with their partner. You generally see people assume they have a pass and benefit of the doubt with people they are close too. And if you somehow become involved in a situation with coworkers, they will hopefully act accordingly.

Not excusing no effort, but to a point I do understand it. But if I can be trained to self remind myself to pause and check, there is hope. We won't go into how often I misread things though, as I feel i am taking a stab in the dark with hope they attempt to present at times.
He didn’t forget to [insert activity he loves to do frequently], right?

We don’t forget the things we care about.

The crudest form of this is something that can be said to shock “forgetful” young men: “You didn’t forget to jerk off today, did you?”
Maybe truly seeing you as nonbinary would also force him to acknowledge that he is now in a queer relationship, and that is a big issue for him?
I personally find changes in pronouns hard, but you keep working at it and it starts to stick.

My child came out as NB at the start of the year. I think I'm using correct pronouns about 60% of the time so there is still a way to go. 

It's the non ""they/them"" stuff that trips me up more. Are you still ""wife"" or are you ""spouse""?

I can't understand how much it must grate but you're changing 15 years of ingrained behaviour, if he's still trying then try to be patient.
Same with my partner. I get that its tough because I'm not out to everyone so there is a switch that has to happen, but he talks about me to our kid and uses she all the time. Also I've chosen to be addressed as ""mama"" to our kid but gender neutral elsewhere. I'm 30 and have been out to him and friends for 6 years. Once in a while he will use masculine descriptors in a convo (handsome, my husband, dad) to make up for it but its very hard for him to use ""they"".
I teach a workshop on this, but honestly, it sounds to me like your husband doesn't care and isn't trying. does he practice, or correct himself?
My opinion, if he doesn't remember, it's because it's not important to him 😮‍💨 I'm really sorry ❤️
I've seen what feels to me like a trend or correlation of straight men in relationships with nb people (often afab) that they then refuse to acknowledge the identity of or make very little effort to accommodate, especially behind the nb person's back (they only use she/her). It's a very sad phenomenon. Nb seems to be ""woman with extra pronouns"" to those men
I could have written parts of this! Except we have been together 20 years, and I myself often misgender and say the wrong pronouns.

We have regular family chats (usually Sunday afternoons) and I think I need to raise this as a topic with my husband and kids and just remind everyone and mention how much it makes my day when someone gets it right.

I think I’m also going to talk to him a few weeks before hand and gently explain how important it is to me, so that he has time to adjust again. And I have said it in a space where we are both calm and receptive.

I don’t know if either of those things would be helpful for you? I don’t even know if other families have regular meetings? Maybe over dinner??

I really hope things get better for you though, you deserve to be happy and comfortable in your own home! <3
Every time he uses it wrong correct him quickly. He needs to respect you. It’s been 15 years, come on man, put a little effort in for the human you literally married
That always bothers me when you tell someone that something hurts you and they're like ""oh but it doesn't really matter all that much"" no. If someone tells you that you've hurt them, you don't get to just decide that you didn't. He doesn't give a crap and its showing. I personally would probably hit the end of my rope too
First: Please feel hugged.

My DH and I are married for 2 years now and my CO was just a few months ago. He also sometimes misgenders me and also English is our second language. Our native (German) is very much gendered and it's a big political and ideological discussion to even be more sensitive towards women in our usage of speech. Not even talking about NB.

I know, you have talked to him, but if he says he always ""forgets"" it seems like he doesn't want to make an effort. I don't know him and I don't know your dynamics.

Have you tried asking him to only refer to you by your first name? Cause in German we don't have an equivalent to they/them I mostly use no pronouns at all (just first name + you) and if I talk I try to use only the generic form of words, so not gendered at all.

I wish you the best and that you guys can work it out.
Me and my twin sibling are both non-binary, and both use they/them in english, but we use different pronouns in our native language. They use our version of she/her and I use a sort of neo-pronouns version of they/them, one that's a mixture of singular and masculine-plural pronouns.

They mess up my pronouns the most often out of any of my friends, and usually don't notice or don't correct themself.

In my case, it's probably because they still have to talk about me in my old pronouns to our parents, and they still love with them, so they still have to use those pronouns to me more often. With other people, like my closest friends, the change was more prominent. My language is much more gendered than English so I have to use my pronouns literally every time I talk, and since they only heard me talk about myself in my pronouns it was a constant reminder that made them remember it after like a week and completely get used to it after about a month. my twin still struggles with my pronouns a year and a half later.

I saw someone recommend you change your contact in his phone to include your pronouns and I think it might help, having a visual change will catch his eye and remind him. Maybe having him wear something new and permanent to remind him, like a new ring or a bracelet that's there to remind him you have new pronouns.

Or you could always just wear a name tag with your pronouns and point to it and ignore him until he corrects himself, although that feels a bit passive aggressive.
It was hard for me at first even being nonbinary. It's engrained in our heads and it's not cool. What helped me was reading fanfics with nonbinary character with they/them pronouns. Seeing the pronouns used consistently in things I read everyday helped normalize it. Idk maybe you can introduce him to media with they/them characters?
Corrective air horn.
first off i’m so sorry you’re dealing with this. he’s your partner, he should remember and do the bare minimum… you should set some kind of rule to enforce him to remember it. like a misgendering jar he has to put money into whenever he messes up /hj
If he apparently doesn't remember, then ask him what would help him remember and then do it excessively. And definitely correct him every time he says she. Doesn't have to be much, just say they whenever he says she
My partner found it very hard. For around two years he struggled to call me they, and struggled to notice he was doing it. I sat him down and talked him through it, and started correcting him every time he’d say she. I explained how hurtful it was for me to be misgendered, and told him that it caused me both physical and mental pain. I don’t think he understood how important pronouns were, as since this conversation he’s not really slipped up much, and this conversation was 3 years ago. He also corrects my family and all of our friends

. He’s autistic so I understand it was harder for him to adjust to this change as before I came out I’d been using she/her pronouns since we’d gotten together (7 years). He did manage it though, he’s just taken to calling everyone they/them until they tell him different, which isn’t a bad thing.

Your partner needs to make much more of an effort or admit he’s not even trying and is transphobic. I’m sorry, but you’re they/them and him misgendering you won’t change that, it’ll just teach your children that misgendering people is okay and also make you miserable. I hope you’re okay and he either pulls his finger out or you come to some sort of decision. Sending you all my best!!
Couples therapy because if he loves you he should really be making an effort. I’m almost embarrassed to suggest, but it might work, try spraying him with water every time he misgenders you and see if that helps. If he doesn’t see how it makes you uncomfortable then perhaps the discomfort of being misted with water every time he messes up might bridge the empathy gap.
I’m an enby. My best friend of 17 years is an enby. It took me an embarrassingly long time to change my usage of their pronouns to the correct one, because my brain just went on instinct while talking about my person. I changed their contact in my phone to “Name (they/them)”. It helped tremendously to see it written out every single time I messaged them, and reinforced it in my brain. Would you be able to change your contact in his phone? 

My other suggestion would be to change the pronouns you use for him. If he gets bothered by it, then he knows exactly how irritating it is to be misgendered on a regular basis. Might help.
So if he has the cognitive ability to do so in front of coworkers, to which there is face to lose by misgendering you since you’re out to them, but not in private to just you where he feels “love” will shield him from consequence… you have an answer.

Seek therapy or make peace with your husband viewing you as a woman. I don’t mean to be harsh or blunt but the meme of a delusional AFAB having a cis straight man as a partner who “acknowledges” he is in a queer relationship while being a cis straight man simply doesn’t line up when he won’t properly gender you. 

This line of thinking is only possible with great effort on their part. It is rare to be a cishet man, but able to be with a nb person without inadvertently, passively misgendering them. Usually it’s contingent on not physically transitioning in anyway since one cannot control sexual desire for certain physical traits.
I don't know how my saying this will land, and I'm sorry, but I don't deal with this. I set the expectation with people in my life that they will get it, I tell them, ""most people get the hang of it in a couple of weeks"" (if we see each other often) and people generally do not have an issue farther than that. Slip ups happen but they correct themselves or someone else does.

I have been openly nonbinary for more than 10 years.

Your husband is choosing to misgender you.

This is not your fault, and there is no work that you could put in to change his behaviour. He has made his choice.

I cannot express how sorry I am that you're being made to deal with this.
throw the whole partner out.
not to be flippant but since summer of 2021 it's been over a year. he obviously doesn't care.
This is in no way excusing his behavior but, as the spouse of a non-binary person, it can be hard to adjust to pronouns. Especially after being together for so long prior to you coming out to him. 

My partner realized they were NB after we had been together for ten years and it took a little bit of time but I got there eventually. It’s actually become harder to remember to use their assigned at birth pronouns around the people my partner doesn’t feel safe coming to. 

All that said, It’s been a year and from your post and other comments, it sounds like it could be one of two things. Your husband is either being deliberate and is ignoring your wishes, or he actually has a memory issue; the latter of which sounds far more unlikely.

It’s probably best to seek intervention in the way of couples counseling or having his memory tested by a medical professional.
Best solution I would say thearpy but possibly he could be suffering from memory lost like Alziemer's disease or maybe short term memory ................... I don't know why I'm talking , when I'm single
It’s hard sometimes. He’s met you and known you by this one name and pronouns all this time so automatically he will forget. My partner forgets all the time, but he makes up for it in using my given name that I did not originally introduce myself to him as.
This is not going to be what u want to hear, but you cannot control his behavior and if you have communicated repeatedly your needs and he hasnt shown any change then its simple that he understands he can continue to call u “she” without consequences. 
Honestly this shouldnt even be a “my needs” thing but a “this is the standard” and he can live up to it or leave. 
Misgendering you constantly is not a matter of ignorance but a fundamental lack of respect and i say that having lived through the same thing. 
You have several options. The best one id do is dont be afraid to leave him. It seems like a small thing to leave over but its a huge red flag- if he wont respect you on pronouns now i assure he wont respect you on things he perceives as more important later. You can try couples counseling if you arent prepared to walk away but feeling u need to bring in a 3rd party for him to just listen to u is also a red flag. id say to not treat your pronouns as an option first. Next time he calls you she, walk away. Ignore him, be offended, react the way you would if he insulted you bc thats what hes doing by not listening. If he wont respect you, then he can sleep on the couch or better yet. Leave for a few nights. Kids make it more complicated i know. But your pronouns arent optional.
It’s great that you have taken a step to discuss your reality and how you feel with your husband.  He cares for you and according to you is making an effort.

What you have to understand is that your reality isn’t everyone else’s. So it takes some time to adjust as he attempts to make you feel heard and important and adjust his reality and what he knows to accommodate for that.

If it’s bothering you that much and causing you that much emotional anguish. Divorce him. Better to do that than be miserable in a marriage.

At the end of the day you may need to ask yourself if him forgetting the new pronouns you have given yourself is worth ending a 15 year marriage over a man who clearly loves you and wants to be with you. Lot worse out there.

Being 100% real and honest with you, I wouldn’t stay with my partner if they came to me and told me to call them a different pronoun. I would still love them but couldn’t be in a romantic relationship with them. Right wrong or indifferent that’s the truth. He is willing to stay and love you. Whatever you decide, it’s what’s right for you, you know your boundaries.
Start using she/they for him. It works for my co workers who “can’t remember”
My mom ""forgot"" for 4 years. I gave her 4 years of time to learn. When I realized she just didn't want to. She didn't care enough or wanted to pretend she could change me ""back"" or she really is just that oblivious. 

The sad thing is, I finally gave her an ultimatum. Told her it's not ok anymore. She doesn't talk to me anymore. I've lost a mother. I'm having nightmares about it. 

It'll get better. But this isn't easy. I guess just know that you are doing what is right. Stand up for who you are. You are valid.
dump him men are trash go meet a beautiful queer love

also I can guarantee u he does NOT refer to u as ""they"" to his coworkers
My very best friend in the entire world (who I have known for many years) came out as nonbinary this summer. I have used the wrong pronoun exactly once and apologized profusely. If your husband paid a modicum of attention to his speech, he wouldn't mess up like that.
If you do (OP), make sure it’s with a truly trans-affirmative therapist who specifically has happy nb clients.
This is a great suggestion. I love that. 

It took me practice to say they/them, and practice to introduce myself as that. I know it’ll take him time, looking at pictures and telling the kids stories would be a lot of fun. Such a welcoming opportunity!
this is what i was thinking too. i hope OP sees your comment.
Yes!! I like this one the best.
I have a squirt bottle that I have thankfully only had to present and *threaten* to use with friends. For my MIL who still struggles 2 years in, I've taken to wearing a series of progressively larger and more colorful pronoun pins that come out and get conspicuously put on after she misgenders me.   


(I'm confident it's not a malicious thing on her part, but it *does* communicate a lack of care or effort, which still sucks)
i gotta start doing this
Im pretty pro these options.
This reminds me of a scene from ""Heartbreak High"" (the newer version) when someone's stepfather misgenders them and they whip out an airhorn.
You said this better than I was going to. If it's truly a memory issue (coming from someone with shit memory), remind remind remind!
I hope your surgery goes well tomorrow!
I had similar issues with my relatives, but over me being vegan 🙈 They don't even know, that I am a pansexual NB.

But if another person disrespects you, cause of whatever choice you made or what you are comfortable with (being trans isn't a choice), then this person don't deserve space and resources in your life.

I wish you best of luck for your surgery 😘
I corrected him today and he sat there looking at me not understanding why I said “they”. “No; theyyyy”. He blinks and is like — oh right, they. 

I think this is a reasonable request, except for the fact he has great memory at work. I feel like at home I get the scraps of the quality of person I get at home.
Based on op, this is how it seems to me too. Husband isn't even trying to do it right. He's not respecting it, which is a bad sign unfortunately.
If OP changed their last name after they got together then they can point out that he had no issues with completely changing their legal name but he for some reason draws the line at being a good husband when he doesn’t get anything out of it (A spouse in the last name’s case.)

He really needs someone to give him a reality check if he can remember that they no longer use their old last name but not the fact that they use different pronouns.
I agree, and I too can understand to a point. 

I showed him this thread today and said — look. Im not showing you to say “youre bad”, but from other people’s perspectives what they’re saying.

So he agreed to therapy and figuring it out.

If he is open to me exploring myself in my time, he deserves the same.

I appreciate your share. Thank you 🙏
""If he wanted to, he would."" Someone said this to me once about my own husband and it totally rocked my world. 

OP, I agree with the people who suggested counseling.
I totally get that it’s an adjustment. 1000%. 

I prefer partner or spouse. Im not a wife.

But like with me, talking to me and our kids and friends, he almost never says they/them. If he wants to use my name that’s cool. Just stop misgendering me.

I totally have peeps that make flubs and sometimes catch themselves, and sometimes not, but i see a genuine effort of inclusion.
My mom is very big on female gendered terms for me growing up. I’m 31 and out as NB for about a year. We only talk 1-2 times a month on the phone but she’s been immediately catching herself each time and says she’s still learning. 

I’m awkward about correcting people so its nice that she at least catches herself and tries. I also don’t entirely know the new names she could call me that are the cute kind of names she likes to use (like “child” doesn’t have the same level of cuteness she likes saying something like “girlie”). 

But yeah, OPs husband sounds like he just doesn’t care to put the effort in. A couple years and OP constantly reminding about pronouns there’s no excuse.
I hope you're correcting yourself the 40% of the time that you misgender your child.
Hey hey! Thanks for the share ❤️

It’s a little off putting seeing folks say “leave, he doesnt love you, he doesn’t respect you”… you know how hard it is being in a long term relationship. And how much stuff you go thru together.

Someone previously suggested to look thru old pictures and have dad tell the kid’s stories with my current pronouns. I thought this was brilliant.

Im looking for how to bridge the conversation, insight from the other side.

The other thing we’re doing is going for a couples counselling tuneup.

After it coming to a head, our oldest is doing their best to use they/them. It’s taking steps, not all or nothing.
Thanks for the love.

We’re going to go to therapy to get a tune-up.

I think he has a hard time articulating and locating where something comes from within him… so I hope this can give us the language and practice to change habits.
I like the idea of a name tag/button. I wanna find one thats like a magnet. 

Good suggestions!
Ouuu i like this suggestion! Thank you :)

Someone earlier suggested retelling stories from photos with current pronouns.

This is good too ❤️🙏
Thank you for this share 🙏

I feel that once i said to him how often he’s making the mistakes he just for whatever reason hasnt made that change in his mind. That’s definitely a him thing, so he needs to take accountability and responsibility for making those changes.

It’s finding what works. Thank you for putting this out there.
Hello hello! Thanks for the suggestion!

I will change my pronouns in his phone. Yes!!

And I will now call him they/them. Yes. See how they like being misgendered.
I think this is where we are stuck. To me our relationship is what it is, but to him… a fragile cis man…. Well….. you laid it out.

Andddd off to therapy we go! Get it out, process it, and get sorted. It’s how adults in committed relationships do things. Quitting isnt the answer here, working thru problems is.
Shiny spined comment
I can tell from experience that's not often the case. My twin almost never misgenders me when they talk about me to other people or when we're on a group call with friends or something like that, but when we're just the two of us in a room they usually revert back to my old pronouns, and I've been out for about a year and a half. All my co-workers know and make an effort, but my own twin gets it wrong and usually doesn't even correct themself, and I found comments they made on Reddit defending my pronouns in our native language (they use they/them in english but she/her in our native language, and I use a sort of neo-pronouns that are a mixture of singular and masculine-plural pronouns that isn't really popular yet but it's getting there).

Sometimes the people who know us the longest and spend the most time with us have the most trouble getting used to a new changes. When I'm not there or when it's an environment like a group call they remember my pronouns pretty well with no actual effort to trying to remember, when we're alone they forget again. Because us being alone just the two of us is something so familiar to them that the new change doesn't register even after a year and a half.

To me personally it doesn't matter when they get confused because it's them, but if that were any other person I'd just make sure there's something new physically that could remind them that hey, this situation is a bit new, so it'll remind them and get them used to it. Like how you draw something on your hand to remember to do something later.
We do have a supportive therapist, I think it’s time we go in for a tune-up and work it out. 

Many assume a lot about our relationship, but I wouldn’t have had kids with someone that I had doubts about overcoming difficulties and differences in our relationship.

He’s a good human, and we all have faults. Very seldom is grass truly greener on the other side. 

We very much so are still in a loving relationship, and I appreciate you sharing from your perspective.

Are folks here going to understand that, well they haven’t been thru what we have. And even after all this time we still discover things about ourselves and each other.
We actually do have one! Lucky to have found her.
😊
Usually, I can get away with just asking who they're talking about without having to escalate to the more extreme options. In my workplace, knowingly choosing to misgender someone is considered illegal discrimination/ harassment... So maybe also remind him of that 🤷
Honestly the spray bottle. Works when my cat misgenders me.
I think these are good, also a tshirt with a big THEY/THEM on it, non binary pride flags, etc
Your username cracked me up 😆  and thank you!
Eh, another non-binary vegan! :D I don't run into too many of us!
Do you see him at work? If not, you can't be sure that's true
And like, that's just not something you forget, right? If I expressed to my partner that something he did was really hurtful to me, that would not just be forgotten. I'm sorry you're dealing with this OP ❤
I kept my name because that’s my name. I think it’s very patriarchal to “take names”.
Yeah, I tend to word vomit my pov for this reason. Working towards change is hard for some people.

Nice to hear some therapy though. Sometimes helping someone find their own method to remind themselves is all it takes.
Have you had a conversation about how this affects your marriage?

Obviously you are not quite who either of you thought you were. It could be he's not used to the idea yet?

I'm sorry if there questions are intrusive. My spouse has recently been questioning their gender. White I'll support them being whatever they are I'm not sure how it would work for the marriage. I'm straight not pan so while I'll love then it goes to a strange place. 

If this is still unresolved with you it could be causing these issues.
Something like ""kiddo"" perhaps? It's gender neutral and still pretty cute
Yes of course.
I'm holding my thumbs that you guys are able to work through this together 😘
I really appreciate your share on this. 

This is how he’s explained it to me. 

This isnt the first time we’ve had someone that’s changed their name or identity. He’s gotten on board with them, needed practice.

You’re not booting your twin to the curb. Im not booting my partner because we have something that needs work. You know?
Rude lil kitten lol
The boobs are gone now and so is the funk!
Nice to meet you 🤗 On the /vegan are also some strolling around. You just have to ask. Or maybe start a discussion here in NB 😘
I have. So that’s why I’m frustrated.
Agreed. I just saw a repost where a doctor didn’t take their spouse’s name because their spouse wasn’t a doctor.
Hard agree. I wanted to have hyphened names but my husband didn’t like my last name, so he kept his and I made my former last, as my new middle. 3 years have passed and he is on the train now of hyphening or creating a whole new shared last name when we have kids (or before if we get around to it lol) and thats one thing in the group of things that makes me love him more and more. I regretted taking his last name this whole time cos other name loving my name and identity, his father was a piece of shit and he’s ready to take that step too of letting the name go.

In reference to this post, I admit I have a hard time with pronouns of my friend who went by she/they for a while, now goes wholly by they/them. I find myself thinking “she” in my head half the time and I correct myself mentally, but I find it easier not to mess up with my words cos I think about what I say before then. I hate it about myself and wish my brain would just do it automatically by now. 

Has he said anything about any remorse he feels when misgendering? I agree with others that the meat of the issue comes to whether he makes the effort to correct it. My husband struggles bad with my chosen name, but he corrects himself when he’s talking about me to people/introducing me. He almost always says the wrong name tho, lol. He has ADD so that hinders him. I hope that your husband begins to make an effort and engages in conversations with you about this topic in reciprocation.
His first question was how does this affect our marriage, and it’s just my gender and pronouns.

We still love each other and our family. That didn’t change.

Every situation is going to be different, communication is the most important and giving space to allow personal growth. But those things can change the fundamental things about the marriage.

Something I never really considered was him not having the language to communicate, or know how to feel or what he feels. And that’s a really big impediment. So it’s time for a tune-up and go to therapy.
Oh yeah, we’ll work thru this. This is definitely not territory of separation.

Like I said 15yrs, that’s a really long time to build a relationship. Folks that have been in long term relationships know the trials and tribulations. All relationships are messy in their own way.
Underboob funk is real.
Oh that's awful. I'm so sorry!
I dont know if i could marry a person like that…. Odd behaviour.
I'm in the middle of a bad spat right now myself. He's been distancing himself or shutting down when I affirm what I'm after in our relationship or anything to do with my gender or sexuality. I'm getting fed up with his behavior. Ten years for us. I don't want to give birth. He wants to keep his genes going so I said surrogate is fine but no it has to be me pushing out spawns even though I'm a more likely candidate of actually fucking dying from it. I bring up my sexuality (ace but I'm cupio so I love fucking) in memes to try and get a laugh and some understanding. Or NB memes for the same reason.

Love my new pronouns pin. I love moths.		"Omgosh I love itttt I want oneeee do you mind if I ask where you got it?🥹
Looks cute but it took me a while to see where the pronouns are.  But I'm stupid and my sight is not the best.
It can be found here! https://www.etsy.com/listing/1264144636/ 

I have the same one 😊
Aww its so cute
That's a really pretty pin! 😍
A cute gift idea for some people
That's soooo cuuuute
u/GloInTheDarkUnicorn does it say the product name on the package? Not out but still want it lol
I need this!!!
Aesthetic: 10/10

Ability to read: 4/""I just started crying because I've been in the conversation too long and desperately want to hide""
Ok I was worried about this too, and everyone in the comments wants one, so I can confirm the packaging is discrete.
My friend got me the same one!
I would also love to know, this is awesome!
At a little local gaming shop.
They can be found here! They’re on sale https://www.etsy.com/listing/1264144636/
Ya, it's super cute, but also a bit subtle, so I wouldn't rely on other people noticing it.
Just ordered! They are on sale!
Tnx I ordered a couple :)
u/MxTacit Does it say the product name on the package, just wondering bc I'm not out lol
No, it was just in a little tiny ziplock bag. I got it at a little local gaming shop.
I know. I have several but I just loved this one because it’s a moth.
It’s been a few months since I got mine but I believe it was discrete. It could be worth it to message the seller on Etsy and confirm for your own safety and assurance.
Oh yeah, I saw someone else in the comments say they got it on etsy, better ask them
Thanks I'll do that :)"	10n9mnj	NonBinary	454	1.0	2023-01-28 07:53:34
I'm everyone's new parent		"I luckily didnt have this experience coming out. I actually was binding when I was a teen long before I even *knew* I was nonbinary although I did know I had dysphoria I just didnt know what it was exactly. I just knew something was up with my body that wasnt quite right. My parents always supported me even when I didnt ""come out"" but still very much showed signs of it at an early age. Never ever did they ever push gender norms on me, I am thankful for them and I wish more parents were like that.  

I also volunteer to be everyone's new parent too :)
Where did you get these photos of my mom? lol
So glad I went no contact long before coming out as enby. I doubt she'd take it well.
Parent I crave violence
Parent: I won't use they/them pronouns when I'm referring to you!

Me: I won't use the word dad/mom when referring to you!

Paren't: Wait WHA-
All of these things is why I didn’t come out to my mom until I was 23. She was consistently losing her mind because I stopped shaving I’m high school, I wasn’t going to push it.
""I won't use they/them.""
""My child can't change THEIR name.""

Ik it's for the meme but it looks funny still
Asked for short hair sins I was 7 years old. Took 8 years before I got it, with parents not believing I actually wanted shot hair and telling me how ugly I would look.

Came out as nonbinary. Got told I would be an ugly boy (???) 

Got a chosen name and asked them to use it. They had a breakdown about how I must hate them for not loving the name they gave me, and I was not allowed to correct them.

Have not gotten a binder, and gave up looking for one. Gave up on pronouns correcting them.

...
Parents are exhausting
cut ur hair anyways!!! what are they gonna do, forcibly regrow your hair???
I maybe 20 years old but if anybody wants to adopt me I'm definitely down

My school councilor request I pick a more “normal” name if the teachers are gonna be allowed to use my preferred name and pronouns, so any advice?	"My name’s Ghost so I see why she thinks my name isn’t “normal” but I don’t really wanna change it or go as my deadname for any longer than I already have so any advice? (I don’t wanna change my name because I’ve been using the name Ghost since I was 12 and it holds csome meaning to me)


Edit: I think I’m gonna take someone’s advice and choose the name ‘Jasper’ as a legal name, I’ll leave Ghost as a nickname though. I think Jasper is a more “normal” name as was I’ve met a Jasper before but they no longer play a role in my life so I feel comfortable taking their name. I’ll give myself a week or two to think on it before telling anyone though in case I change my mind"	"She's free to request it, but you don't have to listen to her.

You've been using Ghost since you were 12. To the person whose name it is - yours - it's not just normal. It's right.

Also, I guarantee you your school counselor hasn't met any Filipinos. The amount of Boys, Babys, Barbies, and Princesses my family knows is astounding. And normal.
That’s bs. Parents are naming their kids anything these days, of course you can be Ghost, it’s only a problem because you’re nonbinary. I would stand firm and threaten to complain to admin/hr.
no advice but I went to school with kids who were actually named ""Dammit Janet"" after the Rocky Horror Picture Show song, and ""Precious Diamond"" so I always hate hearing the phrase ""normal name"". I'm sorry your counselor is being dumb :(
I’ve always had good luck by simply saying “no”, without elaborating. Works like a charm.
I know a person whos mom named him storm. So fuck those stupid teachers. Names a name. Its not latin ffs.
This is just an example of adults attempting to discredit kids/teens because to many adults young=no self determination. Do you, find and claim whatever name makes you feel seen.
Tell her your name is Ghost and to respect your name because it is. Your name. 

It’s your name. 

It is the simplest decency a soul can extend; giving someone their name. It’s the earliest thing we are taught in communication as children, ask and respect a name. 

Ask if they’d tell a child with a non English name to change it to sound ‘normal’? Obviously no. So the same decency can be extended to you. 

Have they asked any kids with moron parents who give them dumbass names to change them? No. Have they suggested kids with names that target them for bullying change them? No. 

This is flagrant discrimination because of your reason for your name change and you should go above them and complain. 

If the counsellor hasn’t learned that they are wildly in the wrong here, then they have absolutely no place being anywhere near education and I say that as someone doing the same exact job for ten years and I thought that before I identified as NB. 

It’s your NAME. Who raised this counsellor? Was it in a literal barn? It’s your NAME.
Your school counselor doesn't have a policy to stand on when it comes to preferred name choices. It could also be added to the records system that your school uses relatively easily if it's similar to what I had access to.   


If you want to be called Ghost, it should be done and the system should work with those of marginalized identities. I'm disappointed in this counselor.
Tell them your name is Godeffroi-Stanislas or Gregor-Herbert-Ophélie-Sylvain-Trévorine
Totally valid if you determine the best decision for you at this time is the path of least resistance, but I find the request that you go by a different name discriminatory.

It seems like because your name is not your assigned name at birth, this person feels entitled to demand an alternate, which is sus.

Why is it important for your name to be “normal”? What problem does using the name Ghost cause that needs to be solved? It sounds like your classmates already know you as Ghost, so it doesn’t come across to me like she’s trying to protect you from being singled out as “unusual,” which is the only logical explanation I can think of for having concern about your name. Are you being asked to change the name you go by because teachers will feel awkward referring to you by an “unusual” name? I don’t think that is a good reason to demand that someone adjust their public identity.

I often think fondly of Dr. Marijuana Pepsi, who [refused to change her name to make others happy](https://www.npr.org/2019/06/21/734839666/dr-marijuana-pepsi-wont-change-her-name-to-make-other-people-happy).

But again, no pressure to fight an authority figure if that’s not how you want to spend your energy. Sometimes it’s worth it to choose your battles.
“Normal” is subjective and you do not need to comply with making others more comfortable with your gender expression. Adults like normalcy and they also like practicality. I wont lie and say it wouldnt make your life easier in the long run to change it, esp if you want to enter a corporate career path or something similar, but there is nothing wrong with your name, you can still live a good life with that name, and its not that hard for other people to just be respectful of it.             
Dont let anyone pressure you about how you exist as yourself. Thats your life, not theirs.
Ask them what's ""normal""? Are Spanish names normal? How about Chinese? Dutch? Nigerian?
I have friends with names that a lot of people have trouble pronouncing. There is a long history of forcing people to erase their culture and identity by taking what someone thinks is a ""normal"" name.
Maybe ask you councilor if they think it would be appropriate in that case.
My birth name isn't a ""normal"" name and they could deal with that just fine.   I'd ignore the counselor.
If you have a trusted adult who can help you advocate for yourself, I'd suggest bringing them in. It sounds like this is completely based on the counselor's bias and personal preference, not on any rule or policy, so you are not required to change your name.
Dude that name's so cool. I'm sorry they're giving you a hard time for no reason
I feel like Ghost is such a cool name. I’ve seen that you’ve decided to use Jasper which I will respect, since I know it’s quite difficult to stand your ground with things like this. I hope one day you’re able to legally change your name to Ghost. Noun names have a special place in my heart. My little cousins birth name is Ocean and it doesn’t feel unnatural or weird to call him that at all. It might be safer for you to use a “normal” name for now since you’re still in school anyways
Fuck ur school counselor tbh
i went to school with two Angels, a Baybe (pronounced baby), a Princess, and a Cookie. a “normal name” isn’t a thing. Jasper is a nice name, but if you feel more like Ghost then there’s no reason to bend to some crabby adult. (depending on your location, getting your name changed might be easier if it’s “normal” though, sadly)
Jasper is definetly a Ghost name;)
It feels like a transphobic attack from them rather than just about the name itself. I don’t think they would have a problem if Ghost were a cis kids given name.

I like the name Ghost, and I’ve always loved Jasper.
Take her name to assert dominance. Hyphenate it and INSIST on both being used. Thanks Mrs Jane Doe, my name is Now Jane-Doe Ghost \[Lastnamehere\]
Jasper is close to Casper for Casper the friendly ghost :) i like that name, but honestly, Ghost is a lot better. also, what counts as ""normal"" to them??? would an ethnic name be abnormal??? would people tell you to change your birth name if it was abnormal???
Fuck that councilor. Completely disrespectful and inappropriate, whether you're trans or not. A person's name is their name, and you are to be respected whatever your name is. Also, ""if"" the teachers are going to be ""allowed"" to use your name and pronouns? That's fucked. They should be using your preferred name and pronouns, full stop end of story period.
If your parents had named you Ghost, the school would suck it up. They're perfectly capable of handling unusual names if they want to.
Ghost is a banger name, don’t listen to them. Holy shit I love that name
My name is Xee and my partners name is Wham. We're almost 30 and people don't question us when we introduce ourselves, even for work events. 

Do what feels right to you!
if you had a name from another language that she found hard to pronounce and asked you to change it she would lose her job immediately (in my country) so the same should apply. that’s your name and she has no right to determine anything, even just the rudeness to ask should cost an investigation at the very least
Malicously comply i'd say....

I know people named Cyan, Grey, Day, Sunshine, Mist and so on. And some of them are cis. And some of them are 40+ years old. 

People need to grow up.
Your name is your name and you’re allowed to keep it for as long as it suits you and feels right.
You could go by “G” at school
Everyone suggesting picking a formal name and then just using Ghost anyway keeps making me think something like Ghostopher. Or that Topher is an unexpected shortening of Christopher
Casper would be kinda tongue in cheek if you go by ghost, and it sounds like jasper. Food for thought 

Either way your counselor is way off base asking you to change your preferred name to smth more palatable to *her*. I think Ghost is a sick name!!
Ghost is a sick name and if others don't respect it that's their problem
Yeah it might be weird and you might get the whole ""is that really your name? is someone pranking me?"" bit. But truthfully if I can have a classmate named taco, another one whom changed his name every year than why can't you be ghost? I mean no one is asking Space Ghost to change his name, so why are they doing that to you?
A names a name and should be respected. As long as you don't pull something sneaky like ""Ben Dover"" or ""Mike Rotch"" I'm sure it should be fine. There's an NB person I knew from high school who now goes as ""Phoenix"" which is a super dope name and all of the teachers have no problem using it. I think your school might just have some transphobic faculty and that's not okay.
God Damn it they must be jealous, Ghost is the coolest name I have ever heard
I know a kid named Casper, basically the same thing 🤷‍♂️
Maybe keep ghost as a nickname and pick a more mainstream name for legal and professional uses? You might have trouble finding a job with a name like Ghost. (I actually used to go by ghost when I was 13, then when I was 15 I chose the name Constantine for legal and professional reasons.)
I think ghost is super cool name and you should use whatever name is the most comfortable for you regardless of the opinion of others.
Hey my name's ghoste too
The way she asks this as if cis people don’t also have the weirdest names…
Do you have an older sister named Amy or are you not my sibling on the other side of the house?
You are the second Ghost I've heard of
Yeah, I advise left bird followed by the right bird, then shake them around a little.
What if they just called you G for short?
That's a good ass name.(wish I came up with something more creative) I'd fell them to fuck off its not their name it's yours!!
Well that's annoying but I kinda understand the legal name perspective. If you do settle on it then at least you can say you're Jasper the friendly ghost :\^\)

Or Jasper the unkind ghost, whichever you prefer lol

If you end up wanting a different ""normal""/legal name, I find nameberry to be a good resource :)
Just in my hall of my dorm alone, I know we've got Mango & Mozely. I really don't think it's a big thing ngl
Oh please please please go with Casper
I knew a christian cishet motherfucker in college who made everyone call him Tofu just because he was a vegan. You be Ghost; it’s who you are.
If Ghost is significant to you, keep it! If it comes down to it, you can always use it as a middle name. Don’t compromise something so important to you for the sake of “normalcy.”
What a ridiculous request, Ghost is a badass name, do what makes you happy. ✌🏻
Cis people have “weird” given names all the time. No councilor is insisting they pick a “normal” name. Nobody has any right to make you change your name
My names is Aurum, I have a friends named Noise and another named Ice. My partner’s name is Ferrum. There is no such thing as “normal” name just as there is no such thing as a “weird” name. All names are just words that you specifically respond to. You don’t have to listen to them. It would be like asking a foreign exchange student to choose a “normal” name, you just don’t do that and it’s rude. Keep using your name if you want to.
Ppl will literally be named Guy or Apple but Ghost isn’t okay??? I will never understand 😭 In a lot of languages/cultures names will have a specific meaning so if anything random names like John are more weird than Ghost I mean John sounds nothing like the name it came from 💀
Ghost is a bad ass name. Name yourself whatever you want to be called. It's **your** name.
My brother has gone by Tiger since he was a baby and legally it is his middle name, afaik he uses it at work and college
Tbh Ghost would be a weird name legally, I think Casper would work better for that, it still has the ghost link too!

But it's your choice.
please tell us ur keeping the name ghost!! it’s so dope
I mean, I went to school with a girl called Rkellya (R Kelly) 😐
There's no guidelines on how to name other people. As long as your name isn't anything offensive, I see no reason why one would need to pick on it. You don't have to obey their ""wishes"", because in the end, they're the gatekeeper in this situation.
i follow a tatted up baddie on ig who just named her baby ghost. that’s his legal name. there’s nothing wrong with choosing that name for yourself. also i love it
Tell them that’s culturally insensitive. I wonder how they’d feel about Icelandic names, where a lot of boys are named Thor, björn (bear), Thorbjörn, and other things. Also point out how rich white women get away with naming their kid “Malachite” or “Amethyst”, or “Sky”, or how hippies named their kids “Blue”, or “Stone” (I literally know a Blue and a Stone) and they weren’t told to change their kids name and that they should go by something different by school officials.

This is just transphobia, by denying you your name and gender. Like, yeah, kids will be aholes and bully you for your name and pronouns, but to deny you your NAME is a violation and not something school officials can legally do. They can get in trouble for that shit.
casper tho
You could also be a cheese and pick Casper like the ghost
?? wtf. what if you were born with that name are they just not gonna use it? me and my sisters are literally named dallas, lyric, and remedy and Ive heard much ""weirder."" Id just get your parents to call school if possible, that usually shuts em up real quick.
Yeah that’s bullshit I knew a kid growing up named blaze white. Parents named him that. Teachers all respected it
instead of jasper you could go with Casper
I named myself Zephyr 

After the Greek god of the west wind and spring, zephyros.

I picked this because, I was born in early spring.

Spring is the season of change and I have changed drastically as a person since I first came out.

My friends call me Z or Zeph.


I know a kid tho who changed their name to Zombie. And then began going by Z. We were in the same friend group at this point and they later admitted to their bf that they were jealous of how cool the letter sounded for my name, so as long as you're not picking a name for petty reasons, I think you're good.


But I only really had a problem with it bc they were bouncing off my nickname, and admitted to it. They also later cheated on their boyfriend, who is my best friend. So I have a lot of negative feelings for them.


That's off topic as hell sorry.


Edit: u remember why that was relevant. If their school was ok with calling them Zombie, I see no reason you're not able to use ghost. 

I also knew a cis woman who's name was starry. There's weird names out there.
Dont conform just because one person asked you to! Use the name YOU want!!
Aaah I love Ghost! That’s such a cool name your teachers shouldn’t get a say in what your legal name is.
Drew!
Casper
Yeah ig name picking is hard but I rather choose my middle name if I ever want to be fem
Boo to whoever convinced you to switch names. Boo them. Ghost is a good name and should be kept as such
Great name! I agree with others who advise to pick a legal name, and just use Ghost as nickname. I mean a lot people don’t know Magic Johnson’s first name is Earvin.
i know u irl
You can pick a gender ambiguous name like Jamie, Frankie, Jackie, Billie, or my favorite, Robyn.
If a kid is named Emeighleigh at birth ain't no teacher gonna go up to the parents and lecture them on how to ""properly name your kid."" BUT if the person themselves chooses a name for themselves? ""Well, I ain't gonna respect you nor your wishes if it ***stupid***. UG!"" It's bs. 

If a person chooses their own name to better reflect who they truly are I think that means a **hella** lot more than a married couple selecting one for a child based off personal preference, vague statements like ""she/he looks like a \_\_\_\_"", or names passed down from dead people. 

I'm real sick of the opinions of the parents (or other third parties) consistently trumping those of the actual human in question. A child transitioning is rough on the parents and family??? SO THE F\*\*\* WHAT? I mean, I care about that, but I care 1,000,000% more about the actual person transitioning: THIS.IS.ABOUT.THEM. And I don't care how hard it may be to change your thinking towards another person. It's infinitely harder for a trans person to NOT BE THEMSELVES. Dips\*\*ts. I don't hear suicide and depression statistics of parents and family dealing with the difficulties of accepting their kids as trans. THE WORLD NEEDS TO GET OVER THIS STUPIDITY. It's literally killing us...

sry. I'm ranty today.
omg same my fam has variations of Happys, Melons, Baby Girls, Princes, lots of unusual biblical names, some names that are just random objects or sounds, even some greek gods
as in the child was named 'boy' ? /gen
haha, my name was baby! i’ve still never met another one
I've known a few people with unusual names, but having your first name be literally a swear word has gotta be pretty rough
I know a “Precious Angel” it’s legit her legal name. Screw “normal”
There was this badass upperclassmen when I was in highschool like a decade and a half ago named Stormy. It's a good name and I was always a little jealous lol
I know at least three people named Stormy
Storm is an accepted boy's name in the Netherlands. I know a Storm.
G. H. O. S. T.
Ikr, she’s perceived as the best person to go to for all of your problems but she has a history of pulling the “well im not ___, but….”
Wham and Xee are both glorious names
…if you two are in front of a mirror does that make it a double *Wham-Xee*?
🎶last Christmas I gave you my heart🎶
Not here, I almost guarantee if I took a complaint they’d probably say “it’s just a name, you’ll probably change it anyway so why bother?”
I’ll try that
Wait Amy? Hi I guess
And second Jasper too!
This confuses me-
Knowing her, she’d probably immediately shut down the idea for fear of people thinking it meant gangster or something (she’s a lil weird)
Like the ghost
I thought about it for two years  but I don't mind my name it's unisex
Who then? Cuz I don’t think I know anyone who uses ‘u’ but I’m interested

Name?
yeah it’s the same in Māori culture, people are legitimately named Boy or Tama (which just translates to boy lol) I’ve also got a cousin called Ocean. You should watch the new zealand movie “Boy”
Well, sometimes they’re just nicknames that have nothing to do with their actual. Like Baby would be the youngest daughter/sister, and so many people have a Tito Boy haha
Ajdjd yeah that's not someone u wanna listen to. If ur teachers care enough to make u feel accepted, they'll do it regardless of whatever name u choose. It's YOUR name, fuck everyone else. It's your choice, doesn't matter what bs other ppl have to say
I do love the idea of the name jasper tbh and ghost as a nickname but that's just me. U do u.
I think Ghost is as well 🖤
Nah I’m kidding, idk who you are
Wait that’s cool!
(Give them the finger)
She's definitely weird. With my smart mouth, I would have said something like ""Well I don't care for your name. It sounds weird to me. So I'm gonna need you to come up with a new one for me as well. And you probably should also find a new job since a counselor is supposed to be empathetic and understanding, not judgy & closed-minded."" There are people with wild and unique first names that are legally on their birth certificate that she would've had to just accept it as is. And there are plenty of people that don't go by their legal first name since forever. My uncle refuses to answer to the first name given to him on his birth certificate, and he's from a completely different generation where the schools & government were even worse with understanding people's unique circumstances & needs, and he didn't have any issues with anyone respectfully calling him by the name of his choosing, including teachers, etc. I understand the name Ghost seems unconventional, but there are plenty other first names much more unconventional than that out there. This counselor just either needs to get with it and get over herself, or find a new career that better suits her.
yes!
did u used to live in ny? bc if not i know someone just like u
I mean we have Guy so kinda similar lol
ohh thats so interesting ! thank u :)
It's interesting you never meet anyone called Kōtiro tho!
Damn you got my hopes up for a sec. My sibling is also 14 and named Ghost.
Nope. I’m born and raised in Michigan
o yea facts !! wow the wonders of language
no worries :)

Lil’ Lemon from the kid’s show The Fungies is canonically non-binary and uses they/them pronouns. They are voiced by Niki Yang who also voiced BMO from Adventure Time.		"Wasn't BMO nonbinary too?
I hadn't heard of this before but this information combined with how adorable it looks has won me over.
I believe so! BMO uses He/She pronouns and references different gendered terms depending on how he feels. I love BMO!
Yes BMO is also non-binary, but I think Lil’ Lemon is a more explicit representation as Lil’ Lemon, unlike BMO, is just like all the other kids in the Fungie world. BMO was one of the only robots in the world, and so it was easier to dismiss his non-binary gender as just being “well he is a robot so he just doesn’t have a gender.” 

I also love BMO, but I like that with Lil Lemon there is no real “out” for for people.. if that makes sense? 

Having watched AT with actual kids it was interesting listening to how they talked about him. Because he was a robot it seemed easier for them to just dismiss the whole NB thing like it wasn’t a thing that could apply to them or their friends. It was just a fantasy robot thing, just a funny idea. Kids need things to be really obvious. That’s why I think Lil’ Lemon is so awesome to see.

I guess there is also Stevvonie from Steven Universe, but i don’t remember their pronouns being used that much. It was like they were really trying to avoid using their pronouns so as to fly under the censor radar or something. 

But again, as with BMO, the non-binary gender of Stevvonie is also easily dismissed as a fantasy thing, an interesting idea. 

Not to say BMO and Stevvonie are not awesome. They are absolutely awesome. But the Fungies seems to be for younger kids, and having this very obvious representation of a non-binary child is just a little mind blowing to me. 

Lil’ Lemon is just another child in a world where most other people use she and he pronouns, and everyone respects and uses Lil Lemon’s pronouns. It is never made a big deal of. It’s just amazing and wonderful for normalizing and modeling they/them pronouns for kids.
Steven Universe Future also had Shep voiced by Indya Moore! Shel used they/them pronouns and dated Sadie.
Totally agree! That’s awesome! More explicit representation is so important! Double Trouble from She-Ra also uses they/them pronouns! 

Yeah, Stevonnie does use they/them but they are a fusion so there is that.

But good things are happening! I know both Rebecca Sugar and Noelle Stevenson are nonbinary."	lolkw1	NonBinary	439	1.0	2021-02-21 01:13:07
Hi I’m Noor. Gender fluid, they/them pronouns.		"Ommgggg I love that vest/shoe combo ! And Noor is a beautiful name 💛💛💛
You are seen!
Absolutely lovely - I adore your name. Also, that style is just worthy of gods, so cute!
You definitely give off big They vibes! It's too bad so many people have their heads stuck in the binary but I feel like that is starting to change....
I like your style, Team.
Hey Noor, this a look!!! Being non binary can be soo hard but also really wonderful. I see you in all your glory
Hi! 👋🏼
Wow you look SO fantastic. Like seriously gorgeous look.

  
Also love your name, this is seriously my favorite name ever, I love it sm.
great fit with that color combination
noor is a really cool name
I'm obsessed with the vest they are wearing.
You look fantastic, Noor. Sending you love.
You are seen, valid, and very spiffy! 😊
Loving how you've matched the colors. Vest and shoes ❤️
That's a snazzy outfit! I love it! 😄❤️
Wow, your style is really great. And you are seen. You actually remind me of an oc i made and they also have a similair clothing and hair style
Hey Noor! My name is Nora, so I guess we're name siblings-ish?
Kamen Rider anti-hero getup 💜
I came here to say that you look great and Noor is such a good name, like I saw that name and I was like yes I need to tell this person that I love their name"	zebc6b	NonBinary	437	1.0	2022-12-06 16:39:56
Finally built up some courage to protest for my proper pronouns. Just put this up on my bedroom door! 💛🤍💜🖤		"I hope it works for you!
This ia awesome!!! And I really need something like that for my door as well💛🤍💜🖤
May I also suggest... 🌌 Offspring 🌌
if only parents could get this message :')
Amazing! Takes guts to do that, from a fellow non binary man who wishes he did that when he was younger, I’m proud of you
yes this is amazing! 🙌🏻
💛💜🖤
Omg yes! I love thisss
Oh shit did u make the calligraphy? Fuckin awesome kiddo!!!!!! 

Good for you on standing up for yourself!!!
That is some amazing graphic design.     Doggospeed you Graphics Themperor.
good for you dude
I hope so too, thanks for the support on this!!
Thanks so much!! And you should totally go for it, I think it'll help! I could send you the non binary graffiti png I made for this if you'd like to use that
The kids aren't alright was my highschool soundtrack.
Spawn
You used a lot of pronouns to be nonbinary
Creation
What? I use he/him or they/them pronouns, still non binary.
""Man"" specifies a gender. He/him also points to male.
I think you’re confusing non-binary with agender. I am not without gender, I just don’t adhere to the concept of being a binary masculine or feminine person. I am a trans man who is also non binary and femininely expressing
You said he in your original comment. Saying he seems as if you preferred masculine pronouns. Most nonbinary people I have known, including the maker of this sign, prefer they/them. Apologies if I have offended, just making an observation that you preferred masculine pronouns."	lupyk0	NonBinary	436	1.0	2021-02-28 20:44:03
So, I just got thrown out of my parents Christmas party.	"Edit: CW: Transphobia, Deadnaming

Tbh, I don't really know why I am posting here, I just have to vent I guess.
Some background: I'm a 37yo trans-femme enby and  discovered that fact about 2 years ago. I talked to my parents and they seemed very accepting but I didn't have much direct contact with them, due to covid.
For Christmas I usually just visit for a few hours and go home the same day, cause the Christmas stuff really tires me and my mental health hasn't been the best the last years. This time, I thought I could spend the night because the last year's went pretty good.
Everything was okay, got deadnamed a few times, but that stuff happens, especially if you know someone your whole life under another name.
Now I don't really care about pronouns in my nativ language (German), because I haven't found a neutral one I like, but I really don't like being called a man or any other male nouns.
So this morning my niece (I haven't met her yet, due to covid again) asked who I am, and my mother told her: ""this is [dead name], he's your uncle, he's my son."" and that just tipped me over.
I waited till the kids were gone and told her that I was  hurt and dissapointed she didn't even try. She ignored me and just went on.
A little bit later I tried to talk to her about it, but she just said she doesn't have to change for me and that I make this all about me (duh, it's my identity).
Finally my father joint in, telling me I ruined Christmas for them and, after I asked them why they can't except that I'm not a man, yelled at me that I am his son and I should leave.
I'm now riding the train to my hometown, after my very accepting Sister brought me to the train station.
That's Christmas for me, I guess, but tbh, the magic has been gone for years now.
I will definitely go no contact for at least a while.
I hope you all have a better Christmas than I do and hope the next year will be full of love for ya'll."	"*Hugs* for you sweetie. Spend some time recovering, and thank your sister for us.
I'm sorry that happened. And funnily enough your parents made it about them. I once read an analogy about changing your last name when you get married and that transphobes have no problem with that. But since you're also talking about your relation to your mother, I think I have a better analogy.

When you have a partner, let's say for the example they're a woman. First she is your girlfriend, then your fiance and then your wife. If your mother than says after your marriage that she is your girlfriend, I can imagine you saying something as well. In this situation no one would try to argue you're making it about yourself/your wife.

Just like the analogy, you parents don't give you the least amount of respect. Only because they can't accept who you are, that's them making it about themselves. They're taking active actions to hurt you.

I hope you find more people like your sister. And I hope you can find a family that you can share festivities with, without this negativity.
I'm so sorry this happened.  Your sister sounds like an angel.
Your 37, time to enjoy the niece with their family, and enjoy time with people that are not looking at a full grown adult and saying that what they are doing for their happiness that hurts no one is wrong.
Your parents are being downright horrible to you. Refusing to show you respect and trying to control who you are, especially at this age!, is textbook abusive parent behavior. (I happen to be the same age as you and also figured myself out at 35 :) And I have a little too much experience with dealing with abusive patents/other family members. On that note I must recommend the sub r/raisedbynarcissists. They're well modded, lgbtqia+ friendly, and many there will relate to what you've been through, even the cis members; they may not have had your exact experience,  but almost everyone there has dealt with the same kind of controlling hostility and tantrumy behavior from their parents over all kinds of other things.)

I suggest you consider reducing or eliminating future contact and visits with them, for the sake of your mental and emotional well-being. It was their responsibility as your parents to support you, including emotionally. Trying instead to force you to be something they want you to be, without regard for causing you harm to get what they want, is close to polar opposite of healthy parenting. You don't owe them a damn thing. They owed you so much already, and now they also owe you nothing less than a massive and sincere apology, especially if they want your time or energy again for any reason. Anything less than that is basically a promise that they will treat you just as badly or worse if you resume regular contact or visit them again.

You didn't do anything wrong.

Your parents failed you. Not the other way around.

You deserve so much better. F* them, if you don't mind me saying so.
So sorry you had to go through this. I kinda relate. I have no contact with my parents for almost 3 years now because they basically stopped recognizing me as their daughter after divorcing and entering a relationship with my current mtf partner. My mother texted me a bunch of slurs addressed to all of us (me, my ex and my current partner), refused to visit me ever again and moved to another city without telling me anything about it. My father (after me calling him on his birthday) accused me of never visiting them in the context in which I was never invited at their place nor do I know where they live anymore. I have a 6yo daughter which they never call or visit. All this comes after a childhood and adolescence of emotional and physical abuse from my father which my mother never stopped or addressed. It used to be a very difficult topic for me, however with therapy and a lot of work I have come to understand that I need to learn to be my own parent and accept the fact that these people who are my biological relatives never learned or made any effort to be my real parents. It's a tough lesson and I am still processing it, however it gets somehow easier to manage day by day. The most difficult cookie to swallow is the fact that I never really felt loved and/or accepted unconditionally. I am still working on this. You need to focus on yourself and try as much as you can to find this comfort inside you first and foremost. You need to love yourself and accept yourself and look inside yourself to find the power to be your own parent. It takes time and work and it will not happen overnight, but it is doable. Leaning on my partner, therapy, reaching out to online communities, all these helped me. Good luck to you! 💜
that's awful hon, I hope you're ok
I'm sorry that happen to you, your sister seems great. Hope you'll have a better new year, virtual hugs for you :)
We are not out yet, but I'm part of an OSDD-1B system (medically diagnosed) and our host disappeared because the people that caused our trauma are here and they didn't feel safe, and I was basically told to go in another room and I feel like no one likes me. Christmases are tough. Sorry you're having a rough one too.
Oh, love, my heart is breaking for you, but I'm glad you came on here to share your story. I'm in a similar boat with my parents seemingly on board and then not and then maybe back on but then no, not. All of which is all compounded when you feel like your brain is struggling with it's own health. It's a painful situation to be in and you don't deserve a second of it, not one single second. You deserve an expansive and beautiful family and I hope that in the coming years you get all that and more. But for now, stay safe, be well in whatever way that means for you, and know that while we are strangers a host of people across the world are loving you and wishing you the absolute best.
Tut mir sehr leid, dass du das erleben musstest. 
Du hast einen mutigen und gesunden Schritt gewagt, deine echte Identität auszuleben und deiner Eltern sind (noch) nicht bereit, diese anzuerkennen. 
Deine Schwester klingt aber super lieb! 
Ganz liebe Wünsche and dich 🎄♥️
Sigh.  That is so discouraging.  On the plus side, your sister.  Stay strong.
I will never understand family that chooses to close their minds and be hard nosed about change rather than continue relationships with the people they supposedly love.

Like did they ever love you at all? Or only the idea of you?
Sending you much love and solidarity. <3
Es tut mir sehr leid. 😔
All the hugs for you <3 I hope you find some more accepting folks to spend newyears with.
I'm no contact with mine. My life blossomed in a way I never could imagine. If it's time for you, it's time. 

I hope you're ok. You will be ok.
i’m so sorry that happened! that does seem so unnecessarily cruel of them. I wish people could be more accepting, especially those who claim to love us. I hope you have a better rest of your day and remember that i’m rooting for you:)
I'm sorry that happened to you. (Hugs)
Im so srry their ur pronouns and ur gender٫ they should exept that hope u have a better Christmas next year virtual hugs from me!
Christmas is such a bummer. Sorry it came to a painful head, but perhaps it is best. You cannot change or detoxify others but only separate and insure YOUR boundaries. 

My parents threw my wife and me out at Christmas for reason(s) I still am not aware of and can only speculate about. 

I divorced them. It was years later after my father had passed away that I made contact with my mother again on a very limited basis. My terms. 

Lost faith in Christmas about the age I realized it wasn't about what they said it was. Not the whole Santa Claus thing, the interpersonal thing. The guts of it. Bullshit made to make you feel miserable. Being trans is just a catalyst in the mix. Be thankful you KNOW that.

Hope the new year goes well for you and those who truly love and accept you!
Typically family selfishness 🙄. I'm glad your sister at least is accepting and got you out of there.

 This is the first Xmas I'm spending with my chosen fam instead of my fam fam, so excited. I had a video call with thr fam though like machine guns of misgendering what a fucking mess but it's over and I'm so excited to visit friends.
I’m so sorry that happened to you. I’ve been kind of having the same thing happen today.

I do hope you get to enjoy the rest of the night. 

Happy Holidays my friend :)
A thousand hugs are on their way 💛. Welcome to the ruined Christmas squad ( although the reason is different ) !
Sending you all the virtual hugs I can!!
Das tut mir sehr leid. Mir passiert das ich sehr häufig, dass meine Eltern betonen, dass ich so eine hübsche junge Frau sei bzw. so eine hübsche Tochter. Sie versuchen nicht, sich mir anzupassen. Es tut weh, aber irgendwann muss ich nicht mehr unter ihrem Dach wohnen. Deine Eltern sollten dich mehr respektieren. Du bist 37 und sie behandeln dich wie ein Kleinkind dass ihnen grad auf die Nerven geht. Es kann nicht sein, dass deine Identität ihr Weihnachten ruiniert hat. Sie haben es für sich selbst ruiniert. Ich hoffe, dass du trotzdem irgendwie ein schönes Weihnachten feiern kannst, und ich wünsche dir alles gute
I’m so sorry this happened to you, especially on Christmas. I hate it when people do that. That your parents try to claim you’re making it all about you. And then they proceed to claim you’ve “ruined their Christmas”? Honey if that’s not making something all about you Idk what is
I'm sending you virtual hugs! 💜 

I'm sorry that your family is so disrespectful and self-absorbed, and that they're sharing those traits with your young niece. You aren't asking for anything unreasonable - Just acknowledgement and respect for your identity and name. 

I appreciate you. Stay strong!
It's been a similar experience here. I have considered whether or not I'll contact my parents on future Christmases. Unsure yet. I may send a postcard with ""your son is dead"", or I might send a Christmas card with a nice photo of me and ""You can meet me, [real name], this Christmas - if you are nice & not naughty!""
I just want to say I’m so sorry to what happened to you.
Thank you so much 💕 I did thank my sister.
Thank you 💕
Yeah, they made it about themselves, but I don't think they even notice. They seem to think their view of the world is the ""normal"" one.
I knew the analogy with the changed last name, but yours may be a little more understandable. If I resume contact I'll try it that way.
Thankfully I have a lot of understanding and supportive people around me. 💜
Thank you 💕 She really is, and all this while she herself is struggling with a divorce at the moment. I'm really happy to have her.
Yeah, I'll go zero contact with them for now, we'll see what the future holds.
Yeah I'm 31 and probably never going to come out to them at all for this reason. Been no/low contact for a  few years and its been the best move for my mental health.
Thank you very much for your words. 💕
I know that subreddit, the thing is my parents do have problems with supporting me emotionally but otherwise they have been pretty supportive, especially my mother, and we had a respectful relationship up until now.
I don't really know what got into them and I feel really betrayed right now, especially because my mother assured me I could be myself beforehand. This was the first time in years I was looking forward to visit them.
Thank you so much 💜
I'm so sorry you had to go through all that and I'm happy you are getting better. 💕
I'm already looking for therapy and I'm looking into some online communitys.
I'm okay and back at my place now, thanks. 💕❤️
Thank you, very kind ❤️ I hope you have a great new year, too!
Awww, thank you. 💜
I'm still NC, still struggling a little bit, but it has gotten better 🙂
>>They seem to think their view of the world is the “normal” one 

That’s exactly what it is. Using someone’s assigned name and pronouns is considered the norm, and therefore anything that deviates from that is seen as a favor people have to go out of their way to do for you rather than just the correct thing to do.
Enjoy the other relatives if you’d like, and you can give them nice memories that are not tainted by the others
Ok good
I’m sorry but what is NC?
Thanks, I will 💕
No contact

I’m finally dating someone who is attracted to *all* of me!	"I’m afab and genderfluid, and I’m not sure where my sexuality falls but I am heaaaavily more attracted to men than to women. I recently broke up with a cishet man who would only ever use she and they pronouns for me in fear of being seen as gay. He didn’t even like me dressing masculine because it was “concerning”…….. yeah I am now realizing I should have dumped his ass wayyyyyy sooner. 

Im now dating abother man who does not identify his sexuality, although he is heavily attracted to women and slightly attracted to men, but holy mother of fuck does he ever change the game. He calls me his boyfriend when I feel masculine, even in front of his French catholic parents! He respects and defends my pronouns and has even told me he does not care how I identify, as long as I stay the same personality he will still want to be my boyfriend. 

I have never felt joy so pure and it is insane how much I love him."	"That’s so nice to hear, I’m super happy for you. People like your boyfriend sound rare, so it’s always nice to hear other people be comfortable with who they are and who they date no matter what others might think.
Yay I’m happy for you :)
Congrats!! Super happy for you!!!
> I recently broke up with a cishet man who would only ever use she and they pronouns for me in fear of being seen as gay. He didn’t even like me dressing masculine because it was “concerning”…….. 

I'm really happy you found someone who loves you for who you are.

It sounds like that last person just plainly wasn't attracted to your gender but tried to force you to restrict your gender to the parts he was attracted to. That fucking sucks.

You can't make someone who's gender fluid stop being fluid for the sake of your own sexuality and attraction. They are who they are, and you either are down with that or you aren't.

I'm glad you found someone who's down with that.
We've all been with at least one ""but can I still call you my girlfriend?"" guy. I'm glad you found someone who respects you.
aww that's so sweet
That sounds lovely, happy you found each other!
uWu
You sound so very lucky.
Now that’s a good partner right there
Yay!!!! this is so precious to hear
Yes go you!!!
That is so sweet! Happy for you :).
Omg, the ""I don't care how you identify, as long as your personality stays the same"" is a really good way to put that. I had someone say something like that to me. I hope we get back together once the rough times are over. He would even use they/them pronouns for me around his family, and if he didn't wanna explain it, he just wouldn't (his attitude was that it didn't matter if they questioned it, though he was worried his family wouldn't get it and wouldn't accept me anymore, we spent a lot of time at his house). Now, even though we barely see each other anymore because he's busy at school and work, he is trying to use my chosen name, which is something I was worried about, because when I talked to him about changing it before, he said it would feel weird and he wasn't sure he could adjust to the change (not the best thing to hear, I know). But now he's trying and I really appreciate it, and he was really happy for me when I changed my name legally, and really supportive when I talked to him about my parents having issues with calling me by it."	r3e8zh	NonBinary	435	0.99	2021-11-27 14:06:47

33 Non-binary, feeling sad today, my boomer parents (I’ve been out to since January) said they can never use my name/pronouns because they are an attack on God’s Kingdom... no shade on religion please, just need some support and encouragement.		"I’m really sorry to hear that, god loves you no matter who you are, god loves you because you are you. I’m proud of you for coming out to them even if they don’t accept you. We will. Feel free to talk to me any time, we’re here for you.
I'm sorry your parents aren't accepting of you. You'll always have a family in the nonbinary community, though

P.S. you cute as hell and total goals
I’m usually a lurker but this connected with me. I know how much it sucks when the people who’ve raised you and are supposed to provide you unconditional support fail to do just that - know that you’re not alone and sometimes the bravest thing you can do is to just keep on living as your true self unapologetically. Sending good vibes your way.
Hey, I'm 22, amab, I love God, and still living at home. I'm out to my immediate family except my dad. My mom isn't supportive. I jokingly (only partially a joke) asked if I looked pretty one night after coming out and she said ""well, that is not a word I'd use to describe my **son.**""

I still love God, I know that he still loves me, and I know that there is nothing wrong with me. And for tou that goes double. You're not alone out there. Mad respect.

Hope this helped.
I can really empathize with how difficult this situation is. I'm thinking about you.
Galatians 3:28, ""There is neither Jew nor Greek, there is neither slave nor free man, there is neither male nor female; for you are all one in Christ Jesus."" I'm sorry that your situation is what it is. You're valid, and you have the support of every single one of us.
Ugh, I wish I could send a hug, (one of those really solid ones, you know?). I don't get my pronouns used by my family either, and my mother has a huge stigma about my transition.

Are you from Canada too?
I feel. My SO's family indirectly (I'm not out as anything to them- straight passing) called me an ""abomination against God and nature."" 

You heckin cute.
Sending positive vibes. 💙 Remember that you're valid, no matter what.
I'm sorry they're like that. I'm 19 and I came out to my mom a few years ago. She never cared about my sexuality cuz shes not exactly straight but it took her some time to get the pronouns. Her excuse was that when she was learning german she got made fun of misgendering things I guess? Idk

Anyway, now she says the right ones. 

You are valid
An act of love, compassion, and respect can NEVER be a threat to a God whose entire shtick is based foundationally on those things. I'm sorry for the intolerance you're facing, by people so close to you. You are so, so loved, you are so incredibly valuable, and you deserve every good thing. I hope you are holding it together despite everything. We are here for you.
sending love your way <3
You’re very courageous and I’m sorry they are reacting that way now. I’m too scared to come out to my parents and I’m about your age, you’re braver than I am. I don’t know if they’d hate my gender or sexuality more....
Play this for them.

https://youtu.be/nRAyImFXW_Y
I'm right there with ya. I recently decided to cut my parents out because of it (and some other things) until I felt they were willing to see me as I am, but I know that's not for everybody. If'n ya need some good scripture to know that you're loved and affirmed by the creator, regardless of gender, Galatians 3:28 is a good one. 
Just know that you're fearfully and wonderfully made and you have a huge family of queer folks here supporting you. I'm sorry your family of origin is working from some bad theology. I know how that feels to not only be told who you are is an affront to ""gods kingdom"" and that it's a choice that negates any claim you have in their eyes to a relationship with God. Please know that's some bullshit, and we're here for you.
I just wanted to let you know that God loves all His children and nothing can change that. if you are still open to Christianity I invite you to join r/GayChristians and r/OpenChristian .
*virtual hugs* Please never give up on being who you really are, the world is better with you showing your true self!
You are not an attack on God's kingdom.  He sent His son to die for every human on this planet- yourself included, because he loves you more than anything.  He wouldn't create you just to damn you to hell, and I will beat up anyone who tells you otherwise.


-A demiboy who has been struggling with his church for a while
If god had a problem with you, he would have made you different, but he didn't.  Your parents are wrong. Do something nice for yourself today, fam. You deserve to be well and feel well.
I'm sorry to hear, friend. Hopefully, you have people around that will respect you for you. Find them and keep them close. Love and light ❤️
I'm sorry. Just want to send support from one 30-something NB to another. You were brave to come out to them and staying true to yourself, no one can take that away.

Omg thank you!!
Thank you so much. ❤️
It really does. Thank you.

A few weeks ago I went out in public presenting fully femme & answering to my girl name & she/her pronouns for the first time ever and it was possibly the best night of my life		"Love your Baphomet top! Ave Satanas 🍷
Proud of you😊
You look so cute!!!!
Gah, I can't get over how happy you look!! I'm so glad you're you 💜

you look amazing! really gives me the chilling adventures of sabrina (I think that's what its called  lmao) vibes
You're adorable!! Glad it was a good night!
You are very strong and very brave and I am so proud of you.
Thank you! It's a dress, though you can't see that from the angle. Ave Satanas 🍷
I was sooooo happy (eventually - at first I was terrified!). It was the first time I truly, 100% felt like a girl and it was blissful.

Pronouns! In! Space!		"If that expression is not a mood. Surprised the universal translator didn't give the more accurate translation that would be more along the lines of ""Use my pronouns or say goodbye to your kneecaps idiot.""
Is this from Star Trek discovery? Or?
Appreciate the acknowledgement of our existence, but this felt sort of half assed. I’d be totally fine with a retcon where the universal translator gets it right from now on instead of trying to (poorly) explain why nbs have been virtually absent from Trek for 50 years
oh my heart :))
Yeah l really liked that they actually addressed this straight on. No bullshit. No Hollywood ‘implied’ nonsense. Just ‘I’ve never felt like a girl’ and ‘please use they or them from now on’. 

Not only do we have a non binary character, they are normalizing the use of ‘they/them’ pronouns and the crews easy acceptance of them as well. 

May not be a major plot point of the show, but folks, when non binary people show up on major television programs demanding correct pronouns be used.... it’s a sign that non binary folks are finally penetrating the wider public’s awareness. 

That’s a big deal. 

Also, this show also has pansexual characters as well as one of the most realistic (and touching) gay relationships I’ve seen on screen.
It’s kinda weird how they didn’t do this from the start. They were called she for like three episodes before this. And it kinda implies that, not only in the future, but in the FUTURE future (there’s time travel in the show), people *still* have to explain non binary to each other :(
Adira Tal ❤️❤️❤️
What show/movie is this??
The character is human, so no universal translation needed... Besides, they were closeted to all but their dead boyfriend... so it's not like it's his fault for not realizing their pronouns.
Discovery. And Idk what episode but I will binge until I get here
The way I see it, no retcon is necessary, it's not like star trek didn't have non binary characters before.. They had whole non binary species, before the concept of non binary humans really became a thing here in the real world.. According to the info I have come across..

Star Trek had non binary before we did.... how's that for being fucking progressive :) It's part of why I will always be a Trekkie.
The actor said in an interview that their delay in coming out in the show was because they did not feel comfortable doing so until they had come out to their family.
Star Trek Discovery, latest episode (s3e08)
I was mostly kidding of course. Have not even watched Star Trek discovery in full. Just thought this expression on this particular screencap just looked wonderfully pissed of and easy enough to take out of context.
3x08 the latest one. Just watched it.
Ehh as much as I do like “The Outcast” and probably look on it more favorably than many other trans folks do, it wasn’t non-binary representation so much as representation of the experience of a single transgender person among an agendered species (played by a cis woman as a cis woman with a hetero interest in Riker to boot). I don’t consider that to be great non-binary representation. It’s a nice overture to some kind of understanding and representation, but other than the Trill stuff we’ve really gotten zero developments in terms of trans inclusion for decades. 

Trek has always been forward thinking for its time, but the fact remains that nb representation wasn’t considered in a real way until very recently and even now that representation is limited. This is the first time we’ve seen an nb crew member, and instead of pretending we’ve had them before, and that the universal translator just isn’t built to be inclusive, I feel it would be better writing going forward to have just have everyone respecting the they/them pronouns automatically via the translator as part of the dialogue. No commentary necessary.

If they really wanted a moment of tension between characters to do commentary on pronouns, then do that more intentionally in a scenario where the translator isn’t working or it’s clearly an intentional act by the other character to be transphobic. Instead, IMO, this just kinda left a plot hole where now we have a universal translator that isn’t inclusive and I’m left wondering when that, if ever, will be addressed. But tbh I’m real high maintenance about weak writing like this and it’s far from my biggest complaint in Disco, nvm all of Trek
Ahhh cool cool then
Thank you!!
It's not like they really had any real world examples of non binary culture to work with. Sure they could have gone full blown invent an innovation (communicators, datapads)  and invented non binary culture themselves..... but did anyone on star trek really have any right to? They had to wait for us to invent ourselves before they could incorporate it into the show.

This is the first person Adira came out to.... This isn't some fully hatched out and proud non binary character we're talking about here... This is the first squeak of emergence from the closet..... and to top it off, THE ACTOR was only coming out about being enby AS they were making the episode.. So sure this could have been more encapsulating... But perhaps they're not trying to simply make this about pronouns... perhaps they're trying to cover the whole experience. The experience of first coming out, and the development and progress that all of us are currently are going through..

because how fucking amazing would that be? the WHOLE enby experience hoisted onto a pedestal by fucking star trek?
I guess I just find the idea that humanity is *just now learning* to accept and fully understanding non-binary folks hundreds of years in the future when we can flash across the galaxy in the blink of an eye depressing. I’m glad you enjoy it, and I’m so glad they’re treating the actor with respect and weaving their coming out into the story, but I don’t find it to be very good writing or overly validating for me.

Then again, it is my experience as a nb person that the less commentary on my gender the better. My dream is for it to be no more significant than a person just being a cis and the idea it would even still need to be any kind of discussion a hundred years from now makes me so sad. I’m sure they’ll get there later in the season but this bit of writing didn’t do it for me personally.
I agree. Star Trek is supposed to show a future where things are better (economy, gender equality, technology...) and it people still have to explain non binary to each other while being not only in the future but after *time traveling* to the FUTURE FUTURE, it doesn’t seem to bode well."	k5vuzt	NonBinary	422	0.99	2020-12-03 11:55:07
Can you be Non-binary and have an incredibly gendered style?	"I don't mean to be disrespectful with this question, it's a sincere wish to be educated.

A little background : where I work we have signatures on emails which also state our pronouns below our names. One of my colleagues has them/they under their signature, so obviously that's how I address them, I'm not a d**k. I have met several Non-binary clients, and they seemed have a very non-gendered style of dress. My colleague however has a very feminine style, with hair extensions, false eyelashes and nails and always wears dresses/skirts, even in winter. Obviously, as someone who isn't Non-binary, it's difficult for my stupid brain to get my head around accentuating very feminine features of they don't feel completely feminine. Can somebody take pity on me and help me understand?

I would have asked them, but obviously I don't want to be rude and it seems like an intrusive question. It's none of my business after all. I just thought reddit was somewhere that people ask questions! 😂 I tried the askreddit thread but was told to post the question elsewhere. I hope it's okay to ask here. Thank you 😊"	"Yes. While ""androgynous"" and ""genderfuck"" are how most people would try to dress to ""appear nonbinary"" (something plenty of nonbinary people, myself included, want to do), at the core of the issue, clothing should not be gendered. A man wants to wear a skirt/dress? Cool. A woman wants to wear traditionally masculine clothes? Good for her (though not as much of a ""statement"" in today's society given traditionally masculine clothes are seen as more universal). A nonbinary person wants to wear literally anything that isn't ""unisex""? Awesome. Hell, even just finding a style that can be labeled androgynous or genderfuck is hard for a lot of people, I unfortunately look rather feminine to most people so me wearing ""girly"" clothes is just me dressing how people expect, and my usual more masc style is just seen as ""tomboy"" fashion, ideally I would look like a man in a dress because that's what I really like stylistically (also dresses are SO much easier for formal events, I had to go buy pants today because my old formal pants are damaged and I don't even know how, but as a chubby short person, men's pants are hard to find, they're either way too tight or way too long and the women's section makes me too dysphoric and I'm still short for women's formal pants, but because I look feminine, I am not intending to wear a dress for formal occasions yet), which is more genderfuck, but my point is, don't gender clothes, anyone can wear anything regardless of gender.
It's possible they are a woman who prefers they/them pronouns over she/her, and it's also possible they're non-binary who feels more comfortable with a feminine style.

Men are able to dress femininely, and women are able to dress masculinely, right? Then, non-binary people should be able to dress femininely or masculinely too.
A lot of the confusion may start to unravel itself when you start to understand that gender =/= sex =/= expression. These three aspects are related, but they're not necessarily inherently and inseparably linked, yeah? 

Men can dress and act femininely, but they're still men, and women can act and dress masculinely and still be women, and the same is true of non-binary folk. It all comes down to how the individual identifies. I myself have a feminine slant to my style, I love the color pink, I make no effort to hide my curves, my hips, etc. but I still identify as neither a man or a woman, to trim things down. 

At the end of the day, you don't need to put so much pressure on yourself to understand, just do your best to be respectful and trust that your coworker knows themself well enough to identify the way that they do. I myself found that when I started here, and accepted things that seemingly contradicted each other, the more I found myself understand it, and by extension, my own identity.
""Can you be non binary and..."" yes. The answer is yes, there are no requirements for being non binary
My boss is a valid enby who uses they/them pronouns. They are 60, wear only suits n ties, look exactly like a basic businessman. What u wear or how others view your presentation doesn’t change your gender nor who you are.
Nonbinary people do not owe anyone androgyny. Lots of enbies choose to look androgynous, but it isn’t necessary.

Also, not everyone who uses they/them pronouns is nonbinary.
Gender is not about gender expression. It’s why tomboys and femboys (the feminine guy kind) exist, and aren’t any less of their gender simply because they present in a gender non-conforming way. 

If you saw a man, who was clearly and openly a binary man, wearing a dress, would that make him a woman? If the answer is no, then consider this case of a non-binary individual who wears dresses, makeup, and nail decor. Would this make their gender any less non-binary?

(If you answered yes to the first hypothetical, I’d implore you to reconsider your definitions of gender and gender expression and what benefit you get from placing these expectations on other people)

That being said, pronouns also do not inherently facilitate gender. So it’s entirely possible that this could be a binary woman who prefers they/them pronouns, or a non-binary woman (as non-binary is a spectrum and people can fall anywhere on it, including leaning towards a binary gender while still being non-binary) who feels euphoria from feminine presentation but uses they/them pronouns as their pronoun set. 

Whatever the case, just know that presentation ≠ gender, and gender identity is so much more complex than physical appearance. If it helps, maybe try looking at clothing as exactly what it is, rather than a gender additive. Rather than “women’s clothes”, it’s simply a dress, longer hair, and makeup/cosmetics. It’s an appearance, not an identity.
To put it simply, yea you can. At the end of the day your gender is nothing more then an identity and some people feel more comfortable when dressed certain ways. Like look at it this way, when I get dressed everyday I tend to dress in an androgynous style but if I’m dressing up for something important I tend to dress very feminine. That doesn’t mean I’m a girl then, I’m still non binary but I prefer dressing feminine for important things. It doesn’t change my gender for a period of time so it doesn’t change someone’s gender if they do it all the time. They prefer dressing feminine but aren’t a girl. The way they dress is just a style and nothing more.

Hope that helps 😊
gender is not presentation. im a trans man and i alternate between very feminine and very masculine styles of dress depending on what i feel like that particular day. its very possible for someone to be nonbinary and also enjoy very masculine or very feminine aesthetics
Yes.  Gender presentation and gender identity aren't the same thing.
I am a nonbinary, but physically I am overweight and masculine in general. For me its more an emotional connection...or disconnection depending how you view things.  I dabble in androgyny and feminine stuff, but my life is filled with fairly conservative coworkers and I live in a very conservative area. As such I just kinda exist buying the cheapest clothes, cause unisex/hoodies etc dont give a damn about style and mens pants sizes are more...easy for me to find my size.  


In a perfect world, no money worries and no people issues...yeah I might go with a style. But I am content emotionally and have 0 problem just looking male
i identify as non-binary and i have a very feminine style. ironically, before i came out my style was a lot more masculine. i think letting go of the pressure of gender norms allowed me to explore my aesthetic without restrictions. just remember that gender identity and gender expression are 2 different things and often don’t match up.
Gender presentation ≠ Pronouns
Gender presentation ≠ Gender identity
Gender identity ≠ Pronouns

All of these are not mutually exclusive, and can lean in one way or another or not at all.
[removed]
Work can be difficult. Other people have great answers about presentation being different from one's gender identity

Now with someone you know at work you only see one slice of their life. You do not know how they might present in other environments. Work has the pressure to be professional and there are usually dress codes. They might be dressing the best way they know how to and still have a professional presentation for what their job is. Wearing a dress or skirt seems like they be in a more professional setting or in management? I don't know their motives, but everyone who wants to do well at work wants to dress well to be accepted and respected. Being publicly non-binary is already a potential risk for their workplace position. Again, the exact workplace and the people there makes a huge difference on how risky it would be to have your workplace know you are non-binary. Stepping outside the norm is always risky. If they decided to wear a more masculine outfit they would still probably be questioned

Personally, I wore pink sneakers instead of blue sneakers one day at work and people asked why I wasn't wearing the normal blue sneakers. It never occurred to me anyone would notice or ask about my shoes. It's just sneakers. I can sympathize why someone might dress in ""comformance"" at work just to hopefully avoid being questioned
Thank you for asking here! It’s so nice that you respect them and understand it isn’t their job to educate you!!

Clearly excellent answers have already been given, but I just wanted to say: this is how to be a better ally. We don’t expect you to know everything! Just listen to people, respect them as equals and ask questions in appropriate places :)
by now of course you’ve already received plenty of sufficient answers to your question, but i figured i’d put in my two cents and give a perspective to why, as an AFAB enby, i often prefer feminine clothes.

when i first came out, i loved dressing androgynously and masc. so much gender euphoria came with breaking my barrier of wearing feminine clothes only. but when the initial “wow! i can do this!” mentality had worn off i realized i still loved a lot of feminine styles- tank crops and shorts, short skirts (i have religious trauma with long ones lol), and traditionally feminine color choices. 


while there are multiple reasons, the biggest reason i dress feminine more often lately is because i’m trying to become more comfortable with my body. i feel like, gender aside, i shouldn’t feel like hiding parts of myself- whether that be my chest, my chubby stomach, or my thigh stretch marks. it’s all a part of me and i refuse to let people define my beauty off of anything but just plain me. no two people are the same, so why are so many people trying to follow the same standards? bodies are natural. let them look that way.

in terms of gender, i feel the same. natural bodies shouldn’t have to be concealed for one’s gender to be valid.

sorry for the long rant, but i hope this perspective (which is mine only! your coworker could and probably does have completely different reasons) can help some gender associative questions you may have. much love!
My question is why does it matter? Is it happening rn? Then it's possible. It's not like there's laws about how non binary people can dress. Ppl are gonna wear whatever they want
Yes you can! Im a non-binary who enjoys wearing crop tops, short shorts, skirts, I just say I’m a “femboy” when I do it
to make a long fucking story short; yes, of course
Easiest way to understand imo is like separate gender identity from gender expression. One of the comments mentioned how some cis people and binary trans people use they/them and some non binary people use strictly she/her or he/him because that’s a form of expression. Same way mostly women wear dresses, but the act of wearing a dress does not inherently make one a woman.
Completely possible; I am one! I was raised as a girl so I got very used to/inclined towards feminine stuff. I just like girly things so I use and wear them. I have a pink bob and regularly do my makeup and wear clothing that many women would choose for themselves, but I’m still non-binary. (:
The style you described, while it is often worn by women, it is not at all naturally feminine. Women who wear a similar style to your nonbinary coworker don't just look that way, it takes a lot of time, skill, and effort. Think about it, women don't look that way because they are women, they look that way because they taught themselves how to style their body. Men look that way too when they like that style and learn how to do it. Some nonbinary people feel the most uncomfortable with how people view them based on their natural features and some tend to favor a presentation where they have more creative control over how they express themselves. They probably just like the style ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
Thanks for being respectful of you colleague and also for being curious about aspects of gender that you haven't thought about before! You seem like a cool person OP!
Hi! AFAB Non-binary person here who *adores* dressing up in a very “feminine” style— It’s different for everybody, but for me there is something so, like, gender euphoria-related when I dress and accessorize like people societally may assume I would but still know deeply within my heart that I am not a woman? There’s a power in that for me— it’s almost like I’m reclaiming the fashion and style I was forced to grow up with and still being me, and that’s a big ol’ “fuck you!” to gender assumptions. Like, the satisfaction I feel when I’m dressed to the nines and all done up and get to say, “Hi, I’m ___, my pronouns are they/them!” is nearly godlike. If that doesn’t make sense I apologize, just my experience as somebody who, from what you described, presents similarly to your coworker.
Yes
Absolutely!
Yes. Presentation does not equal gender. Just like there are feminine cis men, masculine cis women... Nonbinary people can present however they want, it does not affect their gender.
I call myself “masc non binary”. I do vibe with the non binary label, but I mostly use he/him pronouns and I dress very masc. 

I am non binary, but in a masculine way
The way I like to explain it is that someone's gender is different from gender expression/presentation. I'm nonbinary and I range from usually dressing rather plain to dressing fairly fem. It's how I express myself.

Men dress in feminine clothing and women dress in masculine clothing all the time.

The easiest example is probably the ""tomboy"" girl. She's a girl, but dresses more traditionally masc because that's what she likes. Doesn't make her less of a girl because she dresses differently.

I hope that makes sense. And thank you so much for asking! I'm always 100% in support of someone wanting to learn about something they don't understand
Non-binary does not mean they have to wear an androgynous style! An enby can wear fully masculine or fully feminine clothing and still be non-binary and use they/them!
I'm nonbinary and present very fem, my pronouns are They / She. However presentation does not equal gender.
It’s definitely normal! I’m non-binary and AFAB, but I still dress exactly like I did before I started using they/them pronouns and identifying as non-binary. 

To most people when they first meet me, they just assume I’m a woman and that I use she/her pronouns (unless they ask first). How you dress isn’t always correlated to how you feel about your gender.
An important concept is that gender *identity* is distinct from and need not be aligned with gender *expression*. Clothing and pronouns are all part of gender expression. Just as there are gender nonconforming he/him butch cis lesbians, there are gender conforming nonbinary people who may dress and use the pronouns of a binary gender.

[Genderbread Person v4.0 Poster](https://www.genderbread.org/resource/genderbread-person-v4-0-poster) helped me.
Yes
Yes
It's all good, but pronouns do not necessarily dictate someone's gender, and anyone of any gender can express themselves in any way. Gender is a label of how an individual see's themselves, and their style and expression is how they appear to others. Pronouns are how that person is referred to by others when being talked about in the third person. All quite different things, but in many cultures strict gender roles have consolidated these things together. Not everyone will fit cleanly into any cultures arbitrary gender roles, so the only way to understand everyone is to disconnect all of these loosely related things and realize that anyone can have any combination of any of them at the same time, and truly feel that way about themselves :)
Yes of course. I always wear a skirt and I'm not a woman...I think-
Gender identity and aesthetic are totally seperate
Yup! There is no ""uniform"" for nonbinary people. Just as men who wear skirts and dresses are still men, just as women who wear suits and pants are still women, nonbinary people are nonbinary regardless of what they choose to wear.
feminine nonbinary people are still nonbinary! i connect with femininity completely but i'm still not a cis woman because that identity makes me feel deeply uncomfortable and unseen. nonbinary just means that you don't fully connect with the idea of being only a man or only a woman. but there's a lot of room for nuance within that definition! being nonbinary is not always a completely neutral, non-gendered experience
I’m non-binary with a really weird style. I wear tons and tons of makeup bc I’m self conscious and insecure. However, I tend to dress in either androgynous clothes or “masc appearing” clothes. My reasoning is that everything is internal. I never felt comfortable with my assigned gender. I never felt like it was “me.” She/her pronouns make me feel so uncomfortable and weird— like something isn’t right. It’s super weird to explain. What I’m getting at is that they might be feeling the same way. I’m also agreeing with what others said. Clothes and makeup shouldn’t be gendered. Perhaps, that’s one of many things that triggers dysphoria. Everything has its own connotations, normally universally accepted, too.
You can absolutely be nonbinary and have whatever style you want.

In my case, I would enjoy a more gender neutral style, but I can't afford to experiment right now. Everything I get is from thrift stores and just makes me look different degrees of femme, even male clothes. Good binders are expensive and top surgery is out of the question at the moment.

Besides that, I've been going through a phase where I'm less dysphoric and more willing to express myself in traditionally feminine ways. Sometimes it makes me think I was faking the nonbinary thing and I'm actually just a cis woman who hated their body. But then I remind myself that that's just exclusionary bullshit and try to push the thought away.
Yes any person can wear anything they want and it’s none of your business. (I don’t mean this rudely though it sounds quite terse).
Well, short answer, Yes! Absolutely! The hole point in saying your non-binary is that you don’t fit in with exactly the stereotype for men or women, you can wear suits, dresses, shorts, pants, anything because clothing doesn’t have a gender! If they feel more comfortable wearing femme styled clothing they can! If they wanted to wear more masc clothing they could do that to! It doesn’t matter, they can still be non-binary if they wear clothes that fit a gender stereotype! In fact I’m non-binary but I wear masc clothes, but I’m still a they/them! Also keep in mind Pronouns ≠ Gender, meaning they can be a cis woman but just preferring they/them pronouns! Or they can be a cis Man, it doesn’t matter, as long as they are comfortable it’s perfectly fine!
I'm non-binary and also dress very feminine most of the time. It's possible that's how your colleague wants to present at work and that they dress differently outside of work. I dress and present feminine all the time because I'm not out to my parents and I live with them. There's also trans masc non-binary people (one of my friends is, he uses he/they pronouns and presents exclusively masculine). I'm sure there are people who do that with feminine presentation as well. Another thing, clothes don't have a gender, society does. It really just depends on how the person feels about it. There's this saying going around on TikTok ""non-binary people don't owe you androgyny"" that I feel answers your question pretty well. I just elaborated a bit because it could be seen as rude. The only way to really know how your colleague feels is to ask them, they might like to explain, they might not. I think coming to Reddit was a good thing to do for just generally education though. Also you're not stupid, you've been socialized to see that presentation as feminine and associate that with she/her. It takes a while to unlearn that.
You don’t owe anyone androgynous clothing. Clothes don’t have a gender and gender expression is different from gender identity. That being said, unfortunately in society most people will see “feminine” or “masculine” clothes. So you may want to add a pronoun badge or maybe try and mix in some more androgynous aesthetics. Otherwise just own it and ignore other people if you can!
There's not a certain style you need to have to count as ""Nonbinary"", clothing does not have gender! ( I do believe in masculine and feminine clothes though but not gendered clothing)   
While androgynous is commoningly worn by gender-neutral/nonbinary people it's not the style they need to follow!
Yes.
Gender and how you dress your body aren't inherently linked.

Clothing is just cloth. It doesn't mean anything, doesn't say anything, it's just cloth we wear so we're not naked.
I like OP. They're here to learn. Good on ya
Didn’t need to read the rest, read the title and yes. You can be NB and be more fem or masc. The cover  doesn’t represent the whole book.
yes they can. clothes don't equal gender - you can be a man and wear feminine outfits (like skirts), and you can be a woman and wear masculine clothes. so naturally, you can be non-binary and wear feminine/masculine clothes.

most nonbinary people prefer an androgynous style, but there's plenty who don't. personally, i like to shop in the men's section and wear mostly masculine clothes.
Or very feminine AND or masculine. I have strong expression most days and often I require a balance I.e girl bra under business shirt. Boy bra under floral shirt.
Yeah, absolutely.

I can understand that it's hard to unlearn the association between presentation (how someone dresses) and gender (what they are) but there isn't actually any intrinsic connection between the two.

Me for example, anyone on the street would probably read me as a guy, even if i have some articles of clothing that would traditionally be feminine. The sad truth is that we have to contend with preconceptions based on our appearance due to this, like it or not. The point is there *shouldn't* be a preconception due to that, so everyone working on themselves to reckognize that and who tries not to fall into this thinking, helps.
Yes.

Fashion doesn't equal gender.

If it did, then gender would be entirely defined by clothing.
Absolutely!! You’d look at me automatically assume i identify as female. I have long hair, i wear makeup, i like dresses and skirts. I just generally look very feminine. I like the way i look in all these things and that’s why i wear them. However i am not at all emotionally connected to being a female, so i call myself nonbinary. I have no desire to limit or label myself so i am nonbinary. Short answer: yes, as someone that is nonbinary yet very feminine, this is totally okay. Hope this helps, let me know if you have any more questions!!
Yes. You can wear whatever the fuck you want and look however you want. You have only yourself to answer to. It's all just clothing and makeup anyway.
i'm the opposite of your coworker, i'm nonbinary with a full beard and typical ""dudebro"" style, so yes, we come in all shapes and sizes! thank you for taking the time to ask this :)
For me it is easier to connect to my feminine side since I started identifying as agender because I can just sort of wear whatever I feel like instead of having to worry about how I’m seen from the outside. They can present themselves however they like, clothes have no gender 💛
They/them pronouns does not automatically equal non-binary. Pronouns do not equal gender.
Well yes. Just because one doesn't feel like they are male or female, doesn't mean they can't like certain gendered things. Or the fact they might not see them as gendered at all. Most 'female' fashion started as men fashion statements of status.  Be it names, clothes, etc. 

Take me for example. During the fall, spring or winter (any time with cooler weather) I wear pants to work with vary tops. (wish I had more masc like tops that looked good on me) However during the summer since it is so hot I wear nothing but dresses to keep cool. Yeah I wear shorts under them, but still dresses. And my coworkers praise it for temperature wear. They know I am non-binary and don't say much about the genderness of it to them, but if they like the dress.

So yeah, a person can be non-binary without being dressed like a cross between male or female. Then is also the possibility that the person might not feel fully align with male or female, but sorta feel align. as Non-binary is a spectrum, you can have people on any part of the spectrum.
Yeah definitely. There are no rules.
Absolutely. I think I need to reframe how I look at clothing. It's obvious now you've pointed it out! 😂 Thank you 😊
This! I just came to terms with being ENBY and one day I can wear androgynous clothing, ie, hoodies flannel etc, and the next I can wear my other clothes that are more tight fitting. Long as I have my swim tank to use as a binder I am all good.
[deleted]
Thank you, that makes perfect sense.
This describes me !
Thank you 😊
The only exception would be, in my opinion:

-identify fully with your gender assigned at birth
Agreed in our community there is no rules except “if you identify with your sex at birth you aren’t non-binary”
Nice to see a boomer who hasn’t give in to Christofascism. Tell your boss they are awesome.
Yes! I am a nonbinary person, who uses they/them, who dresses in what others might consider a “fem style”. However, clothes do not have gender and I choose items by the way I feel that day! Nonbinary does not equal androgyny!
Thank you, I will. Thanks to everyone for your replies, they're very informative and helpful.
Thank you!
I’m convinced womens pants sizes are intentionally designed to be unbearable. They’re inconsistent, they make no sense, they aren’t based on anything measureable, and stores don’t like to stock anything above extra small. So its not just you, if that helps.
Not to mention why does “female”
Clothing have to be so damn short these days?! It annoys me when my Christofascist mother says dress more presentable, like Mom, seriously, I love feminine clothes,  but it is fucking impossible to find girl clothes these days that don’t show everything. That’s why I don’t wear them and prefer to fly under the radar and be androgynous.
Yeah, while it may or may not be true, it's also something that occurred to me. If I already had women's work clothes, and they are kind of expensive, and came out at nonbinary, I might ask for the recognition at work with my pronouns and keep wearing the same things. Would I wear make-up and do my nails in ways that go with my work attire? Probably. If I didn't, I'd just look less ""done"" or professional.

Personally, if I wanted a ""new look"" that was either fluid or more androgynous, I'd buy after hours clothes.
Very true. I've worked with them for a number of years and kind of wondered about it. It doesn't matter at all, it was just something I was curious about so thought I'd ask in an effort to educate myself.
It does make sense, thank you 😊
This is a great question. I’m AFAB and like dresses more for utilitarian freeness and air flow I get during the summer. I only like particular dresses though. I’m in a wedding next year and decided that I can’t accept doing the bridespeople dress mostly because they are sooooo femme and I wouldn’t feel comfortable or confident in it. So nuanced but it’s just how my brain works
Its also worth noting that in a professional setting, a) being perceived as genderweird in any way can limit your prospects and b) if they’re afab wearing makeup and skirts and eyelashes and whatnot may literally make a difference in their paycheck. There’ve been studies that show that women who wear makeup, controlled for other factors, make more money across a lot of industries. Your coworker may present differently in their off time.
> “That won’t magically erase hundreds of years of gender coding for clothing”

Gender stereotypes and clothing styles are actually less rigid than you think, and have changed a lot throughout the centuries. Actually, the example you used isn’t hundreds of years old, actually less than a hundred years ago [pink was considered a boy’s colour, and blue was for girls](https://www.thevintagenews.com/2019/05/01/pink-blue/amp/).

So it might be worth taking the time to rethink these “gender norms” and how society’s way of framing the issue currently makes it sound like they’re cultural norms passed down for centuries when really, they’re just arbitrary colours assigned to clothing, often for convenience or aesthetic
I didn't say they aren't gendered, I said they shouldn't be gendered. Society genders clothes arbitrarily, the colors used to be flipped, none of it is set in stone, and all the gendering of clothes should be scrapped.
That is when you ask for gender neutral colors like yellow, orange, green etc. i never want kids and if I still was interested in them that would be the kind of colors I go with.
Glad to help!
Glad it describes you!
Fully, exclusively, consistently, I'd say 

As a nod to all the genderfluids and multigender peeps, who want to but didn't feel like they were included. 

Possibly also another exception, if we're talking about being specifically nonbinary, rather than generally trans: 

-identify fully, exclusively, consistently as the other binary gender to your assignment at birth
The Christo-fascist boomers didn’t kill ALL their LGBTQ peers. There’s still some boom-aged queers alive. The old ones who survived their violently bigoted peer group are the most hardcore queers you’ll ever meet!

Been Nonbinary for a long time and played lots of video games, but for some reason, being given this option and seeing my pronouns used just tore me up inside. 🤍🤍		"Game is Grow: Song of the Evergreen on Switch. Beautiful game!
It's nice seeing your existence recognized in media
this is the first time i’ve seen a neutral gender option in a video game and i honestly started to tear up about it!!
I'm going to buy this game just to feel what it's like to be acknowledged as my actual gender/with my preferred pronouns.

Thank you so much for sharing. 💜
This is why the videogame i'm mkaing  is not going to have a gender for the character!
Eee that’s awesome! I just start playing FFXIV and love it, except I’ve never been so aggressively gendered, not even in real life lol

Like, I know it’s my character and not ME, but why can’t my “designed as enby as possible” character get neutral pronouns and titles? Go Grow: Song of the Evertree for showing it’s totally possible!
I'll have to give this one a try. 
I recommend Pyre and 2064: Read Only Memories, both games let you choose they/them pronouns for your player character. 2064 also lets you use custom pronouns :)
Dude, I cry literally every time.
Did they add a nonbinary option? I only remember there being 2 on release
OMG right tho, I recently had my first game give me a gender-neutral option and I broke down in tears Legends of Idleon it's a free crappy idle RPG phone game and you really can't tell but it still makes me happy knowing that it gave me the choice
I still find it difficult sometimes that most games only offer one or the other, and end up picking one based on the type of game then changing all the dialogue pronouns in my head.
Wildermyth has a nonbinary option too, it's really awesome to see representation becoming more common!
I've been reading that it's sort of an improved version of ACNH. Is that about right do you think? You been enjoying it? 

Almost certainly getting it just because of the gender options, but it also seems like a game I could sink a fair bit of time into.
Boyfriend dungeon is another great game with options like this, as is monster prom. Boyfriend dungeon is like Hades and pretty good actually.
Scarlet Hollow actually has a gender neutral option too! :)
Gosh I'm having this experience in Pokemon: Legends Arceus 😭 It feels like every sentence they shove in a pronoun.
Yess I was just about to suggest pyre! I struggled to get into the mechanics, but I love supergiant games so I need to give it another try
Oh also monster prom! You can choose your character's name and pronouns, urgh makes me so happy
I've only had the time to get about 3 hours into it so far, but I am absolutely loving it! The graphics are lacking a tiny bit but the characters and story well make up for it.

I don't know if I'd compare it to ACNH, but I suppose the wholesomeness is comparable. I absolutely recommend it!
I'm currently on a Supergiant Games binge after playing Hades (they/them character in that game too :D) and I thought I would like Pyre the least but I think I like it almost as much as Hades. Give it another chance, if you hate the sports aspect I think you can just turn it off/have easy mode. The story is great!!
My partner's been playing it since release because she loved the studio's previous game so much (Yonder: The Cloud Catcher Chronicles). Definitely wouldn't say it's like ACNH but would strongly recommend it if you like ACNH and/or Stardew Valley.
Hades is utter perfection, I didn't realise there was a non-binary character though! How dare I, haha. And all the songs just urgh, as if it could get any more perfect.
I'll definitely give pyre another chance! Supergiants stories and graphics and music and basically everything has me set on making sure I don't miss it!

Hi I’m Jaylah and I use they/them pronouns but I feel like I look “too” feminine. Any tips to help me look a little more masculine? 🥰		"besides the obvious “try a new haircut” options- you can try filling in your eyebrows more, wearing “masculinizing” makeup, or even try out new clothes. could even put your hair up in a “man bun” or pull it back in some way to make your look more masculine 

all this said- you’re just as much non-binary looking how you do now as you would be if you changed anything. so, don’t feel you have to in order to be “more valid”. look how you want, have fun with it :)
A few things I do are to put my hair in a bun and mess with my wardrobe a bit. I love cargo pants and hoodies, thats not everyones thing but thats just what I like if youre looking for suggestions. A hack I use if I’m feeling unsure of how to present is pretend im customizing myself as a character in a video game and then take what I have and go for a similar look. I’m flux so sometimes I use this to figure out what my gender is that day, but I feel this is also applicable if you’re looking for a new way to present. Another thing I did was observe people I got gender envy from and then I tried to copy some of their mannerisms. Try experimenting with different things and seeing what you like. 

Another thing I want to point out is that there is no such thing as being “too” feminine or masculine. Theres nothing wrong with presenting completely femme and using she/her pronouns and identifying as nb. Your identity and presentation are your own and are valid no matter what anyone says. At the same time I totally get it if you want a more masc look, but dont feel the need to be more masc because presenting femme doesnt fit someone elses preconceived notion of what enbies look like.
I totally feel wanting to look more androgynous b it just putting it out there, you can’t be too feminine or too masculine looking as a non binary person, you can be both or neither or one of the other
Try using some makeup magic to make your jawline look more stronger, especially towards the base of the jaw bone, angles are what catches the human eye, and more angular jaw lines tend to look more masculine in my opinion




P.S. idk how makeup works I don't do makeup thats why I described it the way I did sorry lol
Obviously, you could cut your hair, but some things that I do are wearing minimal/no/masculinising makeup, and I usually wear big basketball shorts, and maybe a hoodie/big shirt, and maybe a sports bra or something like that underneath if that’s an issue. Also wearing dark colours could help a little. If you don’t want to cut you hair, you could tie it up and then put on a hat/beanie/hoodie to hide the rest, so it just looks shorter. You could also (and I know this sounds weird) draw on facial hair with makeup :). I hope this helps, but also if you like looking feminine, that doesn’t take away anything or make you less valid in any way. Enbys can look feminine, masculine, androgynous, or anything in between, but I totally understand wanting to look more masculine :) hope you have a good day/night <3
Shave your head
Check out some masc folks with long hair on like Pinterest or whatever, and look at styling your outfit more masc. The impact of elongating the appearance of one's torso, and of a hat or glasses worn certain ways, can be surprising.
there's lots of different makeup styles that can help make you look more masculine (I found this one helpful https://youtu.be/XjNMG-h5r1M) also how you dress can help! look out for what masc people your age are wearing and if you like it try incorporating it into your outfits, there are also some brands out there that do masculine clothing for (sorry for gendered phrasing) more feminine body types, the brand Both& is very good however more expensive as it is a small company. ""Mens"" clothing sizes very differently to ""womens"" so its more a case of figuring out what you like and what works for you, for example i wear lots of mens shirts, jumpers, shoes, accessories but still wear women's jeans because I found men's jeans were very unflattering and didn't masculinise my body as much as I had hoped. One other thing that can help is hair, not even cutting it if you don't want to but how you style it, masculine styles are usually more messy and harsh looking as opposed to a softer style (An undercut might allow you to keep length and still look androgynous or something similar to a shoulder length wolf-cut might be nice) anyway hope this helps and good luck! remember that there is no one way to look masculine and its more to do with what's inside and how you feel and if you want to reflect that in your style and gender presentation then that's wonderful!
If you like the longer hair, growing out the bangs is less feminine. I am AFAB and have bangs though, I don't care. My other hair is also shorter than yours though, I don't like it going past my chin, it's like a flapper bob. And already you have the  longer bangs, I think the ones at the eyebrow level are the most girlifying. 

I've done masculinizing contouring makeup and stuck my hair in a cap and I look **just** like my brother when I do that it's kinda freaky.
I just found this app, called faceapp and you can make youself look male, then you can see what you would look like. It is actually pretty realistic, I look like my dad as a guy
I would say you don't need to change your haircut if you don't want to or makeup. Wear some clothes that make your inner masculine feel comfortable.
Bigger nose
You don't have to cut your hair off, but you're always going to be perceived as feminine with it styled like that. Try a high, tight bun. If you're willing to change your hairstyle at all, growing out the bangs is a big one. The bangs are a pretty exclusively feminine haircut. Maybe emphasize the jawline with makeup if that's something you're capable of. Otherwise a binder and a baggy T-shirt goes a long way. 

And testosterone. That's what I went with. Tbh with the freedom of expression women are generally allowed in society, I don't really think it's possible not to be perceived as a woman without deepening your voice or putting on facial hair. I still get ma'am'd with a men's haircut, men's clothes and shoes, and some pretty solid binding. You can do voice training if you want a deeper voice but don't want to/are too young to be on T though.

Anyway, obviously you don't have to change anything about your presentation to *be* nonbinary. But if looking more masc would help you feel more comfortable in yourself or in society, these things might help.
You can be feminine or masculine and still use they/them pronouns
Maybe cut your hair or wear less makeup? Honestly tho, you do you
Honestly, no matter what you look like you’re going to get shit for they them pronouns. It’ll be a constant battle between patients and stating very clear and sassy boundaries. With the way that makes you feel best for yourself to yourself. Fuck society it’s pretty sick right now
Try maybe goin for ""mens"" clothing and I personally perffer baggyer the better cuz it hides the more fem body shape, layers and maybe an undercut? If u want one u don't have to either way ur valid no matter what

Mustache
Don't do it your soooooo cute  as you are
Hi Jaylah (beautiful name too) - I hope you don’t change anything since you’re so beautiful (a real gift) - just tie your hair in a ponytail if needed, but please keep your God-given beautiful look 🙏
In my experience tucking your shirt into your pants makes you look more masculine but I have no real evidence for this.
Hey Jaylah -- I'm coming from the other end of the spectrum (AMAB) and from reading through some of the comments, I just want you to know I get it.  I am pretty masculine presenting, even though I've slowly changed my clothing and hair towards being less and less masculine.  I'll be told that I look sexy when I'm very masc and it's like this feeling of.. ""oh, you like this costume that totally isn't me.. that feels bad.""  Though I do have an amazing friend that absolutely loves the mix of masculine and feminine (and I kind of love that energy of bringing both out rather than neither).

Anyway -- I don't know that I have any good advice.  I think it is a journey.  It takes time to feel what's right and how you feel your best.  But you aren't alone and no matter how you may think the world sees you, I see you for who you are and am cheering you on. ❤️
Aww thank you that means a lot❤️
Agreed - you are nonbinary. Yeah you can dress more masc, either way you are you <3  You don’t have to prove yourself to anyone 

If you want some masculine tips to help you feel more comfortable:

-layers of clothes are your best friends. I like a tshirt that has patterns or a graphic design, then an open button-up shirt or flannel. Then if weather permits, a jacket over it

-a horizontal grey and black striped shirt 

-men’s jeans. The pockets are awesome 

-mixing and matching masc and femme things together 

-a masc belt with whatever pants you want
 
-hair in a low bun with a beanie -ever since I started growing out my undercut, it looks like man’s hair… which is good for me cause I’m starting to get comfortable with the fact I’m actually probably a guy, not trans masc nonbinary. Wow first time I’ve admitted that…
A couple of hairstyles that can read as more masculine: a low central ponytail (right at the base of your skull), a bun worn almost on top of the head near the crown (not twisted or anything fancy, just a half pulled-through ponytail basically), and hair worn down with a center part. Basically anything that doesn't look like you've fussed with it for more than a minute.

For makeup: you can use a dark contour under your jawline to make it look more pronounced, same with the nose and the cheekbones. You can look for ""masculine contour"" tips on the web and probably find some decent sources: theatre folks, cosplayers, drag kings, etc.

As others have said: you are valid no matter how people see you. May you find gender euphoria on your own terms.
Thank you ☺️
u did a good depiction tho
I can’t tell if this is a joke or not but it did make me laugh
Ty❤️❤️
Thanks for the advice, I didn’t look like my dad, but I did look kinda hot lol
Thank you that means so much🥰🥰
Ty ❤️❤️🥰
❤️
That’s not for you to decide. I’m just trying to live my life and be as comfortable with myself as possible and so I asked for help and advice not for people to tell me that I’m pretty just the way I am because this isn’t how  I want to look or feel. That comment felt really invalidating.
I love the good intentions but remember, they can be and do anything they want 💜
Heyyy this subreddit really isn't here for your gratification... Based on your post history I'd surmise you're a chaser, and it's really not appropriate for you to be treating this as a ""what is most attractive to *me*? You should do that"" kind of thing. They can do whatever they want to with their body/presentation. It would be a real shame if you discouraged them from living as their most authentic self just because you find them attractive. 

And you should maybe stop creeping around on here. This forum isn't here for you.
Thank you so much for saying something kind like this even though you like don’t really know my situation, It means so much to me❤️❤️
You could keep long hair and go with an undercut
not OP, but anyways to look flatter? I'm currently wearing a hoodie and a jean jacket, and I feel it's not doing anything. idk lol, any help is useful-
Sorta? I wanted to give you the most extreme example just so anything else might seem more within reach! Tbh, a 90s boy cut would be retro and very cute on ya
Wow! I never meant to hurt or threaten anyone. I just wanted to be positive. Don’t worry, I’ll refrain from commenting from now on.
It's weird how sometimes we coming from such different places, but there is so much we can relate to.  You feel like a kindred soul. 🤗
It’ll depend on your chest size. Like I have a 34b cup sized chest. A sports bra and layered clothes kind of hide mine. 

Binders are helpful. You take your measurements and GC2B customer service can help you get the right size. 

I know they’re expensive. There are lgbtq centers and resource centers at colleges that have free binders and gender affirming clothing. 

Even with my size, I get called “girl”, “doll”, “dear”, etc. , and I know for a fact those customers would not be calling a cis guy that. 

Good luck bean <3
By “flatter”, are you referring to your chest?
 Yeah, thank you I’m sorry if I came off rude I just couldn’t imagine myself bald
thanks! I think I'm just going to have to live till I get myself a binder, I hope things are going well for you today :D
I actually think you could absolutely pull of a shaved head, but that's definitely... drastic lmao
Yeah it’s a process for sure. Being nonbinary is interesting , coming into yourself. Realizing what nonbinary means for you 

My day started kinda shitty. Watched some of season 6 of Queer Eye. I’m feeling better now and am ready to start something new. A new direction for myself :)
well I hope your new direction helps you, and that your shitty day gets better and better as it goes on \^\^"	rq7ngp	NonBinary	416	0.99	2021-12-28 05:17:05
Easy solution		"I personally think we should call everyone they/them until we know their pronouns. Some binary trans people find validation in being called their preferred pronouns.
I \*feel\* this but then recall that for binary trans people being called 'they' can feel like mischaracterizing their identity, as if to say sure maybe they're not A, but they aren't really B either... So I try to hold myself accountable to only ever use trans people's actual preferred pronouns, even when binary (for people I know are trans).

For everybody else though... 😛
I'm all for this! Just don't call people they if they've already given you other pronouns and said they don't want to be referred to as they/them :)
Until you know their pronouns this is a fair default. But once you know a person's pronouns it can be really hurtful to use they/them if they don't ID with it.
""They"" is a pronoun
One of my friends uses exclusively she/her and a streamer I watch hates when they/them pronouns are used on it. So I'd rather not use they/them on everyone because some people don't like they/them pronouns.
Nope! If you know someone’s pronouns are something other than they/them, and you consistently use they/them for that person, you’re misgendering them!
I might be nb, but I'm bigender and my pronouns are he/him or she/her.
Another option is using their name if pronouns are unknown. Or terms like ‘person’ or ‘individual’ 

‘Do you know that persons name?’ 

‘I like that individuals hair’ 

‘I think that person goes by Andy’ 

‘I don’t know that individuals pronouns’

‘Wow Sam looks good today’
Idk… if I was only ever referred to with they/them I’d be pretty upset. Especially when someone knew they weren’t my pronouns.
I’m a binary trans person I’m still in this group because I explored thinking I was non-binary but realized no I’m just a dude. My spouse is non-binary. Use they/them with me or she/her and I get super self conscious, I’m 8 months on testosterone and look like a teenage boy. I’m traumatized from people pointing at me and saying “them” because they just can’t tell, and I know that I should’ve been born as a guy so people not being sure makes me extremely dysphoric
They forgot the important part: UNTIL YOU KNOW THE PERSON’S PREFERRED PRONOUNS!

As a xe/xem user, it’s really disheartening when people know my pronouns are xe/xem and avoid using my pronouns by saying they/them instead.
With all due respect, this is just degendering.
Please don't do this. If you don't know someone's pronouns, great, default to they! But using they/them for someone who you know doesn't use they/them is misgendering and feels like shit.
I thought this said “calls everyone HEY” and I was like YES. Because that’s what I do 😅
No.

That's also misgendering, don't fucking do that.
Ehhh... Even some nonbinary people really don't like ""they."" I've seen twitter bios that specifically say ""no they/them.""
No. Call people the pronouns they want to be called.
well in Turkish we have a single pronoun and its 'o', id 100% recommend, gendered pronouns are bad
I used to do this, but it upset people so I stopped. Well I call people they unless I know their gender, since that seems reasonable.
I am non binary and don't use they/them, I use she/her. It's fine to use they until you know what pronouns someone uses. The please use them!
How do I tag myself?
Hey they! Lol fuck pronouns.
Instructions unclear, fucked the pronoun dictionary
My partner started doing this when he was trying to get used to my pronouns. I understand the sentiment but I actually find it kind of rude. It’s not easy to be a They/them, and ascribing those pronouns to people who haven’t asked / requested it doesn’t feel right to me
I wish it was this easy and for most it may be but some of my friends firmly prefer specific pronouns and don’t like they/them for themselves because of their specific gender identity so I will absolutely respect that ✨ I, on the other hand, have never cared what pronouns people use for me as long they’re not being rude or malicious about it.
I can say I am forgetful, I want to respect everyone’s pronouns but I tend to forget things often. So I default to they/them then refer to preferred pronouns when I remember or learn them.

I don’t know if this correct, but I can say my intent is never malicious
That works great if you're not sure about what pronouns an individual uses. But if you know that individual has pronouns other than they/them, aren't trying to hide that person's identity for whatever reason, & intentionally use they/them, whelp, you just did a targeted misgendering simply because you're lazy! And that's a big no-no.

This is especially inexcusable when it affects trans/enby folks considering how hard we have to fight to be recognized as our actual gender & even worse if it comes from someone from within the trans/enby community.
I feel this is a more interney heavy culture that see this, and online, 10000% agree, cuz no one sees what is being put into the universe, but in person, best to just ask. Introduce and provide yours, and hopefully they reciprocate, but to just assume is not cool.
fuck pronouns

just call everyone \[pronoun\]
That is still a pronoun
I'm non binary (gender fluid) and I prefer gendered pronouns based on how I present. I hate being called they/them.
Everyone keeps specifically saying binary trans people would be uncomfortable with they them... Y'all do realize not all binary people use they them, or are comfortable being called they them right? I'm one of those nonbinary people, my pronouns are not and have never been they
i do that already
i do this
Love this
But I'm ace 🥺
thank fuck, a portrayal of shadow where he’s not red pilled
I already do this on accident.
They is my default pronoun to use until the person asks me to use a different one for them.
https://youtu.be/md8nInMGhFY
Nope, I'm Fae/Faer, and I hate being called they/them.
This. I don't like being called they/them, but when it's done out of respect for not knowing my pronouns, I'm perfectly fine with it! It's only when people continue using they/them after learning my pronouns that I'm irked.
100% this. Same goes for identity labels as well. I hate the term Enby, I find it to be infantilizing. I prefer just straight up nonbinary or agender if they're really curious about my identity.

Knew someone who was also nonbinary and constantly referred to both of us as enbies after I repeatedly told them I didn't like it.
This is the way
I agree with the first part of your comment.

Not only binary trans people, I'm a non-binary transmasc and I feel an intense euphoria at being called he, Mr, etc, I don't want being called they, btw in France the neutral pronoun is really hard to use orally.
>for binary trans people being called 'they' can feel like mischaracterizing their identity

It's a form of misgendering called de-gendering; it's often done by transphobes - consciously or otherwise - to avoid recognizing a binary trans person's gender, while simultaneously not categorizing them as their AGAB, out of a sense that a person has warped themselves or is otherwise an aberration.

It's common enough to be something of a trope that someone who is 'mildly' transphobic may claim that they 'struggle' with using they/them pronouns... until they encounter a clockable binary trans person irl.
ah yes, the gender neutral ""HEY YOU"" given can sometimes sound like someone about to start a fight. 😅
Hi ace, I'm dad.
Same, and also - hey, gender twinsie!
Yeah, especially when family members of trans people do it to avoid calling them their preferred pronouns.
Yes, I also meant binary pronouns
A friendly default they/them is like making someone a black coffee before you know if they prefer milk, sugar or like it black. It's polite.

But bringing someone black coffee when you know they take it with milk is being a dick.
Ahh! I love that analogy!"	z42dnx	NonBinary	413	0.88	2022-11-25 03:14:31
trying out she/they pronouns and honestly am thriving <3		"Good for you! You look beautiful!
Wow you are beautiful :)
Love this journey for you! You look absolutely stunning, and I’m glad you’re growing more into yourself every day. 💖"	koo1bo	NonBinary	417	1.0	2021-01-02 01:40:39
Was happy with this makeup look (any pronouns)		"You look amazing! So well done friend! So pretty!
You have a lovely beard
your makeup is really nice, but i'm interested in that jacket!
Ayyy another any pronouns using icon!
Damn thts actually so cool. It’s sorta clashing with the masculine clothes and the bold eyeshadow. Love it it’s really cool. I do a lotta makeup myself but I definitely go the more feminine route so this really made me go like THTS SO FUCKING COOL. Keep it up🥰
Looking good! I like the hint of gold
I really need to learn how to apply makeup, I've never been able to make it look this good.
Beautiful! I love this look 🤩
You look great!
You've got an incredible grasp of color theory -- the red and the bit of gold really bring out the honey tones in your beard as well as your eyes. And even though makeup is traditionally considered feminine, the sharp eyeliner wings and bold use of color give off a certain edginess that really goes well with your outfit's overtly masc vibe. The makeup colors even compliment the details in your outfit (like the bit of red lining I peep on your cap, and the hardware on your jacket)!  


TL;DR: you've got some god level skills at makeup + outfit coordination and holy hell am I impressed. <3
What's that eyeshadow? <3
Thank you!!
Thanks! I grew it myself.
just a basic leather jacket, I've actually had it for like... almost 10 years now
Don't know about icon 😂
Thank you, I definitely present like, almost fully masc but I love makeup, so sometimes it ends up with stuff like this. 

Appreciate the support 🥰🥰
Thank you! Yeah it was a new palette and it had these super pigmented yellows that I couldn't wait to try out
Practice . a lot . I know personally i will literally be sitting in my bed doing full makeup at midnight just cus i can and i am getting better. It also helps cus you dont have to worry about people seeing your failed attempts lol
Honestly it's all about practicing. Even like a couple months ago my makeup always looked like complete trash, but I kept trying and now I'm ok with it
Thank you so much!! 🥰
Thank you so much!!
Yeah I uh... Totally meant to do all of that...

Honestly I just know I tend to look good in reds, and wanted wear my Raptors hat, everything working so well is just idk, like, knowing that these things look good with red I guess? 

The execution of the makeup I will take the compliment though, I was proud of that one. 

Very much appreciate the kind words of course, but you give me too much credit! Still thank you so much!! 🥰
ABH Norvina Pro Palette Vol 3 was very happy with it.
wow really? it looks really nice on you... though tbf i've always had a bias toward leather jackets.
Makeup is a fun way of expression tho. It’s art
You're so welks.
thank you! I am a fan of it, which is why it's stuck around for so long
100% agree."	nbsauu	NonBinary	411	0.99	2021-05-13 21:46:41
Going outside with my pronoun patch for the first time. English isn’t my native language and they them pronouns are rare here, but it still feels like one more step to actually being out.		"I hope you are fine.
Ooh, nice. I bought a pin that says ""they  hen"" (Swedish neutral pronoun) the other day, can't wait to try it out. If anyone wants it, I actually designed the thing myself on the store's (zazzle) website, only cost me 35 kr."	l4nhti	NonBinary	400	1.0	2021-01-25 13:06:33
My pronouns are he/they but I just came out and I’m really, really enjoying leaning into my feminine side. So happy to have a place like this to share, too 😊		"I love your hair!! 
And that shirt suits you so well! 💜
loving that lipstick on you!!
Your hair is lovely
Ok is it weird that I stan you even tho I’ve only seen your reddit posts-
Thank you!!
Thank you!
I’m happy to have you rooting for me! But just be careful staning strangers haha. Lot of realllllll assholes out there."	jts1vw	NonBinary	395	0.99	2020-11-14 00:23:55
University Administration Thinks That They Know Who I Am Better Than Myself	"I'm so frustrated. I graduated with my masters from a pretty prestigious school last year, and I only mention that because it's important to note that this school also attempts to pass themselves off as very progressive and they care a LOT about their carefully curated reputation.

This week, my school reached out to ask for an updated headshot and bio, so they could update my listing in the alumni directory and potentially use it for promo materials (you know, things like ""our graduates now work in XYZ fields!""). No problem, I sent one in, using they/them pronouns in my new bio. 

Well, they were quick to respond, showing me the formatted/finished product for my approval, and that's when I noticed that they took Every. Single. Pronoun. and changed them all to she/her. 

I do dress and present fairly femme. And I'm generally okay with people using a mix of they/them and she/her pronouns to refer to me. But the fact that they took what I wrote, the way I describe myself, and intentionally changed it?!

I know that when strangers look at me they see a cis woman, and I feel dysphoric enough about that as it is. I'm just so upset/sad/disappointed that even after being clear about who I am, some stranger really felt like they knew better.

Yes, I emailed them about it so we'll see what happens, but I'm just so frustrated and I wanted to share this. I'm sure I'm not the first person to deal with this, but why is this still an issue? At supposedly very ""liberal"" schools? It's ridiculous."	"That’s so frustrating! A similar thing happened to me in medical school. I hope the shape up.
Absolutely infuriating. I'm sorry you're dealing with this!!

By the way, I've found that casually cc-ing people's supervisors or department/unit heads gets some pretty magical results (only if you're looking for and have the emotional wherewithal for a bit of conflict of course).
Can you withdraw consent for them to use your image and stuff?
I recently graduated from my school and the dean reached out to see where I’m working. They deadnamed me. 

It’s frustrating when you think they see you as a person but at the end of the day, we’re numbers.
""I regret to inform you that I am revoking my consent for [school] to use my headshot and bio as out values do not align. Thank you for your time and consideration.""

I'm sorry you're going through this.
That's insane. I go to a run of the mill online school (SNHU) and even though they aren't prestigious and have thousands and thousands and thousands of students, since the day that I changed my name in my student portal, I have not been deadnamed on any of their sites nor by anyone I called at the student center/admissions office.

It's crazy how some places truly just do not care when they have the reputation saying they do, and other places where you'd least expect a personal touch, they actually notice and care.
I can't imagine the rage. I don't really know what I can do for advice but I hope it gets resolved.
That shit makes me so mad. If they refuse to use your pronouns, you have every right to refuse to being used in their advertising. Very possibly just a single person in the office reviewing who doesn't think singular they/them pronouns are ""academic"" or something, but definitely escalate and don't let them hide who you are.

So sorry this happened 💜
A lot of “progressive” schools like this are run by people who are either too out of touch or bigoted to understand the messages they preach. It’s like they want to be *seen* as advanced, but they don’t want to do the work to *be* advanced. My school makes all the admin put their pronouns in their email signatures, but it’s a performative gesture because they all refuse to use correct pronouns for students & other staff.
I feel your frustration. Not at the same level but my university is also “progressive” including about gender and also even how it relates to the native culture here, which recognized a third ‘in between’ gender role. My uni has some unisex bathrooms to be gender-affirming, for example. Also has a system of changing what name shows on everything to a “nickname” in the cases of trans and cultural students. So everything has my chosen name on it from the class roster to scholarship forms.     
Yet for some reason the admins sent over my info form (that I filled out) with the correction of my legal (dead) name to my fieldwork placement. It’s caused a ton of confusion for my placement and there was literally no reason to correct it as there isn’t any government/directly legal stuff for my legal name to be necessary for. It’s been since the start of August and my required nametag still has my dead name on it. Frustrating .-.
Tell them you are pulling your photo and listing until it’s resolved.
I wanna hear what happens
It's Possible It's Just A Bad Editor Paid To Edit The Stuff Or Something, Who Heard Someone Say ""Singular They Is Incorrect"" And Didn't Think Harder, I Remember A Story Where My Dadd Wrote An Article For Something, And Then An Editor Changed A Sentence To Make It Less Correct Grammatically Before Publishing, So It's Not Impossible. Still Sucks Though.

If It *Wasn't* That, And Was Actually Fully Intentional, Then That's Like Honestly Disgusting That They'd Do That.
welcome to transsexualism
I'm so sorry you had to deal with this too! I really don't understand why other people feel like they have the right to dictate how others describe themselves.
Something tells me that OP does have some sort of say in this, especially if this is in the US, not to mention the fact that OP is an adult so they can easily email the school and say “if you choose not to respect my identity then I would like for you to remove the updated information completely. You did not ask for clarification on my pronouns and you decided for me that I must’ve made a mistake. I can assure you that I am old enough to know how to refer to myself.”
I’m not sure, but I would assume they should have a right to not being listed if they don’t wish to. 

I’d be beyond pissed. If I was OP I’d be causing a *scene*.
I would definitely not okay something so disrespectful.
They just emailed me back and all it said was:

*""Glad I checked with you, gnomieebee.  I reverted back to your submission.  Thanks, so much.""* 

So on the one hand I'm glad that they're going to change it back (although I'll definitely be checking to make sure that actually happens), but on the other hand WHY did they do that in the first place?!? And also the ""Glad I checked with you"" is so ridiculous and condescending--they didn't check with me, they sent me a form email asking for confirmation before posting. They probably thought I wouldn't notice. That is very very different from asking for permission or checking in about it (which would be inappropriate already, just not quite as bad).
Wow. Real class act there. 

I mean, if I had to guess I’d say that probably someone higher up (usually this is an editor but who knows) was insisting that “they” is incorrect and that you wouldn’t care if someone “fixed your mistake.” And now the person submitting it can go back to them and be like “actually no, those are OPs pronouns, its not a mistake, and if you keep insisting it will be transphobic as hell and cause drama that’ll make us look bad publicly. Mind, this is speculation, but I’ve seen it play out that way more than once. I’m so sorry you’re having to put up with this nonsense.
That’s inaccurate and condescending. If you don’t mind the conflict, I would loop in the next step up individual from that person if you know them, or just a head of whatever department is doing this if you don’t, and specifically point out that you were not asked at all then ask why your pronouns were changed without your permission.
You should say something about that. Ask why it was changed at all and when they think that they checked with you about it.
I would ask for either their supervisor or the person who made the edit and grill them about Why this happened"	xs2zjt	NonBinary	397	1.0	2022-09-30 14:36:29

Ash!
Uhh idk why but I think the name Jett or Jet would suit you. Just based on vibes
I’m getting soft-spooky vibes…maybe Wren?
Inspired by the first picture, but what about Ray/Rey?
Ember or Arlo! :)
That sounds like something I would do, name myself after BBQ sauce haha
I was going to say the same thing: a good name is literally staring you in the face. 😂
I second Ray
A lot of my friends used to call me Alice when Twilight came out haha
I just came to the comments to suggest Lawrence!  Traditionally a last name, but so many possibilities in the nicknames.  Larry? Lars? Laurie? Wren?  One for every mood: )
Sky is actually my middle name
Or sweet baby Ray's BBQ sauce
i second aspen, fits them perfectly
Avery, Ash, Alan, Ayla, Alec
I thought Kat or Kit but Callie is a little softer, I like it too!
I gave it up. It’s all hers.
Thank you!
BBQ sauce is one of the things I love in life
I used to go by Xeno actually
august
Oh goodness this is a good one
That was my childhood nickname 😭
I know a couple of people who have gone by Mik - shortened from Michael or mikala
Why not Ashlee 🤔🤷🏻‍♀️😉
My new nickname is Dia which reminds me of those old photo projectors so... 😅
That's far better than the ""bar-b-cutie"" I could not get out of my head.
Definitely go all out and try Sweet Baby Ray.
Rue :)
yeah I kinda wanna say Barb
You might as well 🤷‍♂️ anything goes around here 😄❤
I genuinely had no idea there was even an Alice in twilight lmao
I’m a socialist so I strongly support y’all sharing
I mean, bbq sauce is pretty good, I can’t blame you.

Chosen names and pronouns are not optional. Credit: fb /queerivyart		"What does the fox say? They speak the truth.
Well, technically it *is* - because humans always have the option to behave like a colossal asshole.

If you want to follow the guidelines on how to *not* be a colossal asshole, respecting someone's identity is one of the most basic steps and literally doesn't harm anyone.

While being a colossal asshole hurts everyone involved, it's just that the colossal asshole usually only notices when they die alone, miserable and unloved, only to be found when the neighbours notice the smell or the maggots.

So respect names and pronouns y'all :3
Love the art and message
I love that, I am trying to figure out names and right now I am trying the name fox.
Yea exactly I went to a mental health center and they kept calling it my preferred name and pronouns it was really annoying
agreed.
I Mean..... For Me It Is Though.. Like I Have A Chosen Name, A Couple Actually, That I Quite Like, But I Also Like The Name I Was Given At Birth, And For Pronouns To A Decent Degree I Just Don't Care.
When I came out to my mother and her boyfriend, he told me that he would only call me by my preferred name and pronouns when and *if* i graduate.
Fuckin,,, refraining from murdering your neighbor is technically optional. Doesn’t mean you won’t face consequences for doing so :)

My Grandma’s opinion on my pronouns.	My 82 year old grandma said my pronouns are easy to remember because I'm like a boy AND a girl so THEM makes sense ☺️❤️	"10/10 can we share grandma? My grandparents wouldn't react well if I ever came out, neither would my dad so I'm in the closet for like 30+ years unless I cut all contact.

&#x200B;

Sorry to kill the vibe, hope you are well.
What a vibe ❤️ I’m pretty agender but I’d use this is it makes sense to people ❤️
Yet my 63 year old mom says it’s too confusing for her…
My mom’s mother (84) is the only family member of mine to immediately start calling me by my new name and consistently get it right. If she can do it, anyone can. I’m so happy we both have this kind of support. ❤️ Go grandmas!
My grandma won’t accept me. Idk if I’ll ever see her again. Today I met a grandma around the same age as mine from a similar town in Russia who had a long convo with me about random stuff and used my pronouns and respected my identity. I wish she was my grandma.
I love your grandma so much
Aww that’s awesome!
That’s AWESOME! My partner’s 95-year-old great grandmother started calling me Sam when I changed RIGHT away😍
omg i love her take 🥲💞
I thought this was going in a whole different direction. Those are some awesome grandma vibes.
Grandma is a gem and a truly wise elder. Enjoy her!
I would like to send your grandma a great big hug. I I’m non-binary have an only recently started coming to terms with that.

They/them doesn’t feel right in my head after so many years of English or whatever the hell. I don’t think I’ll ever get used to the newly created Pronouns.

But damn this makes so much sense it makes life so much easier in my brain already. A great big thanks to her and to you. Old dog new tricks.
Oh my god I want to share your grandma she sounds amazing
Awwwww I love your grandma!! Can I shear her with you ??? My grandma told me if I where a sheep she would have killed me.
I like to keep my anonymity on Reddit so unfortunately no pics, but she’s a rockstar 🥰 luckily my entire immediately family is super excepting of all things LGBTQIA+. I’m sorry to hear that your peeps wouldn’t all accept your true identity :/ stay strong fellow they!
Just re-read your original comment and realized your were asking if we can share her, not if I can post a pic! 😂 I’m a dingus
I’d call it 50/50 correct, but super well meaning and in my case not incorrect.  Her hearts definitely in the right spot though 🥰
I feel ya, my mom is a teacher and will accommodate her students but makes little effort for her own child. Says it's hard because she has been referring to me by my agab for 20+ years.
I haven’t even changed my pronouns and my 52-year-old mom refuses to call me my chosen name :) -_-
Yay!!
All fine, though could you ask her if she'll let Sam be an honorary grandchild? I understand this is weird to ask but feeling like I have some accepting family would help me. At this point I've got my queer ex counselor and two teachers acting in that role.
All good
Yeah that’s what my mom kinda does too. But she’s at least trying so I give her that. I’m going to show her some videos on singular they maybe that will help.
Exact same thing my mom says
Awwww, I'm sorry. I just officially changed my name, though I've been using it as a nickname for 20 or so years. It doesn't bother me at all when people forget, but when my family members do it deliberately it stings.
Of course! Welcome to the club 😄
Happy to be your enby ""auntie"", if you want. Be well!
Need a fellow sibling? If so, I got you! 💛🤍💜🖤
100% feel the same way. Thankfully my friends, partner and partner’s family are really supportive though!
Thank you \*happy noises\*
Thank you :)
Thank you, now I have 2 queer siblings (and 1 i'm sussing very much). Hope you are well.
I'll be your parent

"I got ""they-ed"" by a stranger for the first time ever and it felt really nice"	"Last week I was queuing at the library along with someone else, and when the librarian asked who was first, the other person gestured at me and said ""they were"", just really naturally and casually. I'm generally not too fussed about pronouns, but it feels really good to know that there are people out there who don't automatically try and categorise everyone they interact with as male or female. You made my day stranger, thank you 😊"	"I was pants shopping the other day (I usually HATE clothes shopping), and the person helping me used they/them pronouns for me and it was wonderful
I feel you. I am openly NB but hardly anyone I know uses my pronouns properly. I don't make a fuss about it because I don't wanna be 'that person' but when someone uses the right pronoun it feels so good.

I look forward to the day that a stranger uses my pronouns right. Living the dream.
My mom takes calls for an insurance company, and one of the rules at her job is “use gender neutral pronouns during calls” which I think is pretty cool
I have made it a habit of calling every customer they/them at work and it feels really good. I’m so happy that you had this experience!
When I worked in retail I always defaulted to they/them unless I knew someone. One day some of my coworkers were talking because one of them had acccidentally misgendered someone and the people who didn't make that mistake said they try to do the same thing for that very reason. I'm a trans guy who uses he/him pronouns and hearing they/them, while they arent my pronouns, is sooooo much better than she/hers. (Which makes my skin crawl highkey haha).
So a few weeks ago my friend wanted to go to the weed store and she doesn't have valid ID or a driver's license! 
I was just chilling at home in a new dress, so she asked me to drive to the store she said that she had ID as this particular store doesn't use you check expiry date. 
So I throw on my black high heel boots and we drive down there she goes into the store first and comes back out cuz they checked her expiry date.

 So the only option is for me to go into the store looking awesome but not how I usually dress when I go out, so I go I to get what my wife and her wanted.
The person behind the counter was a guy and he treated me so well I didn't feel any discomfort at the situation!
The women in the back room were kind of giggling but because of the guy whom I found out later his name is literally ""legend""!
I did not care one bit.
It left such an impression on me I had to go back, and commend him to his boss.
It was more awkward talking to his boss a bout it because I had just got off work where it is conservative so I was presenting masc. Lol
Meanwhile I “she’d” someone yesterday and I felt bad about for hours after because I could tell they were kind of gender non-conforming?? But I didn’t know if that’s just how they prefer to express themself or if they are actually non-binary in some way?? And I’m nb myself so I should know better than to assume gender??

I’m sorry, random person I may have accidentally misgendered. 😭
How would you do this in German tho?
Yaaaay! Props to the salesperson for doing their job and making you feel comfortable. So many times I've been guided away from a certain area of the shop because the sales assistant thought I was looking in the ""wrong"" section or even lost! It's infuriating and exhausting. And because I look quite androgynous I really can't get it right, because no matter what section I'm in, someone will think I'm in the wrong place 😆
Living the dream indeed 😀 I don't think I've ever said that unsarcastically before haha. I don't really mind any pronouns to be honest, and I tell people to use whichever come naturally to them, but if there's any hesitation it tends to be between she/her and he/him. Hardly anyone spontaneously goes for they, and it feels lovely that people are actually beginning to think outside the binary!
[deleted]
I think if you're not 100% sure, they/them is a good go-to choice, it generally won't be as grating as getting she/her or he/him wrong to someone who is trans 😊
It still happens to me sometimes as well, it just goes to show how conditioned we all are to automatically try to assign a gender to everyone. But we're trying, and that's the important thing 💪
I really don't know, and I speak German 😭
It probably helped that I'm pretty sure the salesperson was also genderqueer of some sort, but both times I've been pants shopping at that store, they've been really wonderful about it. makes me more inclined to actually spend more money there rather than going somewhere else that has cheaper pants 😆
hey, sorry to be late and all that to the party but I'm pretty sure that ""Mx."" is a generally accepted replacement for binary ""Mr."" or ""Ms.""  


Your best bet is to keep asking though, I know I'm okay with that but I can't speak for all my fellow humans lol :)

They explains it a bit, but the problem remains."	ddpccr	NonBinary	378	1.0	2019-10-05 16:19:20
Therapist consistently misgendering me?	"Basically the title.

I'm nonbinary, I've made it clear I use they/them pronouns. When they first called me to get my information, they asked for my pronouns. They know what my pronouns are, and they're established as an LGBT friendly therapist (which they certainly are! Aside from this. No issues about me being ace/aro or being in a queerplatonic relationship)

But they still call me she/her when talking to me in third person. 

I even had the courage to stop them once and remind them that I don't use she/her. In fact, anything non feminine is fine. They encouraged me for setting boundaries, and used they/them for about five minutes before slipping back into she/her.

When I talked about being nonbinary again, and that I go by they/them pronouns (summed up by ""I don't want to be a boy, but I hate being a girl"") they asked if I knew that they/them referred to multiple people. 

They're totally fine with my plan to get top surgery though. I'm just very confused and think they might not understand what being trans or nonbinary means, but I don't quite have the energy or nerve to keep correcting them after doing so already.

I'm wondering if other people have the same experience I guess? I suppose I can understand it would be very easy to forget around me, I try not to be feminine but my voice gives it away.

One of the reasons I'm seeing them is *because* of Gender dysphoria

I'm not sure if I should seek someone else out, or suck it up and bring it up again, or just let it slide."	"If this therapist isn't helping you the way you need, don't hesitate to drop them. Therapy is too expensive to not get what you deserve.
You should try and find someone else. You aren't asking for something big for them to respect your pronouns. I found a lot of folks were comfortable listing LGBT friendly, but really meant LGB. You shouldn't have to 'let it slide' when it comes to getting care about something that means a lot to you.   
Thinking of you.
Even if this person is otherwise kind and helpful, and on board to help you get top surgery, they may still have a lot of learning to do where pronouns are concerned, and you’re well within your rights to switch to someone further along in their understanding. If they’re a good therapist, they’ll understand that they aren’t a good fit for you and that you need someone who won’t misgender you, even accidentally.
""they/them referred to multiple people""

isn't that not entirely correct even if you don't consider people who use they/them as their pronouns anyway though?
I found a nonbinary therapist explicitly for this reason. Not to say a cis therapist is incapable of respecting pronouns (ive had good experiencs w cis therapists too), but it does sort of garuntee they'll have a better immediate understanding if they are also nonbinary/trans. I look up almost all of my providers on the WPATH directory search, which means they have a certification on transgender health standards of care.
Yikes that's frustrating. Like others have said, you're paying too much to be this therapist's learning experience. There are plenty of LGBT friendly therapists that actually include the T. I see one via telehealth and she's great. She makes mistakes occasionally, but in the three years I've been seeing her I can count them on one hand. Good luck! I hope you're able to find someone that you don't have to fight with to be recognized as who you are.
I found myself in the same boat as you. I had an LGBT friendly therapist and he kept misgendering me. Every time he did I corrected him and he apologized, but I had enough after the 5th time. It definitely made me feel alienated in my own therapy session and I felt I couldn't build a relationship with the therapist because of this. I stopped him point blank mid session and said that we were done. I told him why, outlined the importance of pronouns, grilled him about what trans education he had (which might have been overkill), and said bye. I shook his hand when I left and it was sweaty as hell. ""Good,"" I thought.

As others have said, find a different therapist. To have a good therapist you need to build a relationship on trust and respect - you can't have one without the other, and not using your pronouns is disrespectful.
Yup new therapist time 

Edit: i use they them and have 2 therapists both cis and neither has any problems using my pronouns
You deserve to have a therapist who affirms you. It doesn’t sound like this one can do that. You’ve brought it up enough times. If they acknowledged you for setting that boundary, they should also realize they’re crossing it. A therapist is supposed to create a safe relationship container focused on your needs. It would be very reasonable to leave this one for not meeting your needs.
I had something similar happen. Noted my pronouns in the paperwork. She misgendered me in the first session. I brought up my pronouns thinking she probably just didn't see them on the paperwork. She pauses for a moment and says ""ok"" then goes on a rant about how it's grammatically incorrect. I dropped her and started seeing a trans therapist after that with no issue.
I’m trying to think of any time a therapist has had to refer to me as if they were talking to someone else and… that has never happened.

I am trying to figure out if or why your therapist decides to talk as if they are not talking to you (unless you have therapy with someone else/they are actually talking to someone else).

That just seems like misgendering on purpose by adding an invisible third person to double it down, adding the false idea that they is just for plural just solidifies that.
mine does the same thing :/ feels like shit im sorry
I had a therapist who did the same thing my first session. It felt so degrading, I didn’t go back to that therapist again and told the clinic exactly why I wouldn’t be returning. That is not acceptable to misgender someone in therapy.
I understand how frustrating that is.

When i came out as nb, i had told my then therapist that a lot of my family basically rejected me and refused to use my name. I told her i cut them off because they were disrespectful to me.

She said maybe my name was an ""agree to disagree"" topic and basically that i shouldn't let it damage the relationship.

My experience is a little different but i get how the crossing of boundaries is upsetting.
Therapists are meant to be professionals. They aren't your friend or your irrirating relative who doesn't understand singular they, all the while casually and obliviously using it in daily life. Nevermind that any therapist worth their salt understands the harm invalidating a person's identity on a consistent basis can do. Misgendering is Trans Mental Healthcare 101. 

If your therapist can't even manage to use your pronouns correctly, what the hell are they being paid for? Did someone forget to tell them what the T in LGBT stands for?
>*…they asked if I knew that they/them referred to multiple people…*

Wow, mega cringe. [Maybe try asking them if they know that *you* is actually the plural form of *thou*? ](https://www.merriam-webster.com/words-at-play/why-did-we-stop-using-thou) Then make it extra spicy and request that she go ahead and defer to *thou/thee* for talking to you from now one, since that’s objective singular and she seems to get too confused using plurals.

Hope the article brings you a bit of cheer. Anyone who is bucking back at the use of “they” being objective singular in modern English really needs to just grow up. But if they want to have a battle on etymology and semantics then, let’s not let them down mm? ;) You got this OP.


edit:  Also yes, get a new therapist that is genderqueer friendly. :)

edit 2:  Some edits for clarity
It doesn’t sound like they are being maliciously disrespectful. 

It also sounds like they have more biases to work through in this area, than they seem to be aware of.

It is perfectly reasonable to place a boundary in this area. For example you could say something like the following:

“I am questioning whether this can be a safe enough space for me to continue therapy, while I continue to be misgendered. 

I find it _____ (triggering) and _______ (disrespectful). It feels like it’s getting in the way of my progress, or is actively harmful. 

I appreciate that you may already be doing your best. 

Do you have any thoughts on the subject? Do you feel like we may be able to find a solution that allows me to feel more safe? “
Ugh this is brutal. How to decide whether to stay with a therapist who is good in many ways bit dehumanizing in others? It's hard enough to find a good therapist as it is.

In a perfect world, I would say ditch them. Misgendering is not okay and they don't seem to care that they're hurting you. But in *this* world, it might be worth it to see who else you can find first?

It also sounds like they could use some education on pronouns and trans issues.
They/them can be used to refer to multiple people but has been used as gender neutral pronoun for centuries
This infuriating. If possible, you have to try to move onto someone else. This individual obviously needs more education, but that is *not your job right now*, especially since you are being directly affected by their conduct, THEY are the professional, and you need support that is directly related to your gender identity. If possible, please try to find another therapist. Sorry you have to go through this.
A therapist isn’t someone you should correct in these terms. If it’s not working then go for another one is my advise, that won’t ever help, if anything it makes for weird confused feelings
A bad therapist is worse than no therapist!!
I had a therapist just like this once, it turned out her not being able to understand or respect my gender identity was incompatible with healing. Its time to leave and get a new one.
You are not there to train your therapist. Please find a new one, dear.
You need a different therapist. It's very unprofessional of them to be uneducated about trans people at this point
Maybe mention to them that the singular form of they has been correct since 1375 :)

And maybe tell them that “you” was originally supposed to be plural, and that they should only use “thou” when talking to one person if they care so much about what’s “really” correct for singular vs plural pronouns
I’ve had to drop my psychiatrist for this very reason (though she also couldn’t seem to get on board with my name change, even though she only knew me as my dead name for literally ONE session). You deserve to be respected, especially by someone in the mental health field who should know better
If an LGBT friendly therapist asks you if you know they/them is for multiple people ESPECIALLY after establishing pronons, they are not LGBT friendly.

Im sorry for our experience, and I hope you can find a new therapist who doesnt contribute to the problem you are seeing them to help work through.
LGBT friendly my ass. How you gonna train in LGBT issues and not have heard people use ""they/them"" before. It's like, common knowledge
Woah I did not expect this to get the attention that it has! Thank you so much everyone, I'll definitely be bringing this up to my therapist. I hope this entire page can help and reinforce said help for anyone else who finds themself in this situation.
Confront them! Big time. ""You know I have this problem where people I'm relying on still misgender me. It really hurts, even though they're trying to be supporting me they call me she. Specifically you. How do I get you to stop?""

It's super forward and aggressive but you are paying this person to at LEAST not make it worse.
!new therapist time! (if possible, it can be hard with healthcare and finances) if you can’t get a new therapist, you may have to educate them by sending them some posts/articles about non-binary and gender queerness, but this is not your responsibility and it is on them to educate themselves to be a good therapist. this is also something you should suggest to them if you feel they may respond well and won’t remove you as a patient (again, healthcare)
I had a therapist who would do the same thing. I ended up going to a younger therapist who specialises in young adults, even though I’m in my 30’s. She took me on because she recognized that a lot of my issues intersected with her other patients.
It’s up to you to decide how important it is to you to be addressed correctly. My stance on it would be to keep pushing. Send them resources that educate them on nb ppl and grammatical correctness for they/them pronouns (for that second one the brainpop discussing pronouns should work if you have access to that) In the meantime, I wish you luck <3
Alrighty yep, it's time to move on.  
I explained how I hate being referred to as a girl and that it's getting worse- they said to be mindful of the people referring to me as a girl.   
Then called me lady and ma'am during the meeting. Also used the term   
transvestite.  
I think I'll be switching to a gender therapist even if it means I have   
to go completely virtual.
Oh that does put it into perspective. My therapy is covered thankfully, but it certainly hasn't been doing me any wonders. Thanks!
this is your answer right here. 
 
therapists are tending to peoples' needs, as anyone in healthcare is. if that service isn't giving you what you need, look elsewhere for assistance. 
 
your emotional & mental wellbeing is far too important to give someone your time if they aren't adding anything positive to your existence...& that goes for much more than just therapy, as well...
Thank you for the feedback! I've noticed Psychology Today (where I was looking for therapists) often has ""LGBT friendly"", ""lesbian"" and ""bisexual"" listed specifically, but never anything else. I imagine it's all the LGBT options possible they can put, so they just put them all.

I've had some reservations about my therapist now for other reasons anyways, so I'll start looking for someone else! Probably a specifically LGBT therapist. Thanks again!
Thanks for the advice! I'll try to be upfront next time that I need them to use my pronouns. I might consider switching anyways for other reasons, but if they can make a genuine effort to correct themselves that'd be a huge improvement. Or they'll switch back to she/her and that'll answer whether or not I should look for someone else anyways.
Yeah I tried to explain it this way, ""when you find a wallet, you say, 'oh someone dropped their wallet' but you don't mean multiple dropped it. You're referring to one person"" which led to confusion over using it only when you don't know someone's gender yet, which I countered with something along the lines of ""sort of, but it's not too hard to apply that to myself with practice."" 

I'm always confused by the multiple people argument. I guess people just don't really notice how often neutral pronouns are used since they don't have any reason to think about it!
Singular they has actually been in use for longer than singular you.
Singular pronouns, have been for the last 600 years. We all learn this in our first school years.
It is a bit weird, but sometimes they try to get into the shoes of the other person, like my family, or describe me in third person. I imagine it's to show that other people don't think of me as low as I might think (won't get into all that funky stuff haha, but it's an example) or to point out things I need to work on from a narrative standpoint, which I understand, it'd just be way more tolerable with the correct pronouns. 

(of course there's also statements like ""inside you there's this wonderful ***girl""***)

Though the therapist did respond once with referring to me as ""you"" then promptly going into third person with ""she/her"" after first being reminded about the pronoun thing, so... probably a good sign for me to start looking for someone else.
I hope you found a new therapist?
It's like... I get that the few people I've told are having trouble adjusting. Saying I'm disappointed or hurt when they call me a girl doesn't mean I'm disappointed *in* them. But hearing that I should be mindful of them when that's what I've been doing this whole time stings.
And make sure you let them know why if you're comfortable with that and they give you a leaving survey. There's an opportunity for them to grow from this and learn for next time.
You are hiring them for a service and you can fire them at any time! It doesn't have to be mean or punitive, but you can discontinue services any time you like. Therapy often involves a bit of shopping around before you get someone you can work with well. Good luck in your journey!
I can only speak from my own experience. But if you’re not leaving every therapy session feeling like you were finally able to get something off your mind, or relieved, or confident, or excited, or like you’ve established a plan forward, find a new therapist.
Maybe a trans friendly one would be best? That way you know they have a deeper understanding of nonbinary/trans stuff
It can be hard to find depending on where you live. But if you can find a practice that caters primarily (or even exclusively) to transgender people, that’s your safest bet.
Ya, the singular they has been used for a long time(can be traced back to 1375), and it is endorsed as part of APA style writing. 

Btw your example makes an image of multiple people dropping their wallet pop up in my head lmao.
I, an editor, am stating that they/them is not always indicative of the plural and it has been used consistently in its singular form since the 14th century.

You can also tell your therapist on my behalf that they (singular) are transphobic when they make the decision to use pronouns that you have stated you don’t use. Respect for clients is vital for a therapeutic relationship. Their ongoing decision to misgender you makes them an unsafe contact for any trans or non-binary person. 

IMO you should make certain that the LGBTIAQ network in your area is aware that this person is unable and unwilling to correctly use your pronouns, as it shows that they are definitely NOT an ally.
Your therapist wasted your time you were paying for correcting and questioning you on your own pronouns. Drop em.
ok now I'm picturing all the ""they is for multiple people"" arguments, but it's people complaining when singular you was starting to be a thing
Yeah. Not that's pretty intentional. Like, especially with saying theres a girl inside you when you aren't a girl, no matter how you present or sound, that's messed up and transphobic honestly. It seems super intentional when you add those details to it.
Unfortunately I have not. I don't have the finances to do so.

She also crossed boundaries a few times. I had mentioned in passing that I was bisexual. She asked if i wanted to talk about it. I said no. And then she proceeded to ask if it bothered me I'd never gotten to experience being with a woman (i realized after meeting my partner).

The experience with her made me a bit cross but 🤷🏽‍♀️. I've had some great therapists and hope to find another one day.
I should mention that even though I was going mostly for gender dysphoria, they said that they knew that there's a deeper root to the problem, that if people want to change the outside of themselves it's because they haven't addressed the inside first or something.

Yeah, thanks. The inside is the gender dysphoria. I'm depressed cause I'm a girl, not a girl cause I'm depressed.
It will never not bother me that people will complain about singular they but not bat an eye at using singular you.
Yeah, and I thought it was weird that they asked for OP's pronouns, but only expected he or she? Never seen anyone ask for pronouns when they weren't even willing to use they/them

Hi! I'm looking for a new name that will suit me more. I go by they/them pronouns and I'd like a more androgynous/masculine leaning name but I've had no luck so far!		"Sam suits you imo
Just a few ideas that popped into my head:

Robin, Ashley (can shorten to Lee for added masc.), Marc, Tai, or maybe even Jamie cos that works for masc, NB or fem presentations 😁
I think Rory/Rex would suit you
You look like an Aster to me!
Cash or Colby
Eli!
Idk why but Lucky
Firs of all love your hair! And second of all how about Devin?
Jasper, that seems like it'd  fit you! : )
Hunter
I’m getting Basil vibes
[deleted]
I get strong Charlie vibes
Lane
Taylor. Every Taylor I've met were all somewhat 'in the middle' somehow (regardless of afab or amab). Also every Taylor I've met have all been as cute as anything.

Also I like your hair. And shirt... and eye make up.
Jamie? I’m not sure if it’s masc or not but you look like a Jamie to me. Sorry if that’s weird or something
I'll second Ashley, but I really like Ash as a neutral to masc form
Asher
Arwin
Maxence

Hope any of these are of sum use!
So first off, you look fucking AMAZING

Second, I think Robyn/Robin suits you
I think Jordan might suit you!
A few options: 

Ash 

Levi (you really would suit this one!)

Kai 

Eli (this one too!)

Sky (but not Skye)

Leo (could be short for masc or fem names, but leans masc)
Avery came to mind. Good luck!
This is just me but I feel like with the picture you put you look like the name river. Hope you find a name 🥰
Definitely Borris!
Larry
Brashen
Carmen?
Cody
Sparrow
Corey
Noah or Gareth? Petey would be cute too. Sorry if these are boring names lol, but I think they are nice.
Corey
Aiden? good luck finding your name! :)
Janus
Harrison
Skylar/Skyler
Alex or Jordan maybe?
Please let us know what you choose, Sibling.
First of all I love your hair! For names I'd recommend Jaden, Rory, Kyle, Jordan or Joey
I think Eli might suit you!
Jace!
River, maybe? Or Wren!
Therren, Flynn, Marrick
Lucky, Toad, River, Cris maybe?
Cute
I thought of Jamie or April, even though the latter is considered as feminine. Jamie is also frequently used as a feminine name, but it was the first name that crossed my mind based on your picture ;-).

Or how about Wolf, Arthur, T(h)eo, Thomas  .... Best of luck finding a nice one!!

* someone also said Charlie, which would totally match the vibe!
Noodle
I'm getting MAJOR Robin vibes!
Charlie
Oooh you’re giving me Avery vibes!! 🤍
Cole has always been my favorite name. Mason is also an awesome one or Seth. Sam, Kailyn, Casey, and Alex are also nice classic androgynous choices
Irl life I and my wife took my middle name, Daniel, and turned it into Dani. Like go figure. I find ...from talking to others, if you can tweak your real name, it might make things easier. But personally, I support whatever you choose
Kai, Will, and Lee come to mind. Best of luck to you!
Devon or Denver
Alec
Charlie
Alex 💚
Lark, Raven, Drac, Kaoru, Beau, Felix, Jasper, Leo, Merry, Draco, Lucius, Jyn
Andy or Ray
u give me aether and ezra vibes
Hm, I'm thinking either 'Charlie' or 'Jamie' would fit.

Also, I'd recommend having a look at [behindthename.com](https://www.behindthename.com/), especially if you care about the etymology of the name you choose.  It's how I found my name.
Eli maybe E ? Bellamy ?
Jax
dorian,  Raviv
Tobi
I really like that name but I'm worried people will assume I use it in the feminine way
Yes Robin would be a good one! They give off major bird vibes.
Robin was the first thing I thought upon seeing this post. 🤌
Vibin super hard with Lee for them rn
Ooo I was going to suggest Cadence. But you're right, I feel Devin fits better.
I second Charlie!
Yes!!
Yes we would love to find out when you do!
Hmmm, maybe Alexander. You could always say alex too for a more androgynous vibe
This is a real concern. Where I live Sams are more likely to be female than male.
Glad you like it, I definitely think it would suit you 🤟

Have a nice weekend, and hope you enjoy the rest of your name hunt! 😁
I agree with the bird vibe. Maybe Wren or Kestrel?
I might just be kinda narcissistic but I was tempted to suggest Alex
ashton/ashtyn is one of my favorite unisex names! You could also do ashley but people will assume it’s feminine. Rubin or robin sounds great too!
Coincidentally, there's a song by a guy called Jeff Tweedy called Robin or a Wren 😂.

If you like birdy names then also possibly Jay(e) can be pretty androgynous
Yeah that's the problem with Ashley tbh unless you shorten it, people will likely assume on the fem side. Maybe Ashton would be a better alternative. I would definitely second a vote for some variant on Rubin/Ruben, that's a Hella awesome name!!"	rdy6jf	NonBinary	370	1.0	2021-12-11 11:48:20

My english teacher crossed out every single they/them pronoun in my essay and wrote he/him above it	"So we had to write an essay about parent-child relationships and how a friend's influence compares to that.

I used they/them pronouns to refer to the parent and my teacher didn't seem to like it. When she returned the essay she had crossed out all the theys and wrote he/him above it. She also left a comment at the bottom of the text saying they/them can't be used to describe a single person.

I went up to her and tried to explain why they/them in fact can be used for a single person, but she didn't want to have it."	"Webster's online even says it can be singular. Pull that up and show it to the teacher and the misgender them while talking as a power move.
Completely ignoring the nonbinary side of the conversation, They/Them is the right pronoun to use in situation were one is talking about a single person of unknown gender. IE: Someone stole my lunch. They left no clues.

I had a teacher do this in college. I just changed the gender pronoun every sentence. It got the point across that I was talking about a person whose gender I did not know.
How can she be an English teacher whilst being so ignorant about the English language? Can't tell if it was supposed to be bigoted or not, but she's wrong either way.
This day and age, take it to administration.  Not only is your teacher wrong, but shes likely alienating at least a few kids every year.  This kind of behavior can literally (ha) make a kid who is an aspiring writer lose all motivation to be creative.

I will say this though, be prepared to have a rough go.  I had a spiteful english teacher who I corrected more than once in class.  She never gave me anything more than a C on my papers, but passed me with a B knowing that she was being petty.
Ughh this sh** happened  to me in middle school... 15 years ago. Get over yourselves, crusty English teachers. 

They/them has been canonized correct in [APA style](https://apastyle.apa.org/style-grammar-guidelines/grammar/singular-they) and it even specifically says NOT to do what your teacher corrected it to. I'm not as familiar with MLA style, but at first glance [it looks like they also endorse ""they"" as a singular neutral pronoun.](https://style.mla.org/using-singular-they/)

So sorry this happened to you. Pedants gonna pedant 🤦
almost seems like intentional transphobia, at the very least its gross ignorance. sorry you have to deal with this
Hey there,

I'm a high school English teacher and I hope you get a chance to read this. Your teacher is completely wrong, morally and grammatically. Most style guides have recently adopted the singular ""they"" into their manuals. Additionally, MLA style has as well, which is used almost universally in English classes in the United states. (If you are in the states.) 

https://style.mla.org/using-singular-they/#:~:text=Specific%20Use,paper%20on%20Jane%20Austen's%20Persuasion.

Here's the link to the Modern Language Association website pertaining to the ""they"" pronoun. Good luck and I'm sorry that you had to go through this.
Fight this and make it public.
If your teacher wants more evidence, Bill Shakespeare used singular they/them 400 years ago. 

https://nyulocal.com/shakespeare-used-the-singular-they-and-so-should-you-6452240ca9e0

I'd refuse to 'fix' it.
go to the library, grab Shakespeare, throw it on her table.
Had this happening to me too on a data response home work. There was no mentioned gender so I used ""they/them"" in all of my responses and the prof just wrote: Don't use this pronoun. like is it forbidden lmao? what was one even supposed to use? I'm not gonna go assume someone's identity out of their opinions, tf?!
Hi, Nonbinary/ English Honors Major/ High School English Teacher here.

Your teacher is wrong and a jerk; regardless of whether 'they' is considered grammatically correct or not. Most important is people and respecting and validating their experiences. Literally everything in the world that humans do, all the rules, all the customs are made up and ordered by people. When systems stop working (or if they never worked) for people, it's time to dismantle and re-establish them. Weirdly...language, while often considered precise by nature...is included in this (consider how words change: what words were offensive in the past and are no longer, or words that are offensive now but weren't in the past).

Language, syntax etc. changes over time. New words are invented to describe experiences and new objects, old words are redefined or 'taken back' with intention (queer for instance) and this evolution in language is not new! If you compare 'classic' works over time written by people like Chaucer, Shakespeare, Austen, Poe, Tolkien etc, you'll notice they don't speak the same way we do, that some words seem out of place to us now because they have different contemporary meanings, and that sometimes it seems like reading a completely different language even though it's all in 'English'.

Why do people resist it? As mentioned, we already use 'they' when discussing a person of unknown gender. The easy answer is people like rules, people like systems, people don't like to question what they know. People seek comfort in he familiar, even if they familiar doesn't make sense or is maladaptive. There are terrified/or pretentious sticklers out there who are set in their ways of thinking, clinging to the idea that he world is black and white and unchanging, and who refuse to acknowledge that language evolves over time. People often violently reject things that make them question the clarity of the lens through which they see the world, and often fight back hardest against the things that hit too close to home.

In my experience, you will run into resistance with they/them at any level of writing; from hs essays to thesis defense. Id say that doesn't mean don't do it. When I was in University, I had one prof teaching a fourth year honors class that spent a whole class talking about how they could not be used to describe a singular person because GRAMMAR (he taught 18th century sentimentality...he was a really boring dude). He marked people down for it and was always a pretentious experience to be around. Literally on the other side of the hall was a prof teaching a fourth year honors class where we were actively dismantling the gender binary and writing about queer authors and characters who used 'they/them' pronouns.

Long story short...some people can't fathom that what they know isn't absolute, that things change over time, and that gender is just another construct that we created. We should use gender and language to express ourselves and make room for each other.
I had a college professor do this. He did the same thing on my paper as yours, crossing out all the they/them pronouns and writing that he/him were the ""proper"" rules. It was passed off as, ""Oh, that's just how we do it,"" as if it were just another academic writing convention. But it was one of those rules that was enforced more than the rest. For instance, a more critical fail like not citing sources was just an 'oops', but using they/them pronouns to refer to someone without gender was like committing academic treason.

That is to say, it wasn't about correcting a mistake, it was about enforcing male supremacy in academia, where men are the expected default and women and non-binary people are rare exceptions. Worse, all that is hidden under the guise of a simple academic convention. If I wanted a better grade, I had to prove that I accept this belief by only using he/him pronouns to refer to genderless entities like police, nurses, writers, and scientists. 

I'm not sure if your teacher is doing that on purpose, but either way it's extremely destructive.  It's one thing to explicitly say, ""Only men should be in academia."" It's another thing entirely to package that belief in a writing convention to make YOU feel stupid for being ""wrong."" It took me a while to unpack this and understand why I felt disempowered. If you feel the same way here, I just want you to know this is a thing, it needs to change, and you were never wrong.
Bring it to the principal. If it becomes a real problem then file a discrimination complaint.
Revise it for your teacher, switching out the they/them for whatever pronoun you want. Then put a footnote on all them.

¹ Person's gender is unknown; the pronoun he/his was used in reference.

³ Person's gender is unknown; the pronoun they/them was used in reference.
⁴ Person's gender is unknown; the pronoun xe/xem was used in reference.

Ok im sorry how did she become and english teacher????
For your teacher: https://youtu.be/imK17HQ6dy8

Many of the most celebrated authors in history have used they/them singular
Wrong. Feel free to reference merriam-webster's [definition 3d](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/they) for They, OR the definition 3c if she's close-minded. If she won't hear you out in person, you can email her the explanation and cc the head of your school's english department and a school admin. Make sure to mention how you tried to explain this before in person. It might feel extra because she'll act like it is but fuck her opinion, she's actively invalidating her enby students.
Ew. Not only a pedant, but one that does it wrong.
I’d report them to administration but I don’t think that would really do much.
That’s as bad as verbally misgendering them. Even tho they/them according to my English teacher is correct one semester. And she was accepting of gender neutral
I had an English professor in college do this. She refused to let us use gender neutral pronouns because it wasn't 'grammatically correct.' The worst part is that she would use the fact that one of her kids is non-binary as an excuse, i.e., ""I'm not being transphobic, my oldest is non-binary, it's just a language rule"" (which is a straight up lie; we used MLA format and MLA even says that they/them are *either* plural or singular gender neutral).
What a shithead....
Since Estonian doesn't have gendered pronouns I decided to ha e some fun in English class. We had to translate sentences and o e of them was something along the lines of ""they took their girlfriend to the zoo""
So obviously I translated it into ""She took her girlfriend to the zoo"" The teaches crossed out the ""she""s and corrected them to ""he""s, don't remember of she took points off for it tho..
I had a few teachers who didn't like singular they. I would just ditch pronouns all together and say use ""one"" instead. Like, ""Next, one pours the solution into two separate test tubes."" or ""When approaching this subject, one should always consider the following possibilities"". 

This worked well in lab reports.
it depends on what its for,,, on ACT prep the grading people themselves don't accept they/them but in classroom settings outside of standard tests it should be 100% acceptable especially when a patient's gender is unknown it's obviously better to just use they/them??? I have a bone to pick with this teacher >:^(
bibbity bobbity rip her limbs off
I agree with the advice. Document the exchange with your teacher. Make a copy of your paper and submit it to administration with a written explanation of what your teacher told you and how you tried to address the concern with her. It sounds like she needs some diversity and cultural sensitivity training. All administration is worried about discrimination lawsuits so it should be addressed in-house.
NGL I probably would have asked her 'but how did you know I was talking about a male? What if I was talking about a female? And what if I felt this applied to *either* parent, meaning I was actually using it to denote either of **THEM,**  because **THEY** could both do x, y or z.'

But I recognize I benefited from an extremely supportive home situation where if the teacher reached out to home (I am, of course, guessing this is not a college/uni professor in this situation, and if I'm wrong I'm even more sorry), my mom would have backed me up. I can see how, if someone didn't have that kind of situation, it would be hard to address the issue.
Your teacher’s an idiot, and I say this as a teacher. A modicum of research will demonstrate that singular *they* has been arrested for at least 600 years—i.e. the entire life of the modern English language. The attempt to strike it from the language is a recent movement by prescriptivists, and it’s not the sort of thing any proper scholar would be on board with.

This is a case of a teacher pushing a conservative political agenda and trying to hide behind the profession while doing it.
Also lay it on that biznach that singular they has documented use as early as the mid 14th century. 
So there.
WTF THATS SO UNPROFESSIONAL, WHAT A DICK
AN ENGLISH TEACHER SHOULD KNOW BETTER THAN ANYONE THAT THEY/THEM CAN BE USED SINGULARLY
I'm not here to hate - I'm just trying to understand.

Did the essay mention the FATHER or MOTHER?

It would make sense if you didn't know if it was a male/female... so used ""they"" to refer to the parent... but I'm unsure if you're arguing that the FATHER or MOTHER's gender is being assumed (which is the nonbinary stance).
Also (assuming this is English class) MLA format includes they/them as grammatically correct usage for singular pronouns. This is the standard for correct usage. If she has further complaints ask her for the reason, given that it is grammatically correct.

Here ya go:  [How do I use singular they? | The MLA Style Center](https://style.mla.org/using-singular-they/)
> Webster's online even says it can be singular. Pull that up and show it to the teacher

Yes.

>and the[n] misgender them while talking as a power move.

No.
[deleted]
Hehe. Using this one if ever necessary.
Not to sound jaded but I know far too many teachers who enjoy being a big intellectual fish in a small pond. I have to put up with one at my knitting group who argues about everything like she’s infallible, I believe because she’s the be all and end all to a room of 10 year olds, day in, day out.
Yes! It's completely accepted in MLA format.
Thanks a lot. With this I finally have a solid argument I can bring up. Though I don't live in the states, I think it's still gonna be useful.
Fuck cancel culture.
To build on this, if your teacher doesn't think an article like this is a ""good enough"" source, the Oxford English Dictionary also mentions that it was used as a singular pronoun since at least 1450. It's entry 2b, ""With an antecedent referring to an individual generically or indefinitely (e.g. someone, a person, the student), used esp. so as to make a general reference to such an individual without specifying gender"" (citation: ""they, pron., adj., adv., and n."" *OED Online*, Oxford University Press, December 2020, [www.oed.com/view/Entry/200700](https://www.oed.com/view/Entry/200700).)
This is the best comment in the thread and I'm so furious at these teachers.

Now that I'm an adult I've come to realize what a power trip so many teachers/profs are really on
Well, the essay didn't mention the father or mother, it wasn't even stipulated whether it's a single parent or not, so I used 'they' since I didn't know the gender of the parent.
The teacher also understood this so that isn't the problem. Rather it's the usage of he/him as a 'gender neutral' pronoun and denying that they/them can be used as a singular pronoun that upset me.
I've since had a discussion with the teacher and cleared it up. I'm now allowed to use 'they' as a singular pronoun as ling as I make it clear that the text is written in gender neutral language.😁
same with APA 7th edition, in fact they encourage using they/them as opposed to gendered pronouns!!
That I did not know. Thank you.
Imagine being a person who has to lord over 10 year olds to feel smart. Must be rough tbh.
o_O huh?
It has been singular since English was Middle English
Thanks for the response. Hmm, interesting.

I'm more of a conservative on these issues, so I'm just trying to get to know them better (as there seems to be a lot of conflation online between gender/sex/male/man/he etc). 

So... as I'm understanding it:

-You didn't know if the 'parent' in this case was the MOTHER (female) or the FATHER (male) of the child.

-Because of this, you used 'they/them' as a gender neutral pronoun (rather than she/her or he/him).

-Your teacher crossed 'they/them' out, stating that 'they/them' is plural and therefore, wrong.

-Your teacher then replaced it with 'he/him', because it's singular.

-Your problem is that 'he/him' is being used as a gender neutral pronoun.

-You don't know if the parent is the MOTHER (female, she/her) or the FATHER (male, he/him) of the child.

-You're upset that, in the absence of clarity, 'he/him' somehow becomes the automatic pronoun - instead of they/them.

Did I get that right? If so, I completely agree with you and you make a lot of sense. 

Just to be clear:

You are *NOT* upset that the theoretical FATHER (male) might identity as 'they/them' and is having his pronouns assumed by your teacher... in the chance that he is non-binary?

Am I correct?
People were using ""they"" as a singular back when nobody said ""you,"" but said ""thou"" (singular) and ""ye"" (plural) instead. Then the French came to England and everything got even weirder.
Correct. 
While I would probably also be upset if the parent was written to be non-binary and my teacher assumed they were male, that isn't the case at all. 
My teacher simply didn't accept 'they' as a gender neutral singular pronoun and wanted me to use 'he', which I didn't agree with because while it is grammatically correct, everyone who reads 'he' will assume the mentioned person is male, while it was my intention not to specify the gender of the parent because that was beside the point of the essay and therefore unnessecary."	ke7n5l	NonBinary	372	0.99	2020-12-16 11:36:26

one year of being true to my new name and pronouns 🦋		"I. LOVE. YOUR. MAKEUP. AND. GLASSES. you’re a cottagecore deity
Amazing!
you look so good and i’m so envioussss

i’m a 15yo fat amab with acne. no matter how much i exercise, i can’t change it.
You look like Willow from the Owl House! I love your outfit and makeup :D I wish I had that kind of appearance witchcraft skill heh
Your makeup look and outfit are stunning ❤️
YOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO

U LOOKS SO ADORABLE OMG
I really like your outfit! That shirt is so lovely, especially the pattern and placement of it.
You look so cute?? I love everything about this, the makeup and hair *especially*
Happy one year! ❤️❤️ So happy for u
I LOVE the shorts!! Must have. ♥️
thank you :D
i really tried on my make-up and I'm building a cottagecore wardrobe
I'm so sorry dear :<


you don't need to be a certain size tho, there is beautiful fashion for curvy women


and I've been there, I'm 20 years old now (still look like a child) and my teen years were pretty bad. i was called ""mine field"" cus of my acne and people would make disgusted faces looking at me or my tummy. hormones will regulate and that will help and with time you learn what looks good on you💙 all the luck and love to you 🦋✨
it seems hopeless, but as long as there's there's goodness that can happen
Did you know that the key to losing weight is you have to accept the fact you are the way you are and cant do anything but love yourself? Its very true! I know its hard to love yourself right now, ive been in the same situation. Since i was 15, i kept gaining and gaining weight, for 3 years. Once i turned 18, i started to really start being myself and loving myself, and i lost 50lbs in one year, without even trying. You can work out and eat healthy, but it really comes down to loving yourself and being kind to yourself. You are human, we all are human, people get acne on and off thier whole life! I never used to get acne and now i get it about every 4 months. Dont care what other people think of you, all that matters is how YOU think of you. 

I know one day youll look in the mirror and be so happy with who looks back at you <3 best of luck
OMG I SEE THAT THEY ARE LITERALLY WILLOW WITH DIFF NAME & (PROBABLY) PRONOUNS
THANK YOU!! I LOVE THE OWL HOUSE
haha, maybe i should cosplay her

THANK YOUUUUU
thank you, it's an ""ie"", a traditional shirt from my country. I'm trying to implement my culture in my everyday outfits

"I turned 30 and realized that ""lesbian"" doesn't cover it, this is my first post coming out as nonbinary! How did you all end up finding the pronouns that feel right for you?"		"[deleted]
Hello, non-binary friend! You may want to check out /r/TransTryouts and [pronoun dressing room](http://www.pronouns.failedslacker.com/) :)
I'm so happy for you! Welcome to the community 💜
I think it's about asking people to use it to refer to you and see which one you like the most.
I actually felt a bit off being referred to as she/her for years. It just felt not me. They/them feels like it gives me the freedom to be me, outside of gender
Welcome, and congrats! For me, I knew that she/her just felt wrong, so I asked my people to use he/they so I could see which felt better. Turns out, they both feel good! Do you have a good friend or two that you can test-drive pronouns with?
Congrats on figuring yourself out!

When it comes to pronouns, it gives me a weird feeling when he/him or she/her gets applied to me. Im comfortable with they/them pronouns, but I am also interested in trying out neopronouns as well, particularly xe/xem or ze/zem. I recently gave an old OC of mine ze/zem pronouns and it gave me euphoria, so I kind of expect that if I ever get around to testing it properly that itll click. But its hard to get anybody irl to test things out since theres so few accepting people around
It was and still is they/them for me because she felt like I was being misgendered (afab). The future may hold he/they for me though! Like a lot of people are suggesting asking a few pals to test drive new pronouns for you can be useful and affirming! My partner calls me their boyfriend and that feels very euphoric.
congrats and welcome! i thought i was going to stay with my agab pronouns, because i hated when strangers assumed i was a man from behind. before coming out i asked a few friends to use they/them for me, and started considering using he/him but only in my native language (gendered language so it would be a BIG difference). i thought i hated he/him in english, but eventually it just came to mind and i asked my friends to call me that, and now it sticks. :\] take your time and try a few different ones until it's right!
How did you all end up finding the pronouns that feel right for you?

You stop worrying about them.
I had my friends talk to me/about me with different pronouns until it felt right. I use they/them with the occasionally more masculine terms. It's all about what feels right when you hear it! I also suggest, if possible, having someone record themselves talking about you different pronouns and listening to them until you know what fits. This is useful for name changes too.
Can I borrow your jaw line? Also, welcome! I talked to myself using pronouns I wanted to try. Also ask buds to try em out over text ☺️
Hi, a very warm welcome to you. I just stumbled onto a nonbinary wiki one day and found one I liked in the list of pronouns they had. Turns out ""A"" ist exactly what I was looking for.
Uhhh you give me feelings 😻
Congratulations and welcome to the 30+ enbies club! ;)

I started off just putting she/they in all my social media to see how that felt (nobody seemed to notice), and over time I realized I would really like it if people just used they. After several months of feeling that way, I finally decided to tell my friends I’d like to use they/them, and then I made announcements on my socials, and it felt great! I then got some “they” pins and necklaces and that also felt great, so for now I’m feeling like “they” is working for me :) It’s a very personal decision though!
Omg...Your eyes are amazing 💖💖
I gave up and just said “ah whatever, you decide. Do the main gender neutral one if you don’t know either I guess”
Same here, and the first time a trans friend threw in a they/them for me in convo I got the BIGGEST smile on my face.  The only reason I kept she/her with they/them for a bit was to feel like it was still my choice when ppl used she/her pronouns but realized that’s not me being authentic.
I can definitely relate to that! Whenever people use ""she"" in relation to me it feels wrong somehow, even if no one else notices the way I do. Thanks for your insight
I second this! Both excellent resources for the newly hatched trans and nb people out there
Thank you!
I did that with “they/them” and couldn’t stop smiling so I knew what was right for me :)
HAHA! yes anytime. Thank you!
I'm thinking of trying shifting mine from she/they to they/she, since it feels like almost everyone just defaults to ""she"" because it's more familiar.
thank you 🥺!
Yeah, that was a big motivator for me as well. Realistically, “she” doesn’t bother me that much, but I do prefer “they”, and I knew that if I gave people “she” as an option they’d always take it"	o0ef4o	NonBinary	351	1.0	2021-06-15 13:31:06
hey, recently just figured out that I may be non-binary. Still not brave enough to correct people on pronouns tho		"Congrats! And me too, I can't bring myself to correct people on my pronouns and I've been out for 2 years haha
That's alright, honestly. The last time I tried correcting someone they went full interrogation mode on me and it's just too much trying to explain it to people who won't even try to understand. I suggest correcting people who are closest to you as frequently as possible and then gradually move on to outer circles.
Firstly, congrats!!!! Figuring out who you are is really hard and scary so you should be really proud of yourself. Second, welcome to the community!!! You have support and understanding here, i don’t like correcting people either, i kind of just live with it but we have each other and that is such a wonderful thing ❤️
You'll get there! Just takes time, congrats on this step in ur life!
You are valid and brave regardless of if you correct ppl on your pronouns. 

Sending love ❤️
Sick costal battery tho
Same tho i have only come out to a few friends about my sexuality and now here comes the pronouns-
Welcome to the party, friend. All these wonderful people are here to support you. Congratulations.
big nonbinary vibes in this pic!!
Big mood haha, I can't either. Congratulations on that self-discovery tho!!
Congratulations!  
Having recently gone through the process of coming out and actually letting people know my pronouns, it's a challenging stage, but worth it. It's taken me several years and a REALLY supportive online community to help me get to this point, so don't feel like you have to rush yourself in anything.  
You're awesome. :D
Congrats to you! You look gorgeous btw :)
Thank you! I'm sure we'll get there one day lol. Doesn't help that I look, act and speak quite masc
Okay, thanks for the advice!
Thanks! I'm feeling the love already 💜🖤
Thank you, fingers crossed
Your love is received gratefully 💜🖤
It was at a castle I visited last week in Barcelona
Yeah can be a bit much, had a hard enough time explaining what pansexuality was
Yeah I see that now. Been feeling the love all day
Whoop whoop!
Thanks! Maybe one day we can both take that step
Thank you kindly!
I've never been called gorgeous, you're gonna make me cry 😭
Hey, you be you. I still look act and speak quite femme but I'm still nb, my pronouns are still they/them and people are capable of learning about what lay beyond the binary!
Very true! Already feeling the love
One thing this sub helped me with is that I don’t have to be androgynous to be valid. NB does not equal androgyny, we are not limited by the standards society places on us.
I feel the same way about this sub. It is so affirming to see non-binary folx presenting in so many ways. There is no ""right way"" to be NB 🖤💜🤍💛"	ucdt2e	NonBinary	351	1.0	2022-04-26 14:27:26
I think I might be trans non binary but my girlfriend is a radfem: what can I do? ( trigger warning ⚠️ )	"Hello! I'm the same person who wrote about dysphoria and wanting to go back transitioning. 

My dysphoria came back after 2 years of being ""gone"" (and by """" I mean that I'm thinking some aspects of my condition didn't went away all this time). I have dysphoria since I was 14yo and received and formal diagnosis at 17. I wanted to transition really bad by undergoing top surgery and microdosing T.

I talked about my friends about this: dysphoria, being confused and thinking that I tried to suppress my symptoms and desire for transitioning. They were very welcoming and I felt safe! 

Well, not the same happened to my girlfriend. I'll be honest: she is a radfem and I used to think somethings like her in the past (maybe due to projection or something), but not anymore. I didn't say anything about transitioning itself, I tried at first talking about my dysphoria and she said it could be ""me wanting to fit beauty standards"" (even tho I do already do fit, I'm white and have a thin body, except for being masc), ""internalized misogyny"" (even tho I dont feel offended being called a woman and etc), that maybe ""dont think I can be a woman just for being masc"" and other things like that. I said to her that me knowing those things won't make my dysphoria go away and that is something much more deeper.

One day I posted on my twitter a drawing I made of myself happy with a flat chest from top surgery. She and a friend of hers got upset. My girlfriend tried to argue the same thing. She even said she thought she was trans to, but she realized it came from s.a.. I thought that speech was really heavy and dishonest. Isn't that similar to saying gay people are gay just because ""they were s.a.""?

And that's not all: she usually makes fun of trans people, specially non binary. From my perspective, I think she tries to justify the transgender experience with just her personal perceptions, based on her own ideology, also with ""scientific facts"" that are not even a consensus in the scientific community, which I warned her about, such as ""autogynephilia"" and etc. She makes attempts to put all trans people in the same box: trans men are just ""poor women with internalized misoginy"", trans women ""gay men who can't accept themselves"" and that enbies are ""not really trans"". I find it funny that she usually misgender trans people she thinks are ""not really trans"", but if she's talking about a trans person who are ""not queer""/conservative, she uses their preferred pronouns. I pointed this behavior of hers, but she got kinda silent lol. I find it very simplistic to condition a group of people to the same negative thing, given that they are diverse and have VERY complex experiences.

It's easy to mock a group of people when you don't pass what they go though. And I get mad because that's also mocking my past experience. Yes, I did the same in the past, probably to feel better about myself and hide my desire for transition, but I don't want to be that kind of person anymore. Is not good, for me and for others, to talk negative things about a group ALL THE TIME. I feel bad and embarrassed by that.

I don't know what to do. I'm really upset and I don't feel safe with her to talk about this. (I edited the post to put more information and correct some gramatical mistakes)."	"she sounds like an awful person and not an ally to you or the trans community. maybe I'm just tired from all the anti-trans legislation going on in my country but I would run away fast if I were you. a loved one is supposed to support you, not perpetuate hate towards you. don't let a transphobe tell you who you are.
>I don’t feel safe with her to talk about this.

All you need to focus on is leaving her. She will not change, she will not see it from your perspective, she will continue to spout untrue and harmful bullshit to refute your identity. You may have feelings about her but she does not care about you as a whole person. This is not someone you can trust or feel safe around, there’s no point in staying with them or trying to change her mind. Start getting your affairs in order if you live with her because things will not improve and you deserve to pursue transition if it will make you happy.
Even if you weren’t non-binary I would suggest breaking up with her because she is an asshole
I don't see how this can work out in any healthy way if she's relying on pseudoscientific arguments to defend deliberate cissexism, and you can't feel safe - much less seen or accepted - in your relationship. I'm sorry. Best wishes.
That is such an awful place to be; having to chose between your relationship and your gender identity. I'm sure she has a lot of wonderful attributes which weren't included in the post, which is why you got with her in the first place. But it does sound like you'll never be able to explore your gender identity, and those dysphoric feelings probably won't just go away on their own.  We all end up suppressing parts of ourselves in relationships (i.e. I love musicals and my partner hates them so I don't watch them around him), but gender identity is a really big part. If it's too big of a part, you'll likely end up resenting her or feeling unfulfilled in your self. I could tell you what I think you should do, based on my perceptive, but I don't know how it feels to be you. You're the only one who can determine if the dysphoria/desire to transition is something you can bottle up, and if she's worth it.  Best of luck my friend, whichever way you decide.
have some respect for yourself and break up with her!! life is too short to deal with radfems
Please leave her
You literally don't like your girlfriend. You admitted it. Breakup.
Leave her? Im sorry sounds like a no brainer to me. 

People that don't accept you for you are not worth keeping around.

You'll eventually find someone else more compatible, you'll hurt for a while but you'll be glad you did yourself a favour by choosing your life over a temporary person.

I don't want to sound like I'm dismissing your relationships but relationships aren't everything. If being with a person makes you miserable then you shouldn't be with them.
You are not safe with her to talk about this, because she is clearly not safe. She needs to be let go. She is not supporting you by mocking and downplaying your lived experience and knowledge of yourself.

It genuinely makes me suspicious that maybe she really has felt a lot of the same but has ""successfully"" packed it away with internalized transphobia of her own... 🤷 Many many people who can't accept that they might be trans (or gay, or nonbinary) will find defense mechanisms that include shooting down that minority as a way of distancing themself from it...

Even so. She sounds extremely toxic on this front, and that's not someone you should be with even if you weren't personally the affected minority.
Please realize that even if you do realize you are cis, you are dating a transphobe. Can you really live with the fact that you love and are romantically involved with a transphobic person at a time where trans violence is at an all time high and the lives of young trans children are at stake?
Break up with her
I'm sorry but your gf and her friend sound like terrible people. TERFS are bad people, full stop.

I would remove them from my life
just as she has the right to end your relationship if you transition, you have the right to protect yourself, your well-being, and your dignity by not allowing your fear of someone's reaction keep you from transitioning. you are worth far more than the respect you are receiving, and i strongly recommend you reevaluate what positive things this relationship is bringing to you when such an important part of your life is being dismissed, downplayed, and disrespected. transitioning can make us lose people in the process, but it also guides us to the people who love us most no matter what path we undergo. you deserve better than this relationship.
She sounds like, at best, a person with an awful lot of trauma to unpack from several sides and an identity to unpack as well, and at worst, a great big transphobe. Either way, you deserve better. Your partner should make you feel safe and accept you always. One day, she may learn and grow, but you do not have to be the testing ground for her to do so. You deserve better.
I also give this advice to all the bisexual people who are in straight relationships and feel like they can’t talk to their partner about it… DO NOT TOLERATE ANY KIND OF RELATIONSHIPS THAT DOESN’T RESPECT THE WHOLE YOU.
Your girlfriend is not a ""radical feminist"", she's not out burning bras, she's a **TE**RF, she's a shitty fucking transphobe.  The hell with her and her asshole friends.  Get yourself out of this relationship, she is not a good or healthy person for you to be with.
Only read the title. Your only option is to be direct, honest, and authentic. If she can't accept you, or isn't willing to try in some capacity, you have to decide whether or not she is worth the stress in your life moving forward. She is either with you or behind you. Your health and all comes first.
it sounds scary but you need to leave. I had a doctor who refused to give me HRT due to my past with SA and as soon as she said those words out loud I immediately decided to never go back again. ive been on T for nearly two years now.
if you do not feel safe with her now, you will not feel safe with her. this is not the person you want to spend your energy on. she will not help you grow.
**break up with her.** she is not a safe person to be around, and she’s not a good person in general. radfems are a hate group and you’d be best off getting far away from her.
I understand you're going through a lot and that you must care about your girlfriend. I have to be honest though, as someone who has been repeatedly told awful things by self proclaimed radfems, I cannot support them at all. Again, I understand she must have good qualities and that you care about her. I also hope that you find it in yourself one day to accept yourself and cut anybody who describes themselves as a radfem out of your life, because as long as she identities as one she will never accept you. She will try to tell you awful things about being trans and why you feel the way you do. You don't need that, especially when you're so early on in questioning. 

It is okay that you have this past because you are learning now. It's always okay to change our hearts and minds and be kinder. As long as she still identifies as a radfem, she is surrounding herself by some of the most hateful people. It doesn't take much googling to find cases of radfems and TERFS doing everything up to and including murdering trans women. 

Radfems and TERFS are genuinely dangerous people. I don't say that lightly. Again, I hope you find it in yourself to accept who you are and continue to learn and find people who aren't so hateful to be in your life.
She does not sound like she is very loving towards you.
If you don't want to be that kind of person anymore, why date that person? She's not going to change any time soon and it's not your job to make her a better person
get a new girlfriend
Sounds like a piece of shit

Find someone better
Just ask yourself if you want to be with someone you don’t feel safe to be yourself around. or do you deserve to be with someone who loves you for who you are and fully supports you in your journey of exploring your gender and identity. the answers to these questions will make it clear as to what you should do for yourself. 
whenever you’re ready, i’m sure you will find a way to be true to yourself and choose what you deserve.
Leave that rude ass transphobe
Dump her. She sounds absolutely horrible, and no person is worth staying with if they disrespect you for being who you want to be.
I would urge you to leave this relationship, if you can.  I was in a similarly terrible relationship before I started transitioning, and it held me back for years and caused so much misery that made it even harder to accept myself later.  These people almost never change, and even if her views somehow changed, it sounds like she's being emotionally abusive in ways that often are even more ingrained than bad viewpoints.
I highly recommend reading some essays by Dr. Devon Price, like *Irreversible Healing: What Testosterone has Done for Me* [here](https://devonprice.medium.com/irreversible-healing-what-testosterone-has-done-for-me-6e4b2f086823) or *My Dalliance with Detransition* [here](https://devonprice.medium.com/my-dalliance-with-detransition-97ac9a5126e6). He is pretty honest about his transition and difficulties before, during, after. He is also very adamant about not lying to ourselves, and figuring out ways to be more comfortable and satisfied as a result.
Y'know, from experience with that sad excuse for a community, a lot of ""radfems"" are actually trans, they're just too broke, too cowardly, and too oblivious to know it. 

Many of them have severe androphobia due to trauma and it leaks out into every aspect of their lives. 

For your own mental health, get out of that relationship. It's not worth the amount of work.
I also fell somewhat down the radfem pipeline before I accepted that I’m nonbinary- biological essentialism and black and white thinking feels simple and somewhat comforting but in truth the world is far far more complex than radfem ideology allows for. 

You should leave your girlfriend- she is actively hindering your journey of learning who you are. No one needs to know why you’ve broken up with her, people end relationships for all sorts of things. Most people will accept that you just didn’t feel romantically for her any more. 

The most important thing is that you are able to self reflect and develop without feeling scrutinised by someone who will judge your identity.
Even if you're not trans she's still a piece of shit and your relationship is conditional
Breakup with her, she’s clearly not a safe person for you and she may even cause you to slip back into your old ways, and the whole “being trans bc of SA” Is disgusting and is extremely transphobic. You should be allowed to transition and be whoever you want to be and she’s holding you back from that when she’s meant to support you. You should get away from you before she goes full TERF
Everyone saying you have to leave her clearly hasn’t been in any situation like this. Firstly, I’m so sorry you’re going through this. It’s so tough. I really, really hope things work out. 

Maybe seek out advice from friends- specifically mutual friends. You want advice and help without painting her as the villain and being told by everyone in your circle to split. These friends could have separate conversations with her (not about you, just the subject)

You could do some things to ‘ease’ her into it. Go to different community events, pride things, etc. Repost resources and things on your social media stories; things about accepting ALL LGBT+ people, things about trans rights, etc. 

At the end of the day though, it’s your decision. You get to choose how much time and energy you want to put into educating her. No matter what you do choose, I really do wish you the best of luck and peace of mind
Break up with her. Honestly. She will never accept you as you are, she won't even entertain the idea and would rather talk you out of it :/
You're feelings make a lot of sense. That feels like a direct conflict between your romantic relationship and your personal identity. Both integral things you don't want to have pitted against each other!

You could tell her all of this. If you think there's any hope of carrying on with the relationship, she would need to hear and understand all of that. I don't know her, so I don't know if that's likely.
this is going to sound harsh, but I wouldn’t recommend staying in a relationship with her. Even if you can get her to change her mind (which sounds extremely difficult at this point in time) it’ll take a lot of time and emotional energy. as someone who had a radfem best friend while i was 17 and finally accepting that i was trans (though i first verbally expressed maybe not being cis when i was 14), it’ll take a while to undo the damage that people like that have on you. and it truly held me back. I probably would’ve started t a lot sooner, considered top surgery a lot sooner, and changed my name a lot sooner if she hadn’t been against all those things for me. if someone’s actively mocking the trans community, they probably are gonna bring you a lot of strife to keep in your circle
The fact that your friends are supportive of you is a sign that there are people out there that will accept you for who you are. You deserve better than whatever the hell she's been giving you, and I would imagine you'd be better off without her transphobic views in your life. I don't see her changing anytime soon :(
(i didn't find out which pronouns you prefer so i am going with they / them, i hope that's okay)
when i read your post, i thought: good, this person understands exactly what is going on with their girlfriend. i think you already know what to do. you gave me a pretty good picture of your situation. she is not respecting or recognising how you feel, because of her own way of seeing things.
maybe really consider taking a break from each other. i bet that's what's on your mind too.
you can try that and see if you feel better when she is not around. maybe you find to your true self faster without her.
(Apologies for long comment)
as a nonbinary dyke who considers themselves somewhat radfem (trans affirming+believes that Women's Lib and Trans Lib go hand in hand) I think you might want to sit with the hard truth that your gf is unlikely to come around to your way of thinking anytime soon. From what you described, she is heavily peaked/indoctrinated into gender critical ideology, and it's likely she is surrounded by an online community that will provide her with built in ""explanations"" as to why you want to seek transition. If you stay together and go on T/get top surgery, best case scenario, she goes along with it while secretly pitying you/not taking it seriously. Worst case, she'll actively try to undermine your medical choices with the encouragement of her GC friends. In either scenario, your relationship will become incompatible with your happiness, If it already isnt. 

That being said, I have talked to quite a few ex TERFs/GCs who've managed to break out of the ideology, (it sounds like you were one of them) so it's not impossible for her to change. If you want to go that route, the best way to approach it is to introduce pro trans talking points through a radfem framework.  @aletheia327 on Twitter is an ex TERF but still radfem who writes often about why she was attracted to GC ideology until she realized it was reactionary, transphobic, and anti feminist. it might be easier for her to digest if she hears critique of her view from someone who doesn't inherently see trans rights through the lense of a queer people vs feminism culture war. I would also look into the work of Leslie Feinberg, a historical lesbian and transgender activist who considered zirself both transgender and a lesbian (by modern queer terminology would prob be described as a transmasc butch), which might help her understand the complexities and nuances of the trans experience.

Realistically, I don't know how much success that will reap, since it sounds like you've been trying and extending her a lot of patience to no avail. And I know it's devastating to realize you love someone who is slowly killing you inside. But ultimately, you know you've felt this way since you were 14. you know that no amount of ""unpacking internalized misogyny"" will make this go away, because you've already tried. And you deserve to surround yourself with people who make you feel safe and don't project their own gender related trauma onto you and dismiss you. And if she can't be that person for you, it might be time to let her go. 
Sending you all my love. I'm so sorry you're going through this, and I hope you come to the conclusion that's best for you and your health, not your girlfriend's comfort.
Radfeminism breeds terfs. She is not in your corner.
I understand being in a difficult relationship and being afraid to leave or feeling as though maybe things will work out or that you can get her to change but please, it’s not worth it. I ended a relationship with a bigoted partner two years ago after I couldn’t take pretending to be cis any longer. It was one of the hardest things I’ve ever done but things are so much better now that I have the room to grow and be myself. You deserve that!! Your current relationship is not worth the pain of suppressing who you are and it will destroy you to keep going the way things are
Make sure you have a support group like a friend or family that knows you're breaking things off and safely break up with her. Radfem's believe in very dangerous stuff, and i'd suggest going with your own judgement regarding how you break things off. Please stay safe
She sounds awful.
I would leave someone like that
Who you are has NOTHING to do with who you’re dating. Don’t compromise your identity for her. I did and regret it.
she doesn't sound like a healthy person to have a relationship with. you (and everyone!!) deserve to have relationships with people who respect you and make you feel safe. not the same but i have been in a situation where i felt like i couldn't tell my partner things because i was worried about the way they would react and it's not a good way to live. if you'd like some support feel free to message me if you think it would help you 💓
One is supposed to feel safe around a partner. If you don't it's not a person who deserves you
Personally I would break up with someone like this, whether or not I was ultimately trans. I don't date openly racist people either, even though they wouldn't be racist against *me* because I'm white. Staying with someone like this is a tacit endorsement of their beliefs imo. Dating her is a problem regardless of whether you ultimately decide you're trans, and excising this particular tumor should be done sooner rather than later. For both of your sakes, and especially because she's creating a really unhealthy environment to try to explore your gender identity in.
Break up with her. Seriously. If this is how she is now, it's likely not going to get better in the future. You deserve to be with someone you can be yourself with.
This entire post feels like a giant red flag. She's constantly dismissing your ideas immediately, mocking a group of people she knows nothing about, and I think the worst part is the quote ""I don't feel safe with her to talk about this."" A romantic partner should be someone who you feel comfortable sharing your struggles and questions with without any fear, who you feel safe to talk to. I'm not just going to say ""Leave her she's terrible"" or anything because I don't know what she's like outside of this issue, but this does feel like you either need to have a discussion about it, or break up with her.
Someone you're dating should be someone who supports you, someone who you feel safe around, someone who accepts all of you not just the parts they like, someone who you can trust. Please ask yourself if all, or any, of these apply to your girlfriend. And if they don't, ask yourself why she's your girlfriend.
I give you permission to break up with her 🖤🖤🖤
Honestly, if you can work up the courage to, then I'd tell her. Depending on her reaction (as in if it's seemingly neutral or better), then I'd probably give her some time to see if her general behaviour towards trans and nonbinary people changes. If it doesn't, then she fundamentally would not respect you as a person, only her idea of you, and that's not the foundations of a lasting positive relationship.
Tbh even if you were cisgender I’d tell you to break up with her.

She’s a toxic asshole with shitty views and you can do so much better. She won’t let you be who you want to be, and it’s not your job to “fix” her. Call it there, and end it. Don’t even be friends, she doesn’t deserve it, and you don’t deserve to have to put up with someone like her.
Run. Get as far away as you can. That is fucking terrifying. You deserve better, and I don't mean to sound dramatic or scare you, but people like her can be dangerous. ***Please*** be careful. The fact that you don't feel safe talking with her about this shows just how precarious your situation is. Listen to your instincts. Surround yourself with people who love and care about you and will protect you. I personally would view this as a domestic abuse-type situation, and the period of getting away from the abuser is always the most dangerous time.
If she can not grow to accept you, you've given her time to come around, and she hasn't and decided to invalidate yours and others' feelings -

Then leave. As a partner, even if she doesn't understand where you are coming from the least she could do is try but instead she has attacked you for an identity/label that made you feel safe and demonized your feelings and disrespected you and your community completely. I know it's disappointing, but it's the option that would likely make you happiest, even if you lose someone you love in the long run. It's definitely better than her suddenly leaving you because of your identity, though.
only read the title, but fucker her.
uh

yikes at her being transphobic

Why are you going out with a transphobe who makes you feel unsafe?
Hey, this take might be a little spicy, but I’m just going to be honest. depending on the flavor of radfem, in my experience they don’t usually make safe dating partners, at least not for people who aren’t cis women. I’m an amab nb with varied gender presentation and my ex was a radfem leaning woman who shamed me for my body and was pretty open about hating men and amab people in general. I understand she had a lot of trauma from men which led her to that point, but I honestly walked away from the relationship carrying my own trauma and shame because of the way she made me feel about my body and gender. She wasn’t explicitly transphobic like many other radfems but her ideas did lead her down the rabbit hole of browsing terf and misandrist subreddits and stuff like that, which was honestly really upsetting to me, but I find it can be incredibly hard to reason with people of that perspective. After I broke up with her I basically vowed to never put myself through anything like that again. I have compassion for radfems and recognize there are deep societal inequalities that lead them to their ideas. I hope they can change, but for me they have just been generally unsafe to be around and I can’t imagine this experience being all that much better as a trans man or masc presenting non-binary person. Please be careful and remember that people like this can have a huge impact on others’ mental health
Hey! I’m a radfem, but not all radfems are trans-exclusionary; your girlfriend is just a dick. if you can’t be yourself around her then there’s no point continuing in a relationship. it’s hard but you shouldn’t give up your own freedom for assimilating into a relationship that will hurt you.
I have no idea what your gender is; no one else can tell you that. But you should have a support network that wants you to be happy and that will support you no matter your gender. If someone thinks there is an automatic right or wrong outcome for you as you explore your gender, they aren't really supportive of you.
I'm so sorry your girlfriend has shown she's not a safe person to be open with
You can't change her mind for her, all you can do is decide whether or not you want to stay
Honestly, even putting aside your own identity here - there's an obvious conflict between your beliefs and hers. She's transphobic, you disagree, and arguing about it isn't working. She's making fun of you to her friends/publicly putting you down about a sensitive and personal struggle.

I don't see her as particularly different from (another common example unfortunately) a cishet guy with a bisexual girlfriend, who he doesn't see as ""really queer"" and makes homophobic remarks in front of / about, while dismissing her identity as ""just from SA"" or wanting to be ""not like the other girls"". Both would be shitty, bigoted behaviours, even if they \*weren't\* talking to someone who is a part of the group being derided. To do all that to someone you're supposed to love and support is just... cruel.

That you were out, changed your mind (and engaged in terf-y spaces), and are now in a state of questioning and wanting to come out again is understandable. It's rarely a straight line from realisation to actualisation. Going back in the closet because you thought you were wrong, or that something else would be easier, or because the world is scary and you *hoped* you were wrong... happens. Can't beat yourself up about that. Also not worth beating yourself up if you do land on being cis again. The question is what do you want to do now, and do you want to tolerate someone who is going to dictate how much of yourself you're 'allowed' to be.
break up with her. you'll not have support and your dysphoria, at some point, will become a joke to her.

u dont deserve someone who don't understand u on your changings. its sad, but she changes only if she wants and maybe she won't do it. and probably will make fun of you on your process. is not easy, but think in a long term.
My guy, you should just break up with her
break up with her cuz she’s an asshole.
I’m sorry but your girlfriend sounds like an absolute trash human. I mean no one is perfect but she seems to be deliberately interested in causing harm. 

I wish you all the best as you navigate all of this. I really reallllllly recommend considering leaving this person so you have the space you deserve and need in order to explore and experience your gender. I hope you have supportive people (or at least one person) you can turn to.
Dude you need to leave her regardless, she is a horrid person
This, for real. Anyone who tries to make you fit the mold of what they think you should be is not worth keeping in your life.
She is wonderful in many things! But I really am afraid: I'm not sure yet what I am going to do, if I'm cis or trans, who am I... but I can't erase my transgender experience. It was a big part of me, I can't erase me. I tried, but that's is disrespecting my own being. If just being ""political"" (like what many radfems like to say) and acknowledging misogyny would be enough, my body dysphoria wouldn't have been back and I wouldn't have been questioning myself and my beliefs. How I perceive myself was always different, since I was 14. It didn't changed, even if I tried to hide it. I'm afraid if I discover myself as trans non binary and be sure 100% I want to continue my transition, will she make fun of me? Will she say bad things just like she says about other trans people? Will she sees myself in a different way?

If I break up with her, my mother will sure want to know why I did it. I really CANNOT tell her about this. she will definitely be sad if I say Im thinking about going back to transition. I don't want to be judged. I really wouldn't know what to say if she asked ""why did you breakup with your girlfriend? Everything was going okay, wasn't it?"".
This is a nice take. Only OP can know what is most important here.
Worth noting, though, that even if you bottle it up, if it really is important it will come back out later!
Yes! I really think people who talk bad things about a group of people so much are probably a part of it, but they are denying themselves. For exemple, as a lesbian, I always have said ""lesbians"" who treat bisexual women badly and call them names 24/7 are probably bi and have internalized biphobia. I saw many ""lesbians"" like these that ended up coming out as bi with a boyfriend, what they ""feared the most"".

I wonder if that was also my case, but about transitioning
I guess flirted with some aspects of radfem thinking because of my projection and anger I felt at the time I came out as ""cis"" and also trying to distanciaste myself from the trans community due to that. Also maybe to get validation from my mom and the rest of the society. I remember my mom saying very clearly that she's ""glad that her daughter is a lesbian and not some trans man"". That was like a fuel to me for suppress my desire for transition and just act ""normal like every other women""

I'm glad I'm not alone. Now I see how lots of people of this ideology can be hurtful. My girlfriend really likes to say unpleasant things about transness. It doesn't feel good being surrounded by people who spend all of their time being a bigot, calling trans people this and enbies that. Even me, who aren't even sure about being non binary, is getting tired of that negativity.
No problem! I actually feel okay with any pronouns (and my name is Noah too!!)

Yes, I'm thinking about the possibility of breaking up, not gonna lie, but I always think a lot before making a decision. I'll probably make an appointment with my therapist only to talk about this situation. She's a good person in many things, but when it comes about dysphoria and all... I think there is really a possibility of me going back to transition because the idea of having a flat chest makes me euphoric and I don't think suppressing that feeling will make me feel better and stop my dysphoria. I don't want to be with someone that I'm afraid of being judged for exploring myself. 

But, at the same time, I'm afraid of what she and her friends are going to think of me? I don't know if she is going to see me in a different way and treat me like a joke just like she does with other trans people. Yes, I also was like this, but I don't want to anymore, I won't project myself in this community and talk negative things about them. That's not cool at all. And I don't want to be criticized for changing.
Thank you for your kind words! I'm going to look forward reading Leslie's work, because I'm both lesbian (I still identify as one after all, I don't see myself as a straight trans man) and gender non conforming. 

I'm really afraid of talking about this situation with my girlfriend. I'm almost sure she will ask me (again) not to go to a trans specialist because they will ""force transition down my throat"" or will say (again) that I'm like this ""maybe because I don't think I can be a woman because I'm butch"". I'm afraid that if I break up with her, but stay as friends, she will view me as ""one more butch woman who felt down the 'liberal trans ideology'"", maybe say that I'm ""not really trans"" because I choose the label non binary to describe my experience. I don't want pity from anyone nor feel judged. I just want to live my life like everyone else, in a body that I feel most represented, like how I see myself in my own mind.

Even before questioning gender critical thinking, I tried explaining to her why people with dysphoria choose to transition and I think is a valid way (precisely because I LITERALLY went through that) but she really did disagree and all. I always tried to give her a perspective of a dysphoric person, but she still have the same exact beliefs. 

I guess I still have to unpack more of my past trauma (fear of not being accepted, being excluded and judged) because I'm THAT afraid of what a person who I'm dating for only 4 MONTHS and her friends, who I never saw in my entire life, are going to think of me.
Well, she's not making fun of me, particularly. But if I say ""hey I'm feeling dysphoric, I'm thinking about buying binder tapes and maybe going to a trans specialist who can help me"" or ""I'm thinking about top surgery, I think I'll feel happy"" she will probably say again ""but that's wrong, that's mutilating your body"" ""oh it's all internalized misogyny"" ""don't go to a trans clinic, they will push transition down your throat"" ""maybe you think you can't be a woman because you're butch"" and more things like that. These words are not welcoming at all, and knowing it won't make my dysphoria disappear. Making me feel bad about it and suppressing these emotions won't help, definitely. She NEVER had experience with being trans as I did and she will NEVER know how it feels like.
That's what I'm afraid. What would stop her from saying ""oh [my name] went back being those queers"" or ""she thinks she's that non binary nonsense"" ""oh poor one, she was brainwashed by those liberal trans queers"" about me, just like she says about other people. I'll admit I was just like this, but I don't want anymore. I'm an adult, I've been in contact with both ""sides"" of the story, I can make decisions on my own.

There were this person who was formerly a radfem in my country, they really used to shame trans people and bisexual women, but know they are openly trans non binary. When my girlfriend told me this story, I said ""well maybe they're more happy that way, don't blame them"", but my girlfriend didn't have the same thought as me. I got where did she came from ""how did someone, who was very 'political', changed so much? Didn't they learn anything?"" but I knew that people naturally change their beliefs and the most important thing is that they're more happy right now. I thought that, even while falling down the radfem pipeline. I'm afraid my girlfriend just shame me just like in this situation.
You do not need to tell your mom why you broke up with your girlfriend. You can say something generic like “we have different values and I found myself struggling to relate to her” and if your mom presses you can say “I don’t feel like talking about this, it was a really painful thing because of how well we did get along”.
Maybe you don’t need to think of it as breaking up with her because if your identity. Maybe it can be breaking up with her because she’s intolerant, lacks empathy, and seems to spend her time conjuring up problems to have with marginalized communities. It wouldn’t be unusual for a white person to dump their white partner for being racist. The same can apply here. You don’t have to wait until you feel sure about your identity to cut an intolerant person out of your life. And the truth is, you’ll probably find it easier to understand yourself once you don’t have her in your ear anymore
>She is wonderful in many things!

Is she? Or do you just overlook things because you love her, or you think its normal, or you force yourself to change your feelings to align with that belief? One of the patterns I notice with intimate couples is that one person will come and tell a horrific story about their partner not at all being a good person and yet they'll still consistently say that their partner is wonderful and supportive and so awesome. Then the more people point things out, the more realization the poster has that maybe things aren't as great as they had convinced themself. Of course, not every person is 100% awful at all times, but there is often a long-term thread of disrespect, insensitivity, lack of support and so forth. People will do a lot of mental gymnastics to not have to deal with the truth about someone they love.

>I'm afraid if I discover myself as trans non binary and be sure 100% I want to continue my transition, will she make fun of me? Will she say bad things just like she says about other trans people? Will she sees myself in a different way?

Yes, friend, she will. She has already showed you that. I really recommend you find a good trans-informed therapist to help you through this. and to help you better understand the ways you are ignoring keeping yourself safe. You're allowing your girlfriend to mistreat you because of the internalized transphobia you're feeling. It can be helpful in some way, because that outside source of disagree means you make more space inside yourself to come to terms with your truth. However, outsourcing that hate may not serve you anymore once you do start to claim being transgender. I think, in part, you're worried about not only how your GF will treat you but how you will treat you, how your parents will treat you, how your other friends will treat you. If you start building an inclusive support system now, it will help you so much with trying to make better decisions for yourself. I think it'll help you feel less like you'll lose everything because you'll already have people holding you up.
As for what to tell your mother, I wouldn’t tell her about your gender questioning until you are comfortable to do so (although frankly I have to say I hope you’re prepared for the possibility your hopefully-future-ex might use that against you to try to earn points in the realm of public opinion, although I DO hope she is a better person than that).

I would simply tell her that you found there were beginning to be topics that you didn’t feel safe talking to her about. That whenever those topics came up, your partner would say really dismissive, hurtful, and cruel things, despite you expressing that you didn’t like the way she talked about those topics. 

The ability to communicate openly with your partner is SO important to the health of a relationship. If you said that you didn’t feel “safe” talking about ANY topic with your partner, that would be a massive red flag for me, and it would be time to seriously reevaluate your relationship. Since this particular topic is so tied into who you are, and since her viewpoint is so steeped in bigotry, I’m inclined to say you’re just better off without her. But at the VERY least, maybe you can look into couples’ therapy (obviously with a well-reviewed LGBTQ+ positive therapist), and I hope you are also looking into some individual therapy to help you sort out your feelings around this and give you some guidance in establishing healthy boundaries so that you have the safety you need to explore your own gender identity.

Whatever you choose to do, I wish you well, my friend. Getting to know yourself is a lifelong endeavor. We never stop growing and we will never FULLY know ourselves, and that goes for gender too imo. I hope you find the support you need, whether from her or somewhere else, to find joy in the very act of working to know yourself better through discovering your gender. Maybe you are trans. Maybe you’re cis and you just want a different body. Maybe you’re some flavor of non-binary. Maybe your understanding of who you are will change over time. Whatever you are, you’re valid. And not knowing is valid too. It’s okay to be a work in progress. We all are. :)
I'm curious about your previous trans experience. When you where younger, were you trans masc/man instead of trans nonbinary? It could make sense if you were leaning male but then pulled back because it didn't feel right. 
I always knew I wasn't a girl, but being a boy only felt a tad better. I'm so happy to have gone down my journey to understanding and accepting being trans nonbinary. I don't do hormones but I have had a few surgeries and I love my body now. 
It's ok to considering changing parts of yourself that make you dysphoric. Even if you never change any of your ""labels"", it's ok to pursue what will make your body feel more like a ""home"" you want to live in. Please try to break up with this toxic person and find a gender therapist.
(funny we're name buddies now ^^)

i see... i think you are doing it right. taking time to think and sharing your thoughts with other people and your therapist. that's really good 👍🏻

i'm sorry that you're afraid of their reaction... but i guess when you're not hanging out with them it won't bother you that much anymore... i think if you're having other people you can count on, you will be okay :)

i'm happy for you that you changed and feel better about it now ^^ it really feels like you're going to be fine ☺️
probably she will.
I'm not being arrogant or wishing u bad things.

I'm someone who passed through a similar situation, but, he didn't saw me in my transition (my ex, that I did want to marry and blablabla).
When I told him, the first time, I was bissexual (years after, understood me as pansexual), he thought it cool. But when we broke up the first time and after a long, we came back and he knew, cuz I told him, I dated 2 girls, he got out of his mind. He used to say that I was confused and felt really bad about me having an affair with 2 girls while we were away from each other.
when we came back, he used to be openly bifobic to me and transphobic to others. 
I know that one of his cousins is trans. And he always have been the type of guy who thinks this is a bullshit created to put ""great and sweet"" people in a confused path.

I told a little about me just to say u: people who are openly lgtbqphobic, specially transphobic, they will not accept u as who u are. and depending on how they were raised, it gets worse.
u can try, talk and see what happens. but, we are not talking about ""she likes potato's and I like strawberry"". we are talking about ur self being and yes, she can shame u. in front of many people. or use u as a token to show how benevolent and lovable she is.
my ex always embarrassed me towards my sexual orientation. and used to use me as token for a fat poor lgbtqia person he was envolved.

don't be afraid to go.
if u want to talk to her and see how she treats u... it's upon u. 

hope she don't do anything bad to u or disrespectful.

if u wanna talk, my dm is open!
Seriously, I rarely tell my parents all the details of my breakups.
When I was younger I came out as a trans man to my friends and family, but after some years I started to question if I was non binary transmasc (agender, to be more specific). In any case, all this time I transitioned socially, I legally changed my name and all (and I'm glad I did it because I absolutely hate my dead name). But I wanted specially to undergo top surgery. I was really planning on that, it was my dream of life, I even emailed a doctor from my city asking for information). But when I found out I exclusively like women (after thinking I was bi for a long time), I came out as a lesbian. At first, I did still stick with the label non binary. For me it wouldn't make sense to call myself a straight trans male, since I resonate a lot with being a lesbian. My mother was so happy, she said out loud that she was glad I ""wasn't trans anymore"" and ""I'm so happy you love your body now"". What I think happened to me was: I tried to suppress my desire for transition and my different perception of gender so I can be more accepted and just be ""normal"" like everyone else. It kinda worked, but now I'm feeling dysphoric again and having trouble with how I perceive me. All this time I didn't stop wishing I was like the transmasc folks who have done the surgery nor stopped seeing myself in characters while have more masculine physical features. Right now I see myself as idk nothing? I do would like to be like a more tall, full flat chested with a deeper voice, but at the same time I see nothing about myself.
I'm so sorry your family and partner have been so negative. I'm no contact with my family and it's the happiest I have ever been. I know that no contact isn't the best route for everyone, but I realized that the relationships with my family were unbalanced in what I got out of it compared to what they expected me to to put into it. Nobody should feel required to be in a relationship that causes harm.... sorry for the tangent! haha  
What I came here to say is actually this: I am so very proud of you. I don't know if you realize this but you have taken some pretty big steps recently to look at what you need for yourself and what you need from a partner. Whatever you decide to do, even if it's nothing, please know that someone out there has a lot of respect for how you're addressing some really challenging issues in life. I hope that doesn't come off as condescending, I'm just speaking from experience and my experience is that where you are right now isn't easy, but here you are looking for advice and support. I support you."	121w0mq	NonBinary	351	0.99	2023-03-25 19:15:08

When you leave a note correcting one of your bosses on your pronouns and they apologize alot, which makes you feel guilty for bringing it up. Also notes r the best way for me to communicate cuz I cant fully vocalize my thoughts cuz of brain damage and adhd		"Have you ever considered wearing a pronoun pin?

I know that’d be an extra thing to keep track of (ADHD sibs what up!) but it might be easier to communicate without the sort of formality of a note.

Try to let go of the guilt. You deserve to be treated with respect and your boss’s feelings about making a simple mistake are their own to manage. 

You can also try telling them (or writing to them) “Thanks for understanding”—a little gratefulness can go a long way to relieve guilt on both sides.

You look great, and I'm sorry about the brain damage, anything specific happen, no need to share if you're not comfortable with it
Ayyyyy adhd bad brain twins (I don't have brain damage but I do have a lot of brain fog from my chronic illness)
Tell them the only apology is changed behavior
Some of my nb colleagues send a message via Slack, our work chat app, whenever they notice someone mispronouning them. Just a simple “hey I’m sure you know but I use they/them pronouns now, I noticed you were having a hard time with that, can you work on it?” They find this to be easier and more diplomatic than correcting in person. I’ve taken to politely but firmly cutting people off mid sentence with the correction if I know them well enough.
Ayy is that a Set it Off shirt?? I love SIO, I've seen them live four times and I have their Duality symbol tattooed on my back 😁❤
i know how u feel dude :( im honestly too ech to even correct my friends when they slip up, bc when they catch themselves they always get so upset and apologise and i feel really bad. and i have to do notes too, honestly writing is the superior form of communication bc u can think and reword and dont have to worry about accidentally using the wrong tone/face/body language and pissing someone off. also i really love ur eyebrow piercing, how is it having one? does it get in the way of any everyday actions or hurt when u pull faces? ive wanted one for a while but im not 100% on it yet
I have a pronoun sticker on my laptop.
I find it helpful to teach people I’m going to interact with a lot how to accept correction. The way I’ve learned it is to tell them not to apologize but instead just to hear the correction, repeat the correct pronoun and continue on with the conversation.
Result of severe concussion then stepmom slamming my head into steal door hard one day. I wasnt fully healed from my concussion when she slammed my head in. Been having problems with speach since then, 5 yrs ago
Same, ADHD, autism, schizoaffective and fibromyalgia. I'm surprised I do as well as I do
It is indeed a set it off shirt!!!! I love them too!!! Ive seen them once at warped tour lol!!! They changed their band logo to a hourglass
It does not get in the way at all. When i got pierced it felt like pressure and a pinch. I also dont feel it when i make faces.
Sorry to hear about that, hope things have been and continue to go well for you

So tired of “subtle” transphobia/nonbinary-phobia	"I always come across people that claim to be allies, yet they say things that are transphobic but in a (not-so)subtle way. I had a friend talk about a plus size model (who’s a trans woman) winning the beauty pageant and he was like what are your thought on this? Mind you he sent me a video of a transphobic person’s point of view and I’m like “dude, this guy is obviously transphobic in the video”. And he’s like “yeah I know that but look at the video” and I’m telling him I’m not watching a video on a transphobe reacting to that. And he lowkey wanted me to agree that things are getting “too woke”. But again ✨subtly✨. He also claims there’s a “war” on masculinity because “manly men” (aka his version on toxic masculinity) are becoming too feminine. And then when I talk to me people it sucks cause I use they/she/he pronouns and I’m amab nonbinary/genderfluid. So they see me as a man and just use “he” the entire time and get mad when I correct them too much. *sigh*. Well at least that first friend I have kept distance from him so that’s good. And I’m trying to only talk with people that are actual allies and not claiming to be and doing transphobic things.

Edit: forgot to mention that I changed my pronouns to she/they after a while because I was getting so annoyed of him exclusively using “he” and now he would still use “he” a lot and that was my final straw"	"People who act like they want to be allies trying to get trans people to give our blessing to some transphobic nonsense is such a weird thing.  Like they know it's wrong or they wouldn't be asking, but they're hoping we tell them ""no, you're right, it is definitely getting too woke, and also your gaming experience should definitely take precedence over human rights, it's fine if you send your money to that terf.""  Like our primary purpose as a trans person in their lives is to offer absolution for their bad thoughts and decisions.
Last January I was camping with my brother, his wife, and their two kids.  Nieces were cuddled up against me watching the campfire, I felt safe and loved and decided it was finally the right moment to come out as nonbinary. 

Then my brother and his wife started making fun of a neighbor kid (like 5, apparently AMAB and living as a boy) whose favorite thing is dressing up as Elsa from Frozen and dancing and singing around the house.  

A year later and I still haven't even started to crack the closet door open again.
Although I'm loathe to ever link to Twitter (especially since The Muskening), I feel like this series of tweets sums up the 'culture war on manliness' that your supposed friend was going on about:

[https://twitter.com/paulisci/status/1572713537910476801?lang=en](https://twitter.com/paulisci/status/1572713537910476801?lang=en)

It's a series of clippings from newspaper articles bemoaning 'manly men becoming too feminine' from the following years:

* 2020
* 2018
* 2004
* 1997
* 1984
* 1977
* 1965
* 1950
* 1940
* 1934
* 1932
* 1925
* 1922

* 1910
* 1902
* 1893
* 1886

In other words, bigots rarely get new material. They just re-cycle the oldies due to lack of creativity.

This friend of yours doesn't sound like an ally and doens't even sound like a friend, really. I mean, you know your relationship better than me, but a friend should build you up and respect you, not do this sort of crap to you.
Bro yes. I use they/them, my mom calls me E like i want her too but doesn't they/them pronouns and doesn't try to understand .
This makes so much sense. Literally I felt that and I didn’t know how to explain it. I told him “dude I’m not listening to that, it’s a transphobic guy talking about it” and he kept on insisting like “yeah but just watch it I wanna know your perspective” and I was honestly getting so mad and he kept insisting so many times. He always does this sort of subtle stuff that I find it hard to call him out on. It’s so infuriating and it’s honestly exhausting at this point. I have kept more distance from him for now cause it’s hard to just not be friends with him all together at once. So I’m keeping a lot more distance for now
Somehow a lot of my aquaintances are allies for gay people but are highly transphobic. It is pretty mutch socially accepted to do so and I don't really know why. My dad and his girlfriend talk like this a lot. And being non-binary is a whole other level of being hated.
People talk hatefully so openly and make each other hate others more just for existing and just for the sake of bonding. I can not stand up against these people. I usually just sit silently and scream internally for help.
I don't think I'm strong enough to step out of the closet. But staying in here is so painful...
Oh lordy, my partner has a pal like this. Literally on Tuesday his pal sat there talking about Sam Smith's new music video and about how ""he doesn't want his son to see this kind of shit."" ""But if women want to do this or lesbians then it's all okay."" Like no that's not okay, not in this non binary household. I tried to educate him but it's exhausting trying to do that all the time.
100000% agree. I was scrolling thru tiktok, and there was this one that the overall talking point the user was making was really whatever, but out of nowhere he started going on about “people’s kids these days are coming home identifying as TREES” like gender/etc was not AT ALL what his whole tiktok was about yet he had to go on some mini tangent to shit on trans and gnc people? In some ways, the “subtle” or like passive transphobia feels worse than blatant forms; at least when it’s blatant, it’s easy to point out, but this type feels more insidious and harder to fight.
Ew. People like that probably also think abuse is only physical, too. 🙄
So much of this is what I'm getting from my own family members and it's pissing me off. I haven't been around my family a lot until this recent breakup from a long time relationship and it's just making me wish I could find my own place sooner so I didn't have to put up with this shit. I know they're ""confused"" but it would make more sense if they would actually want to learn and listen when I talk to them. I'm still trying to figure myself out lol.
I just recently made the discovery that I’m a trans man and not non-binary, and I noticed a very subtle shift on how people treat me. It’s so annoying because people shouldn’t have to be binary to be respected and loved, love should come from everyone. Your friend needs to see the error of his ways, but definitely think about if your mental health and mental energy is worth educating him.
I think what annoys me most about this kind of thing is no other minority is expected to provide insightful and informative commentary on the conceptual implications of are own existence.

No one expects random black people to provide oral university level essays on KKK speeches. They don’t stop being black when they fail to convince racist that racism is bad
Well the point of he/they/she is that you don’t mind either. Maybe try to tweak that a little bit.
Watch the video for respect of your friend and right down what you didn’t like and all the things your friend might have not noticed; also is good to try as much as possible to see other peoples side even if they’re “wrong”. Communication is key, don’t close your mind.
sounds like a loser
yo fuq that guy
Wow that is a very accurate analysis of what goes on in their head. You’re right, they just kinda use us to say I support you but… and then proceed to indirectly shit on us cause it makes them feel more comfortable and gives them credibility of being like “hey my shitty ideas work cause I said I support them so I’m safe”. That’s like when people say “no offense but” and then proceed to say the most offensive thing and think it’s okay cause they said no offense
Exactly, I have met so many people that are like ""I'm an ally, but..."" or ""it's hard nowadays with pronouns so I'm just going to use the wrong pronouns"". Like, if ur transphobic just say that no need for (not so) subtle queer-bashing.
Yeah, either that or they're thinking more like:  
 > My ""friend"" is just silly & confused, but I'm too close to them so they won't listen to *me* telling them to get over this gender nonsense already.  
 >  
 > So I'll send them this video where the Really Smart Asshole makes all the points I'm to afraid to say out loud. Tough love by proxy, the ""hard truths"" they need to hear, without me being the one to confront them about it.  
 >  
 > Then my ""friend"" can realize their deviancy and get back to being normal, and I'll never have technically given them cause to get mad at *me*. Once my ""friend"" changes themself to my liking I'll consider them a friend instead of ""friend"".

I think a lot of these people think they're being subtle when they send us this transphobic crap with a ""yeah I know, but just look at the video"" explanation, and that the transphobia on display in the thing they're urging us to experience somehow isn't *them* being transphobic at us. 

That somehow ""Hey, I'm not the one saying these things to you, I'm just the one requiring you to listen to them"" makes their assholery ok.
Yeah, this. A hundred times this. Like, I can't prevent you from buying that stupid game. And I wouldn't if I could, because I respect your freedom. But if you choose to buy it, you are objectively helping a billionaire who uses her platform to harm and restrict the freedom of people whose only fault is to freakin exist. And if you can't bear hearing that, well that's a you problem 😡
it’s sad to see people, especially family members, so programmed into the way our government wants us to be that they make fun of people for being happy. the only thing we can hope for is that enough people get educated on gender. but like they say, you can’t teach an old dog new tricks. those who want to learn would’ve already tried
Very useful thanks! Yeah I figured this “war on masculinity” is the whole “bring back manly men” bs where men aren’t supposed to be doing house work or act “feminine”. I’m so tired of hearing that cause literally nobody is telling men to stop being men, it’s just telling eggs that it’s ok to be a trans woman, or nonbinary etc, but also to the men in general that it’s ok to ease up on the toxic masculinity, and to chill out with everything they do not being manly enough or whatever.
Definitely going to save this link, thank you for sharing!
I think it's just an endless cycle of kids passively picking up on gender roles and expectations, growing up and finding out that reality is different from what they're told, and then believing that those childhood stories were actually accurate meaning that reality must've become worse.
I feel for you. It really sucks all we’re asking is for the same rights cis/het people have it’s not too much too ask
I can’t start hrt or go by my pronouns in my house cause my dad is highly transphobic/homophobic unfortunately.
Glad you shared your experience. It’s not easy being closeted. Even when some people know it’s hard to stand up for ourselves cause sometimes it seems like the world is against us. Yes I have talked to some trans friends and they agree that for some reason cis/het people are more uncomfortable with the concept of being trans and/or nonbinary than concepts of liking the same gender (sexuality).
I think the difference comes from time: for example, Seinfeld was before my time ('89-'98) but there they coined the phrase ""\[something is gay\], not that there's anything wrong with that!"" and that sentiment of ""there's nothing wrong with that"" was pretty pervasive growing up. But only for homosexuality; transgender people were exclusively invoked to be the butt of a joke. More specifically trans women (I can't recall anything transmasc from that time at all).

So people like your dad have grown up during a time where gay acceptance was a big thing but not trans acceptance. Non-binary has barely even scraped the mainstream. So good and bad news:

* Good: trans acceptance progresses at a much faster rate than gay acceptance did, thanks to the internet and to the path having been walked before.
* Bad: the current state of gay acceptance is still lackluster. Gay relationships are extremely rarely depicted in popular media, last year there was a big conservative ""groomer"" narrative surrounding anyone LGBT and there are many people still afraid to come out as gay. So trans people have to catch up on something that's not even finished.
God, I so relate with this… they get so drunk in their aversions that this tiny closet seems a little more comfortable. I’m questioning now and the idea of being out, at least in Indiana, hell no. They already know anyways as I don’t have an intuition to mask perfectly around cis-men.

I’ve tried everything with masking and the only thing that has worked is massive aloofness, which then I get criticized for being self righteous. It’s, like, I’m just not allowed to exist. And feeling this for all of my life has really been a freaking mind fuck.
anddd this is the reason I deleted tiktok- never again.
Literallt though. 🙄
And then they say they’ll listen but when you tell them they get mad again and don’t want to hear it lmao.
Oh I’m sorry I forgot to add more context. My pronouns in reality are he/she/they but I only use she/they when it comes to people like this. I specifically asked him NOT to use “he” pronouns and he still does and then gaslights me into saying he’s “trying” even though he’s really not cause he’s known I’m genderfluid for almost a year now.
I mean yeah it’s not about the video exactly, it’s just that he does this every time. He always shows me something slightly transphobic and wants me to see what I think. But when he talks first he always agrees with the transphobes to an extent and it really pisses me off. I understand not knowing some things are transphobic and willing to learn and understand it, but he basically wants me to feel like trans people are too much without directly saying it idk how to explain it
We got in another fight and this time it went pretty sour. I stopped caring anymore and if he doesn’t want to be friends that’s his problem not mine. I’m done being gaslit into thinking I’m exaggerating asking for something as basic as pronoun usage
Literally though. My friend does this all the time and keeps sort of rolling his eyes whenever I have to correct him. I sort of excuse it but I’m tired of excusing transphobia
The thing is though that you CAN teach an old dog new tricks, dogs are less stubborn than humans.
We live in California, so it's not the government as much as a general culture of cissexism.  But I have friends and acquaintances in Texas, and there it really is the government.  :-(
It reminds me of the same BS Douglas Adams parodied 44 years ago in *The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy*:

“In those days spirits were brave, the stakes were high, men were real men, women were real women and small furry creatures from Alpha Centauri were real small furry creatures from Alpha Centauri.”
You're welcome. 🙂
Awww I’m sorry to hear that :( I guess cause nonbinary is less known it’s less accepted in society. Cause human logic is oftentimes: “majority=correct/ethical” even if it doesn’t make sense.
It’s not all bad. I don’t use the app but when I was figuring myself out, I looked up genderfluid tik tok compilations and nonbinary tik tok compilations on YouTube and I was like “Wow! I didn’t know you can be this gender, wow! I didn’t you can dress as a girl AND a boy and feel like both” so that literally helped me so much. But yes I agree, there is still a lot of toxic things on that app and homo/trans-phobia.
Exactly! It's an infuriating cycle of bullshit!
This always happens. Like  seriously u gotta get over it if u want 2 progress bc more and more ppl r coming out.
lmao. i love that. so true
I was confused that you meant me but I realize you meant people like him lmao.

Strangers lately have absolutely not known what pronouns to use for me. The ambiguity of my gender got me feeling glorious right now haha		"I have random  times when I simply say ""hello fellow  human"" as a greeting so that enbys have a tiny euphoria  moment
Yooo with the Stüssy and the club c 85ssss. That’s what’s up. Especially the ambiguity. Lol.
""What are you?""

Confusion.

""No, what's your gender?""

Trickery.

""But what's in your pants?!""

**Deceit.**
Gender envy go brrrr
Omg my style goalllls
Wow, you are giving me so much gender envy rn
Omg you are dressing just the way I want to dress!! So attractive. (F, just coming out as bisexual and possibly androgynous or bigender idk yet but I much prefer looking and feeling masculine 99% of the time). You look great:)
So pweaty!
Teach meeee
I love your hair
You are a real cutie in a hoodie
That’s cool! So simple to say, yet it’s so refreshing and affirming for sure
Omg u peeped 🥺 Thank ya!

I’m still non-binary even if I’m femme!	"I hate how I’ll be talking to someone in public or online and I’ll express how I’m non-binary because I’m very open about my identity, and they’ll tell me “but you’re very feminine so obviously you’re a girl.”

NO.

I’m still non-binary. I go by all pronouns since I don’t mind being referred to as she, but I mainly use they/them. I’m not androgynous and never will be because I’m not comfortable presenting that way. I’m not a girl just because I’m dressed femininely. Clothes don’t have a gender and anyone, even an AFAB non-binary person, can wear clothing that’s seen as typically feminine. It’s not hard to understand yet people don’t want to take the time to listen and learn about it.

I wish more people took the time to look up gender expression and learn it does not equal identity. I wish more people would use gender neutral terms automatically when they see someone that they don’t know the gender of. I wish people understood stereotypes hurt all communities, especially a community that is so vast and different as the non-binary community. I wish people would just ASSUME I’m not a girl even if I’m wearing the most feminine get-up that I could possibly wear.

I just wish more people understood."	"I've been talking about being trans-femme (as someone AMAB) and people keep saying things like ""but why would you want to look femme when you're nonbinary?!"" Weird that they never say ""But how can you be nonbinary when you look masc?!"" to me.
""Even if I'm femme I'm still a them""
Yeah. I have a coworker who routinely misgenders me anyway, but she goes EXTRA out of her way to do it if I'm wearing something she deems femme. I remain very unclear on why this isn't exactly as big of an offense as deliberately using incorrect pronouns/terms for a binary trans person, yet she just keeps getting ""talked to"" about it, never fired.
I may not be femme, but I feel you so much. I don’t even dress femme and people still call me a girl. But something so important that people just don’t understand is that non-binary people do NOT owe anyone androgyny. We can dress as masculine and as feminine as we want and still be non-binary. That’s the point of it all — we do not align with a binary gender identity. I wish more people understood too. Giving you all the hugs.
Valid
_Big_ fucking mood.

Though honestly I'd be happier if we just stopped gendering this stuff entirely. There's absolutely nothing inherently feminine or masculine about aesthetics, and feminine and masculine are arbitrary concepts anyway.
Yeah I know that feel..
When I was exploring my gender one and trans-questioning of the first comments I got was “but you were so femme as a child.” Except I remember being a tomboy who loved playing with boys and girls toys and hated dressing up in dresses. Our outward presentation and people’s interpretation of that doesn’t necessarily (and does not have to) match our internal experience. Hugs to you.
There is no right or wrong way to be non-binary as long as you’re not racist or homophobic/transphobic
I understand greatly as I'm an AFAB enby myself. I do want to dress more masculine.

There's a post somewhere that proves the point you're making. A picture with text of ""you have to dress the part if you're nonbinary,"" and then ""meanwhile, I..."" with a picture below it of a person dressed like a super-femme bunny lolita.
True. I've always struggled enjoying dressing feminine because ppl always assume but tbh I just have a idgaf attitude 😎. Tbh I do like androgynous dressing but I like to combine femme and masc outfits
I’m in the exact same boat as you!! I’m a very feminine AFAB nonbinary person, and I’m just not happy when I present masculinely or androgynously. I’m happy with my long hair and makeup and dresses, but I’m still nonbinary! The way I express myself makes me feel happy and confident, but I’m still nonbinary.
i feel the same :[
I dress masc most of the time, but I work in aviation as a pilot, so it's job security to dress as my perceived gender. Also remember, its not clothing, accessories, make-up, etc...that makes you Non-Binary, **it's what's inside you.**
I have the same issues, people want to assign a binary role even when you tell them it's not correct, it's frustrating. Or they tell me that I'm just a girl who wants attention which isn't the case
I also wish that people who take the time to actually look it up when you tell them and not get the ole “I just don’t understand it” like no sally sue you just chose not to even try
I’m an enby as well. Many people just don’t get it and will not. It’s frustrating as hell sometimes. I will occasionally purposefully dress andro in public and not answer people’s questions about my gender or pronouns. Some will cycle through things, miss or sir, she, he etc. and I just smile politely at them and tell them to have a nice day. I’ve noticed when I act more mysteriously, people are much more pleasant that way. It’s like wearing a veil without actually having one on. When people just let me be, but try to be respectful, I see they are starting to get it. 

Other times it’s people wanting to fight and use whatever excuse that I don’t exist. Lots of times they bring up nature. Which is kind of funny considering how much DNA that humans share with everything, and that nature literally operates in the way people have had to hide about themselves. Anything that’s LGBTQIA+ is literally reflected in nature and the world around us that was here long before we were. That in itself gives me hope.
We non-binary peeps can be whatever the hell we want
I just want to say I admire your self-certainty and your passion in getting this concept into people's heads! 
Not only is this just TRUE, and I'll only speak for myself here, but keeping this fact in mind also helps keep a lot of dysphoria at bay.

I generally prefer presenting mostly androgynous, but there are days where I want to lean into feminine aesthetics and that was hard to accept for a long time because it made me feel like my identity was less valid. But that's BS!
I'm trans mask enby. Present very femme when I go out. Heavy, bold makeup and alt, usually femme, flamboyant clothes, I'm very hard to miss, still go by they/he. They way I usually tell people is ""they way I look has nothing to do with how I identify and it's also none of your business"". I find it works ok depending on the kind if people you come across
fuck yes 💯
I feel ya. I am a masc-presenting amab enby.

Gender expression ≠ gender identity.
THIS! This is so important and I completely agree. I face the same problems everyday and yet I feel guilty for feeling this way. But truly I am non-binary AND I dress stereotypically femininely. They are completely separate things!!! Gender≠expression
You're so valid! Obviously our experiences are incredibly different, because, like you mentioned, no nonbinary person is the same as another, but I can sorta relate. I'm genderfluid between agender and male mostly, however I rarely present in a masculine way because to be honest I hate that style, I think masc clothes are boring and just overall not that comfortable for me. I quite frankly don't give a damn what other people percieve me as and I use any pronouns except they/them, but it would be quite nice if people didn't see long hair and lots of jewelry and instantly assume female. And on that note I find it incredibly strange when other trans/nonbinary people do this, shouldn't other trans people be literally the last people who would assume gender/pronouns?
I've got an appointment next month to start hormones. I'm planning to continue using neutral pronouns and identifying as nonbinary. I still have people questioning why I want to ""become a woman"" and I have run out of ways to try to explain it.
I mean I'm non-binary regardless how I present or whatever pronouns I choose to go by. There's no one way to be non-binary, if you say you're non-binary you're non-binary end of story!
people think I'm a transmasc when I am nonbinary (I do try my best to look androgynous while avoiding certain clothes like leggings mainly because I hate wearing them) they think I'm a transmasc and TELL me I'm a transmasc because I cut my hair short (I would grow it out if I got a cool moustache)
Exactly! Like non binary just means outside the binary, you can present any way you want and identify any way you want
My MIL tries very hard to be supportive, but in a way that makes me think 'bless your heart,' a lot of the time. Before I came out, she used to tease me a lot for being very masc. Afterwards, she keeps getting fixated on anything at all I do that might be interpreted as femme. She, like many confused cis people, can't seem to wrap her head around the idea that 'nonbinary' doesn't always equal 'perfectly androgynous and devoid of gendered mannerisms or aesthetic preferences.'   


""If you're not trying to be seen as \[binary gender\], then why do you \[do anything at all that isn't perfectly neutral by common standards\]?"" has been a repeat conversation about hair, clothes, the way I talk, hobbies, the way I move/walk/sit, etc. I've given up on the idea of her getting it through her head that the answer every single time is going to be ""because \[gender\] doesn't own \[ANYTHING about personal expression and pleasure\], and doing so doesn't make me less NBy.""   


It's [this meme](https://d3n8a8pro7vhmx.cloudfront.net/ousa/pages/1917/attachments/original/1582134710/Screen_Shot_2020-02-19_at_12.51.32_PM.png?1582134710) basically every time. Other trans people (at least for the most part) have no problem understanding that (presentation) != (gender). Anyone on any part of the gender spectrum can look/sound/present however the hell they want - it's basic sexism to assert anything otherwise.   


Yet, with (mostly cis) people stuck in the mindset of gender binarism, there's no winning. Any way you look or present, *somehow*, you're the one enforcing sexism and gender stereotypes. Any level of comfort/discomfort with things commonly gendered one way or another is scrutinized as either proof that you're just running away from misogyny, in denial, confused, doing it for attention/to feel special, etc.
This is one of the THE most frustrating things about existing. It’s especially disappointing from people who want to consider themselves LGBTQIA+ positive and feminists. For binary folks, they are so laissez-faire about who can wear what. But then all of a sudden for us, it’s acceptable to be the gender police and subject our presentation to intense and constant scrutiny. And if we aren’t doing what they deem to be ‘enough’ to match their idea of what a nonbinary person should look like (which often includes expensive and painful clothing items, specific body types that are completely unattainable for many of us, and surgery), then they feel entitled to decide our gender for us. 

It’s such an extreme double standard and it makes me so fucking angry. I’m so tired of having to argue with self proclaimed ‘allies’ about things that should absolutely never be considered up for debate.
Sure would be nice, but you can't expect years of conditioning and learning to go away so fast, unfortunately.
[deleted]
Actually, people do say, ""But how can you be nonbinary when you look masc?!"" I'm AFAB, and everyone calls me a transgender male, even though I'm enby.
I've seen masc-presenting people say they've been excluded from LGBTQ+ spaces for being too masculine, or told they're too masc to be non-binary, especially when they're newly out 😥
I fucking love that
I totally, agree with you. I simply hate when I can go shopping for most of my clothes in the men's section and have shorter hair than my brother. And still, people tell me If you're Non-binary why do you wear a blouse (that is a shirt from the men's section)? Why don't you always have a flat chest? Why don't you start a screaming match every time someone uses a gendered word for you, if you say it doesn't describe you? And why do you have to tarnish my language with a ""gender-*"" (pretty much the best option I have since my language has no they/them, pretty much the same debate as well) when revering to yourself? It simply is exhausting. I don't have the energy to fight every little battle at once. Because you don't deserve the hate I feel toward myself afterward. For still not looking enough like I feel inside. For you not seeing the efforts I make to make it easier for you to see past this shell, and see me for who I am inside. For not fighting harder against restrictions that cage me, because you are scared of them falling. Of opening up more possibilities than you personally knew what to do with. If I scream, you are annoyed at the noise I'm making. If I stay silent, you use it to put me down. So just leave me alone would you? 

Sorry that turned into a rant, and is obviously not aimed at anyone here, just feels good to get it out there.
I’m sorry this reminded me of the tictok sound and I have to say we do owe them a little dance or a jig
EXACTLY. I feel the same. Stuff is pointlessly gendered nowadays and it’s ridiculous. We should just let people enjoy what they want to enjoy.
On point.
Isn’t combining fem and masc outfits dressing andro unless you just mean switching between the two in witch case my bad
Exactly!
Yes, good for you, but please keep in mind this is my rant post and it isn’t about you :) I don’t mean to be rude but the comment was unappreciated even if you had good intentions.
I should have said people don't say it to me. Sorry though, that's so frustrating 😔🤗
Regardless of our AGAB and expression, society loves to invalidate us. I wish people could just be chill and not get all investigatory.
Legit thought best friend refers to my chosen name as my trans guy name even though I chose a neutral name
It certainly makes me nervous about attending women and nonbinary events.
Oof
Not mine but I can't remember who said it. They even had a little jingle.
I love that TikTok sound 😭 I’m also a fan of that one tweet thread that’s like “Non-binary do not owe you androgyny” “No but one does owe me money”
Yea I like to switch between the two. I think it's kinda limiting to always be 50/50 ya know so I like to lean heavily into one side while still making it somewhat andro.
That would be miserable 4 me especially being AMAB I already try to get as femme/nb as possible to pass. That must SUCK
Even when I’m femme I’m still a them, even when I’m femme I’m still a them, I’m a they either way, no matter what the day, even when I’m femme I’m still a them! (Haha I memorized it, it’s from tik tok)
Ya know what I appreciate the honesty

Not out yet, but I just wanna be myself on my birthday, I'm tired of always posting feminine pics for family, any pronouns		"Happy birthday, hope you have a good one! You look radiant! 🎉
Happy real life cake day
Happy birthday friend, I totally understand the sentiment. Sometimes I feel like I'll never be able to come out irl but this subreddit is a dream

Stay awhile, you look fantastic!
wish if I was there to make u feel like the man
Happy birthday! You look great
Happy birthday! You can celebrate it with us, as your truest self!!!
Happy birthday 🎂
Thank you I appreciate it :)"	nah7d8	NonBinary	342	0.99	2021-05-12 05:22:39
"No pronouns for me, refer to me as ""motherfucker"""		"Which birth certificate is yours?  “It’s the one that says ‘Bad Motherfucker’ on it.”
Hell yes, my motherfuckers!
Sadly Slovak is gendered. But I can get creative.

I turn 26 tmrw. It’s my first birthday since coming out and I’m really nervous to have to talk to anyone. Just hoping to not be misgendered, fingers crossed (he/they pronouns)		"Happy almost birthday my dude!
Happy birthday, I hope it goes well.
happy birthday for tomorrow!
Happy birthday!!

good luck and happy birthday :)
Happy birthday and good luck bud!
Happy Birthday dude!! My husband and I hope you have a wonderful day!

Gimme those pronouns!		"Damn, that's a clean edit
My first friend who I came out to as nonbinary had a conversation similar to this.  She asked me to explain what it meant to be nonbinary, and I started off by mentioning that I'm AMAB.  She then responded by saying that that didn't matter, and that really made me feel validated.
TRUUUUU
Yesss

I do still sometimes use AGAB but only when it's relevant to explain my life experiences.
it’s awesome to know that there are people that validate us and at the same time they still are learning our vocab ✨"	hm5r7q	NonBinary	334	1.0	2020-07-06 11:15:22
Anybody Else Really Dislike Being Addressed as Mr/Ms/Mrs?	"Every time someone calls me it or I see it written on a letter I hate it. It's so redundant.

The only purpose it serves is to help people stereotype you.

Why not use the person's initial or first name instead?

I prefer they/them pronouns but I'm just curious if people who like to use gendered pronouns feel the same way or not 🙂"	"Or ma'am 🤢
Yea. I go by Mx
I like Mx (mix), but I've also seen Mistrum as a gender neutral honorific that I kind of like.
I’m trying to set up a retirement account at my work - I started there before legally changing my name. It seems that everything has been updated, but I couldn’t change it when I went to register for an account with their retirement fund partner. I called them to say, wtf, why is my info incorrect on here and they asked me what my name is and I froze. I said, well I mean the name on the account is [deadname]. And the rest of the conversation was thank you Mrs. x. It’s extra annoying because my title is technically Dr. but what a mind f*ck of a phone call. Between the Mrs. and the deadnaming I was shook for a while.
I'm a server in the south.  Getting called Sir all day long.  It really sucks but I just do my best to stay strong and keep up a good smile for every guest.
Yeah definitely. Especially because in my native language the version of Mrs/Ms (no difference there) is literally the word for woman
Yes. And for me at least, Mx doesn't cut it either. But one day I will solve this by being a doctor. 😁
In five years everyone will have to call me Dr. 😎

Honestly every enby should get a PhD haha
I prefer Darth
Yeah it sucks, it basically lets me know which way the person assumed my gender should be (in their eyes.) I’m NEITHER. I always ask for Mx. on forms and on my checks and stuff.
I know cis people that really hate this too. Even professional adults
It really does feel redundant, and frustrating.

At my doctors they call out your name with the honorific over a loudspeaker to the waiting room when it's your time to go in.
It sets my teeth on edge every time when they call me...
I dislike when people use it in conversation, but I also feel awkward when it's in a letter. I still use my sex as an identifier in legal/work documentation; however, I try to make my pronouns known whenever I have the opportunity to, even in a professional environment.
I hate when people call me sir. Or when someone calls me by my chosen name but then says sir. Okay, halfway there...
Saw someone somewhere (I think TikTok?) say that “Morrow” would be a good option. Abbreviate is to Mw. Or Mrw, I suppose. I actually really like that one and wish it would catch on because I personally don’t like Mx.
Despite non-binary people being legally recognised in my country, a lot of places with a database still haven't put in an Mx title option 😭
I prefer my name just being shouted, more personal that way. the titles are too professional and actually scare me tbh
It always bothers me. Whenever I have the option, I don't use a title at all but so many forms make it compulsory. I've seen a few occasions where people use just ""M."" and I like that so much more than Mx but I've never seen it as an option in a drop-down. 
I have a colleague (cis woman) who always uses Mr because  she's uncomfortable with Mrs/Miss too and her argument is that she shouldn't have to disclose her marital status on everything, so I guess it's a system a lot of people would like to jettison/update.
This was literally what led to me figuring out my gender when I started teaching. I was called [translation of Ms] all day every day and it just got too uncomfortable for reasons not related to the authority it carries (which I actually kind of liked with certain classes). Mx isn't really a thing here, so I'll have to go by either just my first name or something like Teacher when I start teaching again. Some schools allow students to call teachers by their names, and since I'm looking at teaching older kids next time I hope it wouldn't be too informal. And there are so many forms that demand it... If it's a webshop I've started to send them a quick email requesting either a neutral option or just not making that title mandatory to fill out, and have mostly had good reactions to that. Although I did find one that already had the option 'not relevant' for gender, and then addressed me as 'Dear sir/madam' - come on. You got so close.

I don't really mind she/her pronouns by the way. I go by she/they, but the they is as much a reminder not to automatically use other gendered language (which bothers me a lot more than pronouns) as a pronoun by itself. Not that that always works, even in queer circles, so I still have to find my way around that. I feel like I'm mostly happy being called they because it's a nice balance to how ridiculously gendered our language and culture are, if everything else was more neutral I probably wouldn't care as much about the pronouns.
This is why I plan on getting a PhD
I use all pronouns and I hate being referred to with mr/ms/mrs or any other honorific that isn't gender neutral
I guess I'm the odd person out in that I don't really care all that much. I really don't put that much stock in words so you could call me a rhinoceros and I wouldn't think too much of it.
honestly i think it’s the main reason why i want to get a phD so i can just become Doctor & avoid all that. is that a pretty bad idea to get a phD 🤣 i am actually smart… i’m in the masters part of it now but yeah i was just thinking about that the other day. like this might one of the reasons i’m so adamant about getting a PhD! don’t even want to go thru that consideration of Mr or Ms.
I really don’t like it at all and I wish there were more gender neutral terms. However, as someone who constantly gets called “miss” I do feel a tiny bit better when every once in awhile someone calls me “sir” just because it’s a change
Doesn’t bother me. A complete stranger isn’t going to know I’m non-binary just by looking.
i prefer mx over ma’am or sir because we don’t have any gender neutral term for that. but that should change
Yes, I hate it. Hate hate hate. Only a few drop-down menus offer the Mx. I take it when it's offered but it's always a pleasant surprise.
This is honestly the thing that causes me the most dysphoria. Otherwise I don’t care too much. But getting ma’amed because of my chest really makes me want to get top surgery, because nothing else I do will get that to stop happening.
Yes, my bank, doctor's surgery, bills etc are all addressed to me as Mx now
I changed my honorific to Mx. Still would prefer if I had no honorific but its better than get Mr or Sir on every letter
Yep i hate it. I'm unsure about Mx. 

... I'll just see if I'll be able to let my future students call me by my first name....
i really dislike it, i dont mind mx tho
I want a PhD solely so I can use Dr instead of Ms/Mr/Ma’am
I am honestly still trying to figure out how to address people at work. For a bit of background, I work in private security for an executive site (so it’s a fairly professional environment). I grew up saying “sir”, “ma’am”, “miss”. That was just what I recognized as good manners. But I am aware the world is changing. I have tried not using pronouns, but it’s difficult when I need to directly address someone (whether to give direction or advise someone on policy etc…) and I’ll catch myself using a pronoun and assuming their gender, because in that moment I don’t know what else to do. 

That last example aside, not using pronouns seems to work most of the time, except I’ve noticed some of the older men do seem a bit perturbed if I don’t address them as “Sir”. Does anyone have any tips or advice?
I use she/they pronouns and tbh I find the whole title thing really weird. Unless it's earned like Doctor or Captain etc, I don't see why we need them. We can get by jist fine with names and initials. 

I appreciate the Mx title but not everywhere uses it.
I.. I dunno. Right now im using the them and gendered pronouns make me a bit uncomfortable but not all the time. Being called she by my parents or ma'am in public I don't like but my friends can use gendered words like lass, dude, boy and sister when referring to me and im totally okay with it. My friends also respect the they and check in when using gendered terms so that probably makes a big difference in how i feel about it. I think it might also be because when my friends use gendered terms it's more to indicate a certain mood or vibe rather than a stranger who is addressing me solely by my outward appearance.
Ok I'm rating them:

Mr (7/10) Mostly fine, the gendered aspect is still there, but thankfully I see it as more honorific than the others. (not sure if that's internalised misogyny or not)

Ms (6/10) Dispite it being quite gendered, nothing too offensive here, just I bit confusing on its pronunciation. ""Muss""? Sounds like miss.

Mrs (4/10) Absolutely disgusting word. ""m i s s i s"". It's just, I can't explain it. It's just horrible to say.

Miss (5/10) Same as Mrs just slightly batter.

Mx (6/10) Would be perfect if I didn't have a) \*woke vibes\* that using the letter X just gives it. b) didn't have ambiguous pronunciation (mex or mix ???) and c) the general public thinks people who use it are just looking for attention.

Mt (5/10) Similar problem to Mx, just comparing oneself to a mountain just objectifies non binary people, which in my opinion should be avoided (unless ones pronouns are it/its)

Ma'am (1/10) No I will not elaborate.

Sir (8/10) Underrated in my opinion. I think it is less gendered than Mr and more honorific, the only real problem is that asking people to call you Sir instead of Mr can be a challenge.

Rev (4/10) Just a mouthful and quite gendered. Also I'm not a vicar I don't see it as worth it as persuing that career to get this honorific.

Dr (9/10) Ok now we're into the real stuff. Can be shortened to Doc which is even better. Yes getting a PhD is hard but OH MY GOD this word is great and totes worth it.

Prof (8/10) Just a bit worse than Dr, as it can be a pain up the arse to pronounce a three syllable word. Still ok though.

\*your first name\* (7/10) A surprisingly simple and effective one if only it didn't sound like something's missing. Also hearing your first name over and over again might get annoying.

M (6/10) M is fine. Just fine.
i hate it. it's apparently a sign of respect but it bothers me. i teach kids and i'm just like ""call me teacher or (name)."" i have had a few parents complain about it but    my boss backs me up thankfully.

as an transmasc nonbinary afab person, it kinda ruins my day and triggers my dysphoria more than it should to be addressed as ms, miss, ma'am, etc.
I find it too formal and like I’m nonbinary jeebz sake I don’t wanna be formal ):<
Not a fan, but ""sir"" is considerably worse
Mx. is always an option!
I don't like it.
I cross the options out & write Mx
 idk if that's helpful but it makes me feel better :)

Or nothing. 

It is irritating, it's redundant.

I know that it's basically information gathering, we're the product..and we have become desensitised to it sadly.
I use any pronouns and I am OK with it, but I really hate it when people use gendered honorifics, I don't use honorifics at all. Is it so hard to understand that I just want to be referred by my name? I totally understand you. This gives my dysphoria every time.
I got ordained online so I can be called Minister😂
Always have. Makes me feel distant and weird
Yes
I was just thinking about it today.  I keep telling myself its not a big deal, they're just being polite and have known me as a woman for a while.  But since I've started identifying as nonbinary, i cant decide whether it bothers me
As in my name, I go by Mx, pronounced Mix, and it's honestly euphoric when people use it for me. I'd give it a try next time you correct someone on it
I will love to be call Themperor or my lord
Definitely!! I go by she/they, but I really hate being called Ms. I recently asked my workplace to start calling me by Mx. 😊
I have a  issue with ma'am or Mrs. / Ms. / Miss.  I prefer  they / them as well but I don't mind Mr. Or Sir or senor ( Lyft driver made this slip with me when I was dressed very masc got the day and I was kind of giddy about it since I'm AFAB).  I get where your coming from.  When I get called miss or ma'am I cringe.  It's not as bad on paper for me but I still dislike it too.
I hate honorifics so much! Just call me my name, and even that I’m wondering about changing now…. 😅
I don’t mind it per say but I can see how other people would.
It’s just WAY too formal for me. Same with sir/ma’am. I don’t *mind* being referred to with male pronouns since that’s what I look like, but I much prefer they/them.
YES!!! Even with ""Nonbinary"" on my medical bracelet and charts ""she/her"" is the go-to pronoun...

Seriously wish we'd normalize ""they/them"" till pronouns are confirmed from the person.
I know this is an old post, but I've been seeing ""Miss"" on all my documents and letters lately, and it's pissing me off so much. Nice to know my name and identity is tied up into whether I'm married or not (real mood booster!), and that I'm still being referred to by words similar to ""woman"" and ""lady"", when those words really discomfort me. ""Miss"" is especially bad because, like... I feel like I'm five years old. I needed to vent somewhere. Okay, that is all, carry on!
Getting called ma’am over the voice box at work kills me 🙃
I live in the South. I have a big ""chest"". I get ma'am-ed all the time. I hate it so much.
I’ve seen this written, but how is it pronounced verbally?
I had someone use this for me once, definitely not my thing. More Mx for you!!
Knew of the former but not the latter. Thanks!
Yeahh. I work phones and get clocked with the sir all the time. I dont correct them because its just not worth my time asking them to not call me that when I never have to speak to them again in 30 mins
That sounds even more irritating 😬

I'm kind of jealous most languages don't have a gender neutral term like the gender neutral ""San"" in Japanese.

I don't really like any of the gender neutral English titles we have.
are you German? cause same. hate it sm. I'm a person, not a woman or man or whatever. to me gender just doesn't exist and putting myself into any of these categories just comes with stereotypes that limit who I am as a person. even being non-binary comes with stereotypes and expectations nowadays and i hate it sm. I just want to be myself without people thinking about what's in my pants.
Lol couldn't agree more, rather than dealing with the gender feels when someone calls me ""miss"" or ""ma'am"" I just retort in my head ""ITS DR THANK YOU VERY MUCH"" 

literally no one calls me Dr IRL though 😂
Honestly considering it. I'm currently doing my MA, but I'm not too keen on people calling me Master so I may go for the PhD 😅
I'm also in grad school. If I'm emailing someone who isn't a Dr or professor I just address them by their first name. Not sure if that's professional but everything else feels weird
THIS
That's fair enough 🙂

I've just noticed in my own and other's behaviour that gendered language can influence how you think about or treat someone, for that reason I really dislike it.
Could you not refer to someone as 'mate'? Quite a lot of strangers in the UK will call you it.

That or possibly buddy? Something along those lines.

I guess that's not very 'professional'.
same here!!!! i had this lady flirting with me because of my voice i was so irritated 1) this is the job 2) i’m not a lady!!!! all i could do was be polite because it was my job
""Mix""
in the uk we say mix or muhx
Exactly.  Not worth the time.  And if some hick wants to get all offended because of how I identify.  I'm sure I'd be told not to correct people anymore anyways.
Yeah imo titles are sort of unnecessary you can just address people by their name
Yes I am. I know, it's all so infuriating and our oberly gendered language doesn't make it better.
I never said your feelings are invalid, I said I don't relate to them. I don't really care what most people think about me so it doesn't bother me. I don't expect everyone to feel the same way.
Same thing goes for mate, I am sure I would get a lot of confused looks. Lol. But I have been able to get away with “friend” in many cases. “Excuse me friend”. “Thank you friend.” But it doesn’t always get the attention of the individual I’m trying to address. I really doubt there’s a neat and tidy solution to this, I just do my best to not outright offend anyone.
by any chance do you know what the full / polite version would be ? like an equivalent of madam or sir
Yeah, theyd find some way to say that correcting them on your pronouns is some how rude.
Didn't say you did? 😂

I was just explaining my pov
I don't believe there is a mainstream gender-inclusive version of madam or sir, sorry!
I knew what your point of view is because you already expressed that in the original post. I was offering an alternative view point that wasn't as popular and therefore under represented."	pi1zry	NonBinary	335	0.99	2021-09-04 23:25:50

I've been loving these posts so I've been wanting to do one myself (: my name is Brock but I've always gone by Broccoli. However, my pronouns are she/they (or she/slay) and I'd like to know what name you all think suits me best!		"Broccoli is literally the best name, I can't do better than that!
BROOKE!! if u cant tell by my user that’s my name lol so i’m a little biased but i always get called broccoli and brock as nicknames hehe
I don't care how you're called, that makeup's slaying it lol
No, Brock and Broccoli are FANTASTIC, keep them.

I also like the sound of Brae (Bray?) but they sound like the horse onomatopoeia i dunno if that bothers you. 

The Br- suits you well.
The first names I thought of were Maya, Mia, or Raina!
collie/colley/colly could be cute if you wanna stick with the broccoli nickname!
Please reject me so I can move on 😩
My mind went to Col (from brocCOLi) and then Kolya (in Slavic languages that's usually a male nickname but the ending in ""a"" makes most English speakers assume a feminine name.)
[deleted]
My mum's best friend's name is Brock and goes by Broccoli what a coincidence lol
Running with broccoli I'm thinking Colleen
Lily feels like kinda a play off your nick name or even lil
Gosh you are gorgeous!! 😍🥰 Love myself some colourful wings babe 😁
Ariana because u seem like a dangerous woman
do you use slay as like, a neopronoun? like she/her and then like, slay/slayself?
I’ll be honest, my sibling’s middle name is Brock and I sometimes call them Broccoli
broccoli is def rad! I was thinking Emery. Love the whole look! 💞🌻🌈
Idk why i thought of chocolate im horrible with names but this us funny
I really like that you go by Broccoli! If you ask me, I think you could go by Sadal or Romaine!
Collie! That way you can keep your name
Camille/Camilla
I love Brock and Broccoli, maybe other options could be something releated to plants maybe Clover, Ivy, Kale or Yam
You are Stunning!! My jaw hit the floor 💕

Can't really think of a name but wow!! You are stunning !!!
You look so wholesome ⭕️〰️⭕️
Teal. (I knew a girl in college with this name.) 🤗
You look kinda like a horseback riding instructor I used to have named Brie.  Yes, it's a cheese, but she made it cool and I bet you could too!
Oh my god that's such a good name. Broccoli is my favorite veggie EVER.

Can I call u Broccolini🥺
I think Brooke or like jade don’t know why jade just think it suits ya
Dani !!
Your hair is really pretty.
tiffany came to mind first but also broccoli is everything
Love the nails and hat!!
Vi, short for Violet, or Vee short for Veera. I'm feeling a V name for you 🥰
🥺🌟 you are a kind soul. I used to haaaate it as a kid but I've grown to like it as a nickname
My whole life when I've answered the phone as ""yes this is brock"" people instantly say oh, Brooke! Okay


I've learned to roll with it 🙈💖
☺️💖 you win. You didn't give a name, but you win
Aw 😋💖 I love that. Bri is one I've thought about before and I love the spelling of Brae!
I absolutely love Maya and Raina 💖
That’s a really clever idea. Collie is such a cute name.
No 💖🌈
I was literally about to comment the same thing lol
The tradition lives on 🥦
I love love love lily 🥺❤️‍🔥
🥺🌈 thank you so much. this was my was favorite look from a couple weeks back (I just started my makeup a month) but stay tuned for more I promiseee. I'll be getting dolled up for a local drag show 🌟
You dropped this 👑
No no no that's just a dumb pun forgive the poor attempt there 🙈 I was trying to say I slay
Broccoli tradition must live!!!! 🥦

My nonbinary friend seems to refuse to accept that I'm nonbinary too and it's killing me	"I feel like I'm suffocating. I actually cried for the first time the other day because I finally realized how messed up the situation is. They're nonbinary and while I've been nonbinary for years, they seem to brush that under the rug. They don't use my pronouns but complain when others only use one set (even when they do the same to me). They constantly deadname me even when I've lightly tried to steer them to my chosen name and have had all my socials as my chosen name for years. They will use everyone else's correct pronouns but not mine. They constantly spew toxic masculinity and judge my attire for being ""too feminine"". I always make sure to use their pronouns and their name and use terms that they are comfortable with yet they still seem to treat me as if I'm lesser and disrespect me. I hate this so much. My other friends tell me to talk to them but with how long this has been going on I feel like my friend is doing this on purpose and I'm not sure if it's worth it to try to fix. I'm just so done."	"You've tried talking to them and their still showing their ass to spite you. If you would like you can take your time and decide how you want to approach them. Something along the lines of I'm tired of your disrespect, you use this name and pronouns or that's it. They either shape up or you walk away. That's if you decide they're worth a second chance. You can always walk away now, you owe them no explanation. Their is no right way to be nonbinary which is what I think is happening here. They specifically see you as ""feminine"" based on you're comment. So they aren't treating you as nonbinary. If they are doing this to you they will most likely continue to pick and choose who they think is ""gay enough"". It's super messed up and they need a reality check
They're not your friend, tell them to fuck off. A friend is supportive. They aren't worth your time get rid of them.
Ugh. Might be internalised transphobia projected onto you (and thus becoming transphobia again). Potentially they feel like they have to keep up that front to be nonbinary enough, and thus have trouble accepting you being nonbinary in a different way which suits you better. It’s not in any way an excuse, but if this is the reason maybe they’re at least reachable? Though I understand if you have zero fucks left to give, you do seem to have given them enough chances to not be mean. 

I’m so sorry. It really hurts being invalidated by your peers who supposedly should be in a better position to get it right. I learnt early, and also very painfully, that other people knowing the pain of not-belonging does not in itself teach them compassion and respect.
I'm sorry I accept you
This isn’t a you problem, this is a them problem. Typically when someone is so resistant to things, there is a reason. A hunch could be that they are experiencing these feelings about themselves. When we have doubts about ourselves and if we are “nonbinary enough”, it is all from external sources. An issue can happen when we internalize that and lash out at others in the same way. 

Not sure if this is the case but it’s one possibility. 

Anyways - It sounds like you’re frustrated. I think that warrants a conversation. It may go to building a stronger friendship and understanding of each other. It may lead to better boundaries or moving into different directions. Either way, I think this could be a great opportunity for growth and confidence that you have your own back.

Edit: spelling and such
They sound like an ass. It’s hard enough getting recognition from binary people, why be a jerk to someone in a similar boat.
Do you have any other NB friends in your group? Idk if maybe your friend feels defensive about their own identity and wants to be ""the non-binary one"" without having to be compared to anyone else irl. They're still a hypocrite who's being needlessly cruel to you, and you really don't need to put up with their BS, but I wonder if their behavior is because they're insecure and not dealing with it maturely.
This person is not your friend.
that's not something a friend would say at all, that's straight up invalidation of your core existence.
Honestly, personally I’d cut them the fuck out of my life. Not even talk to them when they try to talk to you.
That doesn't sound like a friend. I know this might sound cliche but they sound jealous of you, I don’t know you or the friend but I usually see a pattern in people who act this way. They’re usually jealous of the person they’re bullying because they are open and comfortable with their identity and the bully is not and even if they are out they may still struggle with comfortability. This may not be their case but that’s what I’m getting from what you said. Either way person needs to settle whatever issues they may have if they actually care about you as a friend.
NGL this sounds like someone who thinks their gender makes them “special” and is hate keeping you because of it. They could also think you’re “copying” and are trying to bully you into “stopping” being NB. Regardless, this person isn’t your friend. I’d confront them if you feel it’s worth it, but you could always quietly distance yourself if thats more comfortable
It is okay for you to be done.


A lot of people have this romanticized view that the victim of bullying should be ""the bigger person"" and that abuse can be overcome with a polite, but firm, conversation. In most real-world instances, this just isn't the case.


Your ""friend"" is being an irrational jerk. It's not your responsibility to teach them how to be a regular person. It is your responsibility to take care of yourself. That could mean ignoring this person, calling them out for being a transphobe, ghosting them, or trying to have a polite, but firm, conversation.


You need to do whats best for you. Not what's best for the group dynamics and not what's best for this bully.
Being Non-Binary and being an asshole aren't mutually exclusive, they can be (and sure sound like they are) both.
This just sounds like a Person who has to tear others down to feel good about themselves.  It doesn't feel like it's about you.  Projection of insecurities can come out in weird ways.  But this isn't someone who is a friend.  They have a lot of personal things to deal with.
Drop that friendship. It’s better to be alone then miserable around the people you’re with. I’m sorry you’re going through this and I support you
They are not your friend, and they are causing you anguish. Screw that, ditch them.
It sounds like this individual has a personal issue or resentment with you that’s bordering on toxic and probably goes beyond their internal transphobia. Maybe they’re resentful that you’re non-binary and think you’re “copying” them (yes, people do this). Maybe they don’t think you act or look “queer enough” and are faking it (also a common mindset in our community). Maybe they dislike you for an entirely different reason and you need to ditch this “friend” altogether. Whatever their excuse, it isn’t acceptable and doesn’t justify it. 

Ask them what the hell their problem is and point out that they treat you differently and disrespectfully. You can also just ghost and quit hanging out with them if they don’t seem worth your time. I don’t know how they’d react to being called out but you deserve to be treated better.

Sorry your friend made so little sense my brain crashed several times. Name's Agathon. Sam Agathon. Pleasure to make your acquaintance, you are valid despite what your ""friend"" says. Best wishes my good human.
I hate telling you this but you should cut contact with this person, they don’t respect you and a friendship without respect it is not worth it. Like many comments said, they’re probably projecting their own insecurities in you, many people think that if you are non-binary you should be or act certain way which defeats the purpose of being non-binary. They also could feel threatened because they no longer are the only non-binary person on the friend group and they liked the idea of being special to some degree.
I think a frank conversation is needed about how they are making you feel, and if they continue further this is person you don't need in your life
I think you should give it a shot, talking to them, I mean. It seems to be on your mind enough to speak about it here, it’s probably way more beneficial to talk to them. We could sit here and assume why… but none of us know why they’re doing what they’re doing, only they do. 

If they’re combative/dismissive even when you sit them down and ask them “why do you invalidate me/misgender me”? Then it’s time to move on, but hopefully y’all can have an open and honest convo instead. Best of wishes to you!
I think it is time to reconsider the need to have them as a friend. Or, in less polite terms, tell them to fuck off.
Nah. Fuck that sub!
I have the same issue with my trans bf i have gotten multiple stress / nightmares dreams about it and I'm always crying all the time just know you're not alone on this one
I sent a picture or what this guy named clay said abt non-binary people and it was offensive to us. And I sent it to my friend and it was clay basically blaming us for Russia threatening to nuke and she said she doesn’t appreciate me sending her “innapropriate” stuff and continues to call me she her when I go by they them
Honestly just ditch them. If they won’t changed and you have told them to just move on. They aren’t worth your time!
""I'm the only enby in the village.""
they dont need to be a friend anymore
I would suggest ending the friendship but it's up to you. I know it can be tough ending a friendship especially if your other friends are friends with the person but you need to put yourself and your feelings first. 
If you do choose to end the friendship and they ask why tell them the truth. 
They're being a hypocrite by getting upset when people don't use their correct pronouns and name but deadnames and misgenders you. 

If you want to try keeping the friendship you could try being blunt with them instead of lightly trying to steer them to use your correct name and pronouns. If that doesn't work I'm sorry I think it's best you end the friendship. 

I'm sorry this happened to you, you're valid no matter what your 'friend' says
I would say to bring up how they would feel if they got deadnamed and misgendered, and whenever you tell that person to stop and they dont. Usually when it gets personal they see it from a different way, not that I'm saying it will help. It does sound like internalized transphobia tho
Idk how long ago you posted this, but seriously, if you care about the friendship, confront them. Then if they care they'll try and adjust their behavior, and if not then you know that they're not willing to put in the effort. I'm non binary and I appear very masculine and i really enjoy a feminine appearance from time to time. Dress, and look how YOU want to. Do what is best for YOU and your spirit. Also, this community is a fantastic place for advice and support, I've never felt unwelcome in this subreddit.
The same thing happened to me a year ago. I’m not friends with them anymore :/
You are NonBinary, they are too if they truly understand they are but at the same time then, they are a person who is NonBinary and also inconsiderate of who you are. Just like anyone from any groups of people can be rude or inconsiderate, even someone who’s NonBinary can also still be that while also being a negative person for you.

Might feel more confusing coming from someone of the same group but the negativity is just as equal to those who choose not to call you as you desire even after hearing you out. If you’ve already addressed these issues with them directly and they continue to brush you off, understand that they are no good for you. I don’t believe in evil people, I believe some people do evil things. It’s no ones duty to try and understand all evils, just acknowledging that they are hurting you is enough for you to understand the bare minimum of what’s next for you. If this person were a family member, I could understand wanting to see it out to improve the dynamics. Here however, they must learn on their own if they can’t treat you as a true friend with compassion and understanding like you have already done for them.

Letting go isn’t always easy. But sometimes the right thing to do is also not the easiest. To choose to idle by and suffer is not fair to you and honestly, there’s no one to blame than ourselves for those times we choose to take the pain. Letting go is sometimes a form of self-loving action. That’s something only you could provide for yourself. You are deserving of that love as anyone else. Let go here and who knows what may come of it. Just don’t turn to hatred towards anyone, including yourself. Hatred is a denial of love. You could only suffer in hatred, so pay no mind to some comments here that also direct some negative hate towards this person. I’m sure the commenters mean best by it, but only you truly know this person. I also know from my own self-hatred experiences, no good comes from hatred. You care, and that’s all that mattered here, it’s why it’s difficult to sit with the idea of leaving. Still, you don’t deserve to suffer by staying idle with this pain. To do that, would be your own evil doing. Again, some people do evil things, but there are no true evil persons. Pain causes evil, pain also stems from a love. This pain, is you care for yourself and what this person meant to you as a friend, that’s a very loving pain to have.

No wrong answers, only lessons to learn whether they be good or bad, for you to decide once they are made.
Ultimately it's up to you, only you can decide if they are worth your time because I will be honest that behaviour is disgusting and you don't deserve that. Sit and have a chat, lay it all down and if they don't like it cut them out of your life because this is hurting you and no one needs that level of toxicity in their life. I'm sorry that's happening to you and I hope that this issue is able to be resolved
Seconded just sit them down and lay it all out and if they don’t get it then leave and don’t look back

It was my birthday last week and I’m still spreading the message of “you can present with your AGAB and still be non-binary”! Also, my preferred pronouns are “Your Majesty” 😏		"Thank you! I needed this today
Yes! You can absolutely present with your AGAB and still be non binary! I also needed to hear this today - thank you (and happy belated)
Such power in those pronouns. Love it. ❤
yas queen!
I’m glad I could help!! I hope your day gets even better ^^
Hehehe, thank you!"	ihwn49	NonBinary	332	0.99	2020-08-28 00:03:28
Hi, my name is Echo! I’m agender and my pronouns are they/them :)		"Echo is such a cute name!
Hello echo I am as well echo lol
Hey Echo! I saw your post the other day about the spelling for your name. I love your name, great choice!
Ngl, Echo is an amazing name. I was gonna write a concept album about a character called Echo once.

It's a good name and you look nice! 🙂
Echo Love it, and love this evolution toward your truth! 🌈💗🦄
Hi Echo, it’s lovely to meet you :)
Welcome Echo.
Hello! First i would like to say that Echo is such a great name that i am totally, most definitely not jealous of at all. And second. Could someone fill me on in on the definition of Agender? I know very little and i would like go learn more about it. I don't wanna google it then get the wrong definition. .v.
Hi Echo! I love that name, its so nice. Also I love your piercings :)
I am also Ecco! Small world
Aha! Yes! Another Echo!
thank you!!
Is there an Echo in here?
oh hello Echo!
thank you so much!! :)
that’s so cool! you should totally go through with it. and thank you :)
thank you! i’m enjoying the journey :)
hellooo :) lovely to meet you as well!
thank you!
Agender is were you don’t necessarily have a gender. It’s different to non-binary as non-binary is a gender, just one that that doesn’t fit within the binary, whereas agender people don’t align with a gender, binary or not. Hope this could help!
thank you so much!!
love the spelling!
It kinda backfired a bit and I couldn't come up with a good chunky djenty guitar riff but I'm gonna give it another go soon.
Can I steal your name for myself?
hit the nail right on the head!
of course! it’s a great name and I wish more people used it 😊
Thank you.

I'll try to write that concept album.
I would love to hear that!!"	u2c1rz	NonBinary	322	1.0	2022-04-12 23:13:55
The use of 'they' as a nonbinary pronoun has been added to the Merriam-Webster dictionary today!		"i mean, its been used for hundreds of years as a singular pronoun, but this is still great!
Holy crap. This is probsbly a coincidense but this is why i swesr we sre in a simulation or something but this on the same day i came out to my mum
I think this is a step in the right direction. Language is complex and weird. if this gives someone some comfort, somewhere, then I am really happy for them.
I don’t know that I like this way of defining ‘they’ - by splitting the singular cases between an unknown antecedent and a non binary individual it leaves no room to use ‘they’ to refer to a known antecedent of unknown gender without gendering them as male/female/non binary. 

I know asking is preferred - but the person you walk past on the street whose cool hair you want to point out to a friend (for instance) does not want you to chase them down and ask before you can say ‘they have great hair’ and there are some people (whistles innocently) who may not be sure yet how they want to identify or whose identity shifts over larger or smaller stretches of time. 

Basically, if ‘they’ implies that a person is non binary, what pronoun do I use when I don’t want to specify anything about a known person’s gender?!
This is so freaking awesome, truly! Unfortunately “they” doesn’t even begin to capture the wide scope of gender pronouns enbies use to identify themselves. Not all non-binary ppl feel that “they” resonates as a pronoun. But this is definitely a step in the right direction.  

Ppl who are nonbinary & use “s(he)/they” genderflux pronouns or “ze/hir” neopronouns, etc. *you are just as non-binary & valid!*
I think that definition was already in MW (see entry **3**), but entry **4** was only added now.
I'd consider a known person of unknown gender to fit their unknown antecedent definition."	d5n8w0	NonBinary	327	1.0	2019-09-17 21:07:14
New pronouns dropped		"No cuz that’s actually how I operate sometimes if I’m doin a bit I’ll misgender myself if I think it’d be funny
My pronouns is they/them
dude thassa mood. just as long as its not she/her, u legit cant misgender me. i dont care lol
Fr like I have a preference for they/them but genuinely don't care what pronouns ppl use otherwise, so misgendering me is impossible. I'd like to see them try >:)  lol
Based
Thank you ☺️"	vsdzzh	NonBinary	324	0.99	2022-07-06 01:35:48
Finally realizing that my pronouns yes are they/them, really happy rn, ngl :) (don't know what to do with my beard)		"as a fellow non-binary person with a beard, i think you should keep it! as for my beard, i sorta see it as built-in contour. if you want my advice there it is haha. your lipstick and eyeshadow look v nice on your face as well~
Keep it because it's beautiful? I mean, you do you, clearly, and if you don't like it that's perfectly fine, but you're valid just the way you are and don't owe anyone performative androgyny.
Sometimes I try to use color in my beard to tie it in with the rest of my look

EDIT: also another poster mentioned that it’s built in contouring which is apt af
I love the beard/makeup combo
[deleted]
I use they/he pronouns and still have a beard. I wish I had your skills with a brush so that I can present more obviously enby!
I love your beard
Have a reward to give out for free so here's some silver
Keep the beard! Enby beards are beautiful ❤️
What a Chameleon
🤩👍
Whatever you want to do with the beard I dig this look!
I have the same struggle, you look like you've got the chin for both looks. Either way, you look great.😉
Absolutely beautiful :D
So happy for you 🥰 You look amazing btw, the makeup - especially that shade of lipstick - suits you so well!!!
It looks amazing on you!!! Wonderful contrast AND compliment to your makeup
Listen thembro I'll take it ok no questions asked
You look wonderful!! <3 Love your make up!!! My partner keeps their beard and I keep my facial hair, we both wear make up and nail polish. We feel great, but I think it's ultimately up to you and experimenting with your looks to see what you like.
Rainbow beard
you look amazing !!! love your hair and makeup!
This look is awesome - with it without beard. I love your lipstick and cat eyes too. I’m trying so hard to do cat eyes but it’s not working out.
Actually works really well as a contour hahaha thank you so much, it was my first time using a lipstick, and looks so well ty ty ty
Omg built in contour is a genius description!
Thank you, that's actually a thing, the androgyny look, sometimes I would like to look more fem, and don't want to have a beard, other days i yes want my beard hahaha but thank you for saying that is beautiful
Do you use eye shadow for that?
Hahaha lol you are right, maybe I'm giving too much importance to something that has such an easy solution, it only takes two and a half weeks for my beard to grow decently well again

Also! I'm really happy for you too, they/them cheers🥳
Oh anyone can use a brush, at the end is art and fit in every person in diferents ways and the most important, if you like how looks on you, just do it! Give it a try :)
Thank you!
Hahaha I feel very rich right now with two rewards, thank you for the silver
Aw thank you, we are hahaha
Hey thank you, i like to be a chameleon
Hahaha thank you, you can take it when you want to
Idk if i have the chin for both looks:( but thank you, you and your beard looks really great too :)
Thank you!
Aaah thank you, ussually the shadow in my eyes is darker and scarier than in the pic, but for those pinky shadow eyes i think that the lipstick suits well, and again thank you so much
Really really thank you!! So much complitments i feel embarassed hahaha
I definitely want to have false nails at some point, but they are so annoying to work with, thank you very much for your comment, I hope you are having a great week!
Thank you! I never thought I would get so many good comments, really thank you, a hug
Yep! It’s perfect if you have a palette with a bunch of different colors because you can do all kinds of cool shit (gradients, patterns, etc)
You’re welcome! You’re also totally gorgeous with it even without the makeup.
Ty for the advice! I will definitely try soon
