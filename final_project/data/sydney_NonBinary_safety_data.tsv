The Duality of Dysphoria		"Hard relate
I feel very very called out with the first pic
I didn’t know other people felt pretty much the same way I do wow.
Daily conversations in my head for $200 please, Alex.
I think the obsession with validity is overrated. My focus is on rights etc, Even if I am just a boy who likes makeup and fancy shoes sometimes
Double Trouble, our lord and savior
Did you just reach into my brain and pull that first paragraph straight from there can we TALK ABOUT SHARED EXPERIENCES PLEASE
Relatable, but my ADHD makes me point out that was and were are not pronouns!
I want to steal their gender so bad
Good pic for the meme. Double Trouble always chooses chaos 😂

But yeah…. All too true.
Hehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehe I'm in this picture and I don't know how to feel about it.
Double trouble was literally the cause of my realization that I'm non-binary they're the frickin best.
Literally me ever day even since I came as nonbinary.
Oh look, the most relatable character from a show I've never seen.
Only I get to say I'm not valid.
Me as genderfae 😭
Oh my god, this is so on the nose. Can I use it as my profile pic please?
I'm just starting to just Michael Jackson ""HEE HEE!"" when my friends hard ""he"" me LOL
In Double Trouble we trust 🫡
I was about to make a post that was going to be a really long version of what this meme summed up. 😂
Needed to see this, ty OP ❤️
aaargh  my brain
Feel that very much....especially the upper one
what animated series is that meme from? :o

looks interesting.
Jeez this is too relatable lmao
Was is also part tence 💔💔💔😭😭😭
Test
Fun isn't it.
Looks like I've stuck a chord with a ton of people, lol!

For everyone who's commenting and saying the self-doubt part of the meme mirrors their own inner turmoil, know that none of that makes you invalid. Just take a look at these comments - a *ton* of non-binary people experience impostor syndrome as well.

I think a lot of this is a symptom of existing in a transphobic society. If you have to filter your authentic self whenever you go out in public, and live as an identity that's not your own, then that's going to rub off on you, whether you want it to or not. The same goes for when other people ""sir"" or ""ma'am"" you all the time. If nobody takes you seriously, then it makes you question yourself, even if you ultimately know that you're valid. For me, when I have to be in boymode for a long time (like when I'm at work), that makes the self-doubting start. But when I'm around my queer friends, and can be my authentic, unfiltered self, then I feel non-binary as *fuck*.

So what can we do about all of this? First, I'd say try to find as many queer friends as you can. If you surround yourself with people who accept you as you are, it does wonders for your mental health. Find your local queer events/meetups, and go to them! If there aren't any, then start one (if you feel safe enough, of course)! Strike up a conversation with someone wearing queer pins, and maybe you'll gain an accepting friend!

And while that's a decent coping mechanism, we also have to solve the problem of experiencing transphobia in the first place. If it's safe for you, start being more assertive about your identity. Practice saying, ""Oh, I'm not a man/woman"", ""Actually, my pronouns are they/them,"" and so on in the mirror, until you feel confident enough to say it for real. Or, if you're not out yet, figure out where your friends/family/colleagues are on their journey towards accepting trans people. Start pushing them in the right direction, step by step. Not everyone will change, so don't waste your time on the backwards ones, but do try to help along those who are willing to listen.

If you're just complaining about things online, but you're not actively trying to make them better, then it's time to fix that. It's like having a giant pile of shit in your room, and saying, ""Gee, I sure wish someone would clean that shit up."" If nobody's cleaning it up, then you're going to keep smelling it until *you* clean it up. And if there is someone cleaning it up, well, it is a pretty big pile of shit - it's not fair for them to have to clean it up all on their own. They could definitely use your help with it, so why not help them, and lighten their load? Why not get a group of people to pitch in, so it's easier for all of you?

Our society is a giant pile of shit right now. We all have to do our part to make it better, so it's time to start doing yours. Start or join a queer advocacy group, if it's safe. If it's *not* safe, think about what you can do to get things to the point where it is. And it's not just about queer rights, of course - it's also about racial justice, womens' rights, workers' rights, environmental justice, animal liberation, and so on. A better world is not going to come about on its own, like an apple that falls from the tree when it is ripe - you have to **make** it fall. So get off reddit, go outside, and start making things better!

(This isn't aimed at you personally, I'm just replying here so everyone can see it)
dont forget that non binary doesnt mean you cant exist with part of the binary, you can still associate with being a man/woman while also not associating with it. gender is a made up construct and the way you experience it is solely defined by purely that. how you experience it. you can enjoy boymode while not feeling like you're a boy. non binie is simply existing outside of the binary in any way❤
With 8+ billion people in the world, it's pretty unlikely for any one person to have a completely unique struggle.
you are so right .  i am eternally fluctuating & have accepted that there's no resolution just one hell of a ride .  and if I am breathing,  I'm valid .  i always think of a parking pass ""do you validate parking?""  haha  Validated !
Both are important, imo. We need to tend to the mental health of our community, while also getting out in the streets and fighting for rights.
I love them so much.
Lmao, looks like I struck a chord with everyone. I don't check reddit very often, but sure, my DMs are open if you want to talk about the non-binary experience!
They will be, if the transphobes don't shut the hell up though.
well, that's not necessarily true. there's nothing stopping anyone from using them as xenopronouns or nounself pronouns
Of course, you don't even have to ask.
She-Ra and the Princesses of Power (2018). **Highly** recommend it, it's a fantastic show with tons of queer rep.
Like a merry-go-round of misery.
absolutely .  it's not necessarily ' neither' ...  for me it is BOTH
This is true... it's just sad that most of us will never meet our counterparts. It would be real nice not to be so alone in rl in these struggles...
I guess I should start looking at It that way
>She-Ra and the Princesses of Power

thanksies :)
I have a love hate relationship with my gender fluidity.
for me its man yes man no woman absolutely not none sure masculinity yes femininity yes 😂😂
hello .  nice to meet you .  .  it's a privilege to know other victorious enbys .   we are everywhere
If you have any local queer events or meetups, those are a good way to meet other people!
Victorious??? LOL. What gave you that idea? I am just existing, that's all. Far cry from ""success"". It's a weird world out there, and well... most people just make assumptions one way or the other. It's so weird because 99% of the population is just wrong on first glance, even the allys. Allys immediately assume I'm a transwoman and enemies immediately use everything to attack the male side. But what's weird is noone ever asks. Like I don't think even my pronouns have ever been asked before, they just make assumptions.
There isn't. And I don't like the term ""queer"" because I'm ace. There's a sexuality-related connotation. There used to be an LGBT+ group at my clinic but they closed because of COVID never to return. So once a year there's pride and last year was the first one I ever went to, and might be the last. I was so out of place...
even just surviving for me is a victory .  means I made it another day without punching my own ticket . so there's that
Biiig oof, you don't know how relatable that statement is. The fact that I always think that way is why I don't feel like a success, y'know? Which makes it so interesting that we came to different conclusions of what it meant lol. But I'm glad you are able to take a more positive approach than I am!"	12dndrh	NonBinary	1565	1.0	2023-04-06 15:15:25
what’s up with the trans hate?	"As a person who identifies as both trans and non-binary, I must say some trans folks are so hateful to enbies especially when they don’t medically transition?? Like what?? Especially the older generations. I get it, back in the day it was important to pass and not be clocked for mostly safety reasons. You couldn’t just get a way being a “man” with a beard wearing a dress and make up. I totally get it. But the times are changing and we should celebrate that. Some of us just don’t want to take hormones, because of reasons or just because they simply worked hard to accept their bodies, but damn the hate trans folks send us is ridiculous. 
“If you identify as trans but you still present masculine/feminine than what does trans even meant to you??”
It means whatever I want it to mean to me. It’s none of anyones business but mine. I just wanted to rant a bit and also thank the enby community for being so sweet and welcoming. You guys are great 💜🖤💛🤍"	">“If you identify as trans but you still present masculine/feminine than what does trans even meant to you??”

This fusion of outer appearance and internal gender identity is especially confusing for me as agender/neutrois person. Because it's almost impossible for me to express myself fully and correctly, I can't express the absence of gender, complete a-binarity, lack of everything. I can't express void. I just want to be respected, please.

I'm not my agab, that's what makes me trans, not my avatar in this universe.
I'm an older generation trans non-binary person, and I don't get the hate either. Just the idea of there being any kind of gate keeping in the community blows my mind.  But here we are.

And I know it's hard to feel valid when people run their mouths but try as best you can. Because at the end of the day, you know you. And you are valid in your identity no matter what.
We call them truscum & transmeds. They're pretty much shunned by the rest of the trans community.
truscums/transmeds suck aren't aren't really accepted by the rest of us lol
Many trans women see femboys as eggs or trans in denial, it's really harmful.
Tbh I feel like a lot of people who are insecure about their gender or their validity as a trans person will try to remedy that by saying “well at least I’m more valid than [X] type of person” and the trouble with that is that it doesn’t work and it makes you an asshole. I guess I personally don’t understand feeling nonbinary but also being even remotely ok with passing as a cis person or wanting to do so because that gives me insane dysphoria but I’m also not going to assume that my experience is universal and start shitting on people for having different life experiences than me.
The bit about medically transitioning is especially terrible, and it reeks of transmedicalist nonsense. There's so many reason non-binary people don't transition, such as, but not limited to;

\- Transitioning is expensive, and most healthcare plans accessible to us don't cover it

\- How do they think transitioning as a non-binary person would go? Binary trans folk already have to go through a hard process transitioning to a gender that's medically accepted due to gatekeeping and ""You say youre sure, but I don't think you are because Im a headass doctor"" How do they they think it would go for us to go to our doctors and say ""I don't identify as a man or woman, but I want to edit my features to suit me better, can I get top surgery/HRT/bottom surgery?""

\- Some people are FINE with their natural, unmodified body as a non-binary person (hell, some people are even fine as a binary trans person) and that's THEIR business. It's not up to anyone else to pick it apart, they just have to respect it.

""What does trans even mean to you if you don't transition?"" Maybe because your body =/= your gender? It's like they forget that a man, cis or trans can wear a dress and still be a man, but they completely lose that energy when it comes to an enby presenting their gender in a way that suits them. They're all for trans acceptance until it comes to confronting their own preconceived notions about gender and sex when non-binary people so much as exist as their authentic selves. It's the same as cis people. It's just too uncomfortable to deconstruct because it brushes up against the idea that they've built their identity up around something they thought was inherit, but in actuality, isn't at all.

In conclusion, I try really hard to not think about these people. I know myself. I know who I am. I don't need anyone else to validate it for me, no matter how much some idiots try to loudly assert that they know me, a stranger, better than I know myself. It just speaks volumes of how over-confident and arrogant in the worst way they are.
Not proud to admit it but I used to be one of those jerks. Transmedicalism, I believe it is called. Before I came out as nonbinary, I identified at FtM trans and had a lot of traditional views when it came to gender and roles. This is mostly from my upbringing and being in a small town, but boy were my eyes opened once I attended a university and met some gender nonconforming people (younger and older) and took classes relating to human sexuality and LGBT+ topics.

It’s hard to remember exactly what was going through my brain at the time when I was very strongly transmedicalist, but I think it was a mixture of some things. A failure to realize that gender and gender roles and all of that are purely social constructs, with subsequent consequences on every person, cis or trans or however you identify. A failure to recognize that humans should be a collective instead of a divided species. A failure to recognize that humans are each so complex in how we feel things and view the world. And most selfishly and embarrassingly, I somehow felt as if gender nonconforming folks gave trans people and myself a bad reputation and invalidated our journeys. Don’t worry, I’ve since realized that this couldn’t be farther from the truth.

My biggest eye opener was when I attended a lecture on intersexuality. I knew intersex people existed at the time, but my assumptions of them had been warped by cishet media and ideals. Learning that people existed perfectly happy out there with physical aspects their sex not aligning with societal expectations really made me think. I began to actually deeply question sex and gender and my ideas of it. I started to ask nonbinary people more questions, read scientific papers on sex and gender and feminism and homosexuality, researched the origins of the patriarchy and different gender roles in different cultures. It was all so fascinating to me.

Time went on and I realized male and female are just haphazard descriptors of your reproductive status, and gender roles have been conditioned upon us by patriarchal beliefs planted by some insecure men thousands of years ago. We are all just humans trying to exist in this life our predecessors have created for us, and we need to be able to recognize when our predecessors were wrong. Luckily my views changed when I gained knowledge and asked questions, but there are people much more rooted in their beliefs than I.
Toxicity and being am asshole transcends gender. Everyone I capable of being one.
I'm a trans woman, not really non binary anymore. I was only non-binary for a few months before I realized I was just a woman. The white in the trans flag is for non-binary people. Don't listen to anyone gatekeeping or anything they fucking suck.
More of these rants pls

Speaking volumes, in good ways

excellent video about this topic from a black trans woman
I'm an older (turning 40)nonbinary person, on HRT for years, has had a gender affirming surgery.

I am no more or less nonbinary than the next person on this sub. Our gender isn't something that is put on a scale and measured. Neither is transness. They are words to help us describe our experience, not simply new boxes to constrain us.
As has been said, I think gatekeeping, maybe stemming from insecurity plays a role. I used to want to transition and I've been told that I'm not nonbinary enough now because I don't make enough effort at getting the masculine or nonbinary 'look' every day (which seems like a strange concept really, that I have to make an effort to look how I feel and to make an effort to fit into not fitting in!).  I don't often make any effort at looking feminine but unfortunately I have a very feminine looking body and face. So, in todays world where demonstration and appearances mean everything, to some people I can't just be. I need to look how I feel. I need to be a brand. But some nonbinary don't necessarily have a consistent inner feeling so they might not have a signature look. So in such shallow times where extremism, uncompromising black and white thinking is the norm, perhaps  our existence may be unsettling and even 'inconvenient ' to some people's outlook on life and views on certain issues?

Also our existence has been used by transphobic hate groups and individuals as an argument again the plausibility of trans being a genuine phenomenon.  Obviously heavily distorted, ignorant and warped arguments but they have been used. So perhaps misplaced negativity from that?

Also some ciswomen and transpeople (edit it's only fair that I add that I've seen way more ciswoman say this than transpeople) have argued that nonbinary people are taking the aspects of those communities that suit them while leaving the inconvenient aspects like hate, persecution,misogyny, transphobia, violence, sexual violence that come with being  a ciswoman or a trans person and then using our chosen aspects as a lifestyle choice. This inconveniently ignores the hate, prejudice and even violence nonbinary people can face just for not fitting into norms eg daily misogyny for afb nonbinary people if we don't take time to dress and act 'feminine' enough. Unfortunately there is a widespread myth that nb people don't face persecution on a significant scale. This ignorance could be a reason for some of the discrimination- if some see us as again trying to have the label of being gender noncomforming but without the hardships that come with it.

 Some transphobic groups liken trans as a costume that they can take off at inconvenient times. Obviously conveniently ignoring the hate, prejudice and extreme violence ordinary trans people are subjected to for just existing. The impression some people see nb similarly is sad but unfortunately expected, but if that includes some trans people and allies then it is ironic and even sadder, considering. Do humans ever learn? When I've seen or heard such opinions I can't deny that I've been emotional, hurt, angry even. Although I feel the need to add that I've heard that opinion more from allies than trans people themselves. Not that I haven't heard it from trans people but- not nearly as much.

 I know nb people can be discriminated against: I've been called a dog and barked at and threatened with violence on days that I wear mens or gn clothes and no makeup and don't do my hair. On one occasion I was told by the same man who'd called me a slug, on a rare day that I put on makeup, a dress etc that I looked beautiful and was turning him on (eww). I have been told by authorities on non makeup days that pictures with me wearing (natural looking ) makeup and in a dress and styled hair was not a picture of myself so couldn't be used as evidence (a domestic violence case, long story).
As a trans girl (or maybe transfem NB, trying to figure that out still) I hate to admit this but seeing nonbinary AMAB folks with beards, makeup + dresses etc. triggers my dysphoria really hard. Same with drag queens.

It feels like I'm seeing myself in a dysphoric mirror. I'd never treat someone differently because of it, but it does cause negative feelings to me when I see folks post here sometimes. 

I'm working on it though, I plan to see a therapist soon so I can hopefully begin to untangle/undo a lifetime of built up internalized transphobia + self hatred.

The reason I say this is that maybe this kind of feeling is at the root of some trans women who do try to gatekeep or give NB's a hard time.
Yeah, I feel pretty outsider-y with how I personally identify because, while I feel like I wasn’t born into the right body, I’m ok with it and identity as a femboy cos I have an AFAB body but I’m not on the inside but I can also experience fluidity and feel feminine. Sure, if I was a dude I’d have more respect from others, men especially and the chances of sexual assault would’ve been way lower but I got to have a female experience and am grateful I got to understand a woman’s struggles and general experience. It’s a trip but 🤷🏻‍♀️

I thought about doing a semi transition but that’s not a commitment I can make for multiple reasons.
As an asexual I go through the ringer every time I dare go into a non hetero space because I'm just ""spicy straight"" according to them and I think its kind of the same thing? Like they just feel like it validates themselves more to see someone that isnt \*as\* gay/trans/oppressed as them. Its all internalized homo/transphobia imo, they're the example of a \*good\* lgbt and seem more legit compared to someone who doesn't seem as ""committed"" to not being cis/het :') Thankfully I haven't met any of the enby hate yet but I also haven't really tried to go looking for that community yet either so
I think it largely comes down to gatekeeping and, sometimes, internalized transphobia. It reminds me a great deal of gay men and lesbians who are biphobic.

I think there are a few big factors:

\- Strong transmedicalist views and reliance on them. Some people are extremely threatened by the existence of trans people who don't intend to transition in very binary ways because they're scared that this threatens their own validity or access to treatment. For example, they might depend on the idea that having bottom dysphoria is an inherent, universal part of being trans to justify their own need for bottom surgery. The idea that trans people might have different needs and wants disrupts that.

\- A heavy focus on defining identity around oppression and suffering. A lot of these people have a perception (that isn't always accurate) that non-binary people suffer less, have the option of living as cis, or don't experience any discrimination or oppression for being trans. 

\- Generational differences and resentment. Younger people are often more likely to feel comfortable coming out, questioning their gender, or identifying as non-binary, and I think some older trans people are skeptical of that in the same way that some older LGB people see younger people coming out as queer as being trendy.

I also think that a lot of people who aren't non-binary themselves have a difficult time understanding the challenges and limitations of living and presenting as non-binary. Depending on the individual, there may not be many transition options that will lead to them being gendered correctly by others. A feminine trans man who wants to medically transition may reach a point where he passes as a feminine man. And vice versa for a masculine trans woman. But non-binary people can have very limited control over whether others view us as non-binary.
A Trans person is someone who identifies as something other than what they were assigned at birth, so if you identify as nonbinary, then you are also allowed to identify as trans. Identifying as something doesn't change your appearance, but it does change your gender. Some enby people don't Identify as trans because they feel that being nonbinary is enough, and honestly as long as you're happy, it doesn't matter! They're all just labels to make ourselves feel more comfy, so people just need to learn how to respect others and welcome them into their communities.
Keep in mind that the binary trans people spreading this hate are a small (though sometimes vocal) minority. Disclaimer, I am cis(?), but it's 100% worth keeping in mind that this is what the right wing wants. Divide and conquer. We all, as a queer community, have more in common than we don't. The ""queer discourse"" (like aphobes/biphobes/etc) to terf pipeline is extremely real (obviously less of an issue in this sub, but still worth mentioning).
We don’t owe anyone androgyny or *any* other gender performance. The idea that non-binary identity is somehow bound by binary roles is completely ridiculous.
I'm binary and I don't agree with them. They're truscums and we all need to call them out. They're bigots, just like TERFs, except that they happen to be trans. I have only love for non-binary people.
I mean, basically every person who isn't cis exists in a state of trauma because of transphobia.  Sometimes trauma responses turn inward, sometimes outward, sometimes both. 

Trauma doesn't excuse or justify harm of course, but I think it might explain why people turn on others who are similar to them in a lot of cases.
I don’t want to medically transition because I don’t really care about my body one way or the other and so it’s just not worth the effort if I don’t care. 

This is why I like to differentiate between social dysphoria and body dysphoria. You can be any kind of trans (non binary, binary, fluid) and have either one but not the other. 

Everyone has different experiences. Live and let live. Love and let love.
Some of them think that having an abundance of transgender people who don't medically transition will make cis people not take trans people seriously and thus become more transphobic... well let me tell you that a transphobic person will still be transphobic even if all trans people are binary transexuals
As a genderfluid I feel this rant so much... When I look a month or two back (my inner CO is not that old) I looked in some (self)support boards and it was really... Uff...

Most FtM/MtF were like ""the stupid NBs snatch away our therapist appointments, although they don't really want to transistion"" and it was really depressing to read. There were also nice people who named this kind of talk like it is, as a big pile of BS, and that we are ALL struggling in one or another way. Sometimes more, sometimes less.

I also have a fair share of (mental) illnesses and my struggle isn't less real, just cause I have a good day. 🤷🏻‍♀️

The real problem is, that there are not enough therapists, who are experienced or specialised in working with people who are trans. But here in Germany it's partly originated in our healthcare system, like once there were much more therapists, but the insurances just said ""naaah. One therapist per X thousand people is enough."" 🤦🏻‍♀️

Today I was in the cinema with my husband (we watched ""Everything Everywhere All at Once"", I recommend 10/10) and I was so happy to see other NBs, but didn't had the courage to wave or drop a nice word, cause I still don't look very queer/enby and I didn't want to seem rude.
So often I'll see people on other trans subs shitting on neopronouns, I really just do not get it
Older cishet* woman here. I'm going to shout this from the rafters: lack of understanding doesn't give people the right to be rude, mean or hateful. 

If anyone tries to give you the ol' ""I'm older and I just don't get it, so I'm going to deadname you, misgender you, ignore your pronouns or make snide comments about appearance"" BS, don't put up with it. Sure, we might make a mistake from time to time, but the right move is to apologize. I assure you, people are perfectly capable of at least trying to get it right, regardless of age. 

Internet hugs to y'alls. It must be soulfully tiring either constantly correcting people, or constantly bottling it up. 

*autocorrect wants to make this cashew. Perhaps cishets can now be cashews.
People act like nonbinary people aren't trans and try to invalidate and blame what the government does on us instead of accepting the fact that cishet people do not give a shit lol
Hell, NB falls under the trans umbrella. We're represented by the white stripe on the trans flag, sooooooo.....y'know.
Those, are transmeds/truscum. They’re not apart of the larger trans community and definitely aren’t welcomed if they’re unwilling to learn/plan on being hateful. But yes, they do suck
Def

There's two sides under the Trans umbrella; binary and non-binary! And if not all binary people medically transition, no-one can expect to successfully gatekeep ENBY folks! Come on.

Genderfluid here 💙🖤💜🤍💗 and I definitely identify as Trans!! 
And cis people's weird assumptions about what my AGAB was and what hormone therapies I've done if any are invasive and creepy enough, I don't need other Trans folks to pull the same nonsense 🙃
If I had the money (and the desire), I'd do HRT. However, I look androgynous enough that I have no need for HRT.
Some people think they’ll gain acceptance by behaving or presenting a certain way. For some transmedicalists they think having their identity tied to a health issue either mental or biological gives them more validity. So people without dysphoria or the right kind of dysphoria who don’t transition in the way they think is necessary undermine the definition of transgender they want to put forward.

This is harmful, it undermines the identity of more people than they intend. People who can’t transition because of health issues or financial reasons get treated as less trans, and it erases thousands of years of transgender people who existed before the language, and medical technology we have now existed.

They think society will accept them if they’re one of the good ones, and separate themselves from the bad trans people. It rarely ever does them any good though, look at how the right treats Dave Rubin, Buck Angle, and Blaire White.

It’s insecure people that think they can get points with society at large by throwing others under the bus or at least get less hate by distancing themselves.
Such BS, there are so many enby trans people as well as enby only and should be fully respected. There’s no binary!!!
A lot of this is going around recently due to a video on most social medias by now, I’m paraphrasing because I think it’s laughable but they said something along the lines of “only African American people can be non binary” which is not really true unless they are talking about two-spirited( just learned about this forgive me and sorry for the paraphrase) I believe two spirited is an indigenous North American term(sorry again not good with this stuff) (sorry this reads terribly and I don’t want to offend anybody) but it’s been picking up a lot of traction and unfortunately people are seeing it and applying it. my better half is enby they/them and they recently got criticized for looking female and then when nb was brought up got called a racist, seems like a misinformation campaign it’ll die down I’m sure. Negative people have a way of taking care of themselves.
I had no idea there was any hate at all. Then again, there are like no trans people in my life unless you count myself. Which I don't know nor care if I am labeled trans. I know I am nonbinary.
Yes, as a trans enby, this current rhetoric breaks my damn heart, the division happening in our trans community 💔 I have nothing but love for my trans binary siblings, and it hurts so much to see some of the things being said right now! NB identities being invalidated and questioned - ugh.
Same reason a lot of gay and lesbian people can sometimes be rude or hostile towards trans individuals. They get so wrapped up in themselves and the so-called identity politics of it all. Many trans people are so caught up in the binary systems they attach themselves to, that they can't see anything other. Not to mention, most people cis or trans, have a hard time conceptualizing a 'genderless' individual, let alone anyone that doesn't align themselves with the traditional gender binary at all. 

In my experience, however, many trans people just get really defensive against everyone in general. I've said a few times before that gender doesn't exist, and that it's a social construct. I never say that with the intent of devaluing anyone, but some trans people have taken my statements to mean their gender in specific doesn't exist. Some have gotten upset when I've said that even dysphoria or surgeries aren't 'requirements' to be trans. 

Gender is such a nebulous concept, though. It's not going to mean the same to everyone; and not everyone explores or navigates it the same way. The degree to which nonbinary people experience this will probably always be a sort of controversial thing because it's considerably less tangible in the minds of those who can't conceive of other genders outside a very general 2 existing. Nonbinary people have very different relationships with gender than cis and trans people, who seemingly have everything just laid out for them.
Reminds me of that one time I was fighting with my sister because she was like ""enbies aren't trans""
Agree with this so much & was just ranting about it on twitter lol cause it’s really crazy! And I do notice it mostly from older trans people who have already transitioned. I can’t understand the lack of sympathy from them
there’s never gonna be anything sadder than people inside the community putting down their own
Trans medicalists are dumb af...smh
I feel like some binary trans people don’t view enbies as ‘trans enough’, I’ve seen a trans woman call nonbinary people the biggest issue in the LGBTQ+ community and too many people were agreeing with her
I am also nb 
I watched this video recently, the creator goes into the  question you asked ! 

The YouTuber puts it in better words than I can :)

https://youtu.be/PoicD_Jea0s
Sorry, if you don't identify as either a man or a woman, what exactly is the default you're supposed to transition to? Rhetorical question because it blows my mind that trans people would be the ones doing this. It's even more infuriating when the call is coming from inside the house.
I don't know why it's surprising a binary trans person can't understand outside that binary at first; they're operating alongside the same gender role system as cis folx.
I think we're seeing a backlash because 
1.  Try he involvement of kids, especially exposed to drag shows.
2.  The addition of ""infinite genders"", and people who identify as cats and so forth.

It's asking too much of the establishment to accept.
I’m on the fence about identifying as trans (non binary, Pansexual, basically can’t make up my mind about anything - badum tsh) but I don’t see how NonBinary people identifying as Trans is wrong - it’s not like it is a zero sum game 🤷🏻
my understanding of trans is to not be cis - but maybe that’s too simplistic and I am missing something?

Either way - you don’t deserve hate for wanting to be safe in and apart of the LGBTQ+ community.
Unfortunately, all groups have in-group fighting.
I’ve only ever had explicit hate about being pan from lesbians and a handful of male cis het religious zealots (otherwise people are just gross and assume you are down for anything with anyone…. which is just…. a whole other can of worms for another day)

You be you! You aren’t taking anything from anyone and if they feel like you are then they have their own shit to work through which isn’t your responsibility x x x
There are unfortunately going to be a lot of binary trans people that are going to be upset with nonbinary people who don't choose to go through a physical transition. It may be a sort of ""well I had to and I go through these certain hardships so you have to go through these too to get this label"" sort of thing. Like oppression Olympics. But there are also plenty of nonbinary people who do want to transition. And some have dysphoria and some not. Everyone should be happy that things are getting easier and better for everyone else, but unfortunately we are all human and have complicated emotions. I don't hate them for feeling like that, even if I don't condone those sentiments. There are also plenty, maybe the majority, of binary trans people who support and love nonbinary trans folks. Most of my trans friends are binary trans, and I love them so much and they all love and support me as well.
Yuck, sorry abt the hate. Transmedicalists can be gross to other trans people sometimes, it’s mostly internalized hate that they spew to things they don’t understand. You’re always valid and welcome here! No need to thank for basic human decency. :)
It's transphobia, plain and simple. There's trans creators out there who make deeply transphobic content, and other folks might have some transphobia as well as some internalized issues that make them feel ""less special"" now that more people are identifying as trans, and the spectrum of trans representation has increased in recent years. There's also of course a phenomenon where some of these people might be conservative in their idea of ""there are only two genders"" (again, transphobia) or they might simply be uncomfortable with progress. People tend to settle into their ideas, and when things change it can cause discomfort. Hateful people express that discomfort as hate. There may also be jealousy that hasn't been worked through - perhaps those people never had the ability to express or exist in the ways they're now seeing others express, and that makes them jealous, envious, or they may feel grief for their own transition if they felt unable to do those things. It's not okay to turn that into hate, but many people lack the emotional intelligence to process that healthily. 

I used to identify as nonbinary which is why I'm in this sub, but recently decided I'm a binary trans man. There's definitely some confusion in binary trans communities at time about non-binary trans experiences, and I'm hopeful that time will improve that. There's also a clear impression that others always still saw me as my birth gender before I decided I was going to make a binary transition, and my nonbinary identity was never valid to the people around me. That sucked to realize. 

Sending you all love. It's not fair and it's not easy.
Damn, didn't even know about this internal strife in the bg, I thought it was more united
I don't really know why, but it really sucks to me as I identify as trans but also nonbinary (trans demigirl, i think?) I feel like a girl bit still not really on the binary. Being trans isn't something binary exclusive and people who hate on nonbinary trans people are just shitty
Any group or individual that tries to define what gender identity is for anyone other than themselves is a red flag. Full stop, hold your sundress down Stanley.. the blowhards are trying to tell me I'm not trans enough. Please.. who the hell do they think they are?  It's like they missed the whole point of self identity and kept right on going to narcissismville. Gate keepers just have control issues like those cliche mean girls in highschool, and hopefully they get it worked out in therapy.  

Buuuuut, in the mean time. There ARE people in the LGBTQIA spectrum here, that aren't toxic. : Hand raise :  That DO, welcome everyone and support people in healthy ways. We just have to be louder than the ignorant ones. And just because someone is gay it doesn't mean they are happy, yeah? I'm sure you knew that, but I just found it a tad ..chuckle worthy.
I agree with the OP; no one's identity should be invalidated. But I'm reading a lot of things here like 'binary trans people are upset just because I worked on my self acceptance and can be trans without medical transition'. Or that 'binary trans people are like cis people and reactive because they framed their identity around something that wasn't as concrete as they realized'. That is literally the same invalidation you're venting about.

Binary trans people (particularly women) are already facing a repeal in safety, respect and access to medical care because nonbinary rhetoric has been weaponized, primarily by systems of neoliberalist politics, but also apparently within the community... We're not even fighting our own fight right now.

If naming this makes me truscum than I'll take that label with the rest I've been given. I'm not here to invalidate anyone, but hopefully have people consider how we're approaching this conflict with the same approaches we've been fighting against.
Truly, just let people be what's comfortable for them. Self identification is so important, and we're only just starting to open up how we approach that as a society, and so much is still so needlessly gender-associated.

It's extremely complicated for a person to think about already, I don't understand when people make it harder for others by trying to put everyone in specific baskets, that's just not how people work.
> “If you identify as trans but you still present masculine/feminine than what does trans even meant to you??” It means whatever I want it to mean to me.

My sentiments exactly. My transgender identity is in my head. No one else knows me better than I know myself. I owe no one an explanation.

I am a jeans-and-tshirt enby. Anyone having a problem with my gender expression first has to first tell me what presentation an amab person can adopt to be read as agender-adjacent. Until then, just use my pronouns, as spelled out on my pronoun badge.
Agreed. My gender is empty inside but expresses itself as both at the same time, for practical reasons or because of my mood. But a dress to me isn't feminine or masculine. It just is. If I put makeup on I think it looks nice but I don't feel feminine even if I'm aware that others see me as such. I just feel human. It might not make sense to those who have strong feelings of their gender but that shouldn't be an argument against nonexistence- think about the many people who don't understand what trans people are going through. It is arrogant and transphobic of them to dismiss their existence based on what they themselves don't understand it. 

But there is a similar unrecognised attitude by those who should know better towards nb individuals. I've seen it expressed by an individual that to compare a nb to a trans person is wrong, despicable even. While I can't remember the author (except they were a gay man who ironically expressed this in in article about his own transphobic past and his guilt about this) they did have a platform to express their views.

If I put makeup on me it's because I'm decorating this thing that is my body. If I wear my boyfriend's clothes I think they suit the body. If I wear a dress it's because my boyfriend likes it on me and I see it as a nice decoration. I see myself as wholly unattached to my body. It's just how I feel. I don't know if it's linked to my asd but I've felt it and tried to express it since I've been a child in the 90s where most people had little to no concept of nb. 

So I think a lot nb people are going to struggle to be understood in this age where appearance is so heavily linked to who you are internally when so many of us see external and internal as somewhat or even wholly separate.
I feel this as well as an agender person. 💜
exactly 💜
""not my avatar"" As a VRChat player this hit deep 🤔
I feel this. Like I just want comfy clothes that fit my body well so I feel like I look good. It just happens that my body size/type looks best in clothes designed for my agab and it feels like I have to wear clothes that don't fit me well for people to take my gender identity seriously.
We accept that non-binary is a difficult concept for all binary people. 

IMHO- it starts with Bisexuality- dispite the name, it's really the first form of the non-binary. Bisexuals are not gay- not straight, but are just kinda ""both"". And Bisexuality gets a lot of ""but you can't just like... be interested in everyone"" Actually, yes.

Asexuality is simular but... Not gay, not straight- really just neither. 

Bisexuality and Asexuality have both gotten like ""I dont really understand but I guess"" treatment. 

Gender: Non-binary is probably going to get the same- eventually.

But our comrades are binary. In general, they see the world as black or white and do not understand how gray exists. 

Personally, I do not think we should take titles from other groups- I do not want to be male or female and Trans would imply that my endgame is binary- but it's not. Not being your avatar or agab is not ""Trans"", moving from one side of the binary to the other is. That being said- you can define yourself however you want but this is where their misunderstanding is coming in.

For Context: My Wife and I talk about this a lot. My wife is in Transition, I am non-binary. My wife is asexual and I am bisexual. We have been together for 11 years, since both of us identified as ""Staight and CIS"".
This so hard. I had (keyword there) a NB friend who would constantly pressure me to pursue top surgery. They'd done a lot more to physically transition than me, and they couldn't seem to wrap their head around the fact that having a flat chest would be just as disphoric for me as my current chest - only it would cost me pain and time and money and theres no coming back from removing bodyparts. I'm a C cup so I'm never going to be able to get a boob reduction unless I pay for it myself, and that's probably the o ly surgery that might make me feel better. For now I'd rather just strap that shit down when it gets to me.

Oh to be a genderless, amorphic blob 😔
i’ve just been told on a trans subreddit that if i’m trans and learned to love my body than i’m just a cis woman with body dysmorphia because “there needs to be criteria to being trans otherwise anyone can be trans” 
what in the gatekeeping is that 
i still do experience gender dysphoria but i don’t think i have the need to go around explaining my feelings to everyone otherwise they’re invalid.
People feel easily threatened. It’s the same shit with a lot of older gay guys I’ve met who are super transphobic.  And their reasoning seems to be some sort of bizarre envy that trans rights has become a more major issue than gay rights.  Like their suffering is invalidated because others have their own that’s different and possibly has more attention currently on it 

It’s so dumb
This. I have a friend who identifies as femboy but is in a group who keep trying to push him to go on HRT and call him an egg. I’m genuinely worried for him.
To me it really echoes gays/lesbians who see bisexuals as closeted G/L. As an mspec enby sometimes I just feel like I'm not part of the ""community"" at all 😞
> the trouble with that is that it doesn’t work and it makes you an asshole

Yes yes!! This , so much!
Heck some non-binary people do it too
Not only in subs, I've seen it irl too that trans ppl are supportive towards other binary trans ppl but hateful towards enbies or the use of neopronouns.
I was unfortunate enough to stumble across that kind of hate a couple times too much, especially on tiktok in the past month. Fortunately it’s not to a worrying point but it was still upsetting to witness :’)
Why are you in this sub if you don’t like nonbinary genders. What does drag have to do with ANYTHING. These are just straight up conservative culture war talking points and they don’t make any sense in context.
In response to your ""infinite genders"" comment:

Do intersex people not exist to you? Or let me guess, you don't know what that is. 


Our existence disproves the binary. 
Intersex people prove that gender is a spectrum and has never been binary. It has been society that has forced the binary onto people.
“Exposed to” drag shows?? If there’s going to be anything inappropriate going on there are 18+ shows, I don’t think any child is going to be harmed by seeing crossdressing.
There were dragqueens on TV in the UK where million of children watched in the 90s, I remember. So it's not a new thing? 

Also people identifying with or as animals is not a new thing either, and not gender. It's been used as transphobic mockery and as 'serious' transphobic argument but it's not a new thing.

While a lot of people might not have heard of non binary gender, feelings, identity, expressions in Western mainstream society until recently, many members of what was more widely known then as the lgb or lgbt community have challenged gender norms and this has been covered by the mainstream media to various extents over the years so it's not like nonbinary has popped out of nowhere like opponents like to claim.
I am very trans, and very nonbinary.

Trans is an umbrella, and people don't fit neatly into boxes. That's the whole reason I'm nonbinary in the first place! You can use any combination of labels if it helps you understand your own identity and describe your life experience.
I don’t agree that “trans” implies binary. Even if you think “trans” means “transition” this doesn’t apply. You can transition in a one way (name and/or pronoun change) and nothing else and you have still transitioned; just as you can transition socially but not physically (I differentiate because a social change can include wardrobe, markup, etc.). Transition can start even before you realize you are “trans” or “non-binary” - you change your hair, parts of your wardrobe, etc, to avoid discomfort without understanding why. Many non-binary and trans people who don’t fully (or at all) identify with the binary go through both a social and physical transition. I think it is a blind spot to assume transition *only* means going from “one side” of the binary to “the other”.
I agree trans connotates ""binary"" still, and I don't know how much that will realistically change, even though it doesn't seem to be part of the definition.

I've encountered people who steadfastly argue that any gender position other than that assigned at birth makes you automatically trans. However for some non-binary people this definition feels disingenuous because they don't identify enough with the typical experience of being trans.

On the transmedicalist side of things there's a belief that trans must reflect physical change. But again, many trans people don't have any interventions, and many cis people *do*. So defining it in those terms is also flawed.

Ultimately I think because we straddle part of the cis and part of the trans experience, there will be a lot of variety in how people want to identify. 

If they feel ""trans"" is an appropriate label, there's no reason nonbinary people shouldn't be empowered to use it.

Similarly, bisexuals may choose to identify in different ways and in different groups - it comes down to the individual.
I agree and I feel like this will improve with time. I'm not entirely sure where it all stems from bc I'm sure it varies a bit from person to person but I hope that people (on any side) who find themselves distressed or bothered by someone else's presentation or identity explores that in themselves and use it to grow. I am NB, the way I always have seen us and Trans folk are as neighbors, NB I don't think is necessarily Trans so much as we're both together under the gender-queer umbrella. 

Anytime I don't feel like explaining NB or Demigender or Genderfluid etc. etc. I just say gender-queer and people usually don't press any further. 🙂
dude I’m bi and ace and I’ve been questioning my gender for as long as I can remember :,)
The irony is incredible but very sad. Again, do humans ever learn, will we ever break the cycle of hate?
Sounds truscummy.
Yeah you gotta get him out of there asap. He needs to find his own path, at his own pace.
Yeah both me and my partner are bi/pan but in a straight presenting relationship (although I'm such a femboy) and we get this all the time.
I'm just answering the question as to why I think the level of hatred has increased recently.  Didn't say I agreed with it.
[deleted]
Those definitions aren’t correct. Transsexual is an older term for transgender. Some people do use transsexual to refer to trans people that have physically transitioned to some degree or exclusively for people who have had bottom surgery but it’s mostly older trans people.

Transgender means having a gender identity that doesn’t correspond with the one you were assigned at birth. You can be trans without transitioning at all or to any degree you want.
But “trans” is short for both, so that doesn’t refute anything I said. Also, plenty of binary trans people who have been through full physical transition still prefer the term “transgender” to describe themselves.

About name/pronoun changes; sorry, I was trying to be more compact, because I am sometimes too detail oriented. I was referring to a situation where a trans or non-binary person keeps their name and only charges pronouns (because their name doesn’t give them dysphoria for what ever reason or they have a legal need to hang onto their name and they are fine with using their initials instead); or they *change both*. I wasn’t talking about a situation where a person changes only their name.

I would like to point out though, that there are some trans and non-binary people who would love to physically transition(to at least some degree), but it isn’t life or death for them and their situation makes physical transition very difficult due to disability, financial situation, access to care or a combination of these factors. Do people really need to explain their specific situation to everyone to be considered “trans”? I just think that would be ridiculous.

There's been a string of attacks in my town on patrons of a gay bar in town. Police are doing nothing so a group of community members get together every night to walk people to their cars. I shouldn't have to be doing this. But I will if it ensures the safety of my community. I'm tired.		"[deleted]
Also, I was going for punky, but my little sibling said I looked like a trucker, so this is my plea to gas me up. 😭
Yer a goddamn hero.
Thank you for looking out for the community where you live. Stay safe out there - we need people like you.
thank you for what you do
That’s so good of you. I’ve been followed home before, it sucks.
I really am thankful for kind people like you. Wishing you the best from Oklahoma, Missouri friend.
So proud of you 👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻
Thank you!
Holy crap, thank you for doing this, please stay safe!
Where are you at? Do you all need more help or some kind of support?
Police are the only job that, when hearing that people are willing to do their job for them, attack the people doing their job.

Stay safe.
This is why we say acab
Hey OP, I know this might sound strange but I’d recommend looking into Aegis if you haven’t already got some form of protection when going out doing this given the situation. I know how it sounds rather extreme but I frequently used one of their covert stab vests during a time in my own town here in the UK where stabbings and assaults were so common for people seen leaving one of the clubs and for people who looked LGBT in general to these geniuses that it stopped even making the local papers and I gotta say the vest was no worse to wear than I imagine a binder would be. I’m not going to try tell you not to do it because you’re truly doing something to be absolutely proud of, but just stay safe while you’re out doing it.
Just so you know I've thought about doing this in my town too and you look 100% BADASS AF

Bless you, friend. ❤️
✊🏾
I’m so proud of you for supporting your community. We keep us safe 💕
I don't know how your area is, so only stoned of this will apply. You may be able to get some pressure applied to the police department if you have someone sympathetic in the mayor's office, a sympathetic legislator at the local or state level, or other similar folk. You may also want to try the media, though that's chancier.

Try to stay safe.
We are! We never go in a group of less than 4-5 to take people. We also have a section that patrols the alleyways and a few people that live in the apartment next to the parking garage so they can see the top (where these guys hang out.)
How about a punky trucker? 😛

But on a serious note, I'd definitely say your look gives off punky vibes!
I wish I and the others standing with me didn't have to be. I wish I could just go home and game, but no. I have to make sure our community members aren't beat the fuck up. 🤬 There's rumors that one of the kids doing all this is a cop or council members kid and that's why there's no action being taken.
💛💜🖤 Thanks. We're trying to stay as safe as possible. After our local news covered it yesterday the cops suddenly made an appearance once an hour 🤔🤔🤔 We suspect it'll be a day or two of patrols then nothing again.
Of course. I was a scared teen once. I'm still a scared adult now sometimes, but I'm almost 30 and I'll be damned if I let some kids get hurt if I can stop it. Especially queer kids. I have my own traumas and insecurities, but those get pushed way down for the kids.
Yeah, I have too. And jumped because I got a girlfriend and The Church didn't like that. We walk people home if they're nearby and to the garage if their car is there.
Thanks, friend. Tell your functional medical marijuana program I said hi. 😂😋
Thank you. I just want to make sure these kids can enjoy their nights without fear.
Just doing what no one did for me as a queer kid growing up in the south. ❤️
Working on it! 💙 I'm just doing what no one did for me as a teen. And our whole group feels the same.
We're in Missouri. So far we've been good. Everyone here is really chipping in. 💛 But good vibes are always welcome.
Yupppp. We are. Thanks friend 💙
No I absolutely appreciate the recommendation! Knives and weapons in general are super easy to get ahead of of here.
Definitely recommend it if you can get a group together. We're non violent and go with the ""strength in numbers"" rule. Be sure to check out your town's local guidelines about gathering, but usually a group of people walking around isn't a crime.
LGBTQF+ 

The F stands for ""Fuck around and find out.""
We already had a news crew out and the next night there was a patrol car every 15 min. We lot a fire u see their asses
Heh 😅 take what I can get. The general goal is for us to look as nonthreatening as possible-- but I want other queer people to see me and go ""yeah... that's a fellow gay. I'm safe with them.""
Oh god that is just vile, this is highly upsetting to me as I was just the victim of some abuse of power by a local officer. Please stay safe your a legend!
From what you are describing we live in the same area.  I was downtown last Friday and  I noticed a conspicuous lack of police.  Was there three hours didn't see one.
I wasn’t even dressed up or anything. I was just  coming back from shopping. Two assholes decided to follow me almost to my front door, making comments about me all the way.
Hopefully, we will keep telling it, so long as our Republican lawmakers don't try to sabotage like they tried healthcare or like your state did with healthcare (sorry!). We are still having to fight to keep it day in and day out. We don't quit, though.
Keep the ass fires burning until they catch the motherless sob
I would definitely feel safe someone like you helping me in that situation, for sure! It's an amazing thing you and the others are doing! 

And I really like the ""Mighty Queer"" t-shirt!
Tbh you look like the fellow gay that would punch someone to defend the lot of us, so I think you ultra-nailed the look for the job.

Edit: also you have really nice hair :)
I'm sorry that happened to you. Cops don't care about people like. At all. And some of the most vile people in the world decide to be cops because it gives them access to vulnerable populations. I hope you're ok. I just try to leverage my white lady (ack) powers as much as possible.
If you check my post/comment history, you can for sure know if we're in the same place. But yeah.im back out again tonight and the police have been VERY active since the news story aired.
People are so fucking gross 🤬 and of course they tell cops ""I'm just walking, is that a crime????""
It's a group of them, and unfortunately them having mothers is likely the problem. Because we think a few of them have parents on council or in the PD
Thanks! To both! I got my shirt in The Castro district in 2018. It's my favorite
Thank you! 💙💙💙 I've been through green, pink, orange, you name it. But this has been my favorite!
Nice!
You could rip open your vest like a superhero to reveal that you are a Mighty Queer.
Listen, all I'm saying is it's fun to do that sweep around where you put your hands in your pockets to show your shirt. I saw one girl stop, look at me, i moved my vest and she goes ""I love your shirt!"""	oym69j	NonBinary	605	1.0	2021-08-05 16:35:40
Is it shorts season yet? How about overall shorts?	First time posting selfie and messy house background. Feeling lots of gratitude and safety in this subreddit.	"It's spring
I wish. I'm waiting for Michigan to get out of Second Winter (we have no Spring here. /s)
Cool! I live in dungarees, but it's rarely warm enough for shorts for me. You look great!
You're very cute
lovely rug, nice pic
Those are so cool where'd you get them?
Definitely shorts season. I'm wearing them since January, lol. You look fabulous!
Ahhh so cute!!!! 💙💙💙
Overall shorts.... so... oversomes?
You look gay as hell. /pos
Go ahead, play spot the paraphernalia and adult objects 😆🙃
Uggs season is ending and short shorts season is approaching
Little cold for where I live. But looks cool 😎
We still have snow, -7°C. I would say tis the season.
It's so cold and rainy in England 😭
You look great, and I lowkey want a pair of short overalls now
Adorbs!
But summer is almost here
Still a bit too cold for shorts here, but I wouldn't care if I had such a cool outfit, I'd wear it in the cold anyway ahah
EVERY season is overall shorts season if you’re brave enough 🦵🦵
You look so nice
That is a cool look!  I’m still trying to find some denim overalls that fit me when I go thrifting, so far no luck…
You look like Ally from collegehumor are you actually Ally from collegehumor
plants!! what kind of plants do you have lying around?
That's what I think. It looks like spring today here in BC!
You go from winter straight into summer!?
I get this as a perpetual cold person.
Thank you so very much 😌
Thank you that's nice and validating! Today I feel darn cute.
From poshmark actually. Thankfully they are just the right fit.
Thank you 😊
Lmao seriously though
Thanks!
Haha, I like the background it looks comfy with lived in. And the sunlight in the pictures is giving warm glowing springtime vibes. 

I love your outfit!  You look great!  I want to get some overall shorts too! 💜🌈
Can't those two just go together sometimes 💓
I also had no luck untill I searched for them online second hand. If you can find out your size in a specific brand, Poshmark is a pretty good option.
I am not Ally. I see the resemblance though!!
The lower right is a pothos or devils ivy and the top left is wheat grass (for my cats to eat)
Haha no. This is more of a inside state joke among the population here. Our winters can last a while. We do get a spring, but it doesn't feel like it as we've gotten snow in May. 😅
Yw! 😁
Thank you 😊 🥰
I don't make the rules.
Thanks for the reply and I’ll check it out
Wow that sounds like extreme cold to me. So like 2 weeks of shorts the rest of the outfits have leggings under them 😆

Is recognition dangerous in the USA?	"I have seen a few people celebrating being recognized by the government, getting their preferred gender recognized on their driver's license. The recognition is validating and a lot of people are celebrating that. It makes sense that it would feel great and like we're being recognized. 

But does anyone else feel some concern about letting the government know who you are? I've been seeing more and more opinion pieces saying that democracy is in a dangerous state, that we could very well have a conservative autocrat in power in a not far off future. Is anyone else concerned that being documented as non-binary with an x on your birth certificate or driver's license that you're opening yourself up to government profiling? Could that be very generous for ourselves and our families?

**EDIT**: I also want to say that I'm not trying to rain on anyone's parade. I realize that there are a lot of people celebrating the recognition and this post might feel bad. I just think this is a very important conversation to have. It's about safety and I just don't want everyone to rush out and do something that could put them at risk."	"I'm mostly concerned about cops personally.

Just take gender markers off IDs! Then nobody gets misgendered by their ID and nobody is in danger of being outed by it, either.
I'm glad I'm not the only person who feels like this lol
Florida for example.... we have a lot of advocates and people higher up, closer to officials. But it's hard when your state is ran by mini Trump. And you also have Trump living in the same state and endorsing republican flak and whacked out conspiracy. Everything that we have fought for from being recognized by the government to sports related issues, is being turned back. 

Yes, we have came a long way LGBTQ+ but as with civil rights movement and now black lives matter, we can not stop. What makes it infuriating is that we are having these conversations but its being silenced on a scale that is VERY concerning. As non-binary having two little girls and a wife that I will give my own life for any day, any time, and with plans of being +1 soon.... IT IS SCARY to even think about any branch of government really knowing the schematics  of who I am! Fuck! I freak out filing taxes anymore.

The best way I can describe the feeling is to that of a slow holocaust. Whether it be your party or just rights in general, martial status.... every day it's being chisled away. And sadly a lot people are complacent and bending the knee. 

I like to call the time that we are living in FEAR. It's so hard to find the humanity.
Indeed, it is an important conversation! Security, for self or others, is a balance of actual safety and freedom. We trade one for the other with each decision regarding safety. I mean that I have the freedom to display a pride flag on a pole in front of my house. It makes me feel good and it can help people feel safe in the neighborhood, because they know they aren’t alone. Also, it can help to encourage other neighbors to feel safe enough to put up their own pride flags. But it can make you a target for those who have hate in their aims. But that goes for ANY difference or otherness, so some trouble is to be expected when you show your ID, but also kindness and hopeful curiosity. One may be safer if they blend in, of course, but at the cost of one’s freedom to live authentically. I’m sure that if enough people make the decision to be themselves, it will be much more common and normal- especially if we ever have representation with real power elected into offices of all levels. I wonder how non-binary documents could be used against us, and how deep it can go in a potentially autocratic state, though there is no shortage of similar examples in history. If we do nothing, nothing changes. But at what cost? Shit- If I could have one ID for stealth and one for when I know I’m safe, I would do it and report back to The Team, you know, if that wasn’t so illegal.
Yes. I have a lot of ways to get validation that don't involve painting a target on my back. Usually the people looking at IDs are cops, customs, hiring managers, healthcare; these groups have a historically terrible track record with us. No thanks. I'd rather have the option of whether I disclose my gender on a case-by-case basis.
I'm in the UK, not the US, so I can't speak to your country in particular... However, the UK state has been becoming more transphobic imo and I fear that we're heading down a difficult path in the next decade

Remember many of us don't pass as cis so are already clocked as trans regardless of what's on ID. If a country headed into fascism, most of us won't be able to hide already

Secondly, it's not like modern governments cannot already access unprecedented levels of information on us if they wanted to root out all the ""gender traitors""

I would love to have X on my ID - ideally I wish I could fully change my legal gender. It would give me privacy regarding my medical history, instead of disclosing my birth sex to employers, bouncers, etc. I already receive transphobia from random strangers so I have nothing to lose
This is why I am so skittish to go ""legal""  All it takes is one disgusting ------ in power again to make every single X markered persons life hell by retracting the federal level recognition.
Yeah. In theory I would like to get it done. In practice... No. Feels like painting a target on myself.
I never want an x on my license. If I get pulled over or something, I don't want to give cops more reasons to be an asshole to me. I left Alabama to get away from regular interactions with gun carrying homophobes. I wish there was a way to get gender markers removed entirely
I think this is a classic divide within LGBTQ culture. Do you want to be safe, not rock the boat, avoid people knowing you exist, or do you want to be visible, and possibly less safe, but more free to show up as your true self to the world? It's a discourse we've been doing since before Stonewall. (There were social/activist groups pre-Stonewall which consisted of mostly middle class white gay people who were kind of out-ish and were like ""hey, would y'all mind giving us some rights? no? ok, that's also fine, please don't hate crime us on our way out the door"". They didn't make a lot of progress.)

Personally I'm on the out and loud side of things. I think that approach has led to a lot more progress than the careful ""don't ask for anything and maybe they'll leave us alone"" way of seeing it. 

Also there are plenty of ways for the government to find trans and nonbinary people and round us all up if they want. Am I supposed to not transition? Not change my name? Not buy a house or get a degree? Get a job under the table? I'm not vermin and I'm not going to live like vermin.

(This is not to shame anyone who isn't ready to do this or doesn't think it's the right choice for them personally. I think everyone should be free to have any gender marker or no gender marker.)
Where I live in the US, I feel safe. I also feel ready for a confrontation like this. It’s my right, and I’m empowered to stand by it. 

I did, however, buy a dash cam to let police know, I am not the person to be bullying. The fear is real, I feel fortunate to safely stand my ground
I am waaay less worried about the government and more worried about the cashier or server seeing it and having a freak out. I was already berated in a dressing room (non-gendered) by a staff member because I had “boy” pants.
All the ways the gov’t has to track & monitor you, like, if they want to know you’re trans *they know.*

I definitely am pro getting gender off of IDs etc. 

But in terms of fear, like, I don’t think one letter on my driver’s license is going to be the thing to tip them off when I publicly have my pronouns and politics associated with my legal name and face already, you know?
I'm in Canada and would like to change my ID, but won't because of interactions with state agents & institutions like cops or medical providers. You don't know who is friendly so I'd like the option not to out myself if it doesn't feel safe. I also would never change my gender marker on my passport though it would be v validating.
Originally I feared this but the government already knows everything about us as is. It’s ignorant to think they don’t. I’m almost 40. I’ve lived as not my true self long enough. If something happens to me going forward it’ll be with me standing with pure pride in myself and my community. If the unforeseeable happens and things get bad…I’m happy to go down fighting for the youngsters behind me. Love you all!💜
Eh, if that happens, my gender is the least of my worries
I’m not sure what it’s like in other states, but in Minnesota, gender markers on drivers licenses are like eye color and weight: arbitrary and easy to change… and they have X. So I could get it changed back, Or pretend like it was a mistake, if I find myself in a sticky situation. 

But that might not work for everyone. I still have my name from birth, and “resemble” my agab. 

So far I haven’t felt unsafe? But I haven’t had a job since I changed my ID, and my gender a secret at my job. 

I also have my agab on my passport and birth certificate.
I don't live in the US but that option came up when I was getting my licence. I chose to stick with my AGAB because I was worried about potential backlash. Especially since I have no plans to come out to my parents.
Yeah, I feel you. Especially as someone who works with kids, I've been fingerprinted to hell and back, and I get background checked every other year, too. 

I don't need to give the government any more access to my information.
A lot of people don't need to worry about the bigger ""what if my government turns against me"" so much as they need to worry about ""this individual cop who doesn't have access to my other info sees my driver's license and could shoot me dead"".

In those individual immediate interactions, they're not asking the government what meds you've been prescribed, what social media you use, what your pronouns or title is, etc.

The government knows I'm trans from all that regardless of what my ID says.

But the armed cop who pulled me over for speeding doesn't know it.

And lots of people, but especially racialized people, need to focus on the latter more than the whole ""the government knows everything"" angle.

I don't care that the central government knows. It's inevitable that they do. But I don't want it on my ID; I want cops assuming they already know what's in my pants rather than assaulting me to find out.
I maybe would have considered doing this, before Trump became president and the US showed its true ugly face. I don't trust the people here anymore. I live in an incredibly safe area for queer people, but what happens if I have to move? Travel internationally?
Personally I opted to stick with the ‘M’ on my license, despite the opportunity to go with a third option. As things slide further right I know my legal recognition as ‘male’ could become tenuous, and I didn’t want to risk jeopardizing it further. For example, 45’s state dept started rejecting passport renewals for long-transitioned folks based on gender marker stuff; boy was I glad my passport is good for a few years yet, and I’ll be renewing before the next general election for sure.  

It definitely stung to make that choice, especially living in such an accepting place where I can be so out and proud. But I know plenty enough history to know how fast things can change - best to keep everything in as perfect order as I can.

Edit: as other posters noted, also cops. I’ve had good personal experiences with cops, shielded in my whiteness, class, and masculinity. But I don’t trust them and I stay tf away from them, unless I’m watching them around someone more vulnerable than me - either way, again, keeping some of that extra protection, even if it means making myself a little less visible.
as someone who has an X on their ID I thought about this and honestly I feel like most people who look at IDs don’t look at the gender marker often
I'm reading majority of the comments. my ID is gendered as x. I was happy with it but now I'm concerned if the USA is going down a dark path. I live in the Michigan, it's not too bad here but I'm a little bit anxious now, maybe I should just change my ID to male? or back to female. I'd hate to do that. 
I do have my other ID with the old gender on it. hmm this is definitely something to consider...
I used to think that and actually changed mine from F to M, though I'm nonbinary. Now it seems to me that there's no safe option for an androgynous-looking person like me. Someone will always question whether I ""match"". I might as well have an ID that doesn't misgender me.

No gender on ID would be an easier solution all around
Same here. I'd much prefer gender markers on IDs just not be a thing. A correct gender marker already isn't an option for me because I'm nonbinary, but even if it was i don't want it because the LAST thing I want is a cop or airport security or something instantly knowing I'm trans and being able to subject me to discrimination or further abuse because of it. I do not trust cops I do not trust it to be on government records that I have had a gender marker change no thank you.
Oh, yeah. That's a great idea.
I was just saying this today. I really don’t understand why gender needs to be on ID’s.
Do you truly think a cop is not going to know you're not cis? 

I currently have a binary gender on my ID and police state authority figure types (TSA, for example) definitely know I'm not cis.
Whats funny is i never look at anyones sex on their id.

If you were a transman and i saw F, i would most likely just assume they made a typo lmfao!
I live in Georgia and have all these same feelings.  I would PROBABLY be safe at work, as my employer is in Atlanta and sponsors pride every year, but I'm scared to even come out in that environment because at least half of the people on my team are right-wing.

But I live in rural GA.  It isn't remotely safe for me to be out within about 30 miles of my home.  

I rely on kilts for so much of my gender expression and gender feelings right now because it's the closest thing to a skirt that I can wear without risking being attacked (or risking a teacher or neighbor taking their bigotry out on my child)
Interestingly, in Pennsylvania they gave me a duplicate with my X gender marker and let me keep the original with my agab on it. I’m unsure if this is standard, but I really like it- especially as I am starting a job at a place I am nervous being inclusive.
Until transphobia is unacceptable to our society, visibility will always be a double-edged sword which brings both improved social awareness and attracts those who would use otherness against you. It sucks a lot to be in these early stages of a heightened cultural awareness around gender and its deconstruction, especially as a nonbinary person, when buying back into the binary or risking our safety feel like the only options sometimes. A lot of things are in flux around us and we don't always know who to trust and who to fear. We can choose to live authentically and hope it inspires others - and choose to build communities and support networks in which we feel safe and protected from a world that wants to pretend we don't exist. It's hard work sometimes, just being yourself, and everyone who does it is very brave.
Me personally? Depends. Usually people seem comfortable assuming I'm a cis person, unless I'm wearing a tank top or they can see my facial hair (so not often during COVID). It would be nice to be able to coast under the radar if I felt I was in a dangerous situation though. 

But even if I never passed as cis, there are people who do consistently pass as cis and might want to have that option when they need it. Having a visibly trans body is a choice that I have made, but I don't value my need to have the government validate my gender over the safety of other people. 

Why is the government in the businesses of regulating gender anyway? What use is having a gender on a legal ID?
30 miles is 48.28 km
Can’t look that gift horse in the mouth, can you?
I assume that people who pass as cis, always intend to pass as cis, and do not want to have the X gender marker on their ID will be able to avoid having the X gender marker on their ID. I have not seen any US state that offers it as an option proposing anything other than self-determination for using it. 

Even in the most draconian use case I can think of (another Trump type leader comes to power and manages to subvert democracy enough to really fuck shit up forever, and then decides to use that power to systematically oppress trans people more than is already the case), most likely the move would be to get rid of the X, not create a standard that determines whether someone is nonbinary and forces them to have that on their ID. Also Trump managed to fuck shit up for trans people without X being on anyone's ID.

I wish the government would take gender off of IDs, but they are not currently doing that, and I am currently a person who exists who would prefer to be visible to the world rather than have to lie about my gender daily. I do not think other nonbinary people should be forced, pressured, or shamed into choosing the X.
absolutely!
I was talking about people who are openly nonbinary and do not have visibly trans bodies but may want to pass as cis for safety in certain situations (such as during interactions with law enforcement), not people who are always intentionally presenting as a binary gender.

I dont think anyone suggested that nonbinary people might be forced to use an X, did I imply that anywhere in my comments?
Anyone who doesn't want to use an X on their ID would just not opt to use one. Offering it as an option doesn't mean anything for nonbinary people who want to pass as their AGAB with the cops. Those people can choose not to get the X.

As someone who has a visibly nonbinary body (flat chest, on T, short, curvy, no penis) and a name that doesn't match my AGAB, I'm kind of fucked either way. At least if I get the X I can be visible in some meaningful ways that might lead to some progress for trans and nonbinary people in the future. I don't see any real point to hiding on paper when I can't hide in real life, anyway.
That's understandable.

To me I dont want to be asked to choose between getting consistently misgendered by having the wrong gender on my ID, and being immediately outed to anyone who sees my ID. I want to have the power and control over who has this information about me.

I also hate that getting a gender marker changed is such an involved process and I dont think the government should be involved in determining the legitimacy of anyone's gender. If it was a simple checkbox I could change whenever I renew my license I wouldn't be as upset about the gatekeeping aspect.
Sure, but you don't currently have that.

I wish gender would be removed from ID, too, but it isn't. Meanwhile, the X exists in my state and is self-reported. There is no process to have one's gender marker changed on their ID beyond renewing your license and picking a different one. 

The state I was born in is much more gatekeepy about changing gender markers on birth certificates (and doesn't offer the X anyway), so I will probably always have F there unless they change their policies. Which they will never do if the more liberal states get all ""but what even issssss gender, tho, amirite?"" about it."	s9b9cu	NonBinary	142	1.0	2022-01-21 13:55:10
Came out as nb at 40 — finally!	"Hello all, this is my recent coming out (and maybe egg?) story. 

I've always known I was queer in some way, and always had an unarticulated background feeling that—while AMAB—my true gender was unclear to me. Yet, I played the role of cis het guy everywhere in life except for some exploratory hookups back when I was dating.

I never truly interrogated these feelings and in retrospect, I realize it was because I never allowed myself to think that a different outcome than cis/het would be possible. In truth, I believe now that it was a lack of courage to come out that held me back. 

That fear held me back from even getting to a place where I could articulate my feelings. And there was safety in that, in a way. If I didn't have the words to describe it, I had a reason not to discuss it with anyone. 

And several weeks ago the most banal thing happened: I got an email survey from a company and it asked my gender. I stared at the only two choices: M or F. And the floodgates opened.

I had my first moment of clarity, but then so many other questions and emotions. I was still afraid. What would my fiancée think? I knew in my heart that she would still accept me but telling her would still require a leap because...what if?

When we did talk about it, she was nothing but supportive and loving and really just the best human. I felt so empowered and uplifted by her. She's since even helped me with fashion advice and we shopped online for dresses for me to try out some varied gender expressions.

It took me about two weeks, but I also just told my brother and my parents. The outpouring of love and support is all I could have ever wanted. 

I don't know where this journey is going,  but I am glad that I am on it and finally open about it."	"[deleted]
It's never too late to find out your gender ! I'm happy to hear that you have a supportive family, unconditional love yay !

Welcome to the community, my friend ! Here, have some of your Happy Coming Out cake 🍰, feel free to try as much clothes you want, enjoy the hell out of them and most importantly, don't let anyone tell you what you can't do !
This story melts me: thanks for sharing your story and a little good news in this world. 😊
Fantastic to hear you're getting such loving support! Truly happy for you, and congratulations on figuring out you!
Congratulations! And welcome! 

It’s really funny that you had that experience because the same thing happened to me: filling out HR required stuff a while back at work and faced with M or F, I just stared and stared and couldn’t bring myself to check it. Spawned a conversation with my partner (who was supportive and more like, “well, finally!”) and I ended up coming out. Years of pent-up identity issues, and the floodgates released because of a silly little form at work. Life is weird, and awesome.

Anyway, feels great, right?! Like, you’re finally you!!!
I kind of had the same revelation with the surveys, it was one of many should I say. It clicked, and when there were options for other or non-binary, I didn't even hesitate clicking that. Hearing about your journey is so inspiring and I'm so happy for you! Lots of love sent your way.
💕
Congratulations!

I had a very similar experience, and just came out to my partner as NB a few weeks ago!

What's hilarious to me is that I obliviously told her 7 or so ago, when I came out as bi, that if things had been different and family had been more accepting growing up, I thought that I probably would have been nonbinary, and then I just spent years not thinking about or examining that statement at all until small changes to my style made me realize that I had low-key hated my gender expression as reflected in my clothing for decades and just repressed any feelings I might have had about it.

Here's to self discovery and finding the truth of ourselves!
Thank you!   
Part of me wishes I'd had this experience earlier in life...but I'm so grateful for where I am now.   
What the cliché..? The best time to plant a tree is 20 years ago, and the second best time is today.
Yay cake! 

Thank you for the support. I'm just starting to explore this community and I'm overwhelmed by the awesomeness of these humans. :D
❤️
Thanks for sharing!

I can relate to what you said about the clothing as part of expression, and low-key hating where you'd been for years. My realization coincided with a few seasons of purchasing clothes skewing away from the 'default male' (for lack of a better way to describe that). More pastels, a lavender here and there, etc.

At the surface, I was telling myself I was going with the trends. In retrospect, however, I was slowly gravitating towards a new and shifting way of expressing my gender.

(Edited to be more specific...I didn't want to come off as oversimplifying what you'd said or minimizing any of it.)

Oh yeah I love this community ! I often like to visit r/transgender , r/TransyTalk and  r/TransTryouts. They are adorable here, bunch of wonderful people !
I have a new sleeve starting this week, actually..! 

Maybe a topic for a different subreddit, but my (very basic) understanding of Japanese tattoos is that some elements are traditionally more masculine/feminine. Might be worth a convo with the artist to see if they have any recommendations.
Thanks for the rec's...I will check those out."	s4lunq	NonBinary	131	1.0	2022-01-15 14:48:22
Wish I had more friends to go to the beach with! There’s no queer community here. It’s so conservative where I live so I usually go at night or only for sunsets these days for my safety. I really hate being the only visibility out here sometimes 😭		"I love the beach. But I never have anyone to go with. I definitely don't have any other queer people to go with
omg gender envy. you are so pretty! 🖤🖤 i’d go for walks with you, and laugh at straight people with you. 👯‍♀️
Girl it’s not the vibe out here at all
i wanna go with uuuuu but im a minor in californiaaaaaa D:

imean atleast im in the most progressive state in the country
Virginia is such a populous state. There's really no community in Virginia Beach? Wish I could help you. I'm in Illinois.
That's sad 😔 because you look very cuddel worthy
I have family out there, actually. I had the same feeling when I visited earlier this summer. I expected some more Pride stuff to be happening but... not really.
I love the top, where did u get it?
Let’s goo bb I’m in Virginia Beach
Can we pls I do that already
Oh bestie it’s okay 😂😂😂 and that’s good everyone deserves a safe space 💕
I thought Massachusetts was the most progressive, we where the first to legalize gag marriage
Va Beach is a very conservative town; neighboring Norfolk is a bit better, but it's nothing like Northern Virginia (NoVA) & the DC area. There's like one gay bar that I know of in VA Beach. ([Rainbow Cactus Company](https://therainbowcactus.gay/).)
Oh my god, I was just gonna ask where you where and was like ""There's no way this person is near me.""

I'M IN NEWPORT NEWS. And my partner JUST took a job near the beach in VA Beach, so I'll be over there more often!

Seriously, we need to hang. Let's go to the beach and queer it up together! We are totes HERE you just gotta squint sometimes. (Or maybe I'm the only one rocking rainbow sport sandals, a shirt w/ a heart in NB pride flag colors that says Pride on it, and dyed hair w/ shaved sides?)

Anyway, drop me a line, friend!
Of course you are. I used to live in VAB actually. That place has amazing beaches
*gay
Yeah it’s not progressive at all bc it’s mainly a retirement town
I live on chix beach so I’m sure you can imagine the demographics 😵‍💫
Having Regent University there doesn't help either.
Easier said than done, but Richmond is a pretty progressive place, no ocean beach, but the James River is pretty rad. If you're able to travel. I live in canada now but lived outside of richmond in the early 2000s.
Yeah that doesn't sound great.

The other day I got to leave my apartment and went to the park with a friend (following all safety measures—I'm high risk). First time in years I took a pic of myself that I didn't actively hate looking at. (they/them)		"Nice photo ! :)
Ohhh I love this outfit! That bright top really makes the black overall pop, in a way? And the accessories are really cute, too. You look a little shy, but also happy, and that makes me happy, too ^^
you're so cute :) LOVE those glasses on you
Your outfit is the perfect amount of much-ness. It seems very joyful. I also love your phone case.
I like them overalls

Hell Yeah! Congratulations!!!
Thank you so much for this.  Hearing a success story like this really gives me hope.  Made my day!  💖
That's amazing! Congrats! This brought tears to my eyes because I'm so happy for you!
That’s amazing congratulations to you, I’m so happy for yah 🥰!!
That’s absolutely phenomenal, thank you so much for sharing your happy news with us. It’s so inspiring to see folks like you facing that fear and owning who you are, even when there’s no promise going in of a happy ending. I’m still not out to my parents or brothers yet but hearing your experience has reminded me of the joy and relief I hope it will bring. More than anyone else, save for my partner, they’re who I want to know me for me.

Wherever you are in your journey is the right place for you to be! It has taken me a long time confidently stand in my skin.

Kiddo says I’m the king safety island witch, so that is what I am 🤷‍♂️😂		"It means so much to see a nonbinary parent, just living their life being happy. Thank you
You've got that ""very tired but still trying"" parent face down ahahah. It's great to see parents/older enbies on there, too!
Aw, thank YOU! 😁
Hahaha, caught me! Tired, trying, and bracing for impact as she flails around 😅
Is it okay if I ask what your kid calls you? I've read online some people use a shortened version of parent,  and I'm curious what an actual nonbinary parent uses, if that makes sense.
Once you've seen that ""I love you but I wish you had an off button"" realness, you can't unsee it ahahah. Good luck!
So far just Mommy. It’s going to be a conversation I have with her when she’s able to understand more of what’s going on. Probably many, many conversations about it. She’s only 3 now, and stubborn, so she rejects all of my suggestions just because they are new and different.

Rant about the cis/hets	"Im sick of seeing people say “you don’t need to tell me you’re trans idc” or “you don’t need to post that you’re trans I don’t give a fuck” which is all fine and dandy but you know what? It is still legal to use the trans panic defence so until thats illegal I am going to be unapologetically myself and i am going to make sure EVERYONE knows about it until every last lost little kid feels safe to be what they want to be and do what they want to do. You as a heterosexual cisgender person have the privilege to be who you are without having to actively ensure your own safety but unfortunately I do not so you telling me that I don’t need to “show off for attention” helps nobody because actually I do need to show off to get the attention of governments so they actually recognise me as I am not as what is between my legs and to make sure others like myself know where is safe for them go explore their own identity without dickheads like you telling them not to take pride in who they are and a large part of their identity. 

I have struggled so hard to begin to start accepting myself so here we go this is it. I am non-binary and I am proud and I WILL make sure you know it. 

Thanks for reading.

P.S im aware this is worded atrociously one draft no edits lol just needed to get it off my chest."	"“You don’t need to tell me what I need to tell people about myself.” 

There are two people (or more) involved in every interaction. These people are so fucking self-absorbed.
These people have never had to repress part of themselves to be accepted by society. Keep telling the world I’m proud of you.
I'm not telling you because I think you care, I'm telling you because I fucking do.
Don't wait for society to catch up. In that space you could waste a whole life time. Be true to yourself and live authentically.
This pulled at my heart strings. Thank you.
Thank you for saying this.  These are my thoughts exactly and it's wonderful that I have people like you on my side.

I feel less alone.
I have literally only ever posted once on social media about my gender and it was my coming out post. My aunt will not stop asking every family member why I had to be so public about it even though I explained it in my post (though I shouldn't have needed to) AND I changed my name! Like sorry, but how would you like me to tell people i changed my name? Should I make 300 coming out phone calls? It sucks cuz we used to be pretty close, but now I can't even
Thank you for being yourself.
I need to show this to my colleagues.
Oh. Oh I like that....
Theyre always there voicing their opinions when they dont need to.
Thank you, I’ll never be able to tell you how much this means to me
Y E S.
<3
<3
Always here if you need to talk about it <3
That’s absolutely awful I hate it so much. Nothing to the same caliber but one of my closest friends refused to use my pronouns when i came out to her and refused to use my new name too
Always!
Hahaha not that you need it but you have my permission lmao
Ugghh that sucks. Sorry 😡

I just experienced some of my worst dysphoria while doing job apps	"Prefacing this by saying I’m AMAB and completely closeted irl. 

I was just applying for some jobs and one of them had the usual “We hire anyone regardless of disability, gender, etc etc”. There was a required field where I had to choose my gender and the options were Male, Female, and Prefer not to say. Weird but I just put Prefer not to say. 

Also I of course had to enter my legal names, including my very masculine middle name, my last name which I hate because my family is transphobic, and my first name which I also hate. All this made me cry and feel very shitty. 

Ik this is to be expected while closeted but I just wanted to get it all out in a safe space. I really want to change my legal name and gender but I don’t have the money/safety/knowledge/resources to do so. Just feeling very shitty overall."	"No matter your ""official"" name or which box you ticked, you are you.

Remember the metaphor or the egg. It can protect you, but the chick is never the egg. Just a blob forming into the chicken.
I'm sorry you're feeling this way and it's happened to me too. While signing into my union some forms had male/female/nonbinary and some forms only had male/female, it's almost feels worse bc there's a hope and then they crush it. Also it's just lying I'm not binary, no matter what...I at least wished it said ""sex"" bc then at least it's technically kind of factual but it was a ""gender"" thing.

Either way this community is here for you and you aren't alone. Whether you are closeted or not ❤️
You'll reach your comfort point sometime <3 it's never easy to be non binary when people around you are transphobic, I hope things will turn soon for the better <3
We're here for u!!! It'll be ok!
Sorry to hear it made you feel this way. Filling out forms like this has often made me feel dysphoric, as well as the worrying about how I'm going to have to put up with formal interview wear down the line. As others have said, being closeted, having shitty parents, or using certain names or ticking boxes doesn't change who you are. There are people out there who get you, and you will find a place where you can be yourself and feel safe and in any case it doesn't change who you are. Xx
My work has great benefits, and allows you to choose non-binary in our internal HR software. But it automatically populates our health care info. And our provider does not accept anything other than m/f.

So my work offers a non-binary option. You just have to give up your health care if you want it to be official! Progress! /S

It is unknown if changing my sex internally after enrolling in health care could potentially make you ineligible. So, as far as I know, no one is willing to find out 

I'm not sure what happens when you transition because gender affirming care is covered. I assume most folks go with the binary choice that makes the most sense for them, or the least dysphoria?
i love that metaphor! 🤍🤍

my trans clients finally got their first chest binder!!!!!!	"i’m a non-binary/transmasc clinician working with transgender foster kids in a residential behavioral health setting. ive worked with my team for nearly a year to try and get these two kids (ftm + ftn) a chest binder. A YEAR!!! we’ve had so many ups and downs, so many referrals and approvals, and so many hoops we had to jump through just to get our agency to shell out $70 fucking dollars for some gc2b chest binders. 

we (of course) made sure to instruct them about all necessary safety measures on how to bind properly, and also showed them how to put it on/take it off. it’s funny because they know i’m trans but im not sure if they’re aware i use a chest binder as well (we obviously avoid self-disclosing personal stuff due to potential transference).

AND (drum roll) WE FINALLY DID IT!!!!! the kids tried their binders on for the first time this week and were so excited. i wanted to cry out of joy for them!!! i hate the system and how much we had to fight for them to have access to something so basic and simple as a chest binder. but i’m so so happy that it all worked out in the end. these kids deserve it."	"That’s super great! Congratulations. It shouldn’t have to be so frustrating but it’s great to see that within existing systems of power we can advocate for the needs of others and have it work out ❤️
Good job fighting their corner! They’re lucky to have you. Good job!
omg yes absolutely! it was a really disheartening/frustrating experience, but it’s also motivating me to try and fix (at least some aspects of) the system from the inside out
thank you! honestly, i’m the lucky one to be able to work with them. they’re such incredible kids and they deserve the world!!"	mw81e9	NonBinary	56	0.99	2021-04-22 16:02:13
"my safety bat. work bag for scale. it says ""no horny"" underneath all the ahegao stickers"		"I am concerned for you
For love of God, if you're going to have that in your car also put a baseball mitt in there. Your lawyer will thank you.

[ahegao shit is nasty](https://animemotivation.com/the-history-of-ahegao-face-racism-asians/) and perpetuates fetishization, but enjoy your functionally useless metal bat ig. i’d suggest a wooden bat with a better design choice.
Is it a metal bat? Bats, especially metal ones, don’t make great personal protection. If you’re really worried about it I would look into something a bit more practical. 

I do love the juxtaposition of it saying no horny while covered in horny stickers tho lol
HOLY FRICK-FRACKIN'-FIG THAT'S AWESOME
Welp, I learned something. Thank you for sharing this. I’ll try to bring it up if I see someone else talking about this again.
and now i know, thanks for spreading awareness
Thank you for teaching me something new! It’s always felt gross, but this explains why.
What's wrong with bats?

Edit: why am I getting downvoted for this?
Wooden ones do alright. Not gonna do much against a gun but it's a longer reach than a knife. Aim for joints :)
Well metal bats are made to be light weight so you can swing them really fast, but speed plus that lighter weight doesn’t pack as much of a wallop. Wooden bats are better for that. Also if the bat is hollow, it may bend significantly and become a lot less usable after one hit. And like, being hit with a bat might hurt pretty bad, and stop someone who isn’t that serious about harming you, but it would probably take multiple good hits to actually incapacitate someone seriously trying to fuck you up. 

Bats are also an awkward length. Not really long enough to protect you from a distance, way too long to protect you close up. You have to take a long, hard swing for it to do the most damage, you need both hands, and while you’re winding up your whole torso is exposed p much. 

It’s decent for intimidation, if someone sees you with a bat they may think twice. And if you think you’ll only need to get one hard hit in, it’s not a terrible weapon. But overall a taser or pepper spray will do you better long range and a knife or  your fists and elbows will do better up close.
Oh, and pepper spray. I keep a Swiss Army knife, and pepper spray on me at all times. Love the horny stickers BTW."	wqzosa	NonBinary	52	0.83	2022-08-17 20:47:16
(mostly for safety reasons) which bathroom would you direct me to?		"I honestly wouldn't blink at you going into either bathroom!
From first pic I thought womens, from second I thought mens... I think if you confidently walk into either your either you will be okay!
I wouldn't think twice if I saw you going to either, and I've never been in a position where vaguely ""there"" wouldn't do, but if they were truly separate, I'd probably direct you to the women's.
Which ever one you asked me too! If there was a family, disabled, or otherwise non-gendered room I’d go for that one though.
Womens, but I wouldn’t be surprised if I saw you go into mens.
Full honesty, your face and style is pretty masculine and if no one stares too much you'll pass easy but your body is curvier than a male body typically is so you might be given away (as not cis) by that.

I don't think being perceived a certain way in a bathroom is ""more dangerous"" than being perceived a certain way anywhere in public but I do understand the concern.
I've only been in men's and gender neutral restrooms and wouldn't think you were out of place in either. That doesn't mean you'd necessarily look out of place in a women's restroom, but I'm not qualified to judge that.
Wouldnt think twice at either bathroom as well
I don’t think you’d get worse than suspicious looks as people try and fail to determine your gender. You should be safe if you act confidently in and as you have every right to be here
Men's if pushed to answer one, but I honestly wouldn't blink whichever one I saw you go into
Probably women's.
Either, both, idc, whichever one you prefer. I’d just direct you to ‘the toilets’ and let you figure it out from there
If you can stand to pee the men's, if not you can still go to the men's, but if you're worried about getting clocked for sitting the women’s. I think people are more likely to assume just based of which you go to, might be harassed in women’s more but I don't think it's likely. Also depends where you are, people in different places have different ideas about femininity in masculinity. I honestly wouldn't blink whichever you went into.
Honestly I wouldn’t be surprised to see you in either. If you asked me where the bathroom was and they’re in separate places I’d ask which one bc I’d have no idea how to respond lol
Nice shirt! I have the same one 😃
Idk they are both next to each other behind the carpet aisle. I'll let you figure it out.
Either I don't think I'd think anything if you went into either
Oh I just tell people ""oh the restrooms are down the hallway, I know the women's restroom is on the left but I think the other is on the right"" for all sexes/genders :)
Off topic, but cool Camp Unus Annus shirt!
Good to know. I mostly ask bc I feel like I get the opposite, weird looks either way 😅
I agree with this!!
Thanks! I cherish it lol
I mean. I think the typa people who scan bathrooms to see if any potential trans/gnc person is there will give you weird looks either way. 

But ppl who are just there to use the bathroom probably wont look at you much at all since, yeah, you look fairly neutral. 

But honestly i think this varies a lot based off the outfit. Ik personally theres clothes that i feel safer using the womens room in and others that i feel safer in the mens wearing. ¯\_(ツ)_/¯ 
Honestly i just try to avoid multi stall restrooms if at all possible"	u85por	NonBinary	49	0.98	2022-04-20 20:29:16
Any pointers?	"Hello community! I just wanted to introduce myself. I am the father of a 10 year old non-binary child, biological male. They have been this way since I can remember. So far, the subject of puberty is very stressful for them. We are taking a slow approach, but this morning I woke up early (insomnia) as I realize this will happen rather quickly, and couldn’t sleep. Childhood seems so short in some ways.

We live in a relatively accepting area, though there are more conservative areas around that would likely be less so. I guess what comes to mind is managing things like road trips in areas that are less accepting (bathrooms, etc) and things of that realm. I really have no cares what anyone thinks of my child, but I do think about their safety. And perhaps I’m wrong, but I’m perceiving that there will be some bullying in school going forward at some point, though they have a solid circle of friends at this point. We are well aware of the risk of depression and suicide as well. I don’t want to be pushy (about puberty) but we can’t bury our heads in the sand either.

I don’t want to sound doom and gloom. This has been a beautiful and unexpected journey. They have our full support, but I’m clear in knowing that I cannot expect the world to adapt to my child, and that there will be times of difficulty. I was just wondering if anyone could share things that helped, or perhaps things that they would have done different. I apologize in advance if I’ve made any faux pas, as we are still learning day by day. Thanks much for your help and patience."	"Great that you’re reaching out to community! I would say one of the most powerful things is that your kid can connect with other trans or non binary kids. Find a community, obviously online is easiest but in person is really helpful
Have you tried talking to your pediatrician about puberty blockers?
Also, having you on their side is incredibly helpful. Just taking your kids lead, using their right pronouns, and listening to what they want even when it changes. These are amazing ways to support them in a world that has such mixed responses to non binary people
You are doing a great job and already on the right path. I read above the comment about finding friends that are going through similar things and I love that. I would also like to add that I wish I had realized or been told earlier in my life that your friends can be well-meaning but can get it deeply, deeply wrong sometimes. To me, it’s just as important to make sure your child is contextualizing their friendships and processing some of the things their friends say as much as the “bullies.” 

Not in a critical way, simply because we should put as much care and thought into the effect our friendships have on us just as much as the nay-sayers. I’ve learned so much in adulthood about good friendships—supporting one another without competing, being there for one another without being toxic or demanding, etc. I know these are higher-level relationship concepts for kids, but learning to cultivate good relationships with people who affirm you is just as important as learning how to deal with bullies!
https://www.refugerestrooms.org/ Is a resource for finding safe restrooms while traveling since you mention that specifically. 

You seem to have a good attitude and want what’s best for your kid so the only advice I have is to try to be more careful about when and how you mention their “biological sex”. Many nonbinary folks, myself included would feel hurt being introduced by a parent as their “non-binary child, biological male“. I’m sure you included it because you’re just trying to provide all of the relevant information and their sex at birth and endogenous hormone profile are relevant to transition related health care but it’s usually best to wait until you are talking those things rather than bringing it up out of the blue. A person’s biological sex is actually not relevant in most conversational contexts and a nonbinary person’s doubly so. As a parent of a nonbinary child you are going to encounter people who will be very insistent on learning what is in your kids pants and as a parent your responsibility is to help them understand how incredibly creepy and inappropriate they are being. When talking to a doctor or in a trans support group like this it can be relevant but it really should never be one of the first things you say about any nonbinary person. I understand that you are here with good intentions and I’m not trying to scold you. I just wanted to mention it so you can try to be more mindful of of when and how you talk about this in the future
When I’m on a road trip I try to scope out Starbucks on my route since they are common and typically have gender neutral bathrooms. 

I think you’re doing great… I came out to my parents in my mid 20s and they were very sad to find out I had been identifying as non-binary for more than 10 years but never felt comfortable to tell them all that time. Being open to whatever direction your child’s identity might evolve in will make a huge difference to them 💜
just do your best to prepare them for people being rude and make sure they understand how to deal with transphobia(as best as a kid can understand) for bathrooms you could always let a older female (their mom or older sister someone they know) take them to the womens bathroom I isn't uncommon to see a mom with her son or not female passing kid in a womens bathroom and nobody asks questions
We are working toward that! We know of one child, and are trying to have play dates at least periodically, but it is difficult since their parent is busy with work and also they go to a different school. But we are trying!
Not yet. We have a referral to a gender clinic that will be happening this spring.
You providing resources, community, acceptance and opportunity with your kiddo taking the lead helps reinforce they can trust their decisions surrounding identity. It’s creating another layer of secure attachment.  validating them is HUGE particularly when none of you know the “answer.” Keep at it :)
Thanks so much for your comment. I will share all of this with my family. We’re all in this together, I guess- much love to all of you. I wish you all the best and thank you for all of the support. 

Why can’t the rest of the world be like this?
Thanks for that- not even sure why I included it, in hindsight. And thanks for your patience. We are new to this and are really just finding out how to navigate this and definitely wouldn’t want to be hurtful or inappropriate.
And thanks so much for sharing that app! That is such a helpful thing!
Sounds like you’re doing great tbh
Oh good I was about to suggest an endocrinologist who can give recommendations for things like binders/packers/breast forms etc… as your child grows regardless of if you use puberty blockers."	tikx65	NonBinary	47	0.95	2022-03-20 13:20:55
What can I do to support a non binary questioning child?	"My 16 yo came up to me - “I think I might be non-binary. I am ok with my name and parts - but gendered pronouns make me really uncomfortable. I don’t feel like anything but a [name].  “

Other than affirming love and safety and avoiding pronouns- what to do?"	"I would have a conversation with your child about how they want to be referred to in public. For example, do they want you to continue using their old pronouns with others (maybe they aren't comfortable with everyone knowing yet), and what information, if any, are they ok with you sharing? It's very easy to say things, in an effort to be gender affirming, that might push someone out of their comfort zone. Not everyone is going to be ok with their nonbinary identity, and it helps for a person to scope out a situation before the obligatory ""coming out"" in a conversation.
So far it sounds like you're doing a great job :)
In my experience of coming out, something that made me feel nice was that nobody made a big deal of it. Cuz it's not a big deal. Nothing about me changed, my loved ones just learned a new, fun fact about me. *shrug*

It's possible that your kid's concept of gender may shift and change over time as they figure out their relationship with gender more accurately. Just going with the flow and not making a big deal of these shifts is also very supportive and affirming. I know I went through a couple before I found what felt the best.
I'm so glad you are on here trying your best to be affirming and supportive of your child. I came out to my parents and it.. did not go over so great. My issue is they weren't educated and were hella confused. I don't think that'll be a problem since you are on here looking for good information. Major props for that!

I think making it a big enough deal but at the same not a big deal is key. Blowing it off is bad, but also making it the center of attention is also bad. I think because your child is only 16 they will be exploring things and may find things change. They might want something temporary like binding/tucking, they might want to change their name, they might want hrt. And letting know that you are open to those if and when your child wants them can be really reassuring. 
Can you afford counselling? For you and (more-so) for your child? I can't tell you how helpful a gender therapist has been for me.

But otherwise: I would advise to avoid gender stereotypes. Don't assume interests or desires of your child based on assigned gender. Try to be inclusive especially in areas which are typically though of as gender specific. Things such as getting your nails done (either for or against).
UPDATEish -We had a good conversation - and we are just going to avoid pronouns for the time being while [name] mulls things over.  I don't want to discount [name's] assertion, but this is on the heels of several friends coming out and some long discussions on gender politics and the like.  There might be a bit of ""bandwagon-ing"" going on.  It might not.  Regardless - I am committed to love and safety.
I think that this is really good advice, but that I would maybe add to it. 

I’m out to my parents as gay but not nonbinary (I’m AFAB and they think I’m a lesbian). I’m really glad that my parents haven’t made a big deal about my sexuality, but at the same time I wish that they were better at realizing that sometimes I need support in ways that somebody who’s straight wouldn’t. When the Pulse shooting happened my dad didn’t really understand why I was so upset (but did end up calling every day or two for the rest of the week to make sure my girlfriend and I were doing okay), and my mom has never brought it up with me, and that pattern has repeated for plenty of other things. 

So I guess my advice to a parent whose child was coming out would be to not make a big deal about it, but to recognize that other people will and that sometimes your kid will need support for that.  "	797bw5	NonBinary	43	1.0	2017-10-28 01:00:01

Searched but didn’t find anything resembling this. Trying to prepare my enby kiddo for school after already facing hatred tw for discussion of enby bullying/misgendering	"Hey everyone. First, thank you for letting me take up a bit of space today. And for anyone who comments, I appreciate your time and energy more than you know. 

Short backstory. I’m the parent to a 5 yo enby kiddo. We’re using non-binary as the label with the public, since they just identify as their name right now, but we’ll switch if/when they find the right label for them. They never really came out. We asked them and their twin at three if they were a boy or a girl, and they said “I’m not a boy, I’m an R.”  It was consistent and a few months in they showed distress at being gendered in the binary. We talked to them, and realized this was something we had to start being proactive about. We had them enrolled in a preschool, where they said they wanted us to let the teacher know they weren’t a boy or girl, and where they then faced some serious bullying from two children whose parents were actively teaching these children to misgender R. The teacher gave no support, despite when we initially interviewed the school saying she would respect R, and it was a co-op Preschool, so these parents were in charge of supervising my child way too often for their safety, so we removed them and their twin.  We’ve just started seeing the negatives from that experience go away. 

We are now facing the start of kindergarten and my question is this. What can I do as a parent to prepare them and support them?  What do you wish your parents had done?  We will not be in school with the children that harmed my child last year as it was a private preschool and we’re moving into a different district, but I’m not naive enough to think there won’t be more parents like this, and more experiences like this.  I’m already planning on reaching out to the schools to have a gender affirming plan in place for my kiddo, and to fight the battles I have to.  I just want to do more and I don’t know what. I want to wrap them in so much love that no one can break through it to hurt them, but I feel clueless and worry about causing harm.  I worry I’ll talk too much about their identity and that will make them think there’s something wrong with them. But I also want to prepare them that there will be kids that will misgender them, because there will be."	"you sound like a wonderful parent, your child will be very grateful for your support I’m sure, especially as they get older and understand how complicated and contentious others view gender (especially gender outside the binary) to be. 

like you said, unfortunately there are bound to be kids that don’t accept them and tease them. and I think the best thing you can do is build them up and surround them with so much love at home that they feel supported enough to handle shitty people. emphasise that it’s the behaviour of the other kids that is wrong, not them. 
I’d also suggest getting some resources printed out for their teacher(s), I can suggest some resources if you’d like but don’t wanna bombard you with too much here! maybe even ask if the teacher can talk to the class about gender (without mentioning your kid specifically) and how not everyone is a boy or a girl because young kids are usually pretty receptive to whatever they hear. 
good luck - keep loving your kid like you do and I’m sure they’ll turn out great. a supportive and loving home life is probably the single most valuable thing for any kid, but especially gender variant kids.
I wish you all the best with the school.

I've been doing some reading lately, and it looks like being able to code-switch is often a component to comfort in situations that might otherwise have upsetting misgendering. Essentially, when there's somewhere you have to go that you know won't be good about R's gender (eg. I don't know, the dentist maybe), it might be worth talking with R beforehand and trying to play ""secret agents"" for the trip. If this is distressing to R, don't of course, and it only works if R is genuinely on board, but these kind of boundaries skills/learning to keep information private as a positive active choice can be pretty handy to have.

It can also be good to rehearse answers to common questions. This again will increase R's confidence in otherwise sticky situations.

PS not an expert, learned this in advice for adults, but code-switching is a key word that might help some searches.
Hey, I know I'm late to the party here but just wanted to chime in with a couple other resources.  There's a book that was literally just released yesterday called [It Feels Good to Be Yourself: A Book About Gender Identity](https://www.amazon.com/dp/1250302951/), written by the mom of a trans kid and illustrated by an enby.  I haven't received my copy yet, but it looks fantastic, and might be both validating for your kiddo and also useful for educating their classmates.  You're probably already aware of the handful of other books out there featuring nonbinary kids, such as...

- [Are You a Boy or Are You a Girl?](https://www.amazon.com/Are-You-Boy-Girl/dp/178592267X/), in which the protagonist uses they/them pronouns and is implied to be genderfluid (e.g. ""Are you a girl or a boy today?""); they face some (fairly mild) bullying which might be a good starting point for discussion with your kiddo, though I find this book a bit bland overall

- [Meet Polkadot](https://www.amazon.com/Meet-Polkadot-Book-1/dp/0989883604), which is very similar to the above title but a bit more engaging in my opinion; however, unfortunately it's out of print so very hard to find

- [From the Stars in the Sky to the Fish in the Sea](https://www.amazon.com/Stars-Sky-Fish-Sea/dp/155152709X/), in which the nonbinary protagonist is bullied at school every day but comes home to a supportive parent (though the metaphor of also being different animals can be a bit confusing to some kids)

- [Jamie is Jamie](https://www.amazon.com/Jamie-About-Being-Yourself-Playing/dp/1631981390), in which the protagonist is not explicitly nonbinary, but gender is never specified/pronouns aren't used at all

- [Who Are You? The Kids Guide to Gender Identity](https://www.amazon.com/Who-Are-You-Gender-Identity/dp/1785927280/) and [The Gender Wheel](https://www.amazon.com/Gender-Wheel-Story-about-Bodies/dp/1945289120/), both nonfiction explanations of gender rather than stories

- [Neither](https://www.amazon.com/Neither-Airlie-Anderson/dp/0316547697), which is more metaphorical rather than literally about gender, but it could be a really good way to start discussing with your kiddo how entrenched some people are in the binary and how it can be hard for them to understand at first that not everyone fits into those two categories, and sometimes they can even be pretty mean about it, but it doesn't mean there's anything wrong with being ""neither""!

Hope something in there is useful, best of luck to you and your kiddo with the new school!
Feel free to bombard me. I follow a few enby voices on Facebook. We have enby children’s books at home, and I’ve reached out to our local GLSEN, a local advocacy group in the United States, but bombard me because you can never have enough tools.
This is really helpful. Thank you so much. R already has pretended to be Catboy, if you don’t know who that is it’s a superhero from a kids cartoon, so this coincides with something they already do. I’ll search code switching so I can learn more on how to explain and frame it with them. 

Seriously, thank you so much.
these are resources I came across while looking for stuff to explain being nonbinary to my parents so they're aimed at adults and might be good for teachers to read, see what you think.

I'll chime in with a resource not mentioned. It's more geared toward age-appropriate, inclusive sexual education for kids/teens, but includes some gender resources too. It's called Scarleteen:

Is this Cat Noir from Miraculous Ladybug? :)

With this framing I'd probably suggest something based on ""I'm not sure if (the dentist) will understand your gender or not. Do you want to go as R or do you want to use your superhero disguise and go as Catboy"" But I'm not an expert on kids so yes, get a second opinion :)
Thank you so much for these. I’ll look into all of them when my kiddo falls asleep tonight. I really appreciate your time.
Nope. Catboy from PJ Masks. According to Lin Manual Miranda on Twitter it’s like Sense8 for the under 8 crowd, but I admittedly haven’t watched Sense8 yet. 

And I have a therapist who specializes in preschool age kids, so I’ll run it by her, but based on what I’ve heard from other enby and gender expansive kids’ parents, this seems to jive with what they’re doing as older kids, and how you can’t correct everyone because it’s exhausting for you and not always safe.  And as a parent I view myself as giving them the tools to lay the framework and foundation for the adults they’ll be, and this seems like another good tool they can put in their belt that can help protect them in a positive way. They’re big into superheroes and we talk about how superheroes wear masks to protect their identity so they don’t get hurt. I don’t know if it will work in school, since we’re there day in and day out, but I’m definitely going to research the hell of this for them. 

And not that it has anything to do with anything, but our dentist is actually fantastic and really gender affirming.  When we told them, the whole office just accepted it and moved on. We live in a fairly progressive part of the United States, so the bigots are not as prevalent, but you still run into them.
no problem! if your kid (or you! or someone else in your life who’s trying to learn) might appreciate seeing some videos of trans kids, there’s a few videos on this channel of young trans people: https://m.youtube.com/mygenderation?uid=sDRRuhpz3oCi5PABiiY5kA as well as a huge range of different trans (including nonbinary) folks talking about their experiences and showing the happy lives they’re living. I’ve found it very uplifting to watch.
Best of luck. So glad to hear about your dentist! And Sense8 for kids sounds like something I reaally want to watch."	bv70su	NonBinary	29	1.0	2019-05-31 12:39:27

Compromising on Pronouns	"I firmly believe I should not have to do this, but I'm becoming really desperate. But I need some advice, maybe consolation, I don't know. Something to help me deal with the fact that I have to do this for my safety.

I'm AFAB and nonbinary. I get she'd to death like...every day. I don't really pass. I've been a good soldier, I've handled it the best I could, I've never yelled at anyone besides my parents (who were very abusive and transphobic) for it...but it's starting to destroy me. So I'm trying to compromise by letting people I trust use he/him pronouns and masc words for me under specific circumstances when talking to others, and using them on myself with people I suspect will give me grief for being nonbinary.

My fiancee's grandmother refuses to accept they/them pronouns and insists it's ""just because of grammar"" no matter how much we explain that she uses singular they in her daily language damn near every day. But I suspect it's just subtle semi-malicious transphobia, whether she's aware of it or not. I suggested we try he/him with her, but I have a gut feeling deep down it's not worth it, and that she's going to keep calling me she because I don't pass and she has issues with trans people outside of the grammar issue that isn't really an issue. In fact, I'll find out in mere minutes if that went over well, because my fiancee is talking to her about it on her way home from work.

I gave my family/friends the right to use their own discretion when it comes to using he/him versus they/them, because I trust them and their judgement. I'm ding this to mitigate damage and make things easier on me but I can't get over the fact that I am literally compromising on my entire identity to decrease how much harm someone else's bigotry can cause me. It shouldn't be a thing. And I feel that it causes harm to more than just me. Feel that it skirts around being persistent and asserting that one's identity is to be respected. Which could make the people I compromise with feel content to misgender other nonbinary people and stall change overall.

...Okay. This is disorganized and I'm sorry for that. TL;DR I'm using wrong-but-less-wrong pronouns for my own safety, but I feel guilty, sickened, hurt, and miserable about it, and I need some kind of advice, solidarity, pat on the head or something right now because I hate this so much, even if I know I'll hate it a lot less than what's going on right now. Idk what to do.

&#x200B;

UPDATE:

&#x200B;

So I was right. She flipped the fuck out over it. I'm ubering and walking to work from now on, which is financially impossible, but I can't be in the car with this horrible person anymore. I don't feel safe or calm enough to handle it, so I've decided I won't go with her anymore. She spent my fiancee's whole trip to work this morning begging her to leave me and suggesting that, because she drives for me, I should be giving up my pronouns in exchange. She's admitting to holding my identity hostage and I'm not allowing that. Obviously my fiancee and I are not splitting up just because she's completely out of her mind (and out of line) but I am LIVID at the suggestion.

We're going to figure out if we can move to closer to the Pittsburgh area where it appears to be a little more lgbt friendly and closer to places and events we're interested in going to, people I'm interested in hanging out with, etc. Our landlord is a flakey prick so we need to move anyway, might as well kill several birds with one stone.

I spent my 24 hours lamenting, now I'm going to switch into ""be unapologetically myself"" mode and start making her really god damn uncomfortable by refusing to accommodate her delicate sensibilities anymore now that she's not going to be driving me. She gets no power over me. She can sit in her bubble, alone, where everything is full of her deranged pseudo-Christian values and never having to be considerate of the feelings of people who don't look like you."	"I'm in the same boat (AFAB, constantly read as a woman) and I'm sorry to hear you're dealing with similar things. It's so hard to even work up the courage to ask people to use they/them (I'm not even out to any family members or IRL friends) and it sucks when people just ignore them. 

In my own experience, I've also tried to push myself to ID as a trans man instead of NB, so I understand how shitty it feels to try to mold your identity to be binary. If it makes you feel bad to use he/him, I don't think pushing yourself is going to be healthy for you.

I don't really have any tested advice, but you definitely shouldn't feel responsible for stopping people from misgendering you. You're putting yourself out there by being honest about your feelings, and they're dropping the ball. I hope things get easier for you.
I'm sorry that they're being so problematic about it, I hope it gets better <3

I havent approached my family or friends about pronouns yet, but something that might help for the grandmother is telling them that it is actually explicitly correct in the dictionary to use they to refer to a singular nonbinary person, and that to use any pronoun for you other than they would in fact be grammatically incorrect
Ever since I saw that merriam webster added they for use with nonbinary people to the official definition of they that's been my plan for people like that

I havent tried it though so I dont know if it would work or if they'd just come up with a different argument if you place the dictionary in front of their face. Maybe you could head that off by asking them if grammar is their only issue with it beforehand, and if they say it is then they're kind of stuck unless they want to admit their transphobia?

https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/they
4—used to refer to a single person whose gender identity is nonbinary (see NONBINARY sense c)
I knew certain things about … the person I was interviewing.… They had adopted their gender-neutral name a few years ago, when they began to consciously identify as nonbinary — that is, neither male nor female. They were in their late 20s, working as an event planner, applying to graduate school.
— Amy Harmon

You are valid without other people, but I know how shitty it feels to have the people you care about not respect who you are. You are not alone. *Sending you hugs *
> But I suspect it's just subtle semi-malicious transphobia, whether she's aware of it or not. 

Considering that even a quick google search can bring up that they/them can be used as a singular gender pronoun, transphobia is exactly what it is. It's a myth that ""old people don't use technology"", and it's also a myth that ""old people are set in their ways"" and can't change. 

One strategy you might try is youtube educational videos by non binary and other trans elders from a culture of origin she tends to adhere to. I don't think she respects you as a person (I think all intentional misgendering is driven by this lack of respect). So she might be willing to listen to someone who is closer to her own cultural experience.
Just want to clarify that when I said, one could argue using a pronoun other than they was grammatically incorrect, I meant this to be funny rather than serious. Any pronoun that a person says is their pronoun is imo grammatically correct and valid. I just find something very funny about turning the grammar argument back around"	d8w4g7	NonBinary	24	1.0	2019-09-25 00:51:13
Trans Day Of Remembrance and feeling pretty terrible	"So as most of you probably know, today is the International Transgender Day of Remembrance, where we remember the trans people of all identities who have died at the hands of others or themselves over the past year.

A couple of the murders this year were near me, as were some of the suicides. 

I feel so sad and genuinely grieve for the people we've lost. It feels like my heart's been ripped out, every year. Every time I hear of another death. And it terrifies me. Any day, I could become one of next year's statistics. I've gone through a lot of harassment and rejection already as a result of being trans/nonbinary, including incidents where my physical safety was threatened or compromised. All it takes is for one person to get a little angrier than usual by my existence, and that's it. I'm scared to wear my binder, I NEVER use public bathrooms (did it before, *miSTAKE*), I sure asf don't talk to people or tell anyone.

This is just kind of a rant I guess, idk really. But yeah, TDoR today and it hits me hard. "	"I feel that. I’m sorry. Lots of love today. Here’s a great screamo song. [GLOSS- Trans Day of Revenge](https://open.spotify.com/user/kapplerm/playlist/73gKxHOBoIyGMUXGzSwHpf?si=oRfikHsMSdSI8QxEQegwIQ) 
I'd say ""stay safe"", but that feels so inadequate today. If I knew you IRL, I would offer to be your bodyguard. I'm 6' and fighting is like one of three things I actually know how to do, and I'm working on perfecting my ""back off"" glare. Which is hard, because I'm a huge dork.

Sorting myself out. Uncertain.	"Thank you to anyone reading. I'm wondering if others have thoughts or similarities on how I’m experiencing gender. I'm struggling with words and terms a bit and hope this is ok to ask for some help with. 

I’m attracted to the term “nonbinary” as I’m pretty sure I don’t think there is much distinction of value or meaning in “male” and “female” and this these are both inadequate, oversimplifying, and similar enough to be kind of irrelevant (for me).  I also reject the idea that gender always exists in relation  (inclusive, alternating, etc. ) to these two concepts. ""Genderqueer"" seems like it has angles of making sense here too. 

I was assigned male and birth and have always felt like that made enough sense. I've never felt female and despite debilitating body image challenges, have always felt like having an external appearance labeled male was close enough. 

I’m not feeling a need or interest in changing my body, etc. I'm in a relationship with another AMAB person for the past 20 years and usually identify as queer, but sometimes gay.

But in so many ways, I don’t recognize myself as  “male.” I don't feel connected to other men through a gender lens, don't feel at all like I am part of the conversation when people talk about men*, and have never been interested in gendered spaces or activities for men. I’ve rarely felt men see me as one of them either. This includes gay/queer men as well.  I’ve even noticed in my closest peer group that the “men” connect with each other and are referred to as “the guys,” etc. This never includes me. It’s just understood that this is not me. 

At this point – it’s like I look male, I have male-male seeming romantic and sexual relationships, but I’m otherwise not male internally. 

I remember bristling in childhood when a peer called me ""dude,"" couldn’t understand why boys and girls had different clothes, shirts on or off when swimming, and frequently have to remind myself that I am male when people are speaking about men. I don't feel comfortable being called ""sir.""  Many of the stories I read and a few of the folks I know have similar dissonance with these things, but I see them express a connection to or an identity reflecting “femaleness”. 

*I think one of the complicating factors is that I believe that male and female are political and social groupings and that my expression of maleness (especially my appearance)  has brought various unearned privileges including forms of safety, being listened to, employment privileges, and more.

Is this non-binary? A form of gender ambivalence?  Ami Just a a male that doesn’t relate to maleness on many levels?  

Thank you for any thoughts.

"	"I absolutely suck at talking about nb stuff but alot of what you say makes sense to me. I'm afab and haven't really felt female like ever. I don't really care about pronouns but do bristle abit if I have to be referred to as female for long periods also. I do consider myself nb though just purely because I don't feel male or female. If you feel the same then maybe you are nb. Just as long as you're comfortable with it is what I think matters.
Hey, I can relate to this a lot too!

AMAB here too, but I'm mainly into girls and somewhat slightly uncomfortable with my male presentation (just want to tweak it a bit), and I don't really care much which pronouns or other gendered words are used on me.

Otherwise what you say resonates quite a lot with me, and I almost never fit in all-male spaces either anyway. I like your view on these things too. 
A person who PM'd me is talking about spectrums of gender (and I'm thinking that and spectrums of nonbinary). I have what seems to be social dissonance being identified as male, but am comfortable presenting as male and with male parts, etc. But, as you say, ""I don't feel male or female.""  

Interesting to hear folks say they have some familiarity with this. Thanks for your response. "	7e3z46	NonBinary	22	0.99	2017-11-19 22:15:21
Recloseting myself	"I don't know how to phrase this but I've been essentially recloseting myself lately because my safety is most important above everything else but I'm fearful that this is not a valid transition experience. 

I don't want to say I'm detransitioning but I have scrubbed my socials of all mentions of being trans except for my Reddit obviously. Being trans/nonbinary is so exhausting because I can't find other people in real life who identify similarly to me. I have a really complex relationship to womanhood but people have dismissed this as me secretly being cisgender. I'm just so tired of dealing with transphobia from people at my school I decided that when I return I'm gonna stay closeted. 

It physically pains me to type this and I feel so horribly depressed about it. I was just wondering if anyone had similar experiences. I just want to know if things will ever change. Please tell me there is a hopeful side to this. Is there a light at the end?"	"Your experience is valid, you are valid. Safety and acceptance are so important.


Please don't worry about being valid, you are valid and you are what you are, nobody can take that away from you!

I've been trough a similar ""recloseting"" situation and for me it was all just part of the process! Everyone has their own experience!
I'm not in that exact situation (for me it's staying closeted to a big and important part of my family I want to get to know, but knowing it's not safe)  but it's totally valid. You made your safety your priority and that's a great thing, because you are taking care of yourself.

Living in our oppressive societies means we will face challenges and it's good if you can see when to retreat to preserve yourself.
It doesn't have to be forever, too. These past few years, I've noticed how life eventually changes on its own. Even if you do nothing, things kind of evolve on their own. You might not have anyone irl that can relate or support you right now, but that doesn't mean it'll always be like this.

People will say being non-binary or trans is following a trend, but they don't know the privilege they have by being cis. It's 100% valid to want to hide that part of you from them, and it's 100% valid to feel really bad about it. Plus, none of this is your fault and society is being hard on you.

I support you with all my heart!
Lack of physical community is really hard.  It’s hard existing in a world where we have to fight to have our basic humanity acknowledged.  You’re 100% valid as a gender non-conforming person, in or out of a closet. 

A lot of times, me being femme of center non binary, people have a tendency to just see me as woman-lite.  It’s frustrating, I tend to keep me being non-binary safe when meeting new people.  Especially as I live in a red-ish area politically.

I think there’s a lot of femininity/“womanhood” that doesn’t adhere to the binary.  A sort of wild femininity.  I feel like I’m feminine like a wild moose.  Not really graceful and will charge at someone who messes with me.  Exploring femininity in nature has been helpful lol.  Like damn, it’s usually the males that are ornate in nature.  The gender binary is so absurd.  

And for me, exploring femininity/“womanhood” (I’m not sure what verbiage you use, sorry, take whatever fits ok?) in a way that feels affirming is hard when you’ll be perceived as a woman no matter what, yanno?  There’s a lot of complexity there.

Idk.  💕  I think it’s hard, and all we can do is keep searching out community where we can.  Online community is valid too.  But being patient with ourselves (especially as we weather an extremely hostile politically charged time against trans people) is important. 💕  there’s always light at the end, we’ll figure it out, ok?
Absolutely fine. You're not at a place where you can safely be out, so being closeted is the best option for you right now. That's fine. It doesn't mean you're not nonbinary. It doesn't mean you're failing or anything like that. We're just trying to live our lives, and we can't all be fighters all the time. If it's going to be easier for you to act like you're cis than to deal with transphobia, then just be closeted and save up your energy to get ready to move away to somewhere with a queer scene that you can finally be yourself in. You mention school- maybe you can use getting accepted to a college as a ticket out of a bad area. The irl communities are waiting for you when you get out of there, and Reddit certainly isn't going anywhere.
""Feminine like a wild moose"" has such a lovely vibe as a thought about gender!!

I also found nature was really helpful for navigating how I feel, there's so much variety among the animal kingdom and it makes some of what we apparently decided as human society feel silly and restrictive! I know this wasn't the point of OPs but I was delighted to see another person who looks to nature in a way I do and had to comment. Stay wild! :)"	1232l4a	NonBinary	22	0.94	2023-03-26 22:47:30
Internet way to test different name/pronouns?	"Do any of you lovelies have recommendations of online games, forums, etc. (not tumblr, I'm not a fan of their new safety rules and I'm not a content creator so I have trouble being part of communities on there, which is like fine no harm) where people can test the waters on new names/pronouns/gender expression? (I'm afab, 25, but live rn basically as ""girl"" since I'm not out as non-binary to family rn- not worth explaining until I have a more solid explination for them other than literally the shrug emoji, and the friends I've told well, I feel fairly pronoun indifferent and told them as much, which basically gave them a greenlight to keep using ""she"" which technically is fine since I haven't landed on any final decisions about what I want my pronouns to be. This is rambling, but all I know right now is that my boobs are annoying as hell and i don't?? need them??? anyway). 

&#x200B;

Essentially what I'm interested in is a fun place to experiment with gender expression and name/pronoun usage, where I interact with people with said name/pronouns and can get a feel for how it, well, feels. Any recommendations?

&#x200B;

(P.S. if anyone here remembers the whole .hack franchise pls tell me because my little middle school heart would explode cause that was some GOOD CONTENT RIGHT THERE)

&#x200B;

Thanks!"	"Thank you for sharing your thoughts.

This is beneficial because I have only recently begun exploring and establishing myself as an NB online.

They're also incredibly helpful, and I've dated a few of them through [TS Dates](https://datingadvocate.com/ts-dates).
[Pronoun Dressing Room](http://www.pronouns.failedslacker.com/)  is a site I've used and recommended to people a lot in the past :)
Discord might be your best bet! Check disboard for any friendly trans/lgbt servers (all the specifically nb ones are a bit dead in my experience tho?). You can set a nickname within each server so you could even trial different names/pronouns at the same time on different servers if you wanted! Lots of them will let you set 'roles' for your pronoun use/etc too, and you can just pit your preferences in your nickname. 
The Arcana visual novel/game is light and fun, and allows you to choose your pronouns. I just did some name/pronoun testing with it myself :) 
i like twitter, its great if you search for things you like and you can find people who like the same things, its easy to talk to others and you can put your name and pronouns in your bio as well
Facebook messenger! You can change your ""nickname"" in individual chats to try out new names, and you can add your pronouns to it as well. 
Thanks for the suggestions, all! I really appreciate having some options, especially since i'm starting to try out stuff through MMO's/gaming sort of arenas so good to have the suggestions that worked for you!

Tired of having to choose between safety and freedom	I wish I could go stealth but there’s just no way to do that as a nonbinary person (not that I know of anyway), the moment I reveal my preferred pronouns or say my gender I’m immediately outed, and I hate having to debate if being true to myself is worth risking my safety, and career opportunities and future. Of course I always choose safety and it sucks every damn time.		tq9jli	NonBinary	20	1.0	2022-03-28 13:39:55
Just started HRT today!Can’t wait to see the results.	"33 AMAB. Just came out as non binary a month ago after decades of stewing and I’m already starting low dose HRT. Looking forward to feeling the changes inside and out! 

I’ve known something was different basically from early puberty but had no way of putting a name to it. I’m not that old but I feel like at least where I was trans/ non binary/ being whatever gender you want to be wasn’t a thing. Certainly not something anyone talked about. 

But from the time my body started to be more masculine I tried to “put it back into the bottle” so to speak. Tucking, wearing my sisters cloths in secret,etc. I did competitive gymnastics from the time I was like 5 so I basically grew up in a leotard (with pants over it, but still). Because of the gymnastics I was super fit and small and compact. I was 5’6” and barely 100lbs with like 0% body fat in 7-8th grade so when things started sprouting and growing I wasn’t into it at all. 

Fast forward through the rest of puberty when I grew 7inches in as many months and the hormones took over I basically buried any differentness I felt and for all intents and purposes I was “normal”, dating and hooking up with girls, sports, cars, airplanes, boats, etc. 

It wasn’t until after college that things started to resurface. At that point I was already married and living a great life. At no point in any of this have I ever felt depressed….. I guess unfulfilled is the right word. Like I have a really great life (professional sailor and yacht broker) but I always felt like I was missing something. 

At any rate fast forward to now, after years of suppressing feeling and feeling ashamed about wanting to be something other than fully male, and over compensating by being extremely male (read: joining the military, working as a cell tower climber, racing yachts, and generally being a dink about it the whole time). I’ve finally decided that I’m in a position of reasonable safety and stability in my life to start living as my full self. I still plan on presenting as predominantly male (the yachting world is still unfortunately populated by mostly conservative old white dudes after all) but I’m taking steps to feel more comfortable in my own skin. I got a full body wax the other day, because being furry is dysphoric for me, but it also felt amazing (very little pain other than the few spots you’d expect), very liberating and love feeling smooth all over, I’m also wear a lot more of what I would like (at least under my boy clothes), my wife and I also did each other nails the other night which was a fun bonding moment for new me. And obviously like I said at the top I just started HRT with Folx. 

Updates as I go and feel free to ask any questions."	"Woot!
What sort of results are you going for with low dose HRT? Just curious as the though of subtly changing my body appeals to me
I’m going for a more androgynous overall look. I’m 6’1’, a bit over weight (working on that pretty well with Noom), square face, and have very large feet. Being able to pass as a cis looking girl    isn’t impossible with enough time but not super likely and not what I’d want for everyday. 

My biggest dysphoric factors are my body hair and my testicles. Waxing has help a ton with one and I’m hoping the HRT will help with the other as testicle size reduction is one of the most common effects. Other that that I’m looking forward to some of the mental readjustments. I currently have the emotionally depth of a thimble. I have emotions I’ve just been taught my whole life not to have them. What ever comes in regards to hips, butt, or boobs I’m ok with if I get the other stuff. 

With low dose it’ll all happen, just more slowly. That way I can adjust as I go and slow down/ stop if I need to before things get too crazy. Honestly I’m super excited and can’t wait to see how it plays out. Genetics are a crap shoot but If the girls in my family are any indication I’ll end up pretty curvy."	rkudvz	NonBinary	18	0.96	2021-12-20 18:58:13
Nonbinary, gender fluid... I took the plunge (hrt- Testosterone) My experience so far. (x-post /r/genderqueer)	"So, I'm born female, struggled with my gender and sexual identity all my life until recently.

When I began dating the girl who I now know is my true love, she was so open and honest about her own experience with transition that it wasn't long before I tearfully admitted to her that I've always felt like my birth body didn't match up with how I wanted to be seen.

For a long time, I struggled with that big secret (""I want to be a boy""), and then- it was out. And then I realized, I had never considered what kind of boy I wanted to be, so in the safety of a few trusted friends and with my partner, I began to explore and give a voice to those long repressed feelings and desires. I began to read about non-binary trans identities and experiences, and to express myself in a way that was much more fluid and queer. I realized I always wanted to be someone whose identity was fluid, because cramming myself in a box on either side of the spectrum proved to be miserable in every way. I wanted to be androgynous. I wanted to move the slider over, so that no matter where on the spectrum I woke up, I could feel comfortable.

Finally, just last week, after months of consulting with my doctor, doing the bloodwork, and so on, he asked me if I would like to start my HRT that day. I balled up my fists and said... Yes. Why not? Let's do it. I only have one life to live, I want to start a low dose of T, and keep doing what was working so well for me- taking it a day at a time. Listening to myself. Seeking the support of community. And never trying to fit into a box again.

So far... well- psychologically the effects have been mindblowing. This last year, I've made great strides in taking care of my mental health for once, having never really done so. I stopped drinking. I'm far from better, but now I'm in a place where I don't feel like every step is a landmine. And within a day of that first injection... I felt so at peace. So unified. So calm.

The best way I've been able to describe it is this: I've always thought of this dysphoria and this deep hurt and feeling of not belonging as having two people trapped in the same body, one of which who never really got a chance to thrive. Think teenage angst times 11. But finally, I threw my boy side a bone. I acknowledged that he exists and that he's felt trapped and upset. But now he feels validated, he's stopped throwing temper tantrums. He's even admitted that he's not particularly interested in the culture of masculinity, he just wanted to be heard. I know it sounds silly.

But suddenly I feel so much more comfortable in my skin, long before any physical changes have happened. My partner said her psychological relief was almost instant when she began HRT as well, long before she experienced the physical changes. Now I understand it.

Currently, I am taking the HRT day by day. My plan is to continue with the half dose and just keep feeling it out. Do I want to fully transition? Do I want to continue on a low dose until I feel androgynous enough to stop? I'm not sure. I've already broken most of the ""rules"" and I've never felt more like my life was actually worth living, so I'll just keep living it, day by day.

I love you all and I just wanted to share- this community, among others here, helped me out more than I could ever say. If I hadn't secretly browsed /r/lgbt 4 years ago and wandered my way over to /r/genderqueer, I probably would have spent another decade drinking to blackout several times a week, resenting my cis partner and myself, cutting my skin and thinking about suicide constantly. That was me, a year ago. Now I am engaged in the gayest, queerest, genderless lesbian husband/wife relationship with the best friend I've ever had.

I won't pretend things aren't hard right now, but I think these are the times that the positive must shine through for an example- I never would have been brave enough if it wasn't for all the beautiful, visible queers shining like stars and giving my repressed, miserable self some hope, something to strive for.

Thank you all.

Thinking of changing your name? Recently changed pronouns? Join my Zoom discussion group!	"I find that sometimes it's easier to try them out with strangers, see how it feels, or start talking with supportive folks for your name and/or pronouns to help it feel good, automatic, and like you. It's a neural pathway that needs to be formed, I've heard various estimates on how long this takes (66 days, 492 times, etc.), so let's start greasing that groove together!

I'm hosting a few Zoom groups meant for social connection of non-binary/GNC/trans folks, with the primary goal of allowing participants to try out or get more accustomed to a new name and/or pronouns.

About the meetings:  
\- Times/dates vary. My time zone is the Western US, but I'll try to find times that work for everyone interested, if they vary widely. I'm limiting these to 6 people per group due to the dynamics of group conversation. If there is wider interest, I'll make them ongoing.  
\- I'm doing this for free, so I'm using free Zoom which is limited to 40min per session. I will open a new room at the 40 min mark and we will all switchover. In total each meeting will be 80 min (1 hour 20 min).  
\- You will need to have access to Zoom.  
\- I prefer that everyone be on camera, but it's not required, as long as your audio is working or you can type in the chat.   
\- I know that some of us may have a few different name options we are deciding between. You can discuss this or your options in the group, but I ask that you please choose only 1 to be identified by for the duration of the meeting. Put it in your Zoom ID name along with your pronouns (I can guide on how to do this if you do not know).  
\- We will do a round of introductions with name and pronouns.  
\- I don't want this to be extremely structured or artificial, but in order to avoid Zoom Silence... I'll have a few prepared questions & conversation topics. Some serious, some fun, some random. I'll post them on screen share. We will go around & each person will choose a question, or create one of their own, & ask it to another person, using their name. Then anyone can comment on their answer, or contribute, being sure to use names and pronouns as much as possible. (E.g. ""Ash, what's your favorite food?"", ""oh my gosh, Riley, I'm having a similar experience."", ""I really resonate with what they were saying about representation & how meaningful that is."")  
\- Please come to the group with an intention to be mindful and supportive of everyone. Use their correct name and pronouns, they will be displayed on screen. Sometimes, even trans and non-binary people can misgender others, so if this happens, catch yourself, apologize, correct yourself, and move on.

Meeting with internet people will always carry some amount of risk. But some steps I'm taking to help with security:  
\- I am not posting this link publicly. I will only communicate date, time, zoom link, and room password in private messages.  
\- After someone messages me expressing interest, I'll vet by reviewing your Reddit history & ask you a few personal questions.  
\- Please be mindful of your personal safety. I know that so many of us are not in living situations that are supportive of this process. You can go do this on your phone in your car, outside, or while on a walk. You can use headphones on your computer inside & no one will hear people referring to you. If you need to duck out unexpectedly or turn off your video, that is ok.

About me:I am non-binary. I am queer. I am a student in a master of social work program. I've produced many in vivo events for my local LGBTQIA2S+ community. Although I'm usually behind the scenes, so we'll see how this goes. No, I don't have a post history on this sub. I'm a very active Reddit lurker. I learn most by reading about others experiences and reflecting internally.

If you are interested in joining or have any questions, please message me!"	"hi, I'm interested in joining, but I don't feel comfortable having my face on camera. Also, I can't talk because I'm closeted and live with people, but I can chat and this probably sounds sketchy and I completely understand if it's not ok for me to join.

Half a mermaid today! Clearly something is working with me... I've been trying to get this spare tire off my waist and I had to actually safety pin the teal wonder to a skirt underneath to keep it from slipping! I'd call that a non-scale victory.		"[deleted]

A Gratitude Post	I just wanted to say thank you to all of the older NB people who post selfies to this sub. Often it’s hard to remember there’s a future for yourself when so many LGBT elders have either passed from oppression or live discrete lifestyles for safety reasons. Your visibility gives me hope for my future and I deeply appreciate you all! 💕	"As someone in their late 30s, first exploring their gender in earnest, I second this enthusiastically. 👏👏💜
As someone who is non binary and genderfluid at 50, I would also like to thank so many younger people for their open mindedness, tolerance and bravery in living the kind of open lives I couldn't imagine when I was younger. This has been an inspiration to me, so right back at you! And I share your admiration of the generations above me who really pioneered the lgbtq+ community, which we all benefit from (which ALL society benefits from to be frank)."	mp65c5	NonBinary	16	0.92	2021-04-12 03:43:26
my friends mom is so sus of me	"so I went away with my friend, of 10 years, and we went on a trail and the people who signed us is were asking identification questions for safety reasons and when it got to me my friends mom turned and said ""*deadname* male or female?"" my genderfluid ass almost died and reluctantly said my  assigned gender at birth... I looked at my friend and we  almost burst into laughter."		rkwyk7	NonBinary	16	1.0	2021-12-20 20:56:48
I love my GP	"I had my 3rd appointment with my new GP. Before she was just helping me while my other doctor was on vacation but, after I got ghosted on the next appointment after he got back from vacation, I decided I didn't want to deal with him any more. 

Anyways she is amazing, I came out to her at my appointment yesterday and asked if she'd be able to help me with the process of getting hrt. (That wasn't the point of my visit, I was mainly there to talk about my antidepressants and anxiety meds but no harm in asking right?) While she didn't have the resources to help with hrt she was incredibly supportive and made a note of my pronouns in my file with her. She asked me the basic trans questions and I told her honestly. We even discussed binding safety while I try to figure out top surgery options. I've never felt more listened to by a doctor before, and now I feel silly for being anxious to come out to my medical team.

I still have to find an endo but I do love that she was so accepting. She even said ""I hate this term but clinically it's called Gender Identity Disorder,"" my heart melted when I heard her be so supportive. I just had to tell someone other than my wife, I'm just over the moon today."	Congratulations! There’s nothing better than having support and understanding from your GP. 👍👍	typf74	NonBinary	15	0.95	2022-04-07 23:08:51
Wanting to present femme but scared	Hello! I posted here recently questioning my gender. I’ve decided that, for now, “transmasc nb” makes the most sense. I want to present more femme (makeup, dresses, cutesy pastel clothes) but I’m worried about how folks, especially folks at work will react? I’ve been out as a man since I came here, and I’ve been treated like “one of the bros” and I don’t want to lose that by dressing or presenting femme. I also don’t want folks to stop using he/him pronouns but I’d like them to use they/them. I’ve thought about dressing femme on my days off and hanging out with other lgbtq folks so I have that safety net and a safe space to explore, and dressing masc on my days where I have work/classes to avoid any conflict with work or professors. Thoughts?	"Ive been experimenting in little ways to present to yourself as femme...

Painted toenails. Light eyeshadow. Better self care aka ... Caring about like facial cream, nice smelling products (shampoo, deoderant)...

Those are my ideas so far feel to borrow them Ill be rereading this later to borrow other ideas too"	apky1s	NonBinary	16	1.0	2019-02-11 20:59:56
How to Job Hunt while Non-binary	I have been working at a private school the past two years and for safety reasons, decided to leave and find a teaching job. However, I had never considered that people would be wary to hire someone openly out as trans or apart of the LGBTQIA+ Community for fear of parent backlash (despite their workplace stating they’re equal opportunity). Does anyone have any advice for searching for jobs or any red flags I should be on the lookout for?	"I'm not in teaching, so I can't speak to that specifically, but one way is to look at how they word the job ad. If they use things like ""he/she"" to refer to the individual who will be in the position, that's an indication that they're working on a binary mindset. If they have a webpage outlining benefits for employees, look at their health insurance and see if there's any specific mention of resources or support for LGBTQ+ healthcare. I would at the least hope to see some statement on their website that they support diversity in their students, if nothing else. 

If you get to the interview stage and you feel safe doing so, you can also directly ask your interviewer, ""How does your workplace support LGBTQIA+ staff members?"" I work in libraries/higher ed, and a lot of the jobs I've interviewed for expect candidates to be able to demonstrate how they've contributed to ""diversity, equity, and inclusion"" in their past work. You can ask the same of them. They may not be very honest with you (no hiring manager or interview committee is going to bad-mouth their own place of work during an interview) but if they seem totally caught off-guard or give you a vague answer that doesn't include any specifics about their support systems, that's a red flag. 

No organization will admit to not hiring you because your LGBTQIA+, so you'll never know if that was really the reason or if they just went with another candidate for other reasons. But if someone doesn't hire you because you admit to being LGBTQIA+ in an interview, you probably don't actually want to work there. That place will never be accepting of you, and unless you're really okay with being somewhat or totally closeted at work, it won't be a situation that will be tenable in the long run. If it's a stepping-stone and you recognize it as such, that's fine, but you have to be prepared for that.
I'd look for openly queer employees working there. I have a personal rule: ""I will be no more visibly distinct than the most visibly distinct person on staff."" In my case we have no NB folks, so I'm not open. We do have people with colorful hair,  visible tattoos, piercings, and pride flags (usually just the ""I'm an accepting adult"" sort) so I'll be that open...but I'm not going to be the first Mx.-They/Them on staff, especially when I clearly read as male.
Following, will likely be in this dilemma myself shortly and could use all the help I need.
How do you deal with things like pronouns and people putting you into a gender box? Currently at a place where I am the only “open” NB person and the ones who do know do not respect my pronouns and I’ve just started letting it slide because it’s so exhausting. I also do not like hearing the gender they think I am because of how I present. Some days it is fine but some days… 😮‍💨
I make the choice to take the good paying rather stable and easy job with great benefits over the possible comfort of being out completely elsewhere. It's a cost-benefit thing for me, and there's no way it's worth the trade right now. I use He/Him and They/Them and people don't call me Mr., So that's good enough for me. I'm also the only (perceived) man on staff except the custodial crew, so gender boxes rarely come up except for bathrooms (which I almost never use and prefer the men's anyway, because urinals are faster). I'm also far from masculine in my personality, so people probably assume I'm flamingly gay already anyway. They're not far off, so I just let them be wrong.
Thank you for sharing
You're welcome. It would take a lot to make risking my job worth it, and right now gender dysphoria doesn't outweigh that. One day it may, but today is not that day. I'm a firm believer in individual ""right"" answers, and I don't think answers are fixed or universal. The right answer for me may be different from the right answer for you, and next week's answer may be different from today's.
Right. I definitely agree with that sentiment. I weigh it daily and most days it’s fine. I enjoy the work I am doing but I am currently an intern and not being paid. Most likely why I am struggling more than if I was. I think mentally I could separate myself from my personal life where I am out and my work life where it doesn’t matter. Maybe that is something I can keep working at. Again, thanks for sharing! I always appreciate hearing other peoples point of views.
That’s a big reason I left: I couldn’t handle the deadnaming and misgendering anymore. The lack of respect for trans people got more consistent as the years went on (it’s a Catholic school). Didn’t help that one of my parents works there either so I’ve been getting a lot of shit for leaving and everyone trying to convince me to come back. It’s helpful to hear another person with a more rational perspective on this. Thank you
I work in a public school system. I chose about three and a half years in to at least get people to use the right name, and so far only one coworker has been agressively deadnaming or refusing to acknowledge me. She's always been horrible to me to begin with, so I don't worry about it."	vw2zmq	NonBinary	14	0.95	2022-07-10 22:33:09
Can we talk about safety? [cw - comments might discuss assault, discrimination etc.]	"So, I'm nonbinary, AMAB, bearded and like to wear dresses and skirts. Trouble is I don't *feel* particularly safe doing so in public, and I have no idea how well founded that fear actually is. With a beard and a feminine presentation I would be *obviously* gender non-conforming, in possibly the most transgressive way possible and I've just never seen other people doing that in public.

I'd really like to have an open discussion about safety and gender presentation, as it seems to be something we don't really talk about that much (for understandable reasons). It would make me feel more confident in how I present myself if I had some background in other peoples thoughts, feelings and experiences around this.

A few questions to start things off (answer any, all or none!):

* Where/when do you feel safe presenting in a gender-nonconforming way? Where/when do you feel unsafe?
* Have you ever experienced harassment/discrimination/assault because of the way you present?
* Do you take any specific safety precautions when presenting in a gender-nonconforming way?
* Do you ever deliberately try to ""pass"" as having a binary presentation?

I know this stuff is difficult to talk about, but to my mind it's a lot better to be open about it, where we can reassure/advise/comfort each other, than to have all of us living with our own private fears and doubts.

Thanks for any thoughts :)"	"I'll get things started - I live in a small town in the north of the UK. I just about feel safe enough to wear a skirt or dress in the centre of a large city, during the day, when I'm not alone (I think I'd also feel safe-ish in specifically queer areas at night, but I've never tried that). I'll usually have a change of clothes in my bag though, and will drive or change before I take public transport into/out of the city. I don't do it very often as I still feel quite on edge and that's exhausting.

Other than that I'll wear subtly feminine clothes with trousers/shorts most places, though often I'll just throw on masc clothing as dealing with a bit of dysphoria is sometimes easier than feeling I always have to be vigilant.

The places I feel safest are residential events with my (super accepting) church, I'll wear dresses and skirts the whole time at those, and it's wonderful.

I've never experienced physical violence, just some rude gestures (for having a flower in my hair), a few comments and sniggers and of course plenty of stares (I try to remember that staring can just as easily be ""they look great"" or ""that's unusual"" as anything negative).
I live in a small city in Ontario and honestly it doesn't matter what I wear, I get followed and harassed all of the time. Even being AFAB and wearing dresses doesn't curb this treatment - I get people following after me and yelling that I'm a ""man in a dress"", which is just so wild to me. The last time this happened I was with a group of friends coming back from an event downtown and they made sure I got home okay but even out of all my queer and trans buds I get a whole lotta shit from strangers. I think this is compounded because of my body type, so I've never felt safe on the street because of how people have treated me over the years. 

I think you having a backup plan like carrying extra clothes is really smart, just because there might be times you feel like going stealth for your peace of mind or safety and that's totally okay! I'm really glad you have a community that makes you feel safe. I think this is a really important conversation to have and that there are very real risks involved in looking a certain way, a lot of which we can't just get away from by changing clothes.
So, I am AMAB and live in Brazil, the country that kills the most transgender people, in a Texas-level prejudice region.

When i started wearing make-up and using more female-fitting clothes, like crop-tops and  
chokers (i don't like wearing skirts for some reason), i mainly just got stared at. Obviously, if I know I'm gonna go through some dangerpus region, i take off whatever I can and sprint.

Honestly, it depends on where you live, what makes you more confortable and if you mind being stared at or not.
I'm only just starting out with my exploration of presentation, and I'm nervous all the time about it. I'll be talking mostly about fears and anxieties here.

I'm AMAB and all my life, whenever I've thought about engaging with anything even remotely feminine there's been a little pang that's gone off in my head. Eventually I figured out the phrase that taps into that pang: ""Don't do it! If you do, they'll know!"" This fear is more triggered by how significant something is to me than anything else. I put off wearing turtlenecks for a long time, even though they're totally stealth (in the Archer way too, haha) for that exact reason.

I don't really feel safe presenting at all unless I'm around the few people I'm out to. I haven't been harassed or anything, because I'm not really out, but I know from past experience how narrow the band of presentation is in order to be acceptably masculine. The main thing I'm worried about is the judgement itself (#privilege), and right now my poor little heart can't take it.

Someday I'll be brave.

Just not today.
I’m nb (afab), so can’t specifically answer your questions with my own experience. 
However, from my observations of other genderqueer amab’s - being bearded seems to ‘help’ in this kind of situation as it’s clear to all (particularly prejudiced morons) that you are gender non-conforming - as opposed to (and please know these are not MY sentiments!) “thinking you pass as a woman”. 
I hope you find the strength and security to be (and express) your authentic self safely and with pride. 👊
- I feel safe presenting in a GNC way when I am in mental health or trans/GNC support groups.  I feel safe presenting at home with my SO.  I feel safe for some reason in certain stores like Ross and TJ Maxx 😁

- I haven’t experienced any issues thus far while presenting GNC but I haven’t been doing it for long and I expect that I will experience some form of harassment soon.  As someone DMAB with a full beard I am most concerned that I will be labeled as a cross dresser and that people will mistake my presentation for sexual behavior of some sort, and that this will lead to dangerous situations.

- As a precaution I would prefer to be with someone who could call for help and/or come to my aid of something bad happens.  I am trying to avoid presenting GNC in “common” areas such as supermarkets or other venues where I am afraid I will experience harassment for “exposing children to my _____” (insert misunderstanding of GNC/trans here)

- I have to pass as my designated gender in order to keep my career and not suffer from prejudice and unequal treatment.  I am a parent of a middle school aged child and while this hasn’t come up yet, I will have to present male when interacting with anyone related to her social life or school life.  This also brings with it a tremendous amount of uncertainty and worry that someone will see me presenting GNC outside of those specific contexts and that it will come to affect my daughter.

I live in a major metropolitan area in the US and so I don't feel like I need to be overly concerned with my physical safety.  I feel the danger to my livelihood and to my family's wellbeing most.

I know that my sibs in the transgender and queer communities have endured great hardships, and without their bravery I probably would not know the word 'non-binary'.

I feel a debt to them which can only be repaid with my own bravery.

I have an obligation to myself to at least try to live authentically.

Knowing these things, I am trying to figure out the ways in which I can present GNC without endangering myself or my family, and be brave.
I'm currently living in a village near Bridgwater in the South West of the UK. The problem here is that too many people know me. It's not that I feel unsafe, but I'd probably end up explaining myself a million times just to walk to the village shop.

I'm hoping to be able to move to Bristol however and that's a completely different scenario. It's a lot more accepting and I have been out late at night and felt fairly safe in well lit areas. I'll still avoid back streets, but tbh that's common city safety. If I get the job I'm hoping for then I plan to be out at work too.

For a while I was concerned about being able to pass someday, but I've realised over time that I don't need to do that to be happy.
I long for the time when self expression can truly be an expression of self - rather than that imposed / expected / accepted by others.
I feel mostly safe physically around where I live dressing in a gender non-conforming way, but I feel like it might easier for me at the moment because people perceive me as female still and I think that women have more leeway in what they can wear when it comes to being gender non-conforming. At school I feel pretty safe. People seem to respect my pronouns and everything. The times that I try to have a more binary representation are when I go places with big crowds like a concert (obviously not pride, there you can be gender non-conforming and be fine usually.) I just do it for my own safety because you never know who's gonna be there.
I wish I could give your post like 1k upvotes.
Always tough to hear about places where there is a lot of violence towards people in the GSM (gender and sexual minority for those unfamiliar).  Good luck.
I guess being bearded I would be a ""freakshow"" to those people and they might find that more palatable than a trans woman?  At least in the context of my professional life I feel like my being trans might be more understood if not more accepted.  I believe that the number of trans women who are in my field (computer science) is statistically greater than the number in other fields."	cj8xpa	NonBinary	14	0.95	2019-07-29 09:32:43
Anyone missing being seen as a woman or fluid, after taking T?	"So, is a**nyone missing being seen as a woman or fluid, after taking T?** I mean, even once in a while.

&#x200B;

I'm really just wondering more than being conflicted about. I'm pan, nonbinary man, and pre-T I'm mostly read as fluid, a butch or andro (if read as woman). I'm already very masc in shape and behaviour, I pass most of the times (as a boy, damn), so I think I'll end passing 99% quite soon.

Despite wanting to look more like a man, I rarely enjoy this genderfuck thing I am and I would keep it if I didn't have to alleviate my body disphoria to function.

Social disphoria is not an huge thing to me, but it definetly destroyed my mental health to be addressed as woman-only in the past. probably I'm wondering if I would feel alienated just be seen as another man. I'm one of those people who would like to be just trans, you know, not, binary this or that, but I doubt I'll do because safety is important."	"I have similar feelings but have decided the way I go about it is the more physically masculine I am if I want to present as more fluid or non-binary I can just wear more fem type things. You can still be seen as fluid while being more physically masculine. Im looking forward to that personally. There's a lot of things I don't do because they give me dysphoria feeling like I'm presenting more as a cis woman which I feel like I'd feel more comfortable doing after I've been on T for a bit.
I was worried about only being seen as male but I hated being seen as a woman so I didn't think it could get worse than that. If you are already being seen as male, you don't like being seen as female, and you have body dysphoria than it seems like T will be good for you? But obviously it's really depends on how you feel and only you can decide that. You can always go on a low dose and perhaps maintain a but of fluidity? Even on my more feminine days I don't regret being on t and never miss being seen as female. Hopefully some more gender fluid people can give you some more advice!
There's a sense of weirdness sometimes. Not because it's wrong, but because it feels like people aren't seeing all of me. It was like that when I was only ever read as a woman, too, but there was the physical disconnect on top of it. It was a rough adjustment socially but feeling present in my body makes a huge difference.
I saw someone considering taking T then stopping it for just the permanent effects
I have a ton of social dysphoric about being perceived and addressed as a woman, which is why I plan to stay on T for awhile. But as I start to get addressed as a man, I realize more and more how much I wish I could just be non-binary. I definitely don’t like being put into one of the binary boxes. 

All that said, sometimes I miss being a part of wlw culture; despite not wanting to be seen as a woman or woman-aligned, I do feel a queer connection to women. And it’s tricky to navigate all that

Im Nonbinary but feel like I cant come out due to people's hostility about it ever	"Im Agender,and I hide it. I dont really care about gender,I just like am completely indifferent to my own and if asked would describe my gender as ""I dont give a fuck,who fuckin cares"",but Agender is in general,shorter to say. I guess I have no real need to be out. Im AFAB,present Feminine and use She pronouns. Everyone just thinks I am Cis. 

But sometimes,I wish I could be open about it. I feel like I cant because hostility towards trans people seems to be increasing and I dont want that my way so I just keep it to myself. I am frustrated and angry about this,but I know my safety and mental health is important,I want to be able to be myself and feel I never will be able to do that and it makes me sad."

I haven't come out to anyone in my family because of some enbyphobic comments they made a while back and idk if I can trust them with it. However if you do have people close to you that you know will be supportive, reach out to them. Letting that part of myself out has been a huge weight off my chest (mostly just for giving people a reason to not be surprised when I start wearing clothes intended for all genders) and I hope you can come out safely in the future too.
I love Karamo Brown's take on the whole coming out concept. He prefers phrasing it as letting people in, instead, because that framing takes some of the power of rejection away from other people. You get to set boundaries around who you let into your life. I've let my partner, children, therapist, and doctor in over the last 18 months or so. That may be it for me, it may not be depending on how safe I feel. It may be more critical for someone with dysphoria, but it sounds like letting people in might work for you?"	ztbr3y	NonBinary	15	0.95	2022-12-23 10:06:14
I think I'm... genderfluid? does it matter? is this even... right? real? please help me	"I've grown up knowing that I didn't like being a female. growing up, I secretly gave myself a new name, a male name, and I spent nights imagining myself as the male I wanted to be, treasuring that male name like a pearl in the safety of my mind. but now I'm almost 30, and I have evolved further... some days I feel like taking full advantage of my femininity, and I wear make up, and dresses and heels: other times, I feel male, so male that I think about myself in my masculine name and I curse god for not having a beard. I have a very stark mental image of my male counterpart. 

this is the first time I dare to let it all go like this. I've talked a little bit with my boyfriend, but it doesn't seem like he understands the depth of the... torment? maybe that's too strong of a word... let's say of the insecurity I find myself in. I don't know  I feel so conflicted- everyone around me seems like they know exactly who they are, so sure in their identity, so perfectly fine with how their body looks like and not swinging between loving it one day and hating it to guts the following one. 

a dear friend suggested this reddit to me, and it looks like here you all are similar to me. please, please tell me what is going on in my mind! I feel split in two and I don't know how to put the two halves together. I know that this is all over the place, but please, help me."	"Have you heard about drag kinging?

I've been out for almost a decade. My parents still aren't accepting	"Was quite aggressively misgendered on my birthday card and it finally clicked to me that, despite all my hoping and retries of my coming out (I think I'm on try 7 of a formal coming out), it's not going to get better with them.

"""Cis Passing"""	"Hi, afab bi enby here. Does anybody else get really, extremely angry at being referred to as cis/straight passing? I was remembering a time some years ago when a friend called me straight-passing and I just remember it cutting me to the core for reasons I wasn't sure of. Even now, I haaaaaaaate the idea of passing as a cis woman, but I'm also closeted to my family and at work (partly for safety reasons and partly because I just...don't have the energy to correct people and I struggle with inconveniencing people). I've just been so pissed off today about it and I don't know what to do.

Edit: Almost forgot to mention, I know that passing as cis provides an advantage as far as personal safety is concerned, but to call it a privilege necessarily feels invalidating to my lived experiences as a trans person. I.E: it feels like I'm being forced back into the closet I keep trying to escape from."	"Well for a start being perceived as your AGAB is like... The opposite of passing. Secondly passing as a nonbinary person like... Kinda doesn't exist. There's no way to pass as nonbinary because there isn't a set gender role for nonbinary and society as a whole generally doesn't recognize nonbinary as a thing, there are no cis nonbinary people to pass AS nor any cis passing privilege to be gained by being consistently perceived as nonbinary because that also means consistently being seen as trans and/or gnc which opens one up to discrimination. Like the most many of us can hope for is confusion, which again doesn't necessarily offer any safety nor certainty that we will be gendered correctly consistently. If a nonbinary person wants to pass or go stealth as a binary gender, then passing as a concept may be applicable. But otherwise it honestly doesn't map well onto nonbinary experiences. And tbh not to loop back around but I'm still absolutely FLOORED that someone referred to being solely seen as your AGAB as _passing_. That's not fucking passing that is the opposite of passing. That's being misgendered and/or closeted. Closeted people aren't fucking privileged for being closeted. Having your identity actively erased or invalidated or having to hide who you are and never getting referred to correctly is not a privolege. You have every reason to be pissed about that.
I don't really get mad about it, but I definitely think it's stupid. What does ""cis"" even look like? If a cis man dressed effeminately would you be calling them ""trans passing?""
Cis passing it's about the physical body mostly, not how you present.
You're right, ty for the correction."	tvp5ut	NonBinary	14	1.0	2022-04-04 01:03:47
I feel so damn wrong...	"I'm amab, enby, and sorta, well maybe fluid is more apt but the crux of shit is that I feel like presenting as cis male is a 'lie' and presenting femme is a 'fraud'. 

I'm huge, hairy, and I mean, I can drift into chunky andro territory but, like, today I had a major site meeting, hosting a dozen contractors for a bid kick-off and I just put it all away and presented completely male. Button up, jeans, safety boots, at best I got a ponytail happening but that ain't exactly screaming 'wooo femme'. For this job I've got 30 guys in a room, total sausage party, and I just couldn't. I had to hide, and it makes me feel like I'm living a complete lie. This is happening more and more when I drop into boymode. IT's either I'm terrified or I'm exhausted, like when I had the flu I just couldn't put any effort into the upkeep required to knock back the masc (shave, tuck, wear anything but t-shirt and sweatpants). 

I manage to bring some femme into my daily life, I am on HRT, I am growing teh boobs, I have long hair and want it longer, I tuck and generally am in jeggings, yoga pants or the like. 

But, a line I cross where I feel, frankly, like a fraud. That I'm not really trans, that I'm just a sorta life-crippled pretender, because frankly I'll never pass. I love dresses, I love skirts, I wish to god my shoulders weren't so broad (and hairy) so I could feel comfy with off-the-shoulder stuff. 

Still, even with decent makeup and a denim dress and as much femme as I can pump into my plump-bodied gender-addled frame I still feel like I'm totally fucking full of shit because I'm not doing electro (can't really afford it right now) and I'm not probably ever going to make it into a 'full' transition. I'm not even sure it's possible at my age (42, I'm that weird old enby). 

Pardon the rambling, pardon the bullshit, I just, I talked about this with my pshrink today but it's still a thorn in my side. I don't know if I'm more torn up about not being able to pass, or that the world isn't really open to enbies who just fuckin' well publicly fail at gender. 

It doesn't help that fear leads to hiding, and then shame and guilt for not having more gumption, and then just straight damn sadness because this is all so freakin' hard. I try to follow my heart, but shit is fucked yo."	"My experience has been, and ive said this in another post, is celebrating myself. You should do the exact same thing. 

Celebrate yourself. 

I dont know that focusing on passing helps. I know it would frustrate me (because I wont ever pass, too much balding). 

Focus on acceptance and expression instead. Fact of the matter is , the only opinion about how you look that matters....is your own.

I have to boy mode myself during the day, but at night at home, its 100% girl mode all the way. But unlike you I am not a transition candidate nor will I be. And my partner, who is supportive of my journey, is behind me 100%. 

For me it is when I look in the mirror (and this took a long time for me to accept and embrace) I see a beautiful woman. No matter how Im dressed or what I look like. It is entirely a mental thing, and the physical stuff will take a hold later and work itself out. Whatever that means. Like you I love feminine clothing (Torrid loves me Im sure), and I love how it  makes me feel.  And I think that Im a gorgeous woman no matter what happens. 

We all have your back here. Hugs.
I'm afab and in an all female work environment, and my experience has been similar. It's super frustrating and invalidating to be stuck in a place that can feel so invisible. Some days it seems like no matter how hard I try, the people around me will always only see me as a woman, will never stop treating me like a girly girl despite everything I do to avoid being gendered, which can be discouraging because it can sometimes feel like there isn't a place in the world for nonbinary people. But finding more queer people to interact with outside of work has been helpful for me, and society's understanding of nb folks expands every day. It's never too late to be yourself, whether that's at work or outside of work. I get the thing about feeling like a pretender. Sometimes it can feel like living a double life, even if you're not actually pretending but just playing it safe- I actually had a nightmare a few days ago about a colleague finding out I'm nb. My point is, though, you're not alone in any of this, and we and the rest of the community are here to support you in any way we can. Keep on fighting, my friend. It's worth it.
> I dont know that focusing on passing helps. I know it would frustrate me (because I wont ever pass, too much balding).
>

This is one of the things that helped me so much. When I started transition it was as a trans woman, and there's pretty much always been a TON of pressure placed on passing. For years, I did what society said I needed to do in order to 'pass' as a woman, even though it didn't feel like me. It became another mask I hid behind, just like boy-mode before it, because when I didn't go through that, the world realized I was trans.

When I realized I'm nonbinary and stopped caring about passing, I felt a lot better. There's still shitty unaccepting people, there's still people who assume I'm a cis woman, but I'm actually happy with what I see when I look in the mirror, and I have friends and family that are happy for me. I realized I didn't so much mind people knowing I'm trans, what I minded was the treatment that usually came with it.

Finally I can look in the mirror and be happy with myself, because I'm just being myself.

Non Binary school project (I’m super scared)	Hi all! I’m in high school, and I’m doing a presentation on being non binary. It’s a general introduction, and I want it to be the best it can be. I’m including information on definitions of non binary and sub categories (I don’t know if that’s the right word). Statistics on the safety and quality of life for nb people (misgendering, legal rights, mental health etc). Pronouns and grammar. And nb portrays in media.  I’m super scared cause it’s a normal high school class and there are bound to be some a-holes. But I’m also excited. I could use any support/advice/ideas for information to include.  Thanks and love you all!	"I would make sure to mention that there is no single definition of nonbinary that fits everyone. That is something I often see articles get wrong. I am sure you will do great though! Good luck!
Go check out the ""gay b C's of lgbt+"" from ash hardell. It's a free e-book that has tons of amazing info on stuff
Thank you! I don’t by any stretch of the imagination speak for all nb people, and I’ll try and make sure they hear that."	buacbv	NonBinary	13	1.0	2019-05-29 04:40:27

passport help “x marker”	"hi i need some help and safety tips here please. 

i’m agender and have the option to put “x” down on my passport as i’m traveling to mexico in a few months but for the sake of safety and the possibility of denied entry would this be advised ? 

i would love nothing more than to check the “x” box and have it on my passport but i have researched and researched and i cannot find mexico on a list of countries that recognizes the “x marker” and i’m worried about being targeted by TSA because of this. 

is there a chance i would be denied entry ? or be thrown through multiple loophole’s ?

any help or information is welcome thank you tons in advance."	"As of today, TSA has been instructed that a mismatch between gender markers on documents should not be considered when determing if someone is allowed to fly.

Also, as long as you stay in Mexico as a tourist for less than 180 days, you don't need a visa. You just need a passport book with space for stamps.

The USA is now one of 16 countries where third genders on passports are recognized, so if you are very anxious you could try to visit those countries on future trips.

There is no way to tell you that your travel will be totally without difficulty. However, whenever I have travelled using my passport they never look to hard at the details; just my face and that the passport is valid and stamp able. Getting a student visa requires lots of documents, but being a tourist doesn't.

Please report back if you do travel with an X passport! I really want to change mine.
I wouldn't recommend it just even within America. A bunch of states are openly trying to re-criminalize our existence. Not a great idea to tell the government that you're trans.
i went ahead and decided to not put an x just for my own safety, until there’s more of an awareness.
thank you for ur help !

i appreciate it and for my own safety i’m going to follow it."	u1ie1o	NonBinary	12	1.0	2022-04-11 21:38:59

Came out and it didn't go well	"

TW: Homophobia, ableism


I decided to rip the bandaid off and come out to my mom as Non-binary. I've been out as a bisexual for 15+ years, and when I originally came out she dismissed it as a phase and ignored the blatant homophobic attacks I faced as ""that's just what teenage girls do"" and ""it's all for attention"" so I will admit, my hopes weren't high.


I should note that she is a medical professional who is living in a backwater small town and has no friends, no support network outside of me, no hobbies and no life outside of drinking a bottle of wine most days. I feel for her, I know she's in a toxic place right now mentally and has very little exposure to things outside of her bubble. She has a lot of her own problems and I'm not willing to take them on for my own health and safety. 


But I wasn't prepared for just how low I should have set my standards. She didn't know what Non-binary was, so when I explained she reacted like ""Do you're coming out as a person?"" then went on a really long rant about the following points:


- back in her day people didn't need all these fancy labels


- it's ridiculous to label yourself because that means you've put yourself in a box that you can't change


- You aren't going to become one of those people who's only point of identity is the fact they're gay are you?


- (in response to me explaining that I was out at work and how I react to accidental misgendering) You just need to get over it, the world is how it is and you can't change that fact


- 'Everyone feels this way, you just want to feel special by labelling it' (Mom has stated she's ace before and I told her how much I supported that, then she's telling me she feels the enby things I do but it doesn't matter to her because labels are stupid and confining)


- not only are labels stupid, it's just like these aspbergers people who honestly just need a kick in the pants, but instead they get all this ridiculous special treatment and money from the government (her words, and this was particularly upsetting as my partner is autistic which she is aware of, dunno what the govt benefits thing is about because unless you are eligible for a disability package you don't really get any special treatment outside of the protected disability laws)


- pronouns are ridiculous and expecting people to use a 'plural' pronoun (I'm they/them) is grammatically incorrect and I'm just using it as a reason to attack people for getting it wrong (I don't? And it isn't?)


So basically invalidating everything I've been struggling with and all the journeys of other LGBTQ+ people, with a topping of ableism towards autistic people as a little bonus.


I am angry, disappointed and I just feel like nothing I do matters with her. I'm the only (and first) enby in my entire organisation, I'm well aware that every step I take is going to help those who come after me. That means standing up for my pronouns, making sure people are respectful and using every moment to educate and advocate. Just like the suffragette movement, change doesn't happen overnight. It's the little tiny steps that someone takes under the spotlight that build up over time. If that means I have to be 'all about lgbt' in the workplace then so be it, if it means that visibility is used to advocate for better equality.


I guess I'm just looking for validation and support that I'm okay to be me? I don't know. I know I'm hurting a lot more than I expected to be."	"It sounds like she's super uneducated about this. And that's not your fault. It also sounds like she's very much about herself and is not valuing your feelings. I'm sorry for that and I can relate to that. However, her lack of education and inconsideration absolutely does not invalidate you and who you are. You're you and the labels are important because they help to put some meaning to who you are and really because they mean something to you. Don't let her take this away from you. Be proud of you and love you.
I'm sorry that she's like that.  You deserve better than to not have your identity seriously.
Well I have been in similar situations, like having a school who is full of a bunch of TRANSPHOBIC AND HOMOPHOBIC A-HOLES!!!
We can both stay strong, ok?
As an autistic non-binary person, *wow*. People really don’t get it, do they? Just because we don’t fit in to how people think the “perfect” world should be, they come up with BS like this to invalidate us. I’m getting really sick of it. Why can’t we all just be people?

I’m sorry you have to deal with this. I hope that someday she’ll be more understanding and educated on the topic."	qo18of	NonBinary	12	1.0	2021-11-06 14:21:20
Trans masc afab terrified of mens bathroom	I just started testosterone and my voice has already started dropping and I now have facial hair (I had hormone problems to begin with so it is happening faster). I am totally uncomfortable with using the mens restroom and would continue using the women's restroom forever if I could. I would like to eventually basically look like a guy. I feel like I will upset women if I keep using the women's bathroom. I also want to be able to wear women's clothes and I also tend to socially act more female and I am so so worried about using the mens restroom. I have started considering dropping wearing feminine clothes so I don't risk my safety because of this. Has anyone else dealt with this and what did they end up doing?	"Do you have a friend you trust who can go with you?
I’m in a similar boat. Transmasculine, I pass sometimes, but I wear men’s clothes and I do want to pass. I genuinely hold it and do everything I can to not have to go in public lol. I do think in the men’s bathroom they tend to mind their business more and they kinda look down or straight ahead and just do their thing so it’s easier to get by, but to be fair I do not wear feminine clothing. You may just have to pick which one you go in based on vibes each time. Pray for it to be the single room type, those are the best lol, or use the “family” one if they have them. Some places have specific gender neutral ones nowadays. And like the other person said, taking a friend with you is a flawless plan, no matter which one you go in, having backup is your best bet. I have gone in both that way. Tbh the womens is always cleaner and better smelling and of course has way more stalls so I much prefer it haha
My advice is dress masc like you're intending and use the stalls if you're afraid. I understand the fear but I guarantee you'll be fine as long as you just make your way straight to the stalls.
Sometimes but I have bladder problems so I definitely won't have someone with me every time I use the restroom unfortunately
Well sure, but maybe if you bring a friend with you when you can, it may become less scary and you'll be able to go on your own.
That makes sense I will try that once I start to pass as man more casually in public"	uh1xgj	NonBinary	10	0.92	2022-05-02 22:49:46
"Probably a stupid question, but for people who were ""straight"" according to their AGAB, how have you managed the change/ giving up the privilege of having more options? And what is dating like as a nonbinary person?"	"As I said, this has probably been asked a million times so sorry if I'm annoying everyone (I do not mean for this to sound in any way offensive) but it's definitely one of the things holding me back. I've never felt like a woman and I don't *want* to be a woman, I want my egg to crack for good because now I feel like I'm holding on to the eggshells for safety. But the truth is that I'm into men (and masc-leaning enbies, but while there is some flexibility my attraction is definitely towards the masc end of the spectrum). I feel like most enbies are pan and I'm wrong to be this way. 

I can't say I've ever been a big fan of romance, and I've been comfortably single for most of my life, but I can't help but feel like by accepting that I'm not a woman I'm making the option of experiencing that impossible. It's not just because I wouldn't be a woman, but if I wouldn't be a man either, then who could really like me the way I am? I know this is probably stupid, but I figured I'd ask people who have more experience with this. Thanks for reading this!"	"I didn't identify as straight prior to coming out, so I cant help with that.

I came to terms with my sexuality way before my egg cracked, but I found that it was more difficult to integrate queerness into my personal self-concept than it was to actually accept that I was into women.

The feelings were acceptable, basically, but it was the word Lesbian that tripped me up. (I'm not a lesbian, but I thought I was at the time).

I've never attempted to date straight people tbh. My dating pool is mostly queer people, who are often already familiar with enbies and don't need a sensitivity training on our first date (my current girlfriend dated two other enbies before me). Before that, I dated a lesbian for whom I was an ""exception"" to her usual attraction to women.
I’m in the same boat in terms of agab and  physical attraction to masculine people and men. Kinda sucks tbh... no idea how I’ll go about the whole dating thing 😅 but one step at a time...
I'm AFAB and I've considered myself bi/pan for a long time. While I've been mainly attracted to other androgenous people or women, most of the people I've actually ended up dating have been men. I've been lucky that the people who've I've been with have very accepting and welcoming of gender and subsequent changes (like my name). I would very much suggest being  with someone that is very openly respectful of your gender from the start. If you are concerned about how cis men in particular will treat you (which is reasonable, we don't all live in very liberal spaces where it's expected or the norm) I think looking for masculine enbys or trans men might help you as they understand the struggle with complex gender identies. Hope this helps :)
Well, it will limit your options a lot, I won't lie. But there's still lots of options. Pretty much every bi or pan person is willing to date an enby regardless of their agab. As for my experience, it's pretty limited, my first boyfriend is the only person I've dated and we've been together since.
True, I should stop trying to project so much into the future...and hey, sorry you have to go through this too, we'll make it one way or another! 😊
That's fair, thanks!
We will!! Being myself is enough for now - I hope you feel that too!"	ffgwet	NonBinary	12	1.0	2020-03-08 18:43:50

Binders	"I’ve been thinking about getting a binder for awhile now, and though I’m full of complicated feelings about it (read as: shame and guilt for wanting it) I’ve decided it’s it my best emotional al interest to look into this more. 

So, do you have advice on brands, sizing recommendations/suggestions for someone who has never measured themselves,potential emotional pitfalls upon putting it on, tips or tricks for safety and cleanliness and anti-chafing or something you wish someone had told you but didn’t? 

Thank you. Much love y’all."	"Gc2b is a good company, and their binders are pretty affordable, comparatively. 
I’m still super new, so I don’t have much input for the rest. Definitely measure yourself so you get the right size, and remind yourself that there’s no shame in feeling what you feel. There are enough people in the same boat that *multiple companies* are producing binders and staying in business. You’re not alone, or even that weird
i second GC2B. Pretty easy to get on. Easy to peel off. Durable material. The first binder I ever got was from China and it was mega small and cut into my sides because it had three elastic bands on the side. Ow. 

Edit: much like a corset, it may restrict the moment of your rib cage a little. This can be a little scary or anxiety inducing at first. Even when I bind now, sometimes the first 20 minutes or so I have a bit of anxiety and feel like I can't breathe. I totally can. I remind myself that I am breathing just fine and that I can take it off at any time.

I was annoyed when I saw that it asked for ""gender"" rather than ""sex,"" even though they both suck, because when I get asked for ""sex"" I just write down my AGAB and keep gender to myself. However, I was super excited to see that a new option has been added: ""other."" 

At first I felt amazing and selected it immediately, but then I realized... It won't even be valid in some countries. Doing a little research, I found out that some countries might even ask for ""confirmation"" of gender status, which sounds HORRIBLE. I've been treated like garbage at airports for years and I was pumped to now have easy trips with my first world passport... If I select my AGAB I feel like I'm a lying coward, but I have anxiety and need to think about my safety when I travel, especially since some family I have live in a Middle Eastern country. 

That's it, just wanted to vent. What would you do? Bureaucracy sucks!! Why do they even need to know our sex, let alone gender?! I hate this world sometimes."	"Do what you gotta do to feel safe. You don’t owe anyone the truth about your experience of yourself. If they’re gonna be a dick about it, you are 100% in your rights to play secret agent with your disguise and your “false identity” paperwork. Thats gotten me through more than one family event.
Since you have legitimate safety concerns, it might be possible (through a special process) to apply for two passports. I don't know what the laws of your country are, but in some places you can get a second one if you can prove that your main passport would create problems in a country you're trying to enter. E.g. some countries deny entry if you have a have a visa or stamp from a certain other country in your passport. Similar considerations might apply with regards to a gender marker that does not align to AGAB/physical sex characteristics.
I feel the same.....someday maybe I will get a passport that lists my actual gender. But for now, it's safer not to
Paperwork doesn’t matter or define you. Do what makes you safest!
Thank you so much, for real. It's so shitty to have to put yourself into boxes all the time, your comment made me feel better! I'm totally gonna think about ""secret agent"" <3"	xa2tza	NonBinary	11	1.0	2022-09-09 18:29:21
Work place ettiquite and being validated and respected.	"So a mad. They/them, genderqueer/nonbinary mostly just try for androgenous. I present masculine out of safety but have a lot of more femine habits. I cary a neutral tote bag or purse some times. My fashion sense is more androgynous. My voice is higher. Even my posture and how I move which I've worked on is more femine then masculine most days. 

I started a new job at a Bar as a chef/kitchen manager and it is very different from my previous job which address me by neutral pronouns and most people my chosen name over my ""dead"" name. 

The new place they do call my by my dead name and don't know how to address that without it seeming like a joke. A lot of my friends so understand the name thing but with work it's tricky cause I haven't legally changed my name so it's still on my ID and all my cards. I don't know how to bring it up without it being odd as it was just casually accepted at my old job.

The second is pronouns. My co-workers refer to me by default in the masculine and it bugs me a lot. I trained with someone from South Africa who claimed to not understand me when I explained I don't like gendered pronouns when referring to me. He went so far as to excuse himself when it came to calling me man and sir because they are respectful when they say them. I feel like they use them for me only because I present masculine at work.

I don't know how to address  these without seeming like I am being a whiny malenial or entitled when it's a big deal to me and a very small accomodation.

What should I do?"	"I suggest to say that your current name is a nickname and you strongly prefer it rather than your other name. Maybe say how all your friends and family call you by your name and the other name is very foreign to you. And with pronouns it takes sadly a lot of emotional labor to tell your coworkers and your boss about your pronouns. Some of them don’t necessarily know what that means and might ask you to educate them. If you have the emotional capacity to do that by all means do it. Also constantly correcting them will be a thing, so it takes patience as well and some days you might be impatient. 
With regards to names, I would start by cheerfully correcting people, especially if it's a habitual mistake. ""Oh, and I go by [name]!"" Hopefully some people just don't know, or are forgetting. If there are publicly viewable things that have your legal name on them (like a schedule that's posted on the wall), you could ask your manager if it'd be possible to list your preferred name.

With pronouns, I think it really depends on how comfortable you are correcting people and how supportive your manager is. I'm getting the impression that your coworkers are aware that you're non-binary but are defaulting to masculine pronouns--have you told them that you prefer something else? If you're already out at work but haven't been explicit about what pronouns you use, you could try gently correcting people, or asking your manager for guidance. If you feel like people are misgendering you on purpose or out of laziness, you'll have to consider if you feel comfortable talking to your boss about it. It'd also be a good idea to look at whether your workplace has an anti-discrimination policy that includes gender identity/expression (or if this type of discrimination is illegal where you live).
I’m new to embracing my enbieness  and not IRL out, but would a more gender neutral nickname derived from your dead name or some characteristic of yourself be a possible first step? In new school classes and new people at work asked for any nicknames I prefer even though I am publicly cis male. 
Robert > Bobby
James > Jaime 
Christopher > Chris
Soooo...who gives a shit? Tell them the name you want to be called. As far as referring to you as he or she you just need to get over it. In general I call people guys as in a large group of people. Normal people don't get offended, it's just a part of life. Would you prefer if people referred to you as person? guy/gal is a description...

if you were involved in a crime they would refer to you as the ""man"" who committed the crime...because you fit the description of a man more than a woman...

why be so worried about such a basic concept. If you don't identify as a man or woman that's fine but don't be upset when people don't automatically understand your personal views since you've never told them...

so yeah...you sound like a whiny millennial...it's really not that big of a deal...grow up...

the world doesn't care how you feel...

I’m not sure if you are trans or not but pronouns are really important to a lot of trans people. Maybe you might go through life like that but other ppl don’t. I know that when I go through misgendering it sucks because it doesn’t matter whether you wear a binder or have short hair. People don’t validate you. Along with lack of knowledge and understanding. Constantly educating people is annoying.
So I'm sorry I caught you on a bad evening when you apparently didn't beat you PR or whatever interest you from a glance. You just seem like someone who's a little too dense to get the nuances of human identity I never said I cried or whined. I'm aware of how I could be coming off as a whiny malenial or something. It's a big deal to me how I am address especially as someone in a leadership position. Sorry you are having a bad day butter Cup. My day is fucking great because I at least have wonderful people in this community to be supportive especially when insecure trolls like you feel hungry for attention.


Have a goodnight darlin' 
im not trying to come off as a troll i guess i just dont see what the big deal is. especially if you've never told people how you prefer to be addressed.
This whole thread is asking for advice how to address it. Not complaining that their coworkers aren't mind readers
2 options...

option 1: speak up

option 2: stop worrying about it
Yeah ""speak up"" isn't very specific. "	7pdu9g	NonBinary	11	1.0	2018-01-10 06:43:03
Often Unbothered by Misgendering?	"Hey all, I'm Non-Binary, AMAB, use they/them pronouns. I've been super aware of the code switching that goes on mentally when I go between queer spaces, cis gay male spaces, public spaces, medical practices, etc, and have found that I only really find misgendering upsetting when in the context of medical providers and my workplace...my family, friends, etc., almost never bother me when they mess up, to the point that I usually don't correct them.

Is this relatable? I first thought it was me just not thinking correcting would be worth the time, but that's definitely not the situation, and now I feel like it's a weird safety thing. But when hooking up or going on dates, I rarely disclose my gender immediately, or when I do, I don't emphasize pronouns etc until later. 

I ask because part of me feels wishy-washy and imposter-y for not feeling a sense of dysphoria around this, but part of me also thinks that ironically the spaces where I'm okay occasionally being misgendered are the spaces where people around me are least likely to think of me as cis male."	"I’m the same way. I generally only correct people  if they’re possibly unaware of my pronouns and only get upset if it’s on-going or seems intentional. 

My friends and family are all trying and even i fuck up my pronouns so I’m very understanding. I know they see me as ME first, and that’s usually enough for me. 

And I generally don’t announce my pronouns (outside of queer spaces) unless it’s someone I will have a continuing relationship with. Not, like, a stranger chatting with me at a party. I think it’s a safety and privacy thing. 

It certainly doesn’t make you an imposter: you’re allowed to decide when and what you are comfortable sharing and with whom.
I'm the same way, I'll tell you once, but after that I'm apathetic. I have this feeling of ""not wanting to come across like the conservative image of a SJW"", where I feel safer just not letting it bother me
ultimately people feel dysphoria about a zillion things in a zillion combinations, and what could be super distressing for one person could be literally not a worry to someone else who is just as equally trans (as every trans person is). all that is to say that whatever things you do and don't feel dysphoria about, it's completely fine and completely normal. i know especially online there's such a pressure to have the ""right"" types of dysphoria and be the cookie cutter trans person, but that's not real life. you're ok and so so normal.
i'm dmab and i feel this! but i have it the opposite way: i'm pretty unbothered by misgendering from people that i don't have a personal relationship with (some classmates, most coworkers, random grocery store employees, medical professionals who are not therapists etc). however, when it comes to my family and friends,  i very firmly enforce the use of they/them pronouns and gender neutral language to refer to me. it's also a safety thing for me, which now that i'm saying it makes me realize that i'm not technically fully out, but i absolutely don't hide my presentation or true self. it just got super tiring having to fight for my identity nonstop all day, so i picked my battles. i thought it was really cool to read about your pronoun experience because it's so different from mine! :) gender is complicated and nobody experiences it the same way, so you can feel validated knowing that the way you experience it is totally normal in that respect!
I’m an NB afab she/them who presents a combination of fem/androgynous depending on what I feel like. Perhaps because I’m cool with either pronoun set, or maybe that I’m not keen to add to other people’s cognitive load, I literally don’t care. To me it feels similar to when people mispronounce my name - I hardly even notice. Does that make me less NB though? Nah, it’s just one aspect of my NB identity.
Been having a lot of inner turmoil about this as of late and this was pretty reassuring so ty, it’s been hard for me to accept that I could be nonbinary and not have all the exact same dysphoric feelings as others I know. I hate that I feel like I have to kind of “prove something” before I could truly accept my identity, that’s definitely all due to not trusting myself after years of trauma my family have put me thru lol love starting from square one in the self assurance department per usual 😝"	pmynwy	NonBinary	11	0.93	2021-09-12 18:53:54
Queer Identity in Public vs. In Private	"I’m not sure why, but I have two settings when it comes to being queer. I have one where I either go stealth and pretend to be cishet or will tell people (if it’s safe) that I’m a “bisexual trans man”. But then I also have my private setting where I admit all the intricate details about my queerness.

Like if I had to list all the labels out, it would probably become a very extensive list (nonbinary, genderfluid, transmasc, queer, masculine woman, feminine boy, etc etc etc)

It’s so hard to describe myself in a concise way.

Like with gender;

One way I like to use to describe it is “I want strangers to look at me and think I’m a man, but I want the people close to me to know I’m not”

It’s so strange to try to explain to my trans guy friends why I’m not upset over being called a girl or having people use she/her for me— while I admit, there are some days where I don’t like it, but I typically don’t care.

My gender can vary from masculine male to androgynous male to masculine female to androgynous female to masculine nonbinary to androgynous nonbinary to Boy to Queer Person to No Gender to Very Gender But I Don’t Know What— and often times it’s different every day, and sometimes will change throughout the day (I started this morning feeling very Boy, and I am now sitting in my room feeling very Void).

For example, with my partners, I really don’t care. Often times, my only request is that they respect my identity that day. I’m thinking about putting a colored bracelet or safety pin system in place so they know what pronouns to use without directly having me walking around in public with pronoun pins on, but other than that, it’s free range. I often really enjoy having partners fuck around when talking about me, saying things like “he’s my girlfriend” or “she’s my boyfriend”. Of course, I have some days where I feel Very Gender and want things to be a specific way, but there’s other times when I really couldn’t give a fuck.

Don’t get me started on my sexuality;

It’s gotten to the point where I have to double-adjective it for it to make sense to people— Like I have to break it down into groups like it’s a fucking alignment chart:

Masculine masc, masculine androgynous, masculine fem

Androgynous masc, true androgynous, androgynous fem

Feminine masc, feminine androgynous, feminine fem

Like— I don’t like any masculine masc or feminine fem people. I like all other ”groupings” regardless of gender. I would say I’m primarily t4t— but I would date a queer cis woman or a queer cis man, but I would be less likely to date a cis man— It’s so hard and complex to explain in an easy way, and all it really boils down to is;

”I like other gnc or semi-gnc queer people”

So most times, I just say I’m queer.

I'm a recluse too. I live in the country with some family friends, I don't have my license or a car, so I don't get out much. There's an lgbt support group near me that I'd like to go to but it hasn't met in several months because of administration changes, so I have to wait on that. But I'm planning to start taking trips to the library and get my hair cut this weekend. It's a small step but a step in the right direction.

Experiences as masc-presenting NB?	"So, most of my life I've had a complicated relationship with my gender. I tried transitioning from ftm when I was 20. I felt really uncomfortable with the pressure to be more masculine than I am, and ended up transitioning back to female. I spent a few more years ignoring the confusion and just trying to get by in life, and not really thinking about why I felt so deeply annoyed with being perceived as female all the time. Now, after returning to school and meeting a whole bunch of young adults who have all these wonderful new words to describe gender, I feel like I'm starting to be a lot more honest with myself and my own gender. With that comes a lot of that old dysphoria I'd learned to shove deep into the closet again. 

But I'm also not a guy. I learned that already. I'm a person who should have a beard, a deep voice, and a ballin makeup game, but doesn't. 

I still fluctuate between masc and femme. But I've been wanting more and more to go on T, I have a queer doctor now who would happily make that happen if I talked to her about it, and I'm very conflicted. While I know I'd feel happy if the entire world was a Queer Island and I could go anywhere being my sparkly, bearded self, I'm terrified of the reality of violence against trans women and feminine men, and I know from experience it is safer in some ways to be a masculine-presenting woman than it is to be a feminine-presenting man; it is somewhat safer to be a trans man than a trans woman; and I'm familiar with the territory of safety I have as the body I currently own. Going on T will mean that while my own identity has not shifted, the way the world sees me will shift and I do not know that territory. 

So. Perspectives? Does anyone who operates as a masculine-perceived person with noticeable feminine qualities have any insight, positive or negative experiences, advice, etc. you are willing and able to share? 

Much appreciated and much love,

Dawson"	"I'm in a very similar position as you - thinking I want T, but not being super masc, and sometimes wanting to rock a more femme presentation but being afraid of what that might bring if people read me as AMAB. So yeah, sorry I don't have advice, but you're absolutely not alone! The struggle is real.
Im 21. I transitioned FtM when I was 15, started T at 16. I am grateful for the transition, as I know 100% I am not a woman. However, I am not fully a man either. I am someone who should have a beard with flowers and jewelry, a ballin makeup game, wears leggings but doesnt wear skirts and dresses. I fluctuate as well. 

However. I also recognize femininity is not widely accepted for male passing folks. I haven't recieved a while lot of flack, but I live in the midwest, which is a much better  than some other places. When I did receive that discrimination, I tried my best to educate. It sucks, but someone has to be willing to make it better for the trans kids coming. 

I might suggest moving if you are afraid for your safety if presenting is a need. Its about weighing those needs, unfortunately. 
I think youre placing too much regard to how you pass. If folks only see 2 genders, then yes, youll be seen as one of them. I am like your roommate and dont see anything as inherently gendeted and just do what feels right. You could try focusing on how specific items make you feel and navigating that way through the gray areas. 
and if you ever wanna chat more about it, definitely feel free to hit up my DM! it can be so hard to be ""okay"" with this identity when most of society isn't/doesn't understand it... and sometimes feeling unable to talk about it even within LGBTQ spaces
Thanks for your insight! I'm glad to hear you don't get bothered too much about it. Regarding location, I'm probably located in the best place to do this in my country (Canada). I live in Toronto, there's a pretty diversified LGBTQ+ community. I guess I'm just nervous about it because it would involve new forms of discrimination and interactions that I'm not used to. My roommate is someone who used to be on T, and doesn't conform to traditional or toxic masculinities (wears ""feminine"" clothing, doesn't regard any activity or behaviour as inherently gendered and therefore does whatever the hell they want and I totally envy them lol) and they warned me about being on T and feeling pressured to conform. I do already feel more comfortable in masculine clothes and normally dress that way, and already get ""sir'd"" or ""bro'd"" (unironically) now and then, but I'll always be either a ""masculine woman"" or a ""feminine man"" depending on whether I'm read as female or male. Maybe I only posted because I'm just nervous in general and needed to talk it out x) needed to hear some other people's experiences just to reassure myself that this is something I can do.

Tired of being A Spectacle	"Went out for the first time this weekend and was super excited about my masc-leaning, very queer outfit. Only to get stares, yells, and snide gender comments as I walked around. This is why I'm usually afraid to be open about my identity :/ I kept my head up and ignored it for personal safety, but it still stings as most of y'all are too familiar with. And I just feel bad for not being able to stand up for my community/myself when shit like that happens. It all just goes by so quickly that I just feel trampled on rather than angry.

On the bright side, I went into work the next day and got nice comments on my new haircut, so it's just a matter of having your people out there for you! 

Anyway, I love you all and you're all valid <3"	"Just being out there is itself an act of representation and standing up. It takes courage, and I admire you for that! Every GSM individual out in the world normalizes our existence and makes the world safer for all of us.

A sudden realization of why I was so anxious and depressed.	"I'm a Korean transfemme living in Korea. I have been depressed and anxious, staying up all night trying to find more people like me, or at least supportive of me. I tried to sleep, but instead realized that I was afraid. I was afraid of the extremely transphobic environment I am in. I was afraid that even queer folks think I'm not one of them. If you feel like I am overreacting, let me explain how it's like to live as a transgender individual in Korea.

Korean transgender communities developed mainly in the sex industry, targetted towards chasers. A lot of sexist and transphobic terminology are used. For example, people say ""complete transition"" when one undergoes GRS, and say we are AGAB before transition. A lot of things are misused between crossdressing and being a transgender.
This alone wasn't a major concern for me until they hit Youtube. I support sex workers, but spreading sexist and transphobic misconceptions is a serious problem. As the pandemic hit the world, Youtube views have gone skyrocketing and I see trans women saying things like ""when I was a man, I was handsome"", or ""I date a gay man. These people spread the misconception that being us is a choice.

There is another big issue of transphobia in our society, from a lot of sources. First, there was a sudden rise in feminism in the last few years. All is good, but terf activists were very aggressive, mirroring sexist internet terminology against all Korean men. Because of that, people view feminism as women bashing everything, even presenting as stereotypical women. A feminist trans individual as myself can't find anyone I can discuss anything with.
On top of that, there is another big news that stirred the society. Korean men are required to serve in the military for a certain period of time. A transwoman realized her identity while serving in the military (in a separate program than the required one) due to the help of military hospital. As she was an excellent individual there, her superiors supported her journey and said that they will let her stay in the system. This was done by high ranked military officials too. However when we came back from Thailand due to GRS, the military chose to abandon her and took away all the things she were promised. The religious community planned malicious plans to scare officials, and justice was delayed until she lost all chance of getting back what she wanted. She isn't with us anymore. May she rest in peace.
There were other issues I hoped that our society would open up, but I saw hatred from both femists(terfs here) and men. Nobody tried to understand us even when scientific facts were presented. I cannot socialize as a feminist, and I cannot socialize as a trans individual. (Also being nonbinary is a joke here) I feel that I am alone even when I want to cry for help.

Now I think it hurts more I know. I am a mathematics student, but my unstable mental state has prevented me from studying. Now my main concern about my life is my safety and our rights. I am not sure what I should do. I can go overseas and try live in queer friendly areas. But it'll mean I hide away from this terrible crisis here, which I always wanted to change. I can actually try change things here, like try join organizations that promote queer right, or try make a good source of information by making a Youtube channel. This sounds very fulfilling, but success would be very hard.

The feeling of being trapped is so strong. I know depression can mess up my mind, but this actually is a very touch situation, right? I just want a normal life going after my studies, but it just isn't possible. I am taking my meds and getting therapy, but every day I don't have therapy is a total nightmare. I don't know how long I will last, and it actually feels impossible to go through all the steps I have to in order to be free. I don't know what I want, but I do want to be saved like Neo in Matrix."	"I don't know what to say, but I wanted you to know that I read this, I live in the UK and have been having trouble Street coming out as non binary, but what your saying really hits home how lucky I am.

Hi. I came on this reddit feeling sad and alone, like no one else was out there like me. There're a lot of pictures of people being out and proud here, which was nice to see, but  your post is what actually made me feel the most at home and accepted.

First of all, it sounds like you're having a really difficult time and I stand with you against all of that, society and mental health problems and feeling trapped. It sucks that that's happening and I wish for it to alleviate for you. 

Second, your trapped feeling is what I was experiencing when I got on this site - of course it's very different, we live in different countries. I feel like I was understood as I read your words... I don't know if you can feel understood from mine, but I also feel so trapped by society. You're not alone, there're other people who believe in the same things. 

Third - my advice. What matters right now is your health. There are other trans/nonbinary people out there who feel the same and we understand their pain - I think it's important to keep fighting so they don't have to deal with the same stuff.  And we can't keep fighting if we don't feel okay. Maybe it's time to take a break from Korea, to feel accepted. You're not the only person who feels this way, let's make a community together to change the world!! 

You can do it, thank you for making this post :) your words really helped me out, I hope you'll keep going so you can feel the love back :) 

good luck!!"	moxo31	NonBinary	11	1.0	2021-04-11 19:37:25
How to come out at work with new name and non-binary pronouns?	"I’d like advice on your experience in coming out at work? I’ve been here 4yrs. I have a new male name, they/them pronouns, and am gender fluid. I was thinking to do this all at once by changing my email signature (with my girl name in small font under my new name as a transition) and include a link on gender pronouns. I am leaving this job in five months, so I could just wait. Also, I’m a supervisor, so my name is all over printed materials. But it is really hard for me to be out with my work friends, but not everyone at work. Confusing for them to call me by my name when no one else does. My friends are changing their emails in support too. But I hate being inauthentic-I don’t want to hide how I want to be seen, I’m so over that.

How have others have made this identity transition and how stressful or easy was it? My worry is that it will be too emotionally overwhelming. I came out to myself 2 months ago, and my friends last week so I feel like it is new to me also. I work at a special Ed high school,  so a bunch of people see my name on email and on Zoom meetings. Also I’m not concerned with physical safety. Thanks in advance! Planning on deciding this week ❤️🏳️‍🌈"	"I basically followed your plan. A number of people have chosen to pretend they don't read email signatures or otherwise can't be expected to make changes based on the information found there because ""what's that even supposed to mean"" and ""I need you to explain it to me."" So that's been fun and enlightening about how supportive everyone actually is.

I will also say that, as a parent, I have very much appreciated seeing email signatures like this among the staff at my kid's school. This year I've become much closer to one teacher who quietly put ""no pronouns: name/name/name's"" as an email sig over the summer, and it's been very nice for both myself and my non-binary special needs child.
Wow! Thanks so much and I appreciate your experience and also about  your child’s school. I’ve never considered no pronouns, kinda a cool concept for those who are agender. I already decided that being the staff educator isn’t a role I’m taking on. I found a really cool link explaining it all that I’ll  embed into the they/them. 

For my students, it’s a good discussion on inclusivity and an opportunity for us all to be supportive of one another despite differences. I specialize in disability self advocacy/pride, so my friend thinks it’ll be a good example for students to see their teacher being open. 
I also secretly hope that some other staff will come out or reach out to to me. And our school seriously needs to be more inclusive, so I’m trying to lead the way for that too.

 I know some older folks are not going to be ok with it or acknowledge it, and that’s ok. It doesn’t help probably that my cisgender exH works there too.  Luckily he is so supportive of and thrilled for my living with authenticity. A part of me wonders if some people think we’re still married, that was only last year so I wouldn’t be surprised—some people really stay in the dark, lol! Thanks for your ideas and support! I really appreciate it!
Oh and did you tell your supervisor first, or communicate with them at all after the fact? Or just went for it?
I just did it. I didn't want them to think they got to give approval or anything, and also thought that way it seemed more like ""well of course I'd do this, it's becoming standard process after all."" They actually asked about it within a week or so and I explained that I only didn't do it sooner because I didn't know what to put, since I do think it's a very valuable thing but it also can be really hard for people where the answer isn't obvious to them or will differ from others' expectations.
That's what I'm thinking. Just do it works in most life situations.   The fact that 5 other of my work friends are going to do with me on the same day normalises it. Lol.  Thank you for responding. This topic has been on my mind constantly , and I can't even focus at work! I'm kinda scared/nervous/ excited??  But maybe once I do it it will be fine and then it won't be on my mind anymore? I am running a big ol meeting with the HS staff Friday and wanted to do this tomorrow, but... I'm scared of this unknown! 😬"	lwdxst	NonBinary	10	1.0	2021-03-02 22:11:39
How to respond NB sibling re: surgery and covid	"\*DISCLAIMER: I could not find a rules page for the sub. I hope my post is in the spirit of the community, and I apologize if this is not the right place for this.\*

My sibling (they/them) recently told me they are getting top surgery. I'm happy they told me, but I also worry about their getting surgery now, while covid is still a significant concern. They do have other medical conditions that could exacerbate a covid infection.

I'm a cis man, and while I am not questioning their choice, I worry that expressing concern will make them uncomfortable. This is the kind of thing I would normally not think twice talking to them about, but I feel like they're putting distance between us lately. They have not told me they're nb; I found out about a month ago from a friend who follows them on social media. Because they are not being open with our family, I don't feel like I have anyone to talk to.

I'm hoping the good people of r/nonbinary can offer guidance on how to communicate with them. I feel like I am the only person in their life that would both readily accept their choice, and also express concern about their safety. They have plenty of friends who are certainly sources of support, but many of them have already exposed my sibling to covid against their wishes. I recognize it's not my choice, but it doesn't feel honest to just blandly ignore what I consider serious health risks. I also would like to hear generally how you all would've liked your family to provide support in times like these."	"If they have otherwise been taking Covid precautions seriously, I am sure they have already considered the safety risks. Instead of asking if they have considered the risk, you can express interest in the surgery itself. Ask questions about the process, where it's taking place, what the procedure is like, what kind of care is required afterward, if they need to follow any special Covid safety precautions, etc. If you live close, offer to help after surgery with meal prep or house cleaning, etc. (they'll be sore), or going shopping for new clothes. By showing an interest and asking questions (in the right tone, don't make it an interrogation. lol), you may help your sibling feel more comfortable opening up to you.  
It's quite possible that their dysphoria has gotten to a breaking point. Some people feel the urge to self-harm, or worse. Surgery, even in the time of Covid, is often a safer alternative to the effects of mental health issues related to the dysphoria.  
After all that, your sibling may still choose not to share details. It might just be something they feel they need to face themselves.
The nature of the surgery is going to necessitate that mentioning it involves explaining that you know they're non-binary. Depending on the exact circumstances of how that information made it to you, they may feel comfortable having you know, or there may have been someone they trusted to be discreet who failed to respect that. That will be a tricky part of the conversation to navigate, but if you make it clear that you're supportive, it tends to go well.

Starting from the point where you're both on the same page wrt their gender, you can move on to your concerns about the surgery. Gender minority folks like us deal with a lot of invalidation and gatekeeping from society in general, and the medical establishment in particular. For example, if your sibling wanted to have breast augmentation surgery, all they would need to do is sign a form. But to have them reduced or removed likely required multiple letters from multiple therapists etc confirming that it's the right choice for them. Finding a surgeon willing to do the procedure without a ""medical reason"" eg breast cancer may have been difficult. They may have met resistance from well-meaning family and friends who say they'll regret the decision, or pressuring them to delay until ""they're really sure"" or ""fully figure their gender out."" If you decide you want to attempt to talk them into a delay, be aware that they're probably primed to expect the kinds of arguments I've mentioned and may react poorly. Your best course would be to clarify that the nature of your concern is the exposure risk, and specifically not any of the things I've mentioned.

For what it's worth, I doubt your sibling is somehow unaware of the health risks involved. Unless you have some specific concrete information about risks that they may not be aware of, it may not go over well even if you follow the advice above. If my siblings were to express such concerns to me when I considered surgery, I would probably find it a bit condescending regardless of their good intentions. But that's just me and my family.

Anyway, it sounds like you're supportive and have their best interests at heart. If you decide to go ahead with the conversation, I wish you the best of luck, and to your sibling on their surgery if they move forward.
Thank you everyone who took the time to engage and respond. It really helped me see that I was probably overthinking my own anxiety about a loved one going through big changes. We had a quick talk and I feel like sharing on here helped me offer love and support without bringing my baggage, so thank you all again.
On a more practical level, hospitals have definitely been doing their best to keep covid patients isolated. My meta had bottom surgery in NYC in July and she was basically alone in the part of the hospital they do voluntary/planned surgery in, as was my dad who ended up spending two weeks in the hospital in Florida recently for open heart surgery. Plus, you usually only need to stay overnight after top surgery so your sib should be home safe quickly.
Ask!

I would legitimately say, ""Can I ask you something? I've noticed that your wardrobe has been super rad as of late - can I ask how you identify?""

Putting it like that is basically prefacing with, 'I think you're rad, tell me how rad you are"" Rather than putting them on the spot and having them be slightly thrown into having to answer, letting them know that you are 'woke' enough about gender to ask how they identify."	lpwws5	NonBinary	9	1.0	2021-02-22 19:08:26
MASKING.	"As someone who has ADHD and is nearly closeted, I've gotten pretty good at masking. I've pretended to be someone else nearly all my life so that I could ""fit in"". I wish this is the post where I say ""fuck that, i'm done watering myself down for others!"" and I jump out the closet with a big 'ole nonbinary flag and with the song 'born this way' blasting. But sadly, this is just the post where I vent about how lonely and sad this is getting.

It's not that I don't want to be out and free. I do. I'm just scared to face the world as my true self alone. I don't have anyone to cheer me on as I unravel myself. I don't have anyone to back me up when I want to shrink back into the safety of masking. I don't have people who see me and love me for who I am. I've searched and I've searched, but I still feel utterly alone in this world.

I don't know what to do. I'm sad and I'm alone."	">I'm just scared to face the world as my true self alone.

You've no greater defense against the slings and arrows of the world in the closet.  I know - *believe me* - that coming out is one of those infinitely spiraling possibility sets that'd cause existential dread in any rational person.  I know that it doesn't seem as if whatever you'd be buying at so steep a cost could possibly be worth it.

The thing is that everyone goes through this alone.  You're the only person living inside of you, the only person qualified to figure it out.  To steal a saying, you are your own dragon as well as your own hero, and you have to rescue yourself from yourself.

I'd like to say that I was courageous about it.  There was a time when coming out was insurmountable.  It was only when my fight to avoid the issue had worn away very nearly everything I had to give as a person, when the only way to keep avoiding the issue was *death*, that I came out.  It was a heroic stand that I suspect I'll regret for the rest of my life.  Because it was only in coming out, only when I started truly exploring who I was that I discovered just how much courage, how much *faith* in myself I had.

Only a few noble maniacs manage to come out all at once.  Today you told a stranger on the internet.  That's not nothing.  So blast Born This Way, and tomorrow try and go just a little further.
Thank you."	oogf10	NonBinary	10	0.92	2021-07-21 02:00:50
What are some polite ways to correct people to who misgender me at work?	"So I recently made the super scary but also super worth it decision to come out as nonbinary at my work (in a bar). My workplace has always been super lgbtq+ friendly; my gm is pretty flamboyantly gay and has always been supportive of me and my gay coworkers, up to and including giving us pride weekend (evenings) off last year completely unprompted so we could go to the parade and celebrations etc. This was the crux of my decision to come out socially and he was really supportive and let me decide how I'd like to tell everyone.

Last week the whole staff, which includes a lot of temps from other sites, had a meeting about how the bar will operate in light of the covid safety measures (UK),  and at the end I stood in front of a room full of people and explained that I'm nb and I use they/them pronouns. The response was extremely positive, and some people came up to me afterwards and congratulated me and chatted openly about it. I'm not worried about being mocked or anything like that.

Since we started working proper I have noticed people are still using my old pronouns, mostly out of habit or just not understanding what nonbinary means. I corrected it a couple of times when I heard it but I am aware people are probably also doing this when there's nobody around to correct them. I'm not sure how to approach this without sounding confrontational, especially knowing that it's not malicious or intentional, it's just trying to get used to something new. The couple of people I did correct took it very well, I'm just worried about sounding like a broken record every time someone says ""ladies"" or something.

 I have made a post in our Facebook group about how to use singular they/them, as well as some links to helpful pages and some yt videos. I know it's just a matter of adjustment, I would just like to make sure everyone is on the right track and my coming out wasn't for nothing."	The people around you might need lots of practice with they/them pronouns. It sucks and sometimes hurts but if you do nothing they won’t get the practice and the misgendering won’t stop. At work I just say “they, they, they, they, they” until they hear me and acknowledge that they just messed up. If I only say it once no one actually hears me. If I tell them minutes later it also doesn’t sink in because the moments gone. Being around a largely LGBTQIA+ team might lessen the amount of time you’ll have to correct them. For ‘frequent offenders’ I tend to make really direct statements about them misgendering me on accident like, “You meant to say ‘they’” or straight up “I’m not a ‘she’”. Never worry about being a broken record. You deserve respect and to be spoken to properly and spoken about properly.	hmd744	NonBinary	8	0.85	2020-07-06 18:34:09
Coming out to my coworkers!	"Yesterday, I decided to finally take the plunge and come out to all my work partners after almost a year at my current job. 
I was shaking the entire time, but their words of love and support made it all worth it... each time I come out, I feel more and more comfortable with myself and I feel so much happier.  I’ve struggled with my gender identity my entire life—when I discovered the nonbinary community a couple years ago, everything suddenly made sense.  Last year, I felt sure of my gender, but couldn’t picture myself coming out to anyone other than close friends. Being here today, out and proud among most of the people in my life, introducing myself to new people with my proper pronouns, feeling less and less scared about being a queer person in this world—it’s overwhelming and exciting!!
For anyone reading this, remember that you are nonbinary enough.  You are YOU enough!  I hope everyone finds safety and acceptance and happiness in coming out, whenever that may be!!  There is never a wrong time to come out—it’s never too early or too late."		hrrqdm	NonBinary	9	1.0	2020-07-15 17:20:57
Trying to decide if I should change my gender marker	"Hi everyone, long post incoming. I'm posting this from a new account because there will be a lot of identifying information here. I'm not sure if this is more of an advice-seeking post or a rant post...I guess we'll see once I've typed it out.

&#x200B;

I've been out as nonbinary since 2016. I started my social transition immediately, I legally changed my name in 2017, I had top surgery in 2018, and I started low dose testosterone 4 months after that. In my daily life, I can be pretty male-passing when I try, though not 100% - I kind of look like a teen boy. I have no desire to be completely male-passing, either; I prefer to look androgynous. I just moved to a new state and started a new job, and no one here knows I'm trans.

&#x200B;

The state I just moved to (Arkansas) technically allows X gender markers on drivers' licenses, which I was really excited about at first, but now that I'm here, I don't know if it's a good idea. I've lived in the South my whole life, but since I left my small hometown for college before I came out, I never experienced being trans in a rural area - I've only ever been out in a college town, which, while still conservative, had a sizable trans community. I'm really in the heart of Trump country now, confederate flags and MAGA signs everywhere, and I think having an X would be too big of a risk. Not to mention, I wouldn't be able to put it on any of my other legal documents like my passport, so it would likely create problems down the road in that department.

&#x200B;

I would be okay leaving my marker as an F, but at my new job, everyone thinks I'm a cis guy. I didn't mean to go stealth, it just kind of happened because I never corrected anyone, and I'm not really too keen on coming out. I prefer being treated as a guy versus being treated as a girl when those are the only two options, at least. (At my last job, I wasn't out and presented as a woman, and I hated it.) For the sake of safety and not being outed, I'm considering changing my gender marker to M. I spend a good portion of my days working way out in the forest with my small group of coworkers, all cis guys as far as I know, so if I'm outed and any of them end up having a problem with me, I worry it could end badly. I don't think it's terribly likely that it would come to that, but it's still a thought in the back of my mind. I'm not willing to leave this job, either; I love what I'm doing, and I've worked so hard to get here.

&#x200B;

I know changing my gender maker to an M is probably the safest and most reasonable thing for me to do, and I probably will do it. Leaving it as an F means it's probably only a matter of time before I get outed. It just hurts so much to have put so much work into transitioning into my true self, only to have to go into hiding on the other side of the binary I tried so hard to escape. I'm not a man any more than I am a woman, and it's causing me a lot of turmoil to know that I have to make a choice between the two in order to be safe.

&#x200B;

I'm not really sure what I'm looking for with this post. Advice? Alternatives? Sympathy? I just needed put this in the world somewhere, I guess. Thanks for reading."	"damn. idek what to say except i feel for you, i'm really sorry this is happening

Advice?: My [24NB] girlfriend [24F] is extremely triggered by me exploring my gender identity	"CW: stressful relationship dynamics, enbyphobia, mentions of self-loathing and death/suicide

Hey all, sorry for a not-exactly-happy topic, but I need to get this off my mind and I'd like some advice or at least some other people to think with about this. Thanks in advance for reading a long post.

\--

My girlfriend and I started dating about a year and a half ago, and have been best friends for like four or five years (I lose count). We love each other immensely and have helped each other through very traumatic experiences, and I want to spend my life with her. It's been a revelation to explore our sexualities together, as when we started dating and I identified as a cis woman, it was our first wlw relationship for both of us.

About a year ago, like many people in the midst of quarantine, I started to explore and question my gender identity. It's been a lot of reflection and feeling out the bounds of my gender, relationship to femininity/masculinity/androgyny, how I present, etc. It's been empowering for me to explore this and while I don't have a lot of labels that I actively want to use, I do want to use the label nonbinary, potentially genderfluid or genderflux. 

This has been a lot of exploring on my own, as I've been hesitant to tell many people about what I'm thinking and feeling -- I don't have a lot of genderqueer folks in my life. I have talked about it a little with my girlfriend, and the first time I mentioned it to her -- already several months after I first started seriously questioning my gender -- she took it very poorly. We talked about it a little, she started exploring her own gender a bit before deciding she felt most comfortable identifying as a cis woman, and for a few months we didn't really talk about it.

Currently, she's staying with me for a few weeks, a welcome break from long-distance. I knew that gender was a stressful topic for her as we had talked about it in a different context a couple weeks prior, and I wanted to mention something related to my own gender, I asked if it was alright to bring it up. She visibly braced herself before responding yes, but I asked her why she hesitated rather than jumping into what I was about to say. This started a long, several hours conversation about her relationship to gender, particularly to nonbinary people, and her fears that she will never be able to view me as anything other than a woman because being around nonbinary people is so triggering for her. She was visibly shaking during the entire conversation. The points are kinda muddied. 

Basically, she said she hates herself for being transphobic/enbyphobic and that I should break up with her. For me, I see this as another symptom of an emotionally abusive upbringing and I can't bring myself to feel negatively toward her for these feelings, because I don't think they're her fault. To try to expand upon that:

\-She's neurodivergent, diagnosed with anxiety, depression, and ADHD and aligns with some symptoms of ASD (autism spectrum). Labels and change are really difficult for her -- she identified as bisexual for a long time, and it took her months to come to grips with potentially changing that identity to gay/lesbian. She has expressed to me that me changing my gender label from cis woman to nonbinary is very difficult and confusing, because to her, it feels like my whole person has changed. I have a hard time understanding this, since I'm neurotypical and for me, labels are like stickers or Post-It notes that help people define things, but don't represent the actual thing. I feel like I'm choosing a different name tag that more closely aligns with how I authentically feel. 

\-She spent a lot of her youth on highly toxic tumblr blogs (""all white/cis/straight/wealthy people should kill themselves"" and ""if you don't reblog this you're racist/sexist/homophobic/transphobic/etc. and you deserve to die"" kinds of posts) that has led to a lifetime of self-loathing due to having privileged identities, and feeling extremely triggered by social justice spaces that have rhetoric similar to these posts. She explained to me that to a degree, she associates nonbinary people, especially people who are angry about erasure or disrespect, with these toxic spaces and has difficulty separating them in her mind. Thus, it makes sense to me why the topic of gender is so triggering, if she associates it with tumblr kill-yourself culture. She's been working really hard to address these ingrained feelings of self-loathing, but due to that self-hatred, also feels like she doesn't deserve to overcome it and be happy because she feels worthless.

\-Her home life also was very invalidating and she hasn't felt much safety in people like... pretty much ever. I'm one of the only people she has felt a deep, safe, loving relationship with, from what she tells me. She has a hard time trusting me and that I won't hurt her, even after knowing and loving each other for so long (though I understand that a few years of us loving each other doesn't dismantle 20+ years of self-loathing and external invalidation). She seems afraid that as I explore my gender identity and what it means to me, I'll drift away from her and toward these toxic subcultures, and eventually hurt her in the same way.

I want to assure her that I'm still the same person, that my label doesn't define who I am and our relationship, that I don't hate her even though she feels like I should. I love her so much and I know that these feelings are brought up by her trauma, not because she hates me or doesn't want to be with me. It's hard because her response to a lot of the emotions she's having is to withdraw from me, which for me, feels like she's abandoning me (a trauma response from my own previous bad relationships). 

I want things to be okay with us and I want us to work through this. I also know that she doesn't feel ready to even begin thinking about the roots of her discomfort around gender and nonbinary identities, and wants to run away. It's complicated. 

Part of me wanted to write this out I guess, and part of me also wants to discuss with folx about these roots of transphobia and enbyphobia. Fears of retaliation and death threats for slipping up on a pronoun. Fears of being excommunicated or ""cancelled"" for being confused or uncomfortable. How can I/we support people who have these fears? I don't feel like it's appropriate to reject her because of this trauma. 

\--

tl;dr: My girlfriend is really triggered by me exploring my identity as a nonbinary person, rooted in a lifetime of trauma that I can't fault her for, and I don't want to reject her as enbyphobic even though she wants me to hate her. How can I support her, and how can we understand the roots of enbyphobia that are not rooted in bigotry, but in intense fear of cancel culture?"	"Honestly I don't think this is something that you can fix. It sounds like she has huge levels of trauma around these things. Has she ever tried to work through these things in therapy? I do understand where she is coming from, but trauma isn't an excuse.
Speaking as a non/binary bisexual person who is autistic + adhd and also struggles with depression and anxiety, AND reconciling all that with past trauma and the privilege I have in the world - I know you love her, but you are not responsible for “fixing” her or for her emotional state. You both are still pretty young, so just for transparency sake I’ll disclose that I’m almost a full decade older than y’all (almost 33). But….you are not her therapist and cannot be. Again I know you love her and I appreciate that you are trying to understand her and accept her as she is. But she needs to find a healthier way to work through her trauma, because 1) IMO neurodivergence shouldn’t be used as an excuse to not overcome prejudiced/bigoted views, we are capable of doing better and 2) it is really really unfair and a big burden on you to have to deal with her problematic views due to associating being gender-non-conforming with trauma, AND on top of that manage and soothe her guilt and self-loathing for having problematic views! Like please take care of yourself, I am concerned for both of you but since you are the one writing this post, I don’t want you to feel like you have to be her emotional garbage can because she doesn’t have bad intentions. Your own emotional needs are also valid and deserve to be met too.
immersion is generally the way to go, take her to see other reasonable nonbinary people and have her watch videos and media with them like https://one-day-at-a-time.fandom.com/wiki/Syd.

It's clearly not a logical issue, she's just emotionally primed to panic and this can help. As for reassuring her... just keep up what you're doing and know that the roots of this aren't logical but emotional and that immersion in certain spaces and content is what causes all this hate generally.
You can't solve your partner's mental health for her. She has to get help herself. Here's a question to ask yourself: does she *want* help? I mean, really ruminate on this. Come up with a truthful answer to this question for yourself, because when it comes right down to it not everyone is willing to do the work it takes to make progress on mental health: taking meds every day, not missing or blowing off therapy sessions, *real* deep constant introspection and self-inventorying, immersion experiences with nonbinary people. It could take a lot of forms, but if you have reason to think that she isn't willing to make any changes *for herself without your help* then (sorry to be blunt, but) you are both wasting your time in this relationship."	qvdngt	NonBinary	10	0.92	2021-11-16 17:53:47
I used the men's room tonight!	"I went to see a play at Emerson Paramount tonight. They are so forward about inclusivity - all the ushers wear a nametag+pronouns. The problem is that it is a Historical Register building, so there are only two multi-person single-gender bathrooms, and no feasible way to build any additional unisex one. 

I was strongly debating if I needed to use the bathroom enough to give in and use the women's one. I walked up to the door, and there was a sign on it encouraging people to use the restroom which affirmed their gender identity! (In pretty much those words). I had had a short discussion with a nonbinary usher just before the play, and they were still guiding people out, so I knew I had someone *official* for safety. So, I used the men's room. Without even wearing my binder. Total nonissue - except for my joy!"		etkxof	NonBinary	8	0.91	2020-01-25 02:39:48
Hey, can I rant and ask for advice	"Hi,
My name is Charlie, I run the gsa at my school, I am in the nyc pride march yearly and I’m the lgbtq representative at my school. I like to show strength to the club members and to people who might not want to be seen but I am constantly worried. I’ve built this entire system of safety at my school and I ended up carving myself into the foundation. Now people are actively relying on me and I’m not actually a good person I just pretend to be one. Yesterday a girl I had helped with school id photo transition and other related things said she owes me her life because she was contemplating. I don’t even know who I am and everyone else seems to I’m just overwhelmed. What can I do to fix this without letting everyone down?"	"Well it sounds like you *are* a good person. Youre doing good in your community and helping people. Thats something to be proud of.
When do you graduate? It might be a good idea to pick someone to mentor so you can divvy up the work load and have someone to carry on after you're gone. 



I'm sure you're a good person, not just pretending. In the words of Batman, ""Its not who I am on the inside that defines me, but my actions.""
You sound like a pretty good person to me! Don't be too hard on yourself
You are actually a good person. Maybe you took your mission a bit too seriously to the point where it becomes overwhelming for you, but that doesn't mean you're wrong, it just means you need to find other people to hlep you with the club. 

You could maybe ask around the club to see who wants to give you a hand, I'm sure many people will be very happy to help !
I know exactly how you feel.  Trust me you are so much more important than you think.  It's important to know you aren't alone either.

I want to bind my flat chest and need to know if it’s safe for me to do so.	"I am an amab who is struggling with chest dysphoria. I also made a post a while ago asking for options on a flat chested bra. You know what that means! I’m back at it with asking for a solution to that.

I haven’t built up the courage to ask my parents to buy me any of the bra options you fine folks have suggested, so I looked for alternatives. I looked to wrapping a bandage around my chest. I have definitely heard that binding with a bandage is very dangerous. I’m not sure, however, if it is dangerous in my case. A flat chested amab’s case.

The bandage is 5 1/2 inches wide, and I’m not wrapping it as tightly as you would on a chest/rib injury. Is it safe? These things have been known to cut off circulation, though I know that is a lot less common on the wider bandages.

I am open to questions, if you need any more information. I’m doing this also for a friend, so it’s not just me whose safety could be compromised. It did feel great to have it on briefly, and I’m hoping it is safe. Please let me know if it is."	"Ace bandage has compression, so it would just be a bad idea all around as even loosely it can mess with the lymph and circulation.  Are you trying to add bulk in the chest? If so just go grab a button-down shirt and tie it under the ribcage, then stuff it. You can also take a tight tank top and roll it up (fold it in half upwards while wearing it and then again,  so its a band around your chest) and then use safety pins to hold the roll in place. Put another shirt on top and you've got some padding. Hope that helps
Ace bandage binding as a consistent thing is definitely unsafe regardless of your agab or if you have a flat chest. Doing it once every so often is less unsafe, but still probably not good for you in the long run. Im trans masc and ive had top surgery and i had to use an ace bandage for a week or so for compression. That has a medical need for it and is generally what ace bandages like that are used for- short term compression. And if i continued using it, even if it wasnt as tight, it would definitely have had negative effects over time. 

The issue with using ace bandages is that you cant evenly distribute pressure wrapping it, and you also move throughout the day as well as your lungs needing room to expand during breathing, which using an ace bandage can hinder causing short term pain and if used consistently cause long term issues. Even if its not tight like you say, I'd steer clear of using ace bandages for binding, already having a flat chest doesnt negate the issues it can cause.
You could try KT tape! I’ve been looking into that myself, I know it’s not as good as actual transtape but my friend uses it and he really likes it. It’s available at like Walmart or target and it’s technically a kind of athletic tape. Use the cotton original one and make sure to look up some videos on how to safely and properly tape. Maybe that will work for you?"	tbhgm4	NonBinary	9	1.0	2022-03-11 04:05:44
The Shirt Off My Back	"So all of my friends know I'm enby, and they've been pretty accepting and supportive- most of them, at least. I have one friend who doesn't hesitate to remind me how she ""doesn't get nonbinary"", and that I'm ""still a woman"", so I'll ""never be able to go around without a shirt"", even after top surgery. She says that ""gender shouldn't matter, so all of this nonbinary business is just a bandage for society"". 

Believe me, nonbinary people know INTIMATELY that gender shouldn't matter, and yet here we are, fighting to be seen as people and just live our lives in safety and comfort. I was so hurt when she said that that I couldn't find the words to refute her. 

Any advice for how to deal with someone who I truly want to believe is trying, but just doesn't have the right mindset yet? Also, any stories of post-top surgery enbies baring chests in public for a confidence boost? Thanks guys."	i know this might not be the best advice but you just need to sit down and explain. explain and explain until there's no question. and if you dont have an answer to one of their questions about your identity, then you can either look it up or say fuck it, who cares, because this is your identity and it isn't hurting or bothering anyone to make you feel respected. and i hate to say it, but if they are too stubborn to respect you as a person, then maybe limit contact with them. dont let them get you down!!! <3	vgm4na	NonBinary	8	0.91	2022-06-20 13:58:07
Changing presentation and doubts	"This isn’t necessarily a rant, but I was unsure of what else to tag it. I’ve identified as some form of transmasculine for about 7 years, and I’ve been on testosterone for 4 as of April. I’ve socially transitioned to male in all my social circles and used he/him until around the beginning of this year (I now use they only). I’ve become increasingly uncomfortable with being read as male, and have been experiencing some nostalgia for my pre-t self. I liked being able to be read as both female and male. And if I’m being vain, I liked being considered pretty. As of late, it’s been kind of affirming to be mistaken for female, as I feel varying degrees of male and female on any given day. I’ve become more comfortable incorporating some traditionally-feminine clothing back into my wardrobe, too. But that’s kind of scary to me, as someone who’s considered male by most people I come into contact with outside of my close friends who use my correct pronouns. I’m worried that people will think that I really was just a confused cis girl. I don’t feel like a cis girl, but I feel like a lot of people I know are still of the mind that you have to be one or the other. My doc that I see for hormones has been kind of pressuring me for a while now to change my gender marker to M, but that feels so absolute to me. Like a death sentence. I know she means well, as it can be a safety and legal issue, but I would feel so trapped. I live in a red state, so an X on my ID wouldn’t be an option. I would feel a little afraid to have one anyway. 

I just feel so hyperaware of the gendered world around me, and I’m becoming increasingly uncomfortable. Does anyone have any advice for how to nix these feelings?"		gcwxic	NonBinary	8	1.0	2020-05-03 19:49:43
It's all fun and games until they ask the dreaded question ....	"So are you a boy or a girl?????? 

Fuuuckkkk I'm getting so aggravated by this!!!! I'm getting asked almost daily these days. It's great and validating that I'm androgynous enough people can't tell even after talking with me but, holy shit!!! Can they just leave well enough alone??? Why does everyone feel the need to gender people if they can't tell???? Especially strangers... Like, I'm never going to see you again. You can deal with not knowing my gender for the 20 minutes we have to interact.

For my own safety I just tell people what's on my ID but fuck it just makes me depressed because they'll start gendering me after that. If anyone has a magical solution to this please let me know haha"	"""Hmm ... not to my knowledge! 🙂""
Deadpan ""Yes."" or ""No.""
""There are things out there man/humanity was not meant to know.""
""I'd tell you, but then I'd have to kill you.""
""Why do you need to know? Are you a cop?""
""You are not my partner or my doctor, so I can't see why it matters.""
""Do you need to know this to discriminate against me or for medical reasons? I can't see why else you'd ask.""

A couple examples I've seen recomended on this sub in the past. I've never been fortunate enough to not be seen as my AGAB, but if I were, I suppose I'd probably use option 1 or two. The last two can be dangerous because they can scare some off, but others will want to debate you. Also, it's uch easier to recommend sarcastic options to others than be brave enough to say them yourself, so take this with a pinch of salt!
Wouldn't you like to know, weatherboy?

(I'm probably too cowardly to say that in person, but it's fun to imagine)
There are two ways I can interpret their question. Either they want to know your gender or they want to know what's in your pants. In any case, we do indeed agree that the information is probably irrelevant to the exchange you are having with this person but eh... So, basically, you could reply vagues answers along the line of ""a little bit of both"" or ""neither"", or ""it depends on my mood ;-)"". Then two possibilities. Either people will let it slide (they understand non-binary or at least they understand that it's your choice to keep this information a mistery), or they won't. If they don't, they'll likely ask you more bluntly (and awkwardly and rude). Like ""yeah ok but I mean... what are you *really* ?"" at which point you could politely reply something like ""I'd rather not say"" and then retarget the conversation on whatever was the actual topic to begin with. At that point you made it pretty clear that you did not want to disclose the information and you even did it politely. If the other people still insists about that particular subject, at this point they're at fault. You can honestly reply something like ""Are we seriously discussing what's in my pants ? I don't see how it is relevant to this conversation"" and try again to return to the actual subject of the conversation. Try not to sound too agressive. What you want is for the other person to realize their obsession about knowing that information is irrelevant in the context, not necessarily to stop having a conversation altogether. At this point, two possibilities again. Either the person realizes you're right, that it doesn't matter, and go on with the discussion, or they keep obsessing about it. If they keep obsessing about it, just leave them there and then. You can tell them politely: ""I'm sorry but this can't go on like this. I tried to be polite with you but you don't seem to understand so I think we'll leave it at that. I wish you a good day."" and just leave. You don't owe this person anything. If they can't respect that you wish not to be identified as either a bor or a girl, even though you told them so politely, then too bad for them, they can be annoying to someone else instead.
Yeah i'm not sure I've got the guts to say any of these. At least not at the moment. You never know how people will react.
That's the issue though. Like Emmenias, when asked if I'm a boy of a girl I usually answer, ""No"" with a smile because it's not the answer they were expecting. 

It's a catch 22 - if we have an opportunity to give our gender and we choose a binary option instead, then of course they're going to misgender us. And some of that is on us if we don't correct them when we have an opportunity.

 I've been in that situation and they're not always looking for a fight, but quite often they do lack the nuanced language to approach the question with tact. So if you feel the conversation can take it, gently correct them: ""Are you a boy or a girl?"" ""Actually, I use they/them pronouns."" The ones who actually want to learn will take the point - the rest were always a lost cause."	tek48j	NonBinary	8	0.91	2022-03-15 08:19:11
I'm a trans exogirl!	"I'm a closeted, yet to transition, AMAB transfemme. I identify (currently mostly online due to being in the closet for literal personal safety reasons) primarily as a binary trans woman, especially since a female body, pronouns, name, social identity, etc... is what I am comfortable with and feel truly fits myself... But that female gender identity is to the ""above all gender"" ""core me"" like a browser extension is to a web browser or like a UI theme is to the software being themed. It's just one aspect of something larger, unexplainable. I deeply identify with alot of non-binary stuff, binary stuff and stuff that is outside the binary/non-binary scopes, while still considering myself to be a binary woman at the same time. It's odd but that's me. It's like an unexplainable ""limitless gender"", where I identify as the binary gender I feel comfortable and myself in, yet I am far more than any binary or ""typical"" non-binary person. I can mentally fully snap out of the gender world as needed, which was useful when finding what binary gender I wanted to have the body and personal/social identity of. My thoughts and thought processes are not genderized most of the time, but can switch (usually partially, rarely fully) at any given moment to those of a more nerdy purely-binary (""regular"") female. That's why i consider myself an exogender trans woman, or simply trans exogirl. To me it's like a third space that doesn't fit in the normal non-binary and binary scopes. It's the ultimate liberation for me, the one place and one identity I feel myself as, with nothing restricting what I can be and feel like at any moment. Idk how else to explain it since no other label in the LGBTQIA+ spectrum can explain me entirely. I also, whenever asked ""what does it feel like to be a woman"" by my non supportive mother who's trying to ""check"" if I am a ""real woman"", I say it's complicated and personal, or just go totally silent..."	That explains alot. I feel a similar way about my gender. Thank you for providing the words to explain it	moz0zt	NonBinary	9	1.0	2021-04-11 20:46:50
Traveling While Trans	"I’m traveling for a relative’s wedding for the first time in a reeeaalllyyy long time and wondering if anyone has any safety tips/ reassurance to offer around traveling anxiety about transphobia.

I live in a really queer inclusive city and rarely leave. When I do take road trips I try not to stop unless I really have to (and only use restrooms that are unattended/ single stall whenever possible). But this trip involves plane travel, TSA, staying at a location that will probably be mostly older cishet couples, sharing a hotel room with a relative, having to wear a swimsuit in public, and no one except me is queer as far as I know. 
(For context: I dress pretty butch, have a low voice/visible body hair, and noticeable boobs so I get stares if people look long enough to notice and usually causes either homophobia or trans confusion depending on how I’m read). 
I guess I’m mostly nervous about bathrooms and any other trouble especially when I’m away from the group, but don’t really know what to expect. 

Anyone have any advice or experience here? Am I worried for no reason?"	"is your voice/body hair from testosterone? 
pre-T i was seen as a butch woman and had no issues with planes, TSA, swimming, or bathrooms. after being on T, i got some weird comments in womens bathrooms and started exclusively using the mens bathrooms and locker rooms.
Assuming you're in the US... PreChek makes TSA much easier. But in general, air travel isn't bad. Other travelers are busy and in their own heads. And the employees are trained to be respectful.
Just circling back to say thanks and it went well! A few weird situations but since I was traveling in a group no real trouble.
As a non binary person on e I have had identical experience and now use the women's restroom.  The body hair going away plus boobs means I get less flack in the woman's than men's,. Especially when wearing a mask."	xpv07r	NonBinary	8	1.0	2022-09-27 22:37:10
Non-Binary in Academia? Need advice	"Hi All,

Wanted to get some advice about being a nonbinary academic. I have recently come out as non-binary to some friends and will be coming out to my university soon. I want to pursue a Masters and then PHD in order to become an academic. I wanted to see what it's like to be out in academia, are there concerns about being published or taken seriously in your field, or any general safety concerns I might need to think about?"	"One of my professors from undergrad is out as nonbinary. I do not know what the experience of being nb in academia was like for them. I do know that they mentioned their own identity casually and in passing during a lecture that had to do with gender, and had their pronouns (she/they/he) in their email signature. I do know that they were more open about being nonbinary after they got tenured, but they were always out as lgbt. I was just a student and was never super close to this professor, so again, I don’t know what their experience was like, but I did admire them and so did most of their peers in the department.
Coming from a technical field, I've never noticed it having any negative effect for me. I have my pronouns in my email signature, and stuff like that, and I've never gotten any flack. I haven't seen anyone take me less seriously as a scholar because of it, or refuse to publish my papers, or so on.

That said, let me strongly caution you against pursuing an academic career. The academic job market is in a terrible state. It never recovered from the 2008 recession, and with it looking like we're likely in the start of another economic recession, it's gonna get even worse. Just how bad it is varies from field to field, but in none of them is it good. And even if you do manage to be one of the lucky few that ends up with a permanent position, the route to getting there is: move somewhere for grad school, move again for a postdoc, move for another postdoc, then move one last time for your permanent position. The continual uprooting of your life, combined with stress and overwork, is not great for your mental health. 

The ideal of being an academic is very appealing, but the reality is not nearly as pleasant.
I’m non binary and just finished my PhD. Yeah there will be occasional bigots anywhere, but academia tends to have less “rules” than other jobs which can be nice. Like, generally you can wear whatever you want, be a bit odd, etc as long as you do quality research"	hi9c4l	NonBinary	8	1.0	2020-06-29 21:32:33
Could y'all help me pick a name? Or tell me about your name change experience?	"Hey everyone, I am finally actively trying to find a new name. I have been transitioning for several years now, and always avoided my name. But now, I kinda need a new name out of safety. I ""pass"" as ""not a woman,"" but then, my name outs me. I am about to graduate college and look for careers so getting a neutral name is important to me. 

It has taken me so long to consider changing my name because my name is special to me. I love it a lot, and in a perfect world I would keep it, but it is a feminine name. Likely no matter what I choose I will still let close friends and family call me my birth name. 

In some situations I go by Danny, which is a nickname. But it doesn't give me as much euphoria as it used to, and is my fathers name, and well my father isn't taking my transition very well so I feel kinda weird about being named after him at the moment (Though I have always loved that my dad named me after him, even though I am AFAB, a little fuck you to gender norms even then).

So here is a couple selfies: https://imgur.com/a/66v8AXD . What kind of name do I look like (And you may have seen me on other forums, I've been posting a bit hah).

If you don't have any ideas, feel free to share how you went about changing your name. How you picked a name, how long it took, if you changed your mind, or just any other advice."	"You look like a Henry!
For some reason, I think it might be related to your hair color slightly?? But my mind wants to go towards ""T"" names for you. Something like Taylor, if you're looking for something that sounds like a nice standard, still normal name, or if you're open to more unusual names, something like Tilden or Taryn or similar.

If you're super unsure about what kind of name you would want, you could try some name generators. I especially like how customizable the filters are for https://www.behindthename.com/random/ so maybe play around with that and see what strikes your fancy :)
Cute! How about Alton, Henry, Travis, Tommy?
Tyler, Rylan, Quinn?
Consider Simone!
Reid or Andy!

has anyone felt anxious or nervous about getting a binder?	ever since I've been identifying as nonbinary (past couple months) I've wanted a binder mainly for safety in public or when I feel masc but now when I think about getting one I get so anxious about it and I'm not sure what it means. if it means I'm scared of changing, dysphoria, excitement but in the form of anxiety? nervousness because of my family commenting on the flatness? or if I'm scared I'll actually like it? I'm not sure. I'd appreciate some advice	"I was hella stressed/nervous when my sister got me one as a Christmas gift. When I put it on all those feelings disappeared. I’d say give it a shot and if anyone says something about it you can say, “Why are you so obsessed with the way my chest looks?” (I usually substitute “chest” for “boobs” to make people super uncomfortable). GC2B makes fantastic and comfy, breathable binders that make me flat and I’ve got pretty big bahoohas. You got this.
Hey, tbh I am not sure, if I experienced such a feeling. But I think the best would be for you to try it out.. by e.g. using two sports bras, which would be way better affordable for just trying out binding. Then you can experience how you feel about the general act of binding and how a slight change in size of your chest makes you feel. :)
By this you can try to answer your own questions. For instance whether you feel anxious about liking it or about other people's reactions. 
Please remember that binding with such an option still is exhausting for your chest and body, so that you shouldn't wear it for too long and that you still should be able to breathe properly.
If the thought of getting a binder for trans makes you anxious you could decide to get a binder for a halloween costume. Trying new things is always anxiety producing (especially if you feel its a significant statement about your identity) but its a bit easier with an excuse. The binder feels special but in the end its just a piece of cloth. The anxiety should relax once you have had a binder for awhile.
thank you. I'll definitely give it a shot, but my brain has been acting weird asking myself ""who am I"" I answer myself with my birth name and if feels weird and my brain goes a dark way. this is scary
I wouldn't mind getting a binder, Ive used ace bandages a few years back and I didn't mind it but I always am looking at my chest in the mirror not sure why that is though. if the binder doesn't end up working for me I could just donate it to someone who does need one
yeah I was gonna get one for my Halloween costume (wanna be a sexy male vampire) lol and I'll prolly wear it rarely cuz nonetheless I still kinda want one but I know certainly for me new things can produce anxiety plus I have ADHD and depression so I'm just an emotion mess lol
Discovering yourself and who you are IS scary sometimes. But in the end we figure it out. Even if it takes a long time.
Oh well, please don't use bandages! Then definitely better buy a binder. 
I just think that trying it out (with a proper binder) can give you some answers to your questions. 
Or you could ask yourself what/if smth does give you euphoria, concerning your chest. 
As one often finds out about what one likes rather through euphoria than through disphoria.
That is a mood my dude. The first day wearing it out of costume will also be anxious and the first few times wearing it in public. Its worth a try and even if you decide you dont like it you could always just use for costumes or donate to a thrift store. 

If you have issues with anxiety or sensory issues and are buying from gc2b i recommend getting the racer back half tank. It puts less pressure on the shoulder blades and reduces the added anxiety from the compression.
bc rn I wanna cry after telling myself my birth name and I just I feel like I'm having another identity crisis
I used the bandages long ago, I'm fine it was only about twice I used those and only during Halloween. I think looking at my chest with a big shirt on and no bra gives me a bit of euphoria or is enough for me but I guess I haven't experienced euphoria yet I mean I did when someone said I gave off he/they vibes. I did always want a binder but now I'm not so sure with all these feelings but I think when I can I'll get a binder and just try it and try not to dwell on it rn
I don't really have sensory issues just anxiety is an absolute twat. when I get the money I'd probably get a nude half cut from gc2b. that's the one I mostly want out of all them. I can still feel despite the anxiety I wouldn't mind getting a binder and wearing it rarely when I feel like it. if I end up not liking the binder I'd donate it.
Can you try other names or a variation of your birth name? Sometimes we simply don’t identify with what we were given at birth and that’s ok. It doesn’t even have to be a real name! Just something that’s easier to identify with.
Yes! Good luck in finding out what's best for you!
I actually already have two names I picked out. people online and irl LGBT group has been calling me those names and it just feels better. I think my main issue is I'm fighting against myself and fighting against my anxiety instead of accepting the fear that I'm gonna leave behind my birthname despite that it's scary it's probably going to happen since I like my other names better, I just need to accept that it's okay if I start disliking parts of my body, and I need to accept things. I've been overthinking and overwhelming myself bc I'm afraid
thank you
It’s a wild journey to be sure. I’m glad you’ve got a support system.
thank you. I guess I'm also like ""I never wanted this to happen or expect it to happen"" but one thing led to another and I'm here and I'm glad for this journey because I feel more and more like myself but I want to ask you for validation?
I’m happy to validate"	pus63k	NonBinary	9	1.0	2021-09-24 20:42:59
Passports And Travel	"Ive put off renewing my passport because the thought of having to check the F box utterly repulses me, but it isn't safe to travel with an X, isn't safe in my mind to have the government know I am not F (what if the next president is as bad as the former disgrace? What if being trans becomes as illegal as an abortion?) 
I guess I just need a hug, and some support checking that godawful box I don't belong in but stay in for my safety. I'm so tired of being reduced to ""she"""	"I feel the frustration and you’re right to be concerned. I’m updating my docs to X because I feel like it’s an important affirmation for me. I do have concerns too and I’ll likely never travel to certain states again (Florida/Texas). 

But I also know regardless of what box I check those types of authoritarian violent political actors will try to come for me anyways. If not for my gender for my political beliefs, my spiritual believes or lack there of, my racial ancestry, any reason they can think of that doesn’t make me one of them. 

So it’s alright to do what feels safe for yourself. Safety is the most important thing. But also if you do decide you don’t want to see that F on your documents you’re not the only one. 

We can’t plan for every disaster or avoid every risk so you just have to belief it will turn out ok or you will be able to find a way to deal with it if that dystopian future fully arrives. 

There is so much out of our control like the pandemic taught us. That’s why part of me just wants to live my life now while I have the chance. But again following the same analogy you need to act smart and keep your safety in mind. 

Either way sending you love and understanding 🌈💜🌈💜🌈

idk rant or help	so my friend, who is the only person im out to, asked if i want to be introduced to her friends as Rae (my chosen name) but im worried that a) people will, ya know, judge me and all that, or b) that my parents will somehow find out and im not out to them and i cant safely be out so what should i do? I feel like i have to choose between my safety and my happiness and it succkkks. im going to a thing with her and some people i dont know in a couple days and im so conflicted. i really like when people use my name but i cannot under any circumstances have my parents find out im enby	"I'd say, you should go for it! You don't know these people, so its unlikely that they'll talk to your parents. And if they do, you can always explain to them beforehand the situation, or that you'd prefer to be referred to by -name- and/or -pronouns- around certain people. As long as you explain that you don't feel comfortable/haven't come out to them yet, most people should be fairly understanding! It's a gamble, but most of the time its worth it, in my experience.  


I completely understand the fear of being judged, but that's always a risk. People are often nicer than you'd expect, and even if you do run into a couple of bad eggs, it should in no way invalidate you. And, if things go badly with those people, you always have your friend who you *know* supports you! You have a couple of days to think about it, but I think you should go with whatever makes you feel the most comfortable. Whether that be coming out to these people or not, its ultimately your choice. Maybe coming out to them could be a positive experience for you!   


No matter what you choose, I wish you the best of luck! <33

Does anyone on T feel a sense of loss but not regret when you transition?	"I identify as gender fluid (any pronouns) and I've been on low dose testosterone for about a year now. I really love the subtle changes that have happened in my body and I feel much more comfortable in my gender identity. However, some days I wonder if I regret/miss my life before.

My face and body has changed to a point where I feel less attractive or desirable. Sometimes I miss the femininity, or maybe just the feeling of safety. Being androgynous is really stressful in public spaces such as the gym, swimming pool, etc.

Has anyone else felt a heavy sense of loss and relief at the same time with testosterone?"	"to some degree i've wondered what i might have looked like and how i might've been able to be seen as a girl more if i wanted, but i know ultimately T was the only choice for me
i have often wonder what my life would have been like if i lived my teen years out as a girl and how pretty i would have been if i didn't start t and stuff. i did feel like loss. like she was upset at me for putting her through all this pain and stuff. i don't feel that way anymore. but i think it's common especially with all the terrible stuff you see about trans people.
i'm about 4 years on t and just got top surgery so everything is actually starting to make sense and come together. but i did spend a lot of my first years feel very unattractive and then upset because it felt like everyone else started t and felt better you know. when i started exploring with my femininity again (i am quite a girly boy) i felt so ugly:/ my friend said something to me tho  how about how we connect femininity to things like cleanness and long hair and nice skin and you know just like stupid Beauty expectations of women. so like ur on t you're getting all hairy and you're sweaty, you don't feel cute. i mean  you spend your life being fed this stuff and now even tho you're like yes i'm not a girl and i know that this stuff is stupid. now that you're like really going against it, it's just weird. i hated having facial hair for so long because on days i wanted to wear makeup and dresses it would make me feel so ugly, even though it brought me so much euphoria. i hope this made sense. what you're feeling is really normal just maybe not talked about enough:/
i feel this exact same way. sometimes, i wish i could switch back to my old body for a day, and see how it feels compared to this. i don’t think we quite imagined just how stressful it would be to exist in public after the changes
Hey, can I ask you what changes have you had with the low dose? I haven't started on T yet because I'm super insecure but I was thinking of starting with a low dose
It's a weird space to be as someone who doesn't identify as trans. Like you mentioned, sometimes I feel like I let her down so he/they could thrive.

enby dysphoria	"so , i'm an afab enby ( they / void pronouns ) and recently I've been dealing with a lot more dysphoria than usual
for example , my mum ( who knows me as he / they since i use those pronouns irl for safety reasons ) was talking to me about ballet and saying "" You're going to be so muscly like male dancers ! "" and i don't know if im being petty , but this made me upset
i don't want to be seen as muscly , i agree that dancers are incredibly strong and i want to build that strength , but i want to be lean and tall and skinny and look like a dead Victorian / hypothetical / srs ?
i don't know really how to describe it but whenever i think of myself as anything other than just a kind of void floating in time , I just feel sad
i get so much dysphoria , especially over my face and chest ( my "" bottom dysphoria "" doesn't bother me as much as it used to , it's literally somewhere you use to piss ) and i know its all wrong but i can't do anything to change it and hhh .
I don't know , this is a long rant and it's literally quarter to 6 in the morning .
My point is that I am just sad and feel like a lanky , pale Victorian skeleton looking void person / srs / pos ?

advice is not necessarily needed here , I just wanted to rant for a while"		t72p5q	NonBinary	9	1.0	2022-03-05 05:45:04
Questioning to come out or no because of the angst and anxiety caused by my mom.	"Hi everyone. Sorry in advance, this is long.

Okay so I'm a 22 years old non binary pansexual (they/them) and I live alone with my mom, i have no other choice for monetary reasons. We have a pretty good relationship but we have some problems sometimes. She is really loud and I'm really quiet, many times she doesn't understand me or doesn't listen (she is so absort in her thoughts or what she is doing that she actually seems to fisically not listen), this has made me really tired since talking takes so much effort from me and repeating myself or having to talk loudly takes too much energy and time. Many times I find myself trapped in a repetitive conversation (monologue of her i'd say) while i'm deeply uninterested but nodding out of respect so that she doesn't feel lonely too.

Many of these times my mom has told me questionable things about my bisexual brother or other lgbtq+ topics not knowing about me being lgbtq myself, which has made me very insecure and overly conscious about everything I do. Even if she is trying to learn about lgbtq+ topics so she can be more respectful, she still has a lot of work to do and i understand, she is just starting to interact with our world. The problem is that she gets REALLY worried and overthinks an questions everything when it comes to her family, like someone coming out or just having different tastes in clothes (for example a cis man that wears femme clothes). I know she is mostly worried about safety because she knows about hate crimes and injustice but I can clearly see that she has many lgbtq-phobic (? is that how you say that?) thoughts and she really would've prefered to have a ""normal son"".

All of this has made me lock myself, my sexuality and identity because I don't want her to suffer and don't want to feel lowkey rejected by her even if I know she will still love me as her child. I don't feel sure and safe enough to come out but since I'm 0 starting to fisically become my truest self she is now starting to make all this questions and even worry about what I wear. 

A few days ago she told me I shouldn't wear ""that shirt"" because it makes me look too masculine (i was afab), that my clothes make me look like a lesbian and that it's ok if i have ""other tastes"" and that if i told her she would understand. 
That's when I got really mad because she was basically pressuring me to come out. I just told her i felt comfortable and happy in those kind of clothes and that it has nothing to do with my sexuality.
She took this as a ""I'm not lesbian"" and told me she just wanted me to be happy and that she just thinks i shouldn't dress as something I'm not. ""Maybe someday you'll like some guy and he won't aproach you because he might think you're something you're not"".
The fking flames of hell were burning inside of me but I just told her ""I'm happy mom, thank you"" while being very obviously mad, sad and uncomfortable.
I avoided explaining about gender and gender expression and all of that as self defense so that she wouldn't have more reasons to think I'm not straight or cis. Might sound stupid because I am actually not straight or cis, but the thing is, we shouldn't force people to come out and even if i wanted to i wasn't gonna do it because she demanded so. 

She also asked why my nails were so short even if i've kept them short all my life.

She is now questioning everything i do, and even i she doesn't say a word I can see her face questioning (very expressive, she can't lie). I've been forced by myself to wear more feminine clothes all the time so I can avoid the topic as much as I can.





TW for the next paragraph: Self harm and depression
You can skip to the next one.
__________

I know I'm lucky because some of you face terrible things and this might seem not that important but I'm just so upset, I've cried everyday since that conversation happened. I even thought of telling her that I've survived this long time depression just so that she won't suffer, or else i would've been hanging out there somewhere long time ago. Adding she should at least let me get some happiness from clothing.
__________





I know many things have no sense here but the question is. What should I do? 
I am not ready to come out. She is still trying to figure out trans men and women, she wouldn't understand nonbinary. And she still thinks bisexual people are actually just gays and lesbians. 
But I also can't stand this anymore, I'm hurt and because of this we're fighting often about other things too. Should I just come out and cause her pain? Also making her keep the secret and pain to herself because i just don't wanna come out to the rest of the family?
Is there a way that I can help her understand without making me come out or face this strong emotions and reactions she has??

This is bothering me a lot and i feel lonely and trapped. I was gonna publish this in lgbtq mental health subreddit but for some reason i feel at home here because y'all are so nice.

I'll appreciate any discussion, sugestion or experience about this. Hope y'all are living your best life 🌻"		rjsjz3	NonBinary	7	1.0	2021-12-19 08:33:17
help on how to get a binder?	"hi guys! i’m sars (they/them) i’m AFAB and recently have been having a ton of dysphoria, did something stupid the other day and tried to use an ace bandage to bind (yes i know, a big no no) and i’m still a little sore from it.
my home life is extremely toxic and homophobic, so i’m only officially out to my best friend as non binary and bi, does anyone have any tips on how to bind safety at home without a binder? (my financial situation is very tricky as i’m 17 and with covid i can’t get a job) or resources where i could get a binder discreetly?"	"It isnt the best but it helped enough for me until i could afford a binder. Try wearing a sports bra and a tighter fitting tank top. As long as you dont run down stairs or exercise in it your boobs will stay down. Im a size DD so they still showed but i tried to visualize them as muscley pecks. Good luck, i know it can be hard but you will eventually get to where you can bind without worry.
Hey, I have an old Underworks binder ([size 36 BCD](https://smile.amazon.co.uk/dp/B019LT1L3U/ref=cm_sw_r_cp_apa_i_iL7pFbZRY2RAP))  which I'd be happy to send you if it's the right size. It still has a lot of life left in it (I switched over to a GC2B one shortly after buying it!)... It looks just like a crop top so it won't look suspicious. Feel free to drop me a DM if you're interested 😊
Howdy!

My partner and I (enby, afab) both use KT tape to bind. There are many many youtube videos on how to do it correctly and safely, and KT tape is something you wear for like, ~3 days in a row. Easy to hide from parents, safe, and though it might not get you a *flat* chest, it comes real close!

I highly suggest doing some research on it (specifically queer info/guides to using it) and try it out if it sounds right for you!
I recently found a [magical sports bra](https://www.target.com/p/women-s-medium-support-wide-strap-bra-all-in-motion/-/A-77640871?preselect=77285249#lnk=sametab) for 15-20 bucks at Target. It flies very under the radar but works pretty darn well to minimize my chest. It has a snug fit and the straps are adjustable in a unique way that lets you choose exactly how much smoosh and flatten you want. 

I have pretty persistent boobs, so I wasn't expecting much, but I needed a binder alternative for an impromptu family camping trip so I gave it a shot. Sizing wise, I'm usually somewhere around a 32D-34C. I got a medium and a small, and took the little foam cups out immediately. The medium is as comfortable as any sports bra. I can wear it all day, and it still somehow flattens me out pretty well under a button-up. And I was totally floored that the small (while less comfy and I'd probably limit the time I wear it) works almost as well as my binder under t shirts. I definitely recommend this for people who are looking for binder alternatives at a lower cost and more under the radar. Good luck!!
Kinesiology tape. You can find it in like a cvs or Walgreens. It’s skin safe and stretchy. There you tube vids on how to place it. I know cosplayers use it to wear open button ups. Just please PLEASE remember to cover up your nips and the area around them. It’s so sensitive when you try to take it off.
I think some binder sites deliver descretly, I know gc2b ships without telling what is in the package and their binders start at about 33-35 us dollars.
okay cool! thanks 💞
This is what I've always done.  Or if I didn't want to wear a bra at all (because it makes my lymph nodes under my arms swell regardless of what kind it is, idk why) I would just wear two tighter fitting tanks and then something over that if i didn't want to just go out in tanks.
thank you! i’ll definitely check it out!
ahh this is so helpful! thank youu!"	iduqe0	NonBinary	7	1.0	2020-08-21 11:06:30
Coming to terms and coming out	"Hey, this is my first actual post on this sub due to me just recently fully coming to terms with my gender identity. I’m 17, AMAB, and def still more on the masc side of the spectrum, but I’ve realized I’m something that can’t be defined by a binary. So far I’ve come out to three of my closest friends and I’m probably gonna come out to my little sister next.  My immediate family should be pretty accepting (as my dad has eased up on the toxic masculinity in recent years), but when it starts getting to my grandparent, I’m terrified. And there’s the fact that I come from a deeply conservative and Catholic extended family that DEFINITELY would ridicule me if I came out. Not to mention coming out fully to everyone. I live in semi-rural Indiana so I’m scared for my very safety in some ways. I think I’m going to pretend to be the cishet guy I’ve been masquerading since middle school (when even then I knew wasn’t entirely straight). I’m then gonna fully come out to the whole world once I go elsewhere for college. 

I’m just wanting any tips for surviving this next year and a half that I have to live in the cornfields closeted. Also, if you know any enby friendly colleges that you would know of. 

And for less serious but still very appreciated, I’d like some beginner makeup tips as I’ve never even painted my nails before in my life and I really want to start expressing myself that way. Thanks so much in advance!"		ek83x7	NonBinary	9	1.0	2020-01-05 04:35:49
maybe it was just a phase	"hi, my name's margo, i'm 15, and i've identified as non-binary for a few years now. but recently, i'm starting to feel more comfortable with my original female gender and pronouns. i'm going to take a little while to think this over, but i think that for me, being non-binary really was just a phase

i'm not upset or embarrassed, i was really uncomfortable with my womanhood when i decided to abandon it, and i think non-binary was sort of a safety net for me while i worked through my issues. i think it's given me a better understanding of the community, i've become more empathetic. i just wanted anyone else in my situation to know that there's nothing wrong with going back to your birth gender

i don't really know what to do now, i've never had a great understanding of the whole concept of gender since it's so abstract, but i miss being a girl yk, it was pretty cool. has any of this happened to any of you?"	At 15 you're definitely still exploring yourself.  Take your time and know that nothing is wrong (:	11km8l0	NonBinary	6	0.88	2023-03-07 02:22:21
Androgel Secondary Exposure	I just wanted to share my story about my experience using Androgel while living with 2 dogs and my partner. I have been using Androgel (low dose topical testosterone gel) for a couple months, making sure to follow recommended safety precautions ie. applying gel after showers and putting on a T-shirt once the gel dries to prevent transfer, washing hands after application.  About a couple weeks ago, my partner and I noticed a few changes. First off, my partner started noticing the physical changes expected from a low dose of testosterone. We also noticed change in the behavior and overall health of our dogs (spontaneous aggression, weight gain, increased libido, fatigue, increased thirst/hunger, increased muscle mass). Since realizing that it is a result of secondary exposure from my gel, we have isolated ourselves from the dogs and anything we’ve come in contact with.  Since we have separated ourselves from the animals, their symptoms have subsided and I am switching to injections.  I wanted to post this here to put the word out to others in case secondary exposure might be a concern. The effects were increasing with time, and it worries me that there doesn’t seem to be a lot of information or warning about the potential harmful effects out there. I’m also wondering if anyone has had a similar experience and further insight.		ktbho2	NonBinary	7	1.0	2021-01-08 20:51:54
"Enbies - how do you feel about the idea of ""passing?"""	"I realize that ""passing"" in a nonbinary context means very different things to different people, so I'd like to specify that here, I'm talking about the binary trans notion of ""passing"" or being ""stealth,"" as being able to hide your trans-ness in everyday life. 

Here's the personal context I guess! I only recently came to the realization (haha summer 2020) that I was anything other than cisgendered, and it kind of, just a tad, made me reconsider everything about my life. I'm currently studying in a very conservative academic field, and I know that authority figures in the administration are TERFs. Being read as cis all the time is exhausting as heck, but it's not the safest space to come out in, or present more visibly queer, and I've been holding off. 

All this to say, I've been wrestling with the idea that to live out in the open as a nonbinary trans person, to avoid being misgendered constantly, I would have to come out in just about every new space I enter. There doesn't seem to be a way for nonbinary people to have their gender validated, and to be ""passing"" at the same time. Existing outside of the gender binary, and ""passing"" as cisgendered, frankly, seem inherently contradictory. And that's difficult, because I've wanted to be ""normal"" or intelligible to people, to fit into a box that people understand. It feels like there's a choice between safety and validation. 

What are your thoughts? Does this also bother you? Do you think of ""passing"" and being nonbinary in a completely different way?"	"this is only tangentially related to what you're going into, but I don't like the concept of ""passing"", because it's so often used as like, ""getting away"" with something, and it puts the onus on the trans person to change themselves. instead I prefer to say, ""being read as my gender"", because that changes the camera to the people around me. it's *their* fault that they don't see me for my gender, not mine. (also passing is very culturally contingent. i can't be seen as anything other than a woman when I wear skinny jeans in the South, but that's not the case in more metropolitan areas.)
> being read as cis all the time is exhausting as heck

Damn, I guess our mileage *does* vary lmao. I’m exhausted of the general population treating me like garbage, I’m always shocked to find people that actually *want* that. 

Being non-binary and not being “visibly trans” are not contradictory concepts. Gender is internal and we really should abandon the idea that you can tell someone’s gender solely by looking at them. 

That being said, it’s not possible to “pass” as non-binary in most societies anyway. To pass as a gender you have to be perceived as fitting into an existing social niche, which for the overwhelming majority of places, consist of only men and women. Minus the very, very few of us that manage to exist in total androgyny, we’re all going to get pushed into one or the other unless we say otherwise.
that sounds tough! it really sucks you have to choose between safety and validation, that does seem like a no win situation. especially if you love what you’re studying! but i do know you’re definitely not alone in wrestling with that. 
as someone already pointed out the whole concept of “passing” is kinda a bummer. but also def does affect how ppl treat us.  

personally, i feel like i’m “passing” as non-binary if a stranger is really confused about my gender or if i get he & she pronouns from different strangers on the same outing. but both of those experiences involve strangers using the wrong pronouns for me (i’m a they), so it’s a somewhat bittersweet experience. 

i do feel like i eventually made some kind of peace with knowing most people aren’t going to instinctively understand my gender and pronouns. i think i feel okay about it because i used to be so confused about my gender, i feel kinda empathetic to people who are also confused, if that makes sense? 

and honestly after spending such an enormous amount of energy caring what people think about my gender for a long time, i feel like i eventually burnt out and am now satisfied with knowing i know who i am (i didn’t always.) 

that said i’m privileged to be in a part of the US where i don’t feel like being visibly trans puts my safety at risk most of the time. and i also have spaces where people who care about me do consistently use the right pronouns for me, so that makes it a lot easier to be misgendered all the time in public. and gives me hope for a future where being nonbinary is seen as totally normal and intelligible to the masses!
I feel like I 'pass' but in way I feel like I'm 'cishet passing' as I wear casual clothing and not 'alt' fashion in public like every other enby on the internet. I'm also in a 'hetero passing' relationship with my boyfriend (even though he's nonbinary too, but makes no 'effort' to 'pass' and is perceived as cishet all the time). To summarise, the concept of passing has hurt me more than it has uplifted me.
I agree passing, as Nonbinary has sat on my head before. I never really understood it much, but the idea of needing to Pass, seems like im internally gatekeeping.
Passing for me is being derply gender ambiguous. When people gender me there's generally a question mark in their tone like, hello...uh...sir/ma'am?
I don't tell everyone my pronouns just not safe
Tbh, I prefer the concept of reading. I am being read a certain way I am however always my gender no matter how I'm read.
I'm genderfluid and passing as the binary genders does have meaning for me, but anything else is, yeah, less of a thing, and it sucks.

I'm told that people refer to me by ""they"" by default a lot of the time so that's nice.
This a good way to frame it. I feel weird about the concept of ""passing,"" too, and I'm trying to work out why. This comment helps clarify it for me. I've seen ""passing"" equated to ""lying"" in some cases, and this bothers me. It's not the ""passing"" person's fault that someone makes an incorrect assumption about them.

You leave some interesting, knowledgeable comments. Every time I like one, I notice, ""Oh, hey, it's that be\_they\_do\_crimes person again.""
Thanks for this, I hadn't thought about it like that, and I think what you said makes a lot of sense. I wish in our lifetimes, we could get to the point where people generally don't assume someone's gender on the basis of outward appearance. But hey, in the meantime, at least there's this reddit.
I don't know how much it means, coming from an internet stranger, but I'm sorry that you're having to deal with people being dickwads. Basic human decency should be the lowest hurdle >:/

I should clarify - when I said ""being read as cis,"" what I meant was, being read as my assigned at birth gender. And wanting to be read in a way that conforms with how I feel on the inside. I guess in that sense, I'm a little jealous of binary trans people? To potentially have the option of being able to be read as my gender, without having to come out first, would be a huge thing. It might be lame of me to be so caught up over this, or fuck, I dunno, maybe it's internalized transphobia from a lifetime of living in a cisnormative society, but people look at you differently when you come out as anything other than cis and the thought is majorly anxiety-inducing. 

I guess from another angle, that's also one of the cool things about being nb, that we can fall anywhere on the visible gender spectrum. I'm still coming to terms with being nb, and I guess over-complicating everything while I try to understand it!

So this uh, isn't exactly a very direct reply to your comment. I appreciate it tho, it's good to get a sense of what other people are thinking about our place in society. I agree with what you said about being pushed into binary categories... yeah, that's just life in most places I guess : /
What you said makes me want to change my hair and go out and do my level best to confuse the masses. When the plague dies down a bit, maybe... I used to keep a record of all the times baristas accidentally mistook me for the opposite gender, before the egg cracked. Hindsight lol

It's reassuring to hear that other people are going through the same thing, and to hear that you've been able to make peace with it on some level. I'm not quite there yet... gotta give it time, I guess. 

Or hey, maybe the concept of gender will implode sometime in the near future and free all of us from its yoke. Fingers crossed I guess..!
Alt fashion does seem to be really big in this community. I think it's pretty rad, but def not great to have that pressure to conform to a certain style on top of everything else. Thanks for commenting. I can imagine (... given that I'm not out, haha.......) how much it sucks to constantly be read as something you're not. For what it's worth, I think it's cool as hell that you and your bf are both nb tho!
oh, hey thanks I appreciate that!
I understand the appeal for alt fashion as it's creative purpose is to mock gender roles. But it's also quite expensive and hard to get if you don't live n an area or country that has a high alt community. Honestly, I feel like I don't deserve to come out, I'm still living the same life and wearing the same clothes when I was cishet. I feel like nobody will take me seriously as a nonbinary/genderfluid person as I still use she/her pronouns. Funnily enough, when I came out to my bf he just went ""Same"" it's made us a lot closer"	l1q024	NonBinary	7	1.0	2021-01-21 03:30:28
My college is so accepting!!!	I’ve been out as bi but deep in the closet about being nonbinary for years since I know the odds are my family will never respect it. I’ve just in the past month moved to start attending college at Texas State University and I’ve been blown away at how accepting everyone has been!! Teachers and students alike ask everyone’s pronouns and consistently respect them, i was so thrown off guard since I’ve been living in a relatively small (but growing!!) town in Texas and while most young people would try to be respectful of queer people nobody was super visibly out for safety’s sake. I ended up coming out as nb almost as an accident to an RA and just decided then that I was gonna stay out. It just feels incredible knowing that people here will respect who I am, and if anyone doesn’t then I know that the majority of the people I’ve met here will back me up. This just feels incredible!! If any of you here are considering public universities in Texas then keep Texas state in mind because this is the safest I’ve ever felt about being out. Go bobcats!!!!!	I’m so glad that’s been your experience! It’s super heartening to hear. #deepInTheHeartofTexas ❤️	d8gz30	NonBinary	8	1.0	2019-09-24 02:30:11
Any advice for a first barbershop cut? (afab, they/them)	I got my hair cut short at a salon a couple months back, and now it needs a trim but I'm not keen on going back to the same place.  As far as I can tell, the place I'm thinking of switching to is pretty inclusive so I'm not worried abt safety, but I'm (very) socially awkward and still mostly feminine-presenting. Does anyone who's been in a similar situation have some tips to make it a good experience rather than an awkward one?	"Hello, barber here! 
Is there a specific city/town that you're getting your hair cut at?

name and pronouns at work	"Hey everyone. I've just moved to a new city and recently started a new job. I interviewed for the job the week before I made the decision to change my name (to a nickname I've used for a while). So while everyone I've met in this city now knows me by my nickname, the job uses my birth name as I haven't told them otherwise. Likewise, I felt uncomfortable introducing my pronouns (they/them) at the interview, so now it's a double whammy of them using my birth name and she/her pronouns. I'm masc presenting but still read as female.

I'm now 3 weeks into the job and feel really uncomfortable about bringing it up with everyone, I have no idea how to approach it. Part of my problem is it feels quite trivial or juvenile to bring up, which I know it's not, because it is important to me.

Just to add, I live in a very progressive city and I'm not scared for my safety or being rejected by outing myself. It's more just the discomfort of coming out at work, and it being made a 'big deal' of, or people being awkward about the situation.

Any advice much appreciated. Thanks!  


\*Edit/Update\* - I did it! It felt a little uncomfortable but my colleagues immediately started using my pronouns and correct name. It feels amazing! "	"It's better to rip the band-aid off now than to wait untill they are 100% used to the wrong thing. It's not childish, you're fine.
They can't get rid of you for being trans. I did my first 2 years of work under my birth name/not caring about pronouns. After a point I just signed off on an email with Jay (she/they/he) and got a few phone calls from supervisors right away. I said that I'm more comfortable with Jay and while prefer they/them am okay with any pronouns. Within the month they changed my name on forms, the employee wall and when addressing me. My email and tax stuff still has my legal name but everyone respects it. I was scared too as my parents often said I'd scare a lot of clients away if I came out. No such thing, I only had one client step back and it was due to scheduling and not expression (they were a very religious family too)"	11s0nhf	NonBinary	7	1.0	2023-03-15 16:01:00
Binding safety and identity questions from a moderately confused cis(??) gal	"Hi nonbinary pals! I have large breasts (36J) and I do not like them very much, so I bought a gc2b binder. It came in a few days ago and I wore it yesterday and today and I love it! It’s not perfect, but it does a pretty damn good job at flattening everything down considering what I started with. I can finally wear the men’s button down shirts I’ve always wanted to wear and they actually fit and don’t look stupid! Plus it feels like a super secure hug all day. Also, it’s much less irritating than a bra (no straps or wires to dig into me)!

I did do a bit of research and I know not to wear it for more than 8-10 hours in a day, don’t sleep or exercise in it, and don’t wear it every single day. I do have some more safety questions though:

- Could wearing a binder occasionally (once or twice a week MAX) as I intend to do cause any issues re: permanent breaking down/reshaping of breast tissue or damage to my ribs? Or is that mostly an issue for people who bind more frequently?

- Does the positioning of the breast tissue under the binder affect safety? 

Also, I have some more identity-oriented questions for y’all!

- How do you differentiate between top dysphoria vs. disliking your breasts for a different reason?

- How do you differentiate gender identity from gender expression? I’m chill with my assigned pronouns and genitals and I don’t reeeally mind being seen as feminine, but I also don’t really feel... *strongly* feminine, ya know? Like I don’t love wearing makeup or nail polish, don’t love shaving my body hair, etc.. I don’t know whether that just means I don’t present as femme as the average cis girl or whether I might consider identifying as a demigirl or something. Basically I don’t understand gender as a concept and I don’t really see how it’s useful and aaaaaaa

I don’t know whether any of this is influenced by the fact that I’m also aro/ace and strongly do not want to be seen as a sexual being?? Like maybe I wish my boobs were less obvious to decrease the likelihood of someone looking at them?? I don’t know. Everything is confusing."	"1. There shouldn’t be any problems if you plan on binding only a few times a weak unless you have a preexisting condition that causes your ribs to be weak.

2. Pushing chest tissue in unnatural positions can cause damage to the tissue

3. I don’t know

4. Gender identity is who you are. Gender expression is how you express yourself. If a man wears a dress he doesn’t become a woman. If a woman presents masculine she doesn’t become a man. (You might be gender apathetic)
 
Edit: I’m an aroace nonbinary and my orientations don’t affect my gender but some people’s orientation(s) do
for safety: nipples pointing forward under the binder! not smushed down to the sides. 

also “i don’t understand gender as a concept and don’t understand how it’s useful”. tbh, same. everyone has different opinions on this, but i think all of gender is a spectrum because it’s a made up construct. i’ve stopped focusing on my “gender identity” and only focus on my expression/alleviating dysphoria. to me, there’s no “real” hard line between what you feel and what non binary/trans people feel. like you’re a cis person who seems to have dysphoria and there’s non-binary people on this sub who say they don’t have dysphoria, which just shows none of it is cut and dry. i’m pretty chill with my assigned pronouns also but i’ve been on T over a year and had top surgery - does that make me cis? no. it’s all kind of made up tbh. just do whatever makes you feel comfortable and happy and don’t worry about having to figure out your identity if it’s not important to you to do so. 💖"	i2qejg	NonBinary	7	0.9	2020-08-03 04:12:01
Pronouns	"
I recently started school and in one of my classes we had to think of rules for the class. One of the rules that I thought up was everyone needs to respect everyone else’s chosen name and pronouns. we were doing this in small groups and one of the people in my group asked me if I have pronouns, I said “of course everyone has pronouns!” they asked me what mine are in a seemingly accusatory tone and I panicked and said “I don’t know, they/them he/him”. I’m assigned male at birth and questioning whether I am non-binary but I’m kind of scared now because that was suspicious and I fear discrimination. For context in that same class before class Another kid was waving a trump flag and sporting a trump hat so I fear for my safety. What the fuck do I do.

I am on mobile and I use dictation because I’m too stressed to write properly so please excuse anything weird."	"Stay calm. If people sense that you are confident and it’s no big deal they are less likely to make a big deal out of it. Remember you’ve done nothing to feel guilt for. It’s totally normal to question your identity and you owe nobody an explanation
I've learned that if you aren't confident or comfortable with yourself, either no one will take you seriously, or they will make things harder for you by picking on or bullying you in some way.

I think it goes to show that not everyone will think the same. Just because someone might not agree, doesn't mean you have to back down. 

If you take a stance by being firm in yourself, even if you are questioning, and taking to consideration what your options are if something does happen. Then you'll be fine.

Try to address this with the instructor, or the admin about this concern if you really do think something will happen. Or have any adult you trust have your back. No on really likes going against am authoritative figure, especially if it's a kid, like a student vs an adult, like a teacher or even the principal.
I’m just scared
I certainly get that. I live in the South and have had plenty of confrontation about who I am. Being someone who’s easily gets panic attacks over confrontation for much of my life I was scared and accepted guilt before I was ever accused of something because I couldn’t handle my fear. But now that I am working on managing my fear and guilt it has gotten much better. Take your time and remember you can always throw accusations back onto someone else make sure they know you’ve done nothing wrong and that it’s wrong of them to be accusatory or unaccepting of your identity. It takes time and practice but you’ll get there"	iu9vhk	NonBinary	7	1.0	2020-09-17 01:51:58

I'm getting my hair cut!!!	"I have an appointment on Thursday to get my hair cut. I've been struggling with my gender for a long time now and finally told my therapist how serious it has gotten. I literally cry if I look in the mirror too long because what I look like doesn't correlate with who I am. So I finally worked up the courage to start trying to change that, regardless of what others think.

I got my first binder and I'm obsessed with it (don't worry, I'm following all of the safety guidelines on how long to wear it and everything). I actually bought clothes from the ""men's"" section instead of just going to try stuff on. And I'm going to try a more androgynous hairstyle. I'm excited, but also scared because what if it looks great in the pictures on the internet, but doesn't look good on me? I'm a bit bigger and have a very feminine face shape, so I'm nervous. But I know it doesn't matter as long as I like it. So I'm going to go for it.

I made the mistake of telling my mom that I'm getting it cut, but didn't show her the pictures. She said that I better not come home looking like a boy. I'll probably get an earful, but hopefully, it'll be fine. I'm sure she won't do anything too drastic over a haircut, especially since my oldest sister had a ""men's"" cut when she was my age.

I'm really excited! Maybe soon I'll finally start liking the way I look!"		nvhf0d	NonBinary	6	1.0	2021-06-08 23:14:46

Feminization and Safety: Experiences?	"Hi everyone, I'm an AMAB transfemme (nonbinary woman) of color (non-white light-skin latinx) who has been navigating the world for a few years now as visibly gender nonconforming. It is a privilege that I have a supportive community around me and am able to express myself in the ways that are most affirming to me, but these transgressions against the gender binary and racialization often lead me to experience objectification, sexualization, fetishization, transmisogyny, discrimination, and violence at some pretty high levels. I have not gone on HRT, as I don't think that is the best option for me, but I am still considering feminizing myself and am exploring my options. I am particularly looking into getting a BBL (Brazilian Butt lift) to provide my figure with more curves, but hesitate with that decision when considering my overall safety and how I would navigate the world post-BBL.

I would love to hear from other folk who perhaps have gone through this procedure and/or exist with a curvacious figure and no breasts, about their experiences with navigating the world and safety. Did anything change after going through with the procedure? Did it complicate navigating public and gendered spaces even more?"		kb9r1l	NonBinary	6	0.88	2020-12-11 19:43:47
Assigned at birth vs. Now	"I'm hoping someone on here maybe feels the same way I do about this- I came out as non-binary just a couple months ago, for context. I'm AFAB, and grew up in pretty feminine roles and expectations. I experienced all the catcalling, harrassment, sexism, you name it. Now that I'm out though, I'm not quite sure how to talk about/feel about the things I experienced because of ""being a girl"" growing up without misgendering myself, or giving people a reason to see me as a girl. A part of me and how I see the world is always going to be affected by the gender I was raised as and experienced as a child and teen, but I haven't quite figured out how that fits in to who I am now. Unfortunately I've seen in lots of LGBTQ+ spaces that often non binary people or gender queer people are seen as women ""lite"" and I don't want to be a part of that or help that idea in any way because it is very stupid, obviously. Has anyone else figured out a way to reconcile how their assigned gender growing up affected them and their life without it being actively a part of who you are now? I'm always going to think ""like a girl"" when it comes to personal safety, women's issues in general- how do I make that a part of who I am now? Sorry for the long ramble. 
TL;DR- reconciling how your assigned gender at birth affects your perception of the world"	"If I’m talking about a situation where I’ve been sexualized/harassed like you describe, I usually say that so-and-so sees me as a woman, or people in general see me as a woman, therefore they treat me as a sex object. That makes it clear that I don’t feel like a woman but other people around me still behave as if I am.
It’s been really helpful and affirming for me to talk to other trans people without a cis audience (ie, in private chats or in person not on message boards where we’re afraid something we say may be used against us later as a gotcha to ignore or invalidate some other conversation). There’s realities of what I have lived through and what my also trans wife has lived through that have been different or similar, and getting to talk these out without fear of either judgement or misunderstanding is so so so useful. I know that my therapists in the past also tried to be available to do this but their understanding of the complexity of gender was fairly weak. A good, gender affirming counselor would do in a pinch if there aren’t specific individuals you can trust to be able to hold that you went through life being seen one way and experiencing that without it defining your self but still having an impact on you.

Way less personal, as someone who has to live “as a woman” currently, I find it very helpful to be subbed to MensLib (and I’m sure other spaces exist that I’m unaware of) to gain a nuanced perspective of things that I wasn’t raised to understand. Men there talk a lot openly about the conditioning they experience and the ways that they are misunderstood by women without it being a toxic pool of performative ally ship or self aggrandizement or the typical MRA bs. I also still sub to some spaces specifically for or at least directed at women because it’s useful for me to see the perspectives of (bear with me) actual women vs myself who isn’t one but gets treated as such and is expected to understand women."	lwtexq	NonBinary	7	1.0	2021-03-03 13:04:59
Venting session	"Shaving my head always empowers me but it also scares me. The first time I shaved my head I had just graduated and was 16 years old. I was on my way to the beach when these white bikers called me a f****t and threw beer bottles at me. I went to an amusement park and was called a bald b***h. This happens all the time even with hair. I’ve had a person yell at me outside of my job a few weeks ago “Are you a girl or a guy? Wtf is going on?”

I love my androgyny. I always have. But I’ve been bullied for it. I’ve been beaten for it. Something about shaving my head brings it out even more and sometimes I fear for my safety. Especially after what happened to Samson. My ptsd is always heightened in times like this. 

With everything going on in the world I get afraid. Being brown and trans is like I’m not  even seen as human. Openly using they/them pronouns and expressing the way I do is dangerous but I do it anyway. I don’t really know what the point of this post was I just needed to get some stuff off my chest."		urzyfv	NonBinary	6	1.0	2022-05-18 00:00:17

Transgender Social Support and Health online survey	"&#x200B;

Good morning everyone

My  name is Michael Evitts. I am currently a doctoral candidate in  the  Counseling Psychology Program at Western Michigan University. I am   recruiting participants for a research study for my dissertation under  the supervision of Mary Z. Anderson, PhD. This  study is interested in  understanding the quality of life for transgender  populations living in  the United States. Specifically, I am interested  in how transgender  people feel others have treated them because  of their gender identity, and their perceived level of  support from  people in their lives and how that affects their  psychological  well-being and quality of life. I am interested in this  research topic  because I want to further understand experiences that promote the health  and well-being of transgender individuals.

The  study has been approved by the IRB at Western Michigan University.  A  copy of the approval letter can be provided upon request.  Participants  who qualify are anyone who identifies as   transgender/gender-nonconforming, is at least 14-years-old or older, and   currently lives in the U.S. Participants will also have the  opportunity to enter a drawing to receive one of twenty $25 Amazon Gift  cards for participating in the study. The study is completely anonymous  and will take about 20-30 minutes to complete.

\* How are trans scholars/researchers included in this research work?

Although no trans scholars or researchers are involved in the collection, analysis, and writing of this study, I have consulted with several transgender members of the community to review the questionnaires in my study for feedback on language that might be harmful or insensitive to transgender participants. As a doctoral student in counseling psychology, I have received training in clinical issues and gender identity from doctoral courses on LGBTQ+ issues in counseling and development and workshops at Affirmations, an LGBTQ+ outreach center in Ferndale, Michigan. I have also provided individual therapy to transgender college students. I have also conducted research on prejudice and discrimination in the workplace for LGBT law enforcement and public safety workers at Eastern Michigan University.

\* Who is funding the study? Describe any conflicts of interest.

This study is not funded from any outside source. This study is supervised by Western Michigan University and the Counseling Psychology doctoral program as part of fulfilling my requirements to conduct a dissertation to complete my doctoral program. It is reviewed through Western Michigan’s Human Subjects Institutional Review Board (HSIRB). You may contact the chair, Human Subjects Institutional Review Board (269-387-8293) or the Vice President for Research (269-387-8298) for any questions.

\* ... Describe geographic scope, languages, and intersectional inclusion.

In addition to understanding social support, quality of life, well-being, and affirmation of transgender populations, I am interested in understanding other forms of support transgender people may reach out to. This includes members of one’s racial community, online communities, and spiritual communities. I’m also interested in experiences of stigma and discrimination participants may have experienced. To better understand identity, you will be given two different ways to indicate your gender identity, racial identity, and sexual orientation. The first method will allow you to answer in your own words how you identify. The second method will give participants a list of options and they will be asked to select the options that best represent their identity. In regards to geographic scope, this study is designed in an online survey format so that it can be taken by transgender individuals living in the United States. This study is limited to transgender populations in the U.S. due to U.S. specific sociopolitical factors, such as high unemployment rates, low socioeconomic status, and high rates of prejudice and discrimination having a negative impact on their quality of life.

\* Will the results of this research be published in open access journals or channels?

Yes, the dissertation will be available for public access through Western Michigan University. People can search for the title in Western Michigan University’s library for access to the dissertation.

please share to anyone who might be interested and thanks for your help!

A first date	"Yesterday I (45yof) decided to open a tinder account. I normally put myself down as lesbian because the thought of dating men and having sexual relationships with men physically refuses me due to trauma. This time I opened myself up to men thinking they would have to be a unicorn but if I click with them emotionally then good. I came across someone who was possibly transsexual or non-binary. Every picture of their face however showed them wearing a different mask and I could t help thinking how sad it was that they couldn’t show their face, so I liked their profile and messaged them. We talked for a bit and they asked if we could go get some coffee, that they would even dress as a guy. I explained that they could dress any way they wanted and felt comfortable and we will meet today. 

My adult daughter knows where I’m going for safety so that’s covered. What I wanted to ask was… if you were this person… what would you want from me. What do you wish the other person knew, said or did?"	"Focus the conversation on them as a person, don’t fixate on their gender, gender presentation, or what’s “in their pants”. You wouldn’t ask a cis woman why they’re a woman, or a cis man how big their d-ck is, so don’t do that with a nonbinary person either. Basically, treat them like a human. Compliment appearance only how you would for a cis person, and it’s generally better to compliment things they can make choices about rather than things they can’t control. 

If you don’t get good replies here, try also r/asktransgender or r/mypartneristrans.
Its very sweet of you, to ask here. if you want to compliment them, be aways honest, but rather compliment something, they have put effort in, than something thats a given. Just treat them like everyone else, if the topic comes up, you can askthem about their identity, but it is usually not somethign you would spend ages talkign about or has someone questioned you about being a woman for hours? I wish you all the best :)
I would want intellectual interest. More about thoughts and feelings (:
Thank you for your reply! I can’t imagine ever asking someone so personal a question like what’s between their legs yikes and I’m sad that happens. What I want to know is what kind of person they are, how do they treat people like family and strangers. Do they work or expect someone to support them. Do they thrive on negativity or are they positive."	qrk16k	NonBinary	5	0.86	2021-11-11 12:16:39
Just picked out a name for myself, already came out and started using they/them a few months ago. How should I tell people of my new name?	"My parents were okay with me changing my pronouns but they're still getting used to that. I don't want to drop something like this on them so soon, so when would be a good time to tell them that I'd like to be called ""Raven"" now?

I kind of fucked up coming out the first time and I don't wanna mess this up again. First came out to my sisters over a text and they said that made them scared for my safety (I think they thought I would get harassed or something idk), so I should probably do it in person.

Anybody have any tips for letting people know your new name after already coming out?"	"Congrats on being among us Raven's.  You're the third Raven I know of including myself.  

I think that the name change is gonna be real rough for them.  My mom still slips up sometimes and she's super supportive.  It's never gonna be easy,  but it only gets easier with time.  So I say rip the band aid off and start the process of getting them used to it.
Haha yes I have known like 2 other Ravens! Such a pretty name 🥰

I guess I can tell everyone at Thanksgiving tomorrow. Hey, here's a thought 💡: should I say grace and include something like ""God, I hope everyone in this family will accept me, Raven, for who I am!"" or some cheesy sentiment like that? I mean they already do accept me thankfully so this shouldn't be too much of a stretch but it may be for some.
As much as I love that idea.  I think it'd be better to make it it's own thing.  No jump scares.  Lol
yeah that's probably best 😂

I'll just sit everyone down during the Macy's parade or something. That way everyone can ask questions all at once and I don't have to answer the same thing 20 times!
Very smart to do it with everyone all at once."	r0ipji	NonBinary	6	0.88	2021-11-23 17:43:53
Name?	"So, I've recently been experimenting with the idea that I might be gender fluid. Obviously I'm not certain yet and I'm not sure if I ever will be. However, I've lately been thinking on how the name thing would work.

On the one hand, if I'm gender fluid, I don't need to really change my name. I go by a nickname as is and, generally, it's not the most male name in the world (although it is associated with men). Leaving my name as is would allow me to exist in relative safety in a transphobic household/family- a thing I've been cursed with. This becomes especially crucial the more I'm at home.

But here's the thing: I've been fascinated with the idea of taking a new name.

Even before I thought it might be that I'm genderfluid, it fascinated me. I'm a Thespian by trade so I often find myself responding to names of old characters. I'm not extremely attached to my legal name right now. I think it would be nice to have a name I gave myself. A sort of new start if you will. Or even just a sort of stage name to keep relative anonymity in public (not that I'm famous or expect to be, but hey).

I've been messing with the idea of calling myself Lawrence and not particularly caring about pronouns. I honestly couldn't care less how I'm called pronoun wise- especially since I'm starting to actively seek more effeminate features (painting nails, growing hair out, etc.) 

I'm wondering how some people on here went about the name thing? Did you change it, what did you change it to? If you didn't, why didn't you? Are there groups of people with whom you go by your new name and others with whom you do not? Tell me about it please, I'm looking for others' experiences."	"My friends call me either 'feminine', 'masculine', or neutral versions of my birth name. My transphobic family only knows about my birth name. Just ask your friends to call you Lawrence if you're comfortable with that.
My birth name and the name I use around most of my friends & family is Owen, but recently after about maybe 2 months of identifying as nonbinary I decided I liked the name Quinn, so that's what it says on most of my social media accounts. I haven't told my family yet, and I doubt I'll ever tell my school friends since they don't get my pronouns right nevermind a different name, but my best friend knows about it and it's my nickname on facebook, which feels pretty good!
I like that plan, thank you
I've been considering starting to utilize it on some of my more anonymous accounts. I'm also trashing my current Facebook and getting a new one when I move out so it's certainly possible. Thanks!

i’m getting this weird vibe from someone who’s been in my life for 7+ years	"this person let’s call her pam (not real name btw) and i have known each other since 6th grade, we were both new students and we have the same name so we kind of just gravitated towards each other.  
we went to the same middle and high school till the last 2 years i went to online schooling, we now work at the same place together.   
anyways into the issue, she doesn’t respect my pronouns, i don’t expect customers to respect my pronouns cuz i’m never seeing them again and i don’t want to cause a problem at work, but i expect my friends and people who know me to use my correct pronouns, pam being one of these people and she doesn’t.   
i also identify as a lesbian (i prefer queer tho) and i just have this feeling she’s telling people i’m faking and using me having safety crushes aka “liking” men as an excuse cuz when i told her i’m a lesbian she went “what about…” and named off like 3 “crushes” i had in the past and idk just the way other lgbt people who are friends with her look at me at work makes me feel she’s telling people i’m faking and i have no evidence but it’s just an uncomfortable guy feeling."		pi88h1	NonBinary	5	0.86	2021-09-05 06:56:42
What are some ways that I can signal that I’m enby as someone who is Amab and mostly presents that way for safety?	"Looking for ways I can signal that I’m enby to other enby or lgbt people. I wear a bracelet with the non-binary flag colors, wear makeup (which probably doesn’t count), and do my nails in a fem way. 

I’m Amab and for the most part present that way for safety reasons mostly when I have my kids with me."	"That is always tricky trying to express yourself without exposing yourself in a way that might compromise your safety.  Our culture can dismiss an afab non binary person as  a ""tomboy"" to a point but even that doesn't seem especially safe in some parts of the country.  Amab who present as fem have been called Marys in the past and looked on with a variety of hateful terms. 

Please don't think I am diminishing the struggles of afab or amab non binary folk. We all have both similar and unique struggles regardless of our agab.
Honestly I think you are doing great, those all seem like subtle cues that other enbys would recognize. Subtle jewelry maybe? Eyeliner?
I present gender neutral for safety reasons too. I took to many beatings as a kid. Honestly, my anxiety levels rise whenever I’m in public spaces.
capes, eyeliner, septum piercing, monochrome outfits, shaved head, warm eyes but neutral expression, rings, brimless hats, dress like Vega from Street Fighter
I painted nonbinary flag colors onto my nails. That's pretty obvious and might not feel safe enough to you, but you'd be surprised how many people don't get it.
I like the idea of using accessories in the colors of the nonbinary flag as subtle signs that other enbies plus members and supporters of queer identities might recognize."	11t80kt	NonBinary	5	0.86	2023-03-16 22:13:45
Proud and scared parent of a non binary 10 years old brown kid (Montreal)	"Hello Dears,

This is my first post on reddit, and this is for sharing my questions, concerns, and begging for resources.

I am a proud parent of a bright and wonderful 10 years old kid who early on, while male assigned,  decided that violent and competitive masculinity was not for him. They finds themself in-between girls clubs and boys clubs at school, which is not easy to navigate.

Our darling is our single child, is adopted, brown (white adoptive parents), we are wealthy, and we try giving them  antiracist and feminist education. They as well was diagnosed ADHD and high potential, but issues in bad self-esteem, we are working hard on that.

We run after them, reading and documenting ourselves as quickly as possible. We differentiate sexual orientation (they say they are gay), gender expression (more and more make-up), gender identity (non binary). I sometimes wears skirts because it is physically comfortable (not socially comfortable) and in order to open him up some possibilities but I know it is double edged, I am white, cis, hetero, they have nothing of that.

We struggle with our own upbringing, binary norms, white norms, name it. Even our native French language we are discovering is 10 times more binary than the English language, which breaks our hearts. And we simply can not adopt the doubling (feminine + masculine) of every word in our daily conversations.

We struggle as well with social norms :

Our family norms say sobriety, discretion, not searching attention, are good values. Society says that as well, and also society says ""you should not judge on appearances"" but society practices the contrary, judges people on their outfit and appearance, whole industries strive on ""beauty"", and we all know that ""you can not not communicate"" with the outer world, and that thinking of oneself as alone is delusional and simply false, we are social beings and we all have to deal with norms. We are also brought in the idea that our value is not what we have, not what you show off, but what you do and who we are.

But, I wonder what ""being discreet and ""the gray-person"" means for a brown racialized kid, male assigned. I clearly feel it doesn't work in a white society.

Also, I have the feeling that our kid has the intuition that inhabiting a brown male body is made heavy and sometimes unbearable in our society, because they will be perceived at best as exotic, at worst as a threat and treated likewise.

I am being told by some white feminists that ""at least he is a male"", meaning that they have a male privilege (that they refuses) : I hate that, because it pushes them to an impossible place, that they benefits male bonding and privileges that he refuses and do not get completely. And at the same time, those white feminists will encourage him to fly away of being heterosexual, of refusing ""masculinity"" and I am suspicious of their intentions (the intentions of said feminists).

So, now, we are in the middle of now-where, listening to Alok podcasts (but Alok however brilliant says they are divine, elected, etc : how could that be a practising model...; they also say that you can appear how you want to society which is not true, maybe it should, but it is not the case) , we are gathering our forces to accompany our kid the best we can. We have to struggle in many fronts because our own families are conservatives and since our child is adopted, their sense of belonging is already a challenge.

Our child wants to wear heavy make-up so we have to channel that for fear of them being rejected at school and in the streets, but with the constant fear of us, their parents, oppressing them. We also are looking in the direction of racialized dragqueens or dragkings in Montreal, but their show hours are not that practical for a primary schooled child. And we also have to talk about safety.

We struggle we our white feminism norms saying that you do not want to over-signal, over sexualize, over-gender, over-stereotype your body, and that being non-binary is not being over sexualized. We fear police and social aggression and transmisoginy  when they are a grown teenager.

And in the same time, as scared as we are for their future, we feel so privileged to be trusted and to support them and to learn so much with them.

Thank you for reading me and giving me any input that could help."	"[deleted]
Owww thank you so much. 

Yes indeed we get sometimes that from wellmeaning friends ""it's just a phase don't worry"" and of course we struggle to not get into that mode ourselves.

starting HRT??	"A little bit of an intro: I am AFAB non-binary (they/they & he/him) struggling with the decision of starting T. 
 
Awhile ago, I was placed on a waitlist to meet with a doctor about starting T. I recently got a call back, and now my appointment is coming up and I feel more indecisive than ever. 

Starting T is something that I’ve been thinking about for a while now. Yet I find myself worried about my safety, how others will view me, etc. I still struggle to even tell people my pronouns, and I feel like I’m constantly flip flopping between options. It doesn’t help that when I told my parents (expecting them to be excited), they listed tons of other options/alternatives that made me feel even more doubtful. 

I know that if i were to start T, it would be microdosing, and I’d like to stop at a certain point. The main thing that’s so appealing about T to me are the voice changes and fat redistribution. I know I just want a more masculine/androgynous appearance/frame. I don’t particularly dislike my features as they are, but I feel like I look to feminine?? If that makes sense?

I guess I’m just trying to find a version of myself that actually aligns with how I see myself in my head. Dysphoria has been eating away at me. 

Have you guys gone through feelings like this or have had similar experiences? What did you do? How do you cope with dysphoria???"	"Hi! I'm also nonbinary (he/they/xe) I went through this too. I know what you mean when you talk about parents listing the alternatives. The fact is that taking hormones is a life-changing decision and I'm sure you know that it's not one to be taken lightly, but shouldn't be thrown out because of fear. It's common to worry about how people will view you. I also have a lot of trouble introducing my pronouns outside of queer spaces.

When I was deciding whether or not to start hormones, I heard there were two types of fears related to medical transition: 1. The fear that you are making a mistake for your body and 2. The fear of your life changing for the worst. The first is a fear for your own internal happiness and that you wouldn't like what you see after you take hormones (this is commonly talked about in anti-trans detransitioning discussions). The second is a fear of external pressures like family, dating, friends, social circles, strangers, etc.

Ask yourself whether you think you would be genuinely happy in the body testosterone would offer. Are you afraid of the changes themselves or experiencing doubt that you can handle the new changes?

If you think you're feeling the first type of fear, then take a moment to stop and keep exploring your gender before you make a decision. If it's the second, then you might just have to take a leap of faith. Since you have been dealing with your dysphoria for as long as you have, then I'm sure you're strong enough to face the new difficulties ahead. Try to remember that 99% of cis women don't want to take testosterone. Listen to yourself and your body and you'll know what to do.

Good luck, homie! Godspeed to you!
A little update: I started low-dose testosterone! It’s been about a month and I’m so glad I decided to start
I find that a lot of my fear comes from the external pressures you listed, it’s something I’m still trying to work through. Thanks so much for sharing your insight, I really appreciate it! Will definitely keep this in mind as I explore my options & gender."	vybe4p	NonBinary	7	1.0	2022-07-13 19:18:14
(US-Specific) Should I put an X gender marker on my license?	I'm a nonbinary man and am stuck between putting an M or an X on my driver's license. My state allows me to change it with no doctor's note or additional paperwork. I asked some other transmasc people and they said I shouldn't because it may put my safety at risk if a transphobe, specifically a transphobic cop, sees it. What do you think?	"It might put you at risk if you get pulled over definitely
I’ve had the X marker for over a year and honestly no one has noticed.
This depends a lot on what state you’re in and what states you want to travel to. If you don’t drive, you’re less likely to encounter a cop, but you might encounter some weirdness at airports or situations where you have to show ID. 

Only you know where you’re gonna go and what you’re up to handling. With the way the right is cracking down on us, I personally am not in a hurry to do this, but I also have to travel to some transphobic places at times. That’s just how I feel more safe, but I wish the world was different and I could be out on official ID.
I have one on mine.

Depends on you. I don't worry too much about out any of that. I'll deal with that person I
If they come around. 

Others want to be on the safe side
You have to do pro/con analysis for yourself. If you look a certain way a gender marker on your ID won’t make any difference. At certain points in my life I feel like I just don’t care about the negative consequences anymore. I just need to be me.  I’m thinking of getting an X marker as well soon.
I’ve had one for over a year (MA) and no issues. I haven’t had my passport switched yet, and I don’t think I will.

Fitness routine for becoming more masculine?	"hello lovely enbies! I am an AFAB, and I wish to start working out to achieve a stronger, broader, more masculine upper body. problem is... I have no idea where to start! I have never cared about fitness and I have no clue about the names of exercises or how workout routines work. 

do you have any advice? I have found a few [exercises](https://pittssmitts.tumblr.com/post/174276816633/some-people-on-insta-said-i-should-post-my-workout) that seem to be appropriate, but I can't judge whether they are actually good or not.

That's not what passing is	"My friends. my beloveds. my siblings in arms. I know you mean well. but ""passing as [your agab]"" is not a thing. 

""passing"" refers to being seen as ones gender. 

if you are consistently being seen as something that is not your gender, that's not passing. that's being misgendered. 

we have *got* to stop treating being misgendered and closeted as a privilege. it's not. 

if someone has (relative) safety only because they people around them fail to see them as they truly are? that's not privilege. that's just being in the closet. 

now, we can appreciate that closeting can be harder on some than others, but that's an entirely different conversation, and ultimately it's not something *anyone* should have to do. 

I'm begging, please be careful before assuming different struggles mean lesser struggles."		pdevvc	NonBinary	7	1.0	2021-08-28 18:13:25
Excited about starting T, but at the same time, a little worried.	"I've been mentally in and out of the closet since I was maybe 20. Five years, I've sort of reflexively mentally called myself a 'they' and only recently tried really hard to verbally call myself a 'she'. Ended up expressing how a lot of things related to being a girl felt wrong to a nonbinary friend of mine (known each other for years, it came out of the closet pretty early in our friendship) and it and I were talking.

Well, this person could absolutely be a therapist if it wanted to be, because it knows its way around peoples' heads very well and has a talent for pushing things in just the right directions to make things make sense. It's always had a talent for asking the hard questions and coming up with good answers. In any case, a long and honest conversation with this friend, and turns out, I'm a they.

I'm publicly out to all my coworkers, classmates, teachers, and other very very close friends. I'm lucky to live in a very progressive city at a very progressive college campus. Not to my parents yet, though. They were fine with me being ace, they were fine with me being a lesbian. But they're uh... well, let's just say they started liking J.K. Rowling a whole lot more recently and I don't think it's safe to tell mom and dad yet.

I'm talking to a therapist at school to start T. But here's where things get tricky.

I want a dick. Like... really really bad. And I love the idea of having a beard (a beard isn't necessary, but could be very fun!) and a very androgynous voice. I love singing, and I love all of my range. But my speaking tone definitely outs me as AFAB. I have always felt very dysphoric about penetrative sex (part of the reason why I resonated so strongly with the ace label for so much of my adulthood). But I love my titties (I think...), and I'm afraid of them shrinking. I like the idea of having an androgynous presentation with subtle traits of both sexes. But I'm worried about gaining one and losing the other. Or, worse, not being able to pass well enough as one or the other when I need to for my safety.

What do I do? I mean, I could always get breast implants later and wear bra inserts for the sake of having enough T to kick start bottom growth. But I'm also worried about my voice getting so deep that I can't sing in a woman's range. The aim is Contralto/Tenor, starting in Alto. But how much T should I take to achieve that goal, and for how long before springing for metoidioplasty? My voice and my bottom is where most of my dysphoria comes from. I just kind of want to have enough of each to make people scratch their heads, and nothing more."	"I've never heard of boobs shrinking on T otherwise I'd've started it years ago! The voice thing is gonna be tough because it's basically a second puberty. Right now I'm dealing with the weird voice cracks and notes that I used to have are just not there anymore. It will change but that's more voice training than anything. I'm making my voice deeper on purpose. You will more than likely get bottom growth (I wasn't sure I wanted that one but I love it) so I'd talk to a doctor about how and when to go about that. You can start on a low dose and see if you like it before deciding next steps too


Edit: looked it up unless you're like AA cup now, it's doubtful t will affect for breast size enough to really notice
Really? Oh, that is a massive relief. Thank you! I'm not exactly packing DD's, but they're at a reasonably comfy fit for my frame. Small enough to pass either way if I wanted, just the way I like."	szt6vh	NonBinary	5	0.78	2022-02-23 21:56:47
I want to come out but afraid of family’s reaction	"For context I am 30, AFAB and have a child. I have been using she/they amongst my friends and academic peers (I’m a full time university student) for the last year and a half and it makes me feel the most comfortable. I am also a closeted Pansexual (to most, close non-family connections know).

My parents are in their mid-50’s and while they claim to be open and accepting toward the LGBTQ+ and non-cis hetro people they are incredibly bigoted and offensive. Their thoughts and feelings toward queer people is really gross and despite my efforts to politely, and in some cases academically, refute their “facts” they continue to spew bigoted, harmful comments. I have been able to get them to stop using slurs, which is a step, but the one topic they seem to have the most “discomfort” with is non-binary as a whole and using they/them pronouns. Particularly when someone uses mixed pronouns (she/they for example). 

I really want to come out, I want to be able to have my gender experience affirmed by being addressed by what feels most comfortable. I also want to be able to be open and honest with my daughter about who I am. I have explained, at an age appropriate level, the fluidities of gender and sexuality as well as tried explaining LGBTQ+ topics in a way she can feel safe not listening to obvious hateful comments. The fact a five year old can articulate some people are boys, some are girls, some are “in betweeners” and some are “neithers” makes me feel comfortable in expressing to her what my gender identity feels like. But I am very worried about my parents reaction. 

What would be the best and safest way to come out and ask for my pronouns to be respected? Is it even worth it? What sorts of responses should I have ready if I do go through with it?
Note: I do not fear for my physical safety and do not live with them (but do see them often)."	I'm in the same boat as you. I don't have any advice except to wish you luck.	xzi4hi	NonBinary	6	1.0	2022-10-09 10:17:05
A few thoughts for pride	"Happy pride to all!


These are just a few thoughts for pride that also apply all year long. Feel free to add to them. 


You’re valid. Period. 


If you can’t ever get the chance to express who you really are for safety reasons or living situations, you’re still valid AF. 


You don’t owe anyone androgyny or anything really. Just be yourself! 


Whatever you’re going for, keep going for it! I love seeing all the posts and I’m happy for all of you. It makes me a little jealous and sad personality because I won’t ever get to look how I truly want but I’m happy for all of you. 


If you’re also trans, you’re valid too! You don’t owe anyone an explanation of who you are. You’re great!


I struggle with defining my gender so I just go with nonbinary usually. Don’t feel like you have to have a name or label for it. Just be you!


Finally, if anyone finds a genies lamp or something and you get a few wishes, can one wish be that all nb and trans people can shapeshift? I think we’d all be pretty excited."		v3xw57	NonBinary	6	1.0	2022-06-03 12:04:40
ATTN: AFAB non binary people	" You  don't need anyone's affection or approval in order to be good enough.  When someone rejects or abandons or judges you, it isn't actually about  you. It's about them and their own insecurities, limitations, and needs,  and you don't have to internalize that. Your worth isn't contingent  upon other people's acceptance of you - it's something inherent. You  exist, and therefore, you matter. You're allowed to voice your thoughts  and feelings. You're allowed to assert your needs and take up space.  You're allowed to hold onto the truth that who you are is exactly  enough. And you're allowed to remove anyone from your life who makes you  feel otherwise. You are loved and appriciated, may you be supported and have the safety and resources to transition or not to the place you feel most safe.

So my doctor said for the safety of my spine I can’t go on hormones or blockers	I have some weird spinal condition so I can’t do hormones, but I still want to present androgynous. I wish I could just do the hormones but the doctor says they can mess me up with the condition I have.	"I'm sorry, that sucks :( have you gotten a second opinion? Might it be possible to take some hrt later in life?
That sounds very frustrating.  As sarah valentine has noted, you can certainly seek a second opinion.

In any case, you still have a lot of options to present androgynous in terms of clothes, hairstyle, piercings/jewelry (or not!), makeup (or not!), and of course, pronouns.  I wish you success in finding the combination of those things that fits you best!

Starting the year with more questions about living as a nonbinary person!	"Hello I'm back again with the questions!! I'll start saying I'm AFAB, 23, Italian aaaand I want to look like your stereotypical Man, like... someone looks at me and they immediately think ""That's a guy"" without second thought. But I don't feel exceptionally like I'm a guy. I just feel like I'm supposed to look like that, I stopped questioning why, I just feel incomplete like this, for whatever reason. 

So in the perfect future in which I have top surgery and I'm pumped full of Testosterone I wouldn't necessarily want people to start seeing me exclusively as a guy. Like I wouldn't mind my mother still calling me daughter and my siblings sister or my friends using my current name. It feels weird to say but they would feel even more right if I imagine myself as dude than how people see me right now? But I wouldn't mind either a mash up of everything. Like people using different pronouns and terms at the same time (I like the idea of being tought of as a young man but also as a daughter but also being called Mx, just go crazy). I guess I like either the mixing up of the terms or the that I enjoy? 

I'm just wondering if there's anyone living like this? Like, physically transitioned in a set direction almost like a binary person but socially is way more all over the place? How is it? Like personal life, work? Did you find an environment in which to be open or do go as the gender you look like the most? Anyone from Italy?  I'm just afraid what I'm imagining is pure fantasy and in reality I'd be trading ways of being uncomfortable. Because I'd either not be able to completely transition or I would but I'd have to pretend I'm 100% a guy for safety reasons. Like, I have no idea what's it like to actually be a nonbinary person who's out and I don't know how unrealitic mt expectations are."		ej21vi	NonBinary	5	1.0	2020-01-02 18:31:27
Safety vs euphoria	"Lately I’ve been struggling with my gender identity, and how it relates to my trauma responses. I keep finding myself getting stuck on whether any aspect of my gender expression is something I genuinely like and feel suits me, or if it’s just something that makes me feel safer from external threats. 

I’ve been leaning towards much more masc presentation. I’m really enjoying it! I’m just not sure if I’m enjoying it because it feels true to me or if it’s because I feel like less of a target for abuse. Am I really trans or am I just afraid to be a woman because being a woman means having a higher chance of being victimized….again…. 

I don’t even really know how to go about working through the feeling. Every time the thought crops up I get paralyzed at the thought of having to go out and be girly again; having to perform correctly to match my appearance and having to accept that half the population sees me as no more than a piece of meat…"	"This type of thinking is popular in TERF communities (not calling you a terf!! Dw) and it always struck me as not making much sense. Masculine/androgynous presenting women still experience misogyny & sexualization, if not worse at times *because* they are gnc. 

Now, I don't mean to discredit your feelings. I think you should definitely present in a way that makes you feel content, whether it be because of safety reasons or gender euphoria.

I'm really sorry for what you had to experience. I can only speak of my experience: spending time and prioritizing women and queer/trans people as friends, content I consume, spaces I occupy ... can help feeling safer. Good luck!
I came to that thought last night; that regardless of who I really am and how I identify, the people around me only see what they want to see. 

Maybe I’m struggling with that fear then. I guess I had hoped that being myself would somehow provide a form of protection. Seems silly.

Ya, i know it’s a kinda terfy fear to have. I guess it’s the internalized transphobia still being stubborn."	y499dt	NonBinary	5	1.0	2022-10-15 00:01:37
How Did You Know You Wanted Top Surgery?	"My boobs have really bothered me lately. I don't necessarily wish they were gone, but I just hate how aware of them I am. I'm pretty terrified of most surgical procedures in general, but this would be triple as A.) I wouldn't have the support of family and B.) I wouldn't wanna be perceived as a pre-pubescent boy (I'm 5'0""). I've also never had a surgery that's impacted my mobility yet. I'm still thinking about it obviously, and there's no rush for me--but what made you sure you wanted top surgery? 

Also, what are things I can do to be less bothered? Thought about getting a binder but there's so much safety wise and I'm a bigger chested person. TIA."	"I'm a very large chested person (like, crossing my arms is a struggle) and I just got my first binder today. I sized up a little bit for safety, and I find it's no more constricting than any of the sports bras I've been wearing otherwise, but it gives me much more mobility and a much more masculine shape (which was what I specifically was going for).

The reason I want top surgery is mainly the reason I got my binder. My chest is large, it's in the way and it's hard on my back, it's hard to find button-up shirts in men's styles without risking popping buttons and clothing in women's styles almost always accentuate it.
Plus, I would love to be able to just throw on some shorts and go outside or go for a swim, without being seen as ""inappropriate"" or ""offensive"".
Really, that's interesting! I was imagining, like, a higher set corset. I mainly just wanna stop noticing them 24/7. Thanks for the input
If you're interested, I got mine from Underworks. It's the Compression Chest Binder Tank. It's a tank top, but the compression stops at around the ribs so it doesn't put any pressure on your stomach or hips. I've yet to wash it to see if it shrinks at all, but so far it's been really comfortable.

You could also do what I was doing before, which is wearing two sports bras at the same time. That gets pretty warm though lol.

Little Bits of Euphoria	"I'm just starting to be more open about my gender in the last year or so. I usually wait to get to know someone before talking about pronouns and the like.

Last summer, for the first time, I felt comfortable coming out to a large group of (mostly) strangers. I ended up making a bunch of good friends, including a guy who runs a D&D game. 

He invited me to play, and the other players are awesome, but I haven't really mentioned my pronouns or anything and my name is masc-leaning/unisex. 

The DM has made an active effort to use neutral pronouns for me and the other players have picked up on it— I've heard them correct themselves, even though I usually use my former pronouns for safety.

I'm working through some dysphoria, but these little moments where someone uses my pronouns or does something else to make me feel seen have been really awesome— especially since they've been proactive about it.

I feel like my non-binary identity is being excluded in a dance performance coming up	"I’m moved to Chicago last year and joined a dance community through my cis WOC Zumba instructor who is also a choreographer for a dance studio. I recently joined her dance studio and was having the best time ever. It felt like we were getting closer as friends and I got excited that she invited me to perform to her original choreographer in a show at a bar. 

Things changed for me after our group was discussing costumes for our performance, and my choreographer only provided options for a “ladies” costume and a “guys” costume, excluding a non-binary option for people like me. On top of that, she seemed to resist me making a boundary that I wasn’t going to wear something that made me uncomfortable in multiple ways including not having enough support for my large chest while hip hop dancing. 

Now this circle of people doesn’t feel like a safe space for me. I just want a space where I feel like all of my identities are respected and celebrated all at once. Is that possible? Has anyone in here had that? 

I’m grieving the safety I use to feel being a part of this community full of femme presenting people of color like me. I feel like I’m being reasonable by sticking up for myself, but I repel so many people by doing that, I’m feeling pretty lonely which doesn’t feel good. Apparently people feel awkward after I set my boundary. 

Part of me feels like I’m grieving the loss of a potential friend, someone I could go dancing with for my birthday. I don’t trust her anymore to be respectful of my gender identity. But maybe she was getting emotional because I think she is jealous of femme presenting people with big chests like me, I think she might have been insecure of her breast size and snapped at me.

Can anyone else relate? Do you think I’m being reasonable?"		uomvdf	NonBinary	5	0.7	2022-05-13 08:12:20
Names make a change??	"I've been incredibly euphoric today and I feel like I should share this with this community. My name is Joell, I'm NB (they/them) but I am closeted to anyone irl. On the internet however, as you can see I'm not.
Today I've met an internet friend of mine for the first time and even though it did made me feel a bit nervous I can't describe the feeling I've had when I realized their support. I believe I've never been called by the name Joell for a whole day irl and it made me feel,, so damn good?? I had never thought it would change so much but knowing that for that friend and their family I was 'Joell' and only that, no dead name or anything similar, was fantastic.
Unfortunately it stops at the name, since there are no neutral German pronouns like they/them (and those who exists usually sound very odd. I do not enjoy those neopronouns (?) in particular). Because of that I always told myself how pointless it'd be to tell people irl about my gender identity because ""all that could possibly change is the name and nothing else"". But today I realized, that even though it isn't perfect, a name can give you so much more comfort.
This won't mean that I'll tell my family and irl friends because I believe it'd damage me more than anything else as of now, but I am very certain that one day I'll be surrounded by people who will only call me by that name.
 I (and I'm sure everyone else in this sub, too) will be surrounded by support and safety and I'm very happy about that thought"		f6j848	NonBinary	6	1.0	2020-02-19 23:07:38
Looking For Resources	"Hey Everyone, not new to Reddit, but new to this community. I, with the help of the fantastic artist, have launched a Kickstarter for a NonBinary Pride Bird pin.

yearning for a weird little house?	"I have this instinct to move into the middle of nowhere. I'm not sure why- it could be the cottagecore thats been going around, but tbh its more likely because thats the only way I'd be able to afford a home, and because I like areas with lots of green and places to walk.

But it sucks that I don't really have that option, both because of safety, and wanting a queer community. I just want a little house with a porch and a place to do art in a place with a lot of trees! 

I'm partly complaining, but I would love to know your experiences with being queer/nonbinary in places where its not the norm, or places that fit this vibe that are safe/queer."	"Whether it's safe is really going to depend on country and location within that country. My experience with small town life was quite positive. Don't expect people to be up on trans issues, you'll have to explain things (or don't and just live your life). But when you're in a small community sometimes people are quicker to just accept you as a person. If you're fitting in with the community otherwise, you'll belong. However, being the only visibly queer person in the village started to wear on me after a while, despite people mostly being kind. I felt like I stuck out a lot, and living in a more diverse bigger city felt like a breath of fresh air. I still live on the outskirts so I can easily walk out of the city. It's all agriculture and meadows instead of forest and heather, so that's a downgrade, but worth it to me. Basically, safety yes, community yes, queer community no in my experience. However, this was in the Netherlands, close to a liberal small town. My family lives way more rural than that and is also accepting, but I don't know what actually living in their villages would be like. I'd love a queer commune/living group, I've lived in a more ecologically minded one for a few years and it's a good way of finding community. I'd probably want to start one with people I'm already friends with though, because they do have drama potential or just living styles/personalities not matching.
I live a nomad life. Minimal things and basically headstead and travel to where I want to be. I live out of a travel trailer and just spend 7 months in the woods. I’ve rented, had a mortgage, and this is by far the best way I’ve lived so far"	y9jyu7	NonBinary	4	0.68	2022-10-21 04:40:09
"Today in English Class we were tasked with writing a poem, so I wrote a poem about being Non-Binary. It's called ""Only Two."""	"“Only two. No more. No less.”

“Two ways to act, two ways to dress, two ways to be addressed.”

“Two ways to be organized, two ways to be known, two ways to live.”

“There are only two.”

“You cannot change this, for it goes against not only our society, but nature itself.”

“And if you want to claim otherwise, you're crazy.”

“Only two. Like it or not, that’s the truth.”

Or at least, that’s what I thought, for that was all I was ever told.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

It’s not that everyone who passed on this rhetoric was trying to be mean.

For it, too, was all they were ever told.

But why? Why? Why only two?

What if I’m now beginning to realize I’m not what everyone told me I was?

What if I’m the other one?

Or perhaps, what if I’m neither?

Neither? That’s impossible, for everyone knows there’s only two.

But why? Why? Why only two?

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“Nature gave us two types of bodies to help us survive.”

“Therefore, there are only two ways I can treat and address you within our modern day society.”

Society answered to me, often in very subtle ways.

What? That doesn’t make sense!

Nature is imperfect. Sometimes, a body possessing traits of both is created.

How would you treat a person like that? Like one? Or the other?

Or perhaps, a person’s physical body has nothing to do with how they wish to be seen in a society.

All this in consideration, why only two?

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“I am this way” I told myself for years.

“I am this one, and therefore, can do these things, but can’t do these other things.”

“Because I am this one way, society can only treat me this one way.”

Turns out, I was lying to myself the whole time.

Because now, as I take more time to figure myself out, I am finally able to understand.

I am not one. I am not the other. I am neither. And I'm sick of lying about it.

Both to myself, and everyone around me.

But for the latter, there is a good reason.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Being neither can jeopardize relationships.

Being neither can jeopardize my reputation.

Being neither can jeopardize education and job opportunities.

Being neither can jeopardize my safety.

Because being neither is not an option in this society.

Everything is divided, and everyone must conform, Into one. Or the other.

“One. Or the other. Two. Only two. No more. No less.”

“You cannot change this, for it goes against not only our society, but nature itself.”

“And if you want to claim otherwise, you’re crazy.”

But why? Why? Why only two?

It makes so many neithers feel invalid and shunned.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Being neither may not be an option in this society,

But it still does not change the fact that it is who I am.

I don’t just feel this. I know it. It’s just who I am.

So despite everything that I hear, see, and feel, that eliminates ‘neither’ each day,

If you can be very understanding, I would just like to say:

I am Non-Binary. My pronouns are them, their, and they."	I love this, thank you for sharing.	k64jtq	NonBinary	5	1.0	2020-12-03 19:43:20
Seeking Advice - Fears about relationship with my partner of almost a decade	"As the title states, I'm seeking some advice/resources to help. For some backstory, my partner (33) recently came out to me (32M) as non-binary. We've been together for more than a decade, married for 9, and I'm incredibly proud of them. I've been researching and taking in as much information as I can to be supportive without overstepping their boundaries, but in the back of my mind are still some very real fears that I'm experiencing.

I love them and have always been attracted to who they are as a person, but I'm scared that as they go down this journey that they'll discover that their attraction doesn't line up with who I am, a relatively cis-gender male.

Their happiness, safety, and comfort are paramount, and I'm struggling with how to discuss this with them without pushing the conversation too soon, as they are still coming home to who they are. I want to be respectful, and stay a safe place where they feel they can discuss their feelings openly without pressure or judgment.

I hope to always be a part of their life, but candidly, I know that it will be hard for me to deal with knowing I may not be who they're looking for going forward. No matter what, I want to remain in their life, preferably as their partner, but always as their close friend. 

Any tips on how to breach this topic sooner rather than later? Or should I wait until they have a better idea and acceptance of who they are?

They come from a very strict, religious background and are struggling with their programming/ideals from that upbringing, and their family's acceptance if/once they come out. 

TIA, and apologies if I err in my original post or responses. All I can promise is that nothing is said/written from a place of hate, and that I'll strive to better educate myself."	"So at first I didn't really understand why you thought their gender identity would be so tightly linked to their sexuality/romantic interests, but is it because of the religious background that you're thinking that as one thing starts moving away from the heavily-reinforced ""default,"" the other might too?
in terms of them no longer being attracted to you, i would try your best to let things happen and not get too worried about something that may never even be an issue. but if you aren't interested in polyamory, i would be super upfront about that. it NEVER works when only one person really wants it and the other is going along with it bc they don't want to lose their partner. best of luck to you 🥰
That is a really great point, and yes your are correct. 
They've also been mentioning polyamory more when we talk. It seems like general discussion thus far, but it is spiking my anxiety.

I do know that my insecurities/anxiety are my own issue that I need to work on, and have started to see a therapist for that. I just want to keep honest communication open.
Thank you, I really appreciate taking the time to respond and the advice.
I'm glad you're talking to a therapist! One thing it seems like you might want to think about with the therapist is what boundaries you would like to establish with your partner about all of this, and how to communicate that in a way that's respectful of their identity and ""journey."" It's of course great that they're learning about and exploring all of these new things, but it might not be best for you to always be the one they're processing everything with in real-time. Polyamory is a perfect example of something that often seems really intriguing and exciting at first to someone who's never considered it as a possibility before, or who has dismissed it as being immoral/what have you, but then for a lot of folks that enthusiasm burns itself out fairly quickly to ""actually I'm happy with things the way they are."" As the partner, I think it'd be reasonable for you to want to get a feel on where their comments are coming from, and if it is just that first flush of ""did you KNOW that this is a THING??"" maaaybe they could find someone else to enthuse at, or at least clearly demarcate ""I've been reading about this and am fascinated, but this isn't me hinting that I want to explore it myself/ourselves right now."" And then your job with the therapist is to come to terms with the possibility that someday that might change... but that's kind of a good thing to be able to do in general anyway, because people do change and grow and, sometimes, unfortunately, it's in an incompatible direction, but worrying about it ahead of time isn't a way to prevent that.

For what it's worth: to me, it seems like the single biggest thing that drives newly-out non-binary people away from cis partners is the partner not being able to let go of the image they had of who the non-binary person was. It's not that a cis person isn't enough anymore, it's just that they persistently remain a link to a former life that no longer makes any sense, and the cognitive dissonance between loving them and feeling invalidated by them gets to be too much. You sound like you're doing very well on that front though!
i definitely don't want to invalidate your anxiety or fear, it can be really scary to think you might lose a partner over something you can't control. it sounds like you are processing this very maturely, and i'm not suggesting you bottle up your feelings of fear or insecurity. that's obviously not good for either of you. but if you're both on the same page, respect each other, and have a shared goal of maintaining a healthy relationship, i am hopeful you can talk things through. i just don't want you to let the fear consume you. you're doing the work to create a safe space for your partner and hopefully that results in open communication."	s2jz2b	NonBinary	6	1.0	2022-01-12 23:17:03
Queer Book Recommendation!	"The Night Brother by Rosie Garland is the best piece of queer fiction that I have ever read, and it really holds a special place in my heart. It masterfully brings up issues such as transphobia and homophobia, as well as anti-intersex thoughts and crimes, and sexism, all through fictional devices used as extended metaphors.

[MINOR SPOILERS] The book follows the two siblings Edie and Gnome through their lives in early 20th century England. There is only one problem: they share the same body. In the day, they are Edie - who is not aware of Gnome - and in the night, her body transforms into her brother Gnome’s male body, and he takes over the control. They must of course keep this a secret, for their own safety’s sake.

The book explores the relationship between gender and gender roles, as well as sexuality and “not fitting in”. It also has other sub-plots that it follows, such as the Suffragettes’ movement, and the gay and queer lives and rights movement of England.

All in all, it’s an amazing book, it is beautifully written, and it really makes you think of what it can mean to be queer. It really touched me, especially when the characters pondered on their gender identity, and what importance community and historical representation can have for a young queer person. Please take some time to read this book!"		89o7qz	NonBinary	5	1.0	2018-04-04 10:14:51
Exploring My Gender and Feelings Through a Nonbinary Self-Insert, and How They Changed Too	"I’m afab and consider myself a cis girl currently

But I’ve been writing and exploring an oc-started-part-self-insert and their gender has changed… \*considerably\* from their inception

When I made them they were a cute and androgynous character to fill in as my avatar in the mmo final fantasy 14. You don’t need to know about the game, but I think it’s relevant to know how they came into existence

As they were “legally” male ingame, I thought they might be a pretty boy. Then I shifted that thought into them being nonbinary. (which I think is a result of my essence trying to coexist with a masculine character? Like it had to balance out or something)

For a long while they were simply nonbinary and I began to incorporate those gender feelings of discomfort and wanting something \*more\* into their personal backstory involving them wanting more from their life like their sister who left to become an adventurer. 

Two mirrored situations, them feeling the need to run because staying just wasn’t right. I didn’t realize at the start that those two feelings could possibly be linked.

As the story progressed and my headcannons grew greater and greater, I again began to question the gender of this character who was so similar to me and yet.. starting to take on a life of their own.

I started imagining their family dynamic with their individual siblings and parents, small moments in their youth that marked their jealousy, vulnerability, and curiosity. They ran away from home! I realized that this action needed to have consequences on the well-being of the family they left behind. They adopted the mistakes and flaws I had yet to write down and really look at.

In the end, this oc became a representation of my feelings and self. Another version of myself perhaps.

So when I realized that this character might be transfeminine as a result of my influence… I wondered.

I’m freshly in college and starting recover a casual femininity I didn’t realize I had. I was \*that\* girl in elementary and middle school, I didn’t fit in so I was going to vehemently deny ever being like everyone else.

But I now define my femininity differently than before, in broader ways that emphasize the safety I feel with female relatives and queer women especially and the easy laughter that I didn’t think I’d ever find with other girls. I realized that I really am a girl, even if I occasionally want to look androgynous or leave my legs unshaven. Femininity has never been so welcoming and freeing a concept.

And I think that in this realization my oc began to shift into a more feminine identity, I certainly dressed them with my sensibilities and aesthetics as best I could with the “male” restriction affecting the clothes they could wear ingame

But would they be a trans girl? I don’t think so, or at least, this game’s limitations would make me hesitant to swap their gender and cause them to lose the casual touch of masculine androgyny that had characterized them from the start.

I think they are a little of both, again similar to me but different too. I don’t think they hate that they were born amab, but felt restricted by it, especially considering their more medieval fantasy based world. 

I questioned my gender for several months in senior year and even bought a binder and \*liked\* it. It’s too annoying to wear for very long and I don’t feel crushing dysphoria so it mostly just sits in my closet now.

I didn’t think I’d have such probing thoughts about gender when I made my beloved little oc. I don’t know why exactly I felt compelled to write this down or to share it on here.. just a probably cis girl exploring her gender and coming out stronger for it I suppose.

Though I do wonder if it means anything for a self-insert to slowly adopt a gender different to one’s own.

To those who read to the end, thank you for your time reading my thoughts. May you have a good rest of your day!"	As a writer also, I’ve been doing the same thing. It’s helpful to be able to look at yourself from the outside and inside through fiction. :)	prsfzu	NonBinary	4	0.84	2021-09-20 10:57:32
Need some input	So I recently came out as gender-fluid and only to my wife, best friend, and two siblings.  I’m 32 years old.  There isn’t a ton of queer support where I live.  I was assigned male at birth and dress mostly masculine for convenience and safety.  I never wore dresses or experimented when I was younger but I was always open to exploring my gender.  About 3 or 4 years ago I decided to further explore my gender identity, after years of coming to terms with my sexuality(pansexual).  At the time, I didn’t feel “valid” enough to identify as gender-fluid and didn’t feel like I knew enough about it to make that decision.  So fast forward to current day, I’ve been doing tons of research, reading books, and trying to get a grasp on gender.  I feel comfortable enough at this point to call myself gender-fluid but for some reason I still don’t feel valid enough.  I feel like even the LGBTQ community wouldn’t see me as valid because I still wear pretty masculine clothes, listen to death metal, and am married to a Cis-woman.  Even queer folks can be unforgiving of such things.  I just need some validation.  I haven’t felt this way my entire life like some people have but I genuinely see myself as gender-fluid.	"Hm. You're vvvvvaaaaaalllllliiiiiiddddd enough :) Pay attention to the quiet assurance within yourself, even if you have to tune all the noise out regularly to hear it. Queer spaces can certainly have cliquishness and subcultural norms, but those things are positively incapable of invalidating anybody's queerness. At worst they can just encourage exclusive behavior in the group and shyness and anxiety at its margins. But those things are not invalidating. They're just bad. There's nothing unqueer about metal. Sure I don't go to shows anymore because I'm old and cranky, and sure I don't want to go to certain clubs without a crew to keep me safe, but I've always felt as safe or safer in the metal scene as just out in ordinary public spaces. And if anybody in a queer space wants to say ignorant shit about the metal scene I'll be the first to talk shit about whatever dumb geek obsession they're monopolizing everybody's time with, because that's nothing but cliquishness and exclusivity and me and you are both valid and permitted to push back and claim our seat at the table.
Thank you so much for your comment.  It means a lot to me.  I guess metal is pretty queer honestly and yeah I don’t go to shows anymore either but the scenes are mostly pretty accepting.  I guess I don’t have a lot of queer folks, especially non-binary, to fall back on and honestly the people in the LGBT Reddit and this Reddit are super nice and supportive.  I may be moving in a few years so hopefully it’ll be more queer-friendly and I can feel free and safe.
You're welcome and there's metalhugs."	dynuhw	NonBinary	5	1.0	2019-11-19 17:48:48
I rarely ask for help	"The past few days have been so exhausting and filled with negative energy and I just need someone to tell me I'm not stupid or delusional. I'm only out to my mums because I want the teet yeet and I was hoping they'd be supportive and they absolutely are which is great! Somehow I've come across so much negativity online towards trans people (not only from cis peeps) and it has me very worried about ever coming out to anyone else other than my family and very close friends. And yes, I know I'm not obligated to tell anyone about my gender identity but once I'll have the scars on my chest there is no way around other people knowing that I'm not cisgender. I don't really care for other peoples opinions and I live in a fairly open western country but I'm becoming more and more anxious about my safety if I should choose to for example swim in a public space and hell I'm not going to wear anything on my chest once I get the breasticles removed but I'm also very nervous about physical abuse or/and slurs and such.   
I understand that I'm hella rambly right now. I'm simply filled with a lot of anxiety and I know my dysphoria is too strong more me not to go through with the surgery but what if that'll open up more doors to asshole-behaviour from humans?

Someone hug me please!"	"sending love and solidarity <3 it’s definitely terrifying to open yourself up to the possibility of harassment and other shittiness by making your transness more visible, but ultimately you’ve got to live for *you* and if you know you need top to be happy and comfortable in your skin then it’s the right decision. I’m feeling similarly overwhelmed about the prospect of having to out myself to everyone in my life, including casual acquaintances because I want to go on T, but I also know it’s what I need to do to feel hopeful about my future so other people’s opinions have to take a backseat. really hope things turn out better than expected for you
Sending you a whole freaking pile of love, support and hugs. I can't tell you ""everything is going to be ok and great!"", but I can tell you that there are lots of people in the world that want you to be happy and loved for being exactly who you are. There are lots of people who want you to feel welcomed and safe and part of a community and a chosen family. There are lots of people who would probably take a punch of throw a brick for you, if it came down to it. Being yourself is really scary, but those people are out there and they want to find you and be found by you.
:HUGS:

Much loves and comforts and time for gaining strength! I wish all these for you and yours!
Thank you so much! I know I also wanna pave the way for others so they have it easier but maaan it's hard enough to live with myself and to stay true to what I feel even though it has always made me the happiest. I think top surgery is definitely the next step for me and I hope I'll also be able to get a good gender therapist since my current one really doesn't specialise in this field and she's been kinda struggling to help and understand me since I've opened up about my dysphoria. 

Wish you all the best <3"	c451il	NonBinary	4	0.84	2019-06-23 13:56:09
chest binder	right now i can't afford to buy a chest binder so i tried using the legs of a very stretchable pair of leggings and used safety pins to close and open it but i don't know if that's unsafe or not. The material is very stretchable and i can breathe and move perfectly fine i just don't know if it's safe or not. can someone please help me?	"Should be safe as long as you can breath properly and dont wear it for more than 8 hours. Listen to your body and you should be fine! Hope you can afford one soon!
it’s alright, not unsafe, but i’d recommend the camisole method more: put a camisole on backwards and fold the torso part up into thirds over your chest. it’s closer to an actual binder in function and you dont have to wrap things around your back or cut up any more clothes.
okk thank you very much :D
Happy Cake Day 18-furbies-and-a-cat! You are never too old to set another goal or to dream a new dream.
okk! i'll be sure to try it out, thank you :D

A vent? about internalized transphobia/misogyny and figuring myself out	" During 6 years I was going back and forth in labels, questioning myself a lot. I also hope that with this I can help someone or someone can relate to my situation!
I'm afab and 18, english isn't my first language.

 It begun with hearing the term ""genderfluid"" when i was 12 and something clicked, I thought it was so interesting and it opened a new reality for me.

 I identified as genderfluid for awhile but at that time, there was going on the cringe culture thing and the genderfluid identity was viewed as nonsense so I tried fitting in one. And well, I chose to identify as male.
 The feelings and the pain I felt were absolutely real, I felt crushing dysphoria, but unexplainably, it changed.
 Then for awhile I tried to accept my feminity and it also felt real. But it all went back to my male identity, had dysphoria again but not as crushing. I could express myself in a tipical feminine way, clothes and makeup, but I still felt male. However, as that also wasn't deemed valid at the time, I forced myself in the tipical masculine.

 With all these people and discussions forcing ideas of gender binarism onto me, I also tried to force myself into that. But it never felt completely right. I thought to myself that I could always be a feminine trans man, and that nobody is completely feminine and masculine. And while that is true, it still didn't feel right.

 Later I saw a phrase by Simone de Beauvoir that went something like this, and it made me think a lot: ""Man is defined as a human being and woman as a female – whenever she behaves as a human being she is said to imitate the male.""

 Was I trying to find comfort in masculinity because it felt more close to neutrality?
 Was I neglecting my feminity because of internalized misogyny?
 Was I neglecting my androgyny and non-binarism because of internalized transphobia?

 Short answer: yes, yes and yes.

 I was actively rejecting the idea of non-binary, because I always thought that society wouldn't take me seriously.
 I also thought that, being non-binary and afab was something so ""common"" that it also made me feel invalidated. Until I came the conclusion that since afab people had to deal gender related issues the moment they were born, it was so much easier to explore gender identity.

 Discovering myself is both fun and scary. If it wasn't for the obvious difficulties that this implies, it would be obviously more fun than scary. These days my parents found about my hormone therapy and reacted very badly. I guess i can only dream of a better world.

 I came to the conclusion that, man or woman, I'm a human that expresses myself and wants my brain to match the reality I live in. Since I don't want to reproduce and even less like this, I have no interest or use for my hormones and reproductive traits. Either way, my way of reproducing doesn't have to determine my whole life. 

 It was a long journey, I'm still accepting myself and i don't know if there will be space for more changes, either way, I think that anyone questioning should priorize both comfortability and safety!"		qe9gis	NonBinary	4	0.84	2021-10-23 17:35:26

Hazel, my first Non-Binary character	"I just felt like showing my new drawing of my first Non-Binary character named Hazel, they're 14 years old and AMAB, they go by they/them.

There is more to know about this little fella, ask if you wanna find out.

Backstory:

They're backstory is a bit complicated, and pretty traumatic, if you asked them, they most likely wouldn't want to tell you even if you they know you well, but that's what I'm here for, there are some details I still need to polish though:

Hazel was born in an aristocrat family, in a very matriarcal country, meaning that daughters were the heirs of families and had most of the positions in power, but Hazel was the youngest child of 5, having 4 older brothers, it was a dishonor for they're family to have a another boy (the way they viewed Hazel), so they decided to raise them like a lady and was given a female sounding name, try as hard as they could to convince everyone, including Hazel, that they were a girl, this as expected triggered their disphoria at an early age.

But that changed when a professional assassin was sent after they're family ( for reasons I'm still working on), they were the only one that managed to survived, but now they had lost everything and became an orphan at the age of 9.

Because they feared for they're safety they escaped to another country, there, they were adopted by a family of farmers, with this new family Hazel adopted a more male sounding name an tried to act like the male they thought they were suppoused to be, and why they were so unhappy. The farmers weren't bad people, but they never knew about Hazel's past, they never even asked, Hazel worked daily in the farm even at their age, mainly to train they're body and get rid of their femenine figure, but with a few years they realized things weren't really changing, they were still unhappy like before, and still suffered from the disphorya just as much, but before they were able to make up they're mind about anything, a second tragedy happened, on a night of full moon, Hazel found the farmers dead, they had marks of bites and scratches, Hazel took a weapon to defend themselves, and then a huge creature attacked them, one that looked like a mix of a tiger and a human, it went to bite Hazel in the leg, and even with the pain, Hazel managed to kill the beast, but now he had no family again, and would soon discover that, not only they are not a man or a woman, but something in between, but also that they are now a weretiger, capable of transforming either partially of completely into a white tiger at will.

If this is against the rules just tell me and I'll delete it.

https://i.redd.it/lh3vkc0ttgf31.png"	"Can I know a bit more about them? What are pronouns, what's their story?
The name Hazel always reminds me of Watership Down.
I love them and their backstory, such a cool character!
I edited the post with the answers :)
I guess, came up with the character years ago, and at the time Hazel was just a name that sounded cool for a character, and after I learned that it can be an eye color, then I decided to give them hazel eyes.
Thanks, and they're one of my more underdeveloped characters, I still feel like I'm not doing them justice.
It is a great name. Hazel was the protagonist of Watership Down. Such an epic. I cry whenever I hear Bright Eyes (from the 1972 film).
Yeah, I did watch the movie, but I totally forgot the names of the characters, altough, it had already been years since I had created the characters, and I watched the movie last year, it wasn't inspired by it, I just felt like I wanted to make that part clear."	co6bl5	NonBinary	5	0.73	2019-08-09 18:21:21
Should I mark my gender as X on my driver's license?	"Partly seeking advice, partly a vent because I know this has been posted here before: I live in New York and I'm planning to renew my driver's license tomorrow: new photo, new address and everything. The one thing I'm still uncertain about is changing the gender to X.

I'm not in the most progressive part of the state but it's still better than a lot of areas, and I have public social media accounts I use for work where I'm out as nonbinary, so it's not like you couldn't figure that out about me.

I guess my concerns remain with getting stopped by a cop or anyone else looking at my ID, or having that down in a public system.

I'm still so often seen as a woman, and it would be great to have my gender legitimized in some way, but I don't know if it's worth that euphoria if my safety is at risk.

UPDATE: Fate ended up deciding for me :/ There was no ""X"" option on the form at the DMV in my little rural county so I left it blank. When I got my interim license it was marked F"	"First, if it matters to you, I'd double-check whether it even is recorded in the public system or not. In Ontario, they'll print the ID with an X, but the system — and even the paper temporary licence they give you — has your ASAB on it (unless you previously went through the steps to have it changed to F or M). I worried about these things, too. I think it's hard for anyone else to say, given there are other factors that influence one's interactions with people checking their ID. Eg are you already likely to deal with racist violence and BS from cops, airport security, etc. I haven't had issues but I haven't had to hand it over that many times, I don't think people are looking at that piece of info, and I'm well aware that white and to some extent class privilege have a lot to do with how those interactions go.
Only problem I've had in two years with an X was in Wyoming.
Oh yeah, I'm well aware I have a lot of privilege because I'm white and oftentimes pass as cishet. Nearly all my interactions with police have been fine, like even involving incidents like speeding getting dismissed or dropped to lesser charges and like I *know* that for sure has to do with it. It's partly why I think the ID thing wouldn't be an issue

Also I'll check if it is recorded in the system or not, thanks for that
What problem did you experience? o.o
Id was confiscated at a liquor store for being fake because of the x, also I look like a teenager. I told the  kid at the counter he didn't have to sell me booze, but he did need to give me my fucking driver's license or call the cops.

He gave it back.
Honestly I look pretty young so that would be a concern for me :/

Who is eligible for the nonbinary category when running races?	I’ve been running on-and-off the last 5 years and I think this is the year I want to break the 10K threshold and run a half marathon! I am AFAB, 1 year on T, and just had double-incision top surgery. I run for completion not for speed, but for context when I ran as a female I was average. Nevertheless, I do have some goals later on that have time requirements. My legal gender is now male and I’m on testosterone, so I’ve run my last two races as male. Is there any time I should consider running as nonbinary? I hate labels but I chose a male gender marker for international travel safety reasons.	"i’m afraid if you’re using male for safety purposes and you change it to any non -gender conforming label
you’re putting yourself in way more danger internationally than using women. 

i would stick with male if you’re on t to avoid being hate crimed (just my opinion i don’t marathon)
There's a nonbinary category?
The time you should consider running in the non-binary category is if you feel non-binary when you a signing up! Lol

Are you concerned about having a fair competition while on T?

I am competing in my first marathon in the spring!! I am starting hrt (again) while training. I'm AMAB but by the time I race my hormone profile will be solidly in the female range. If we were to race against each other this year, maybe I'd beat you since I probably won't lose too much performance. But if we both kept on our same HRT pathway, maybe I'd improve more slowly over the year and you would improve at a faster rate, and you beat me handily the next time we face off.

My feeling about this is, who cares? Lol. I'm happy we can compete as ourselves and in our own little club without shoehorning ourselves into whether we are closer to man or woman at the time we compete. It is probably likely that trans men and non-HRT transfemmes will top the category, but until we have more data and better divisions for performance metrics, I think you shouldn't worry too much about it. Wouldn't it be cool if you were the fastest NB in your city???

Also, if you are on Strava I now think there needs to be a non-binary running club.
Yeah publicly claiming nonbinary can be dangerous
Majors like Boston, Chicago, London, and New York City Marathons have added the category!"	1179fue	NonBinary	3	0.72	2023-02-20 15:20:04
Wearing a binder at school?	"Hey, baby trans here! I really want a binder, but can’t get one right now - nevertheless, I have a question. Can I wear a binder to school? My school day lasts from about 7:00 to 3:30 if you factor in my bus rides to and from campus. That’s eight and a half hours roughly. I’ve heard the eight hours rule, so do you think I should take off and put on my binder at school - shaving about an hour off. Sorry if this is a weirdly specific situation, I’d just like an elder trans perspective please. Safety first!

Thanks in advance! 😊"	"I personally would never wear one at school just because I go by the rule my trans friend told me to have a break after 4 hours and I'm at school for 9ish. I'd love to but I care more about my safety (it's also really hot out)
commenting because id also like the answer
If you're just starting out, don't have a full school day be your first day. It's probably okay if you wear it some days if you put it on once you get there. But don't wear it every single day. It's important to have break days. Try to listen to your body and if it feels like too much, you might need to take a longer break
Okay, good advice! Yeah, I really would like to but health comes first. Maybe I could wear it only at certain times? Idk, I’m just struggling to see “me” in the mirror.
Excellent. We can wait together 😂.
Yeah, good advice! I’m not planning to start off with a school day 😂.
Me too, I just have to be safe. A lot of people just say not to bind for more than 8 hours.
Yeah. Eh, I hope outside of school will be good enough. I say this like I’m getting one, I couldn’t without outing myself to my... less than supportive family. This is all such wishful thinking 😂.
Yeah, I own one but only wear it in my room by myself, again I would wear it to school (my parents wouldnt see) but safety"	oo8eh0	NonBinary	3	0.81	2021-07-20 18:50:06
I think I'm a girl, or at least partially - a ramble	"Sorry if this is a bit ramble-y, I've had a lot on my mind and I'm not always the best at being concise when typing stream of consciousness. It's also copy pasted, I tried to post this in /r/asktransgender but I think my account is too new and it got auto removed. 

I had to make a throwaway because I'm far from out:


So I'm 28, AMAB, happily married to a cis woman i love deeply. A couple years after college, I came out to her as bi sexual, as I had discovered it myself in my early 20's. I'd say I have like a 90/10 preference for women over men, but I'm not turned off based on genitals.

I also got help for my depression, addressed my ADHD which was not diagnosed until adulthood, and my therapist thinks I may be on the spectrum which would make a lot of sense... anyways.

Maybe I'm better described as pansexual, but I've never really been that concerned with finding the exact right label for myself. My wife is amazing, she knows this and it didn't change anything about how she sees me.

She also knows that I sometimes enjoy wearing women's underwear, though I've never been brave enough to do it in front of her. I asked her a couple years ago if she would ever peg me, and she's willing to try, we have the toys. I just haven't been brave enough for that yet either.

I've told her before that I sometimes am conflicted about my gender identity, and she told me that she wants me to be happy, but that if I fully transitioned that would kind of be a deal breaker for her, which I understand.

I want to have biological kids of my own, and be a father, or parent, for lack of a better term, so for many reasons I don't know that I'll ever ""come out,"" fully, or publicly. I'm not sure if I'm sold on that idea for life but for now I'm okay being honest with just myself. The only people that even know I'm bisexual are my wife, and my best friend, a cis man who is also bisexual who I confided in.

But recently I've been reflecting a lot about how I feel about myself, and my body. I remember vividly being 4 or 5 years old, and telling my mom I wanted to be a girl. I was a kindergartener, but I just loved the way the pretty girls at school dressed. I always wanted a doll as a toy, and I had one, in addition to more stereotypically masculine toys.

My mom kind of brushed it off, my parents always told me I was allowed to be gay if I wanted when I grew up and stuff like that but this was 1998 so trans issues were not as well known by people like my parents. I grew up as a cis boy, and I was obsessed with girls as I came into puberty so all I really knew was that I wasn't gay.

My mom raised me catholic, and I went to an all boys private college prep school. My parents aren't wealthy, but a family member of mine taught there and I did work study and other obligations to help afford the tuition. I think being in that environment was very poisonous to my psyche regarding sexuality.

My parents were open and honest with me about sex, they're liberal, pro-choice, sex positive, pro contraception, understood I would be sexually active with my first serious girlfriend and just encouraged safety, etc. But so many of my peers were extremely conservative, extremely rich, extremely homophobic, extremely catholic.

We were taught a lot of horrible chastity theology from ages 12-18 (this is a grade 6 through 12 school) and I think despite actively disagreeing with it while I was learning it, it had a big impact in my shame response to some of my feelings about my sexuality and my gender. It's like that part of my brain is still programmed to be phobic out of safety or something.

I'm an atheist now and have been since high school, but being exposed to that thinking by so many people my adolescent life has me with some bad problems with internalized transphobia, or biphobia, or whatever.

I didn't really question my gender much after I was really young, but I do remember through ages 7-14 hating wearing boxers, and secretly pulling them up my legs while I slept under the blankets so they felt like girls underwear.

I have a lot of masculine traits too, and I don't get dysphoria from them I don't think. But lately I've been having a hard time denying myself, the more I learn about gender in general. I think I'm a girl. Or at least, sometimes I'm a girl, or I'm part girl, or I was supposed to be a girl. I haven't really figured all this out yet.

I don't really identify with men at all. I have lots of guy friends and we do stereotypically masculine activities, but my friends are all kind of weird and empathetic while still being sociable. They aren't vary ""Manly"" men for lack of a better term.

I've always been strangely comfortable as the only guy in groups of women, and in college my wife (then not even my girlfriend yet) and her group of girlfriends would have me included in their girls nights sometimes just to cheer me up (i was going through bad depression after a horrible breakup with my high school sweetheart)

There's something about women, or femininity that i deeply identify with. I'm very sensitive and empathetic, and even when i desire women sexually it's almost in an awe struck ""I want to be you"" kind of way.

I also like playing sports, but in that environment I'm much more uncomfortable with men. I played beer league hockey for a while, and being in that locker room was terrible. There were a couple good dudes but a lot of racists, a lot of casual sexism... In environments I guess where people just assume I'm ""one of the guys"" i feel really really really out of place.

I've been growing out my hair super long for the first time ever and I like the way I look. Today I sat in some cute panties in front of a mirror, and actually tied one of my wife's swimsuit tops on. I'm a bit skinny-fat, athletic but not super defined. if i scrunch my shoulders my ""cleavage"" filled out the swim top nicely.

I'm usually bearded but I shaved my beard today very smooth, and trimmed a lot of body hair. I guess body hair is one thing I'm kind of dysphoric about. But I sat and finally saw a picture of myself I liked, I felt desirable. I'm hoping sometime soon to be brave enough to dress like that in front of my wife.

I don't know how that will go overall but she's supportive and I hope she won't see me any differently still. I don't know what the point of this post is really but I've never talked about this before, anonymously or otherwise. I think I'm a girl, or nonbinary, or maybe genderfluid. I still don't really know the differences and am working to figure myself out.

But I'd appreciate any words of support or just empathy if anyone is in a similar spot to me.

Coping with Nonbinary-Specific Gender Dysphoria? (BIPOC)	"(Current identity is trans-nonbinary, hx/hxm or he/him pronouns pls.)

Hi everyone. I'm afab and transitioned to a guy a while ago. But when I explored fem clothes/makeup for the first time a few years into being stealth, I liked it. I kinda realized I'm not a guy, I'm a he/him very usually fine with being seen as a guy. But sometimes I'm not, if it's been a while without me feeling like I can express myself. But also safety is a bigger concern than comfort, so idk. Being a guy in makeup isn't exactly cool here, so I use the womens bathroom, then get confrontations bc I'm a guy in the womens bathroom. (They're not *wrong,* tho I am a no-T afab, I feel like I vibe as an intensely queer-fem cis amab.)

TL;DR: I'm afab bipoc, not cool with being a girl, used to being a guy. But it feels like pretend sometimes. Is settling what I'm gonna have to do? How does one cope with the nonbinary dysphoria? It doesn't feel traumatic like my trans dysphoria, but the nonbinary dysphoria unease feels constricting. 

PS I don't like they pronouns when used to refer to me, though that's the only nonbinary-affirming progressively socially acceptable solution I can think of."	"i don't have any specific advice but you might also check out r/ftmfemininity
As a nonbinary afab with facial hair, I have similar bathroom-related issues. When at all possible I've been using gender neutral/family restrooms in public because I don't feel safe in mens bathrooms, but I definitely get weird looks and double takes in the women's restrooms, too. When I must use gendered restrooms, I usually just walk quickly to a stall and try not to make eye contact. 

However, I'm also white, so people react differently to me than they would to a nonbinary or GNC bipoc.

It's also hard to cope with wanting to present in GNC ways, but fearing other people's reactions. So far I've tamped down my desire to wear makeup or more ""flamboyant"" expressions, because while my area is relatively progressive, we also have a population of Proud Boys and other violent conservative groups around. 

I don't really have a solution other than ""take advantage of opportunities to be femme when you're not in public, or at queer-specific events"". 

Good luck. Living in the between space is hard."	nuw6fz	NonBinary	4	0.84	2021-06-08 04:21:54
Safety on Public Transport Advice	"Hello! I'm amab, non-binary, and 19. I'm looking for opinions and advice about how much I should tone down my presentation while taking the subway back and forth to my classes this summer. 

A little bit of background, I go to a very liberal art college where I feel pretty safe presenting however I want to. I also live in a pretty liberal area as well. I've been out and presenting as my queer self for a while, and i've been on HRT for eight months now. It's to the point now where unless I take steps to hide my breasts I look visibly trans. This works for me on a personal level, because I'm non-binary and my ideal presentation is a pretty inherently queer one. I've been able to present this way because I lived in the dorm at my school, and the dorm is right across the street from my classes, so I never felt particularly vulnerable. I dress pretty feminine or androgynous most of the time, often with makeup, skirts or cute socks and things, though mostly I just wear whatever I feel like at the time.

When I needed to go out on my own to other places on errands and such I would just dress normatively. However, this summer I'm back home and I'm taking summer classes a few times a week for about a month. I have to ride the subway for a fair ways in order to get to my school. I'm really worried about being harassed or targeted for being visibly trans on public transportation. It doesn't help that I also have pretty bad anxiety, and public transport completely terrifies me on it's own even without the added stress of being trans.

 I've gotten used to being able to express myself openly at school. While I know that's a huge privilege, I really don't want to go back to hiding my real self. I also would have to stop painting my nails for a whole month while going to classes, and having that fear interfere with my presentation in my normal personal life sucks. Toning down my presentation doesn't erase my queerness. But because I have anxiety my presentation is often the only way I can make myself visible and express myself to other people, and it's also one of the few things that gives me confidence in social situations. Plus it just hurts every time people gender me as male. Trying to ""Pass"" in public as female would be closer to my desired presentation than my assigned gender is, but I don't know if I could, and I've never really attempted it.

So what do you people think? Should I dress completely as my assigned gender on the train, or should I just present how I want anyway, or is there a viable compromise between expression and safety. It's really hard for me to decide because a combination of my anxiety, and inexperience presenting in completely public spaces prevents me from realistically assessing the situation.

tl;dr - I'm amab and present pretty feminine. I used to be close to my college classes, but now I have to take the train and I'm worried about safety with how I present.
"	"Honestly, the large majority of your metro experience will be boring but if it does bad (and I have no idea if it will!) it'll be scary. 
Are you commuting in a bad area? Have you been harassed there before? Whats the
I think I would definitely try to preserve some of your gender expression but you basically have to decide how much risk you think it will put on you and how much risk you are willing to accept. 
These are the options that I think would be the most feasible given your situation:
-Present as neutral and gradually add more feminine items as time goes on to ""test the waters"" and see how much you are able to safely put out there
-Present as neutral on the bus but change and/or add accessories that make you feel more ""you"" when you arrive at school
-Find someone to travel with that you feel safe around "	6db0zw	NonBinary	4	1.0	2017-05-25 17:15:32
friend’s boyfriend has misgendered me twice	"so I 23nb live with four roommates (22nb, 22nb, 23nb, and 26f) and it’s generally pretty good. However, 26f’s bf who did not know me prior to me exclusively using they/them pronouns has misgendered me twice in my own apartment and it’s just been making me feel quite dysphoric. It’s just making me feel terrible and spiral and makes me on edge whenever I have to be around him which makes me feel bad because he’s generally a nice guy but I just feel so uncomfortable. I’ve never had such a strong reaction to someone misgendering me and don’t generally experience a lot of dysphoria but for whatever reason this is bothering me a lot.

I have a few theories as to why it’s bothering me so much 
- as stated, 3/4 of my other roommates are also non binary and he NEVER misgenders any of them. While don’t get me wrong I’m glad he hasn’t misgendered them, it kind of shows me that he isn’t just bad  at pronouns but just sees me specifically as a woman. Which, whatever, but do a better job hiding it.
- I am bisexual and he made a comment in the past about bisexuality(not about me) that wasn’t explicitly bad but just felt a little off / sexualized 
- this has happened twice in my own apartment where I feel like I should be able to be comfortable.
- I’m not out at my job for safety reasons so I get misgendered (through no fault but my own) a lot and my personal life is the time I get to be open abt who I am.

Idrk what my purpose in this post was. I’ve decided not to bring it up to him or his gf unless he does it a third time so not necessarily looking for advice on how to approach them?

I guess I’m asking if I’m crazy or overreacting and how I can help myself stop feeling so uncomfortable around someone I have to see fairly regularly ? Thank you <3"	"You’re not overreacting. Having your boundaries and your preferences respected in your own home is super-important.

You probably can’t stop feeling uncomfortable about it, but you might be able to become more comfortable with your discomfort with some self-compassion, acceptance and a plan for how to deal with it if it does happen.

It’s probably more about him and something going on in his mind than it is about you. I have a mind-trick of sorts which I call ”water off a duck’s back” which is just to imagine whatever unpleasant/annoying thing just happened just falls off me, like water off a non-permeating surface. Somehow the imagery helps.

Hope you get to have peace and thriving in yoor home.
It kind of sounds like while he's being welcoming to the others, he's singling you out and choosing not to use *your* specific pronouns. Being bisexual as well, it kind of feels like your friend's boyfriend is fetishizing your sexuality, and doesn't want you to be defined as non-binary, as it ruins the 'fantasy'.

Honestly, I'd tell your friend flat-out what this is doing to you. If he's done it twice on purpose, he's going to keep doing it until you either snap, or cut him out. Especially if he's proven to be capable of using pronouns properly for others. Just approach your friend honestly and tell them truthfully that their boyfriend doesn't seem very willing to budge on how he views you, and how it's making you feel.

You're not overreacting in setting boundaries. Especially not in your own home.
Thank you so much. This was really helpful and validating ❤️
thank you, unfortunately this is what I kind of feared. I really don’t think he’s doing deliberately at all (bc if he was he would get torn apart lol), but I do kind of feel like the sexualization thing is why he’s placed me in the woman box and has misgendered me. The bisexual comment was basically he told his gf “it’s okay if you’re bisexual, don’t fight it” or something along those lines - it’s not explicitly sexual I guess I’m just on such high alert w men commenting on that or being actively encouraging of it but I think I may just be reading into it. but yeah idk I just feel a lil weird and thanks for your comment ❤️"	11demia	NonBinary	5	0.86	2023-02-27 15:32:01
Hiya! 👋 quick question	"I’m Non-Binary using they/them pronouns. Im pretty indifferent to my own pronouns but I always want to be respectful of everyone else’s feelings too. 

So if I were to greet another person I knew was using the same pronoun but hadn’t met, would it be disrespectful to say “what’s up fellow they?”

Thanks and sorry if I offended anyone ✌️💕

EDIT: Safety is a *huuuuge* concern of mine and I always want to respect that :) just adding that this is a greeting only for platforms like OKC unless I know the person well enough to feel comfortable with casual greetings."	"Haha, I also like to be respectful of pronouns and in my opinion I don't think that is offensive and it can be a pretty fun way to start conversation!
If you know they use they/them pronouns, I think that's a reasonable way to open the conversation. I personally would not be offended by that.
Might startle/catch me off guard in a ""HOW DID THEY KNOW!?"" sort of way.
I favour ""Greetings fellow human,"" and not just because sometimes it gets an ""Are you...?"" in response
With the 'fellow' it should not be a problem.
It would kind of weird me out. Not because of the ""fellow they"", but because of the whole ""How do they know me?"" thing. Like, even if you vaguely know someone from a mutual friend or your job or something, it's polite to introduce yourself first before you jump to, ""Hi! I'm a random stranger who knows you're queer!"" And if it's some random public place, they may not want to be outed like that.
Thanks! That’s exactly what I’m aiming for ☺️
I hear ya! I would *definitely* only use it when it's only the two of us. I'm really sensitive about compromising anyone's safety and only feel comfortable using this type of greeting on platforms like OKC where I already have good idea of them :)"	nzowjw	NonBinary	5	1.0	2021-06-14 15:07:42
T timeline: 2 week update	"T timeline: 2 week update

https://www.reddit.com/r/NonBinaryTalk/comments/l3iwfc/1_week_t_update/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf

Hey friends! I wanted to check in and let you all know about my progress on low dose T. I posted a link to my 1 week update in case anyone wants to start there. So far not a lot of changes since my first post. 

Mental: I talked about how great it feels to have a better mind/body connection and I still feel that way but something strange happened at the beginning of week 2; my anxiety skyrocketed for a few days. I think it was a combo of extra energy on T/new feelings of being present in real time. I feel like even though I didn’t enjoy how things were pre-T I still had a safety net and knew what to expect. I’ve always been one to think 12 steps ahead just so I can prepare myself for every outcome, almost to the point of being able to predict things that will happen. When I started T I didn’t feel the need to be “on” all the time and that realization came with me having to find a new baseline. I didn’t feel the need to obsess over what was going to happen and my anxiety made me believe that the fact I didn’t feel the need to obsess was wrong somehow(the human mind is so bizarre) but I guess we are creatures of habit; even if those habits harm us. After I processed what was happening and also cut down on my caffeine intake I was able to become clear headed again. I still have moments of panic and feeling like things are surreal but this is a journey and there will be many bumps along the road. I’m willing to deal with those bumps because I finally feel like I’m headed in the right direction. 

Physical: Things are still uber slow on this front and I’m okay with that. I think if physical changes happened too fast my anxiety would ramp up more. My body hair is getting slightly longer on my arms but still light in color. I have more hair on my upper thighs but very patchy. I can tell I’m getting more muscle definition and I feel stronger. Last Friday I had horrible leg pain that felt similar to growing pains when I was a kid. I read that ligaments and tendons change when T is introduced so I’m thinking that was the reason. I was able to control it with Advil. Skin changes are the same, just a bit more oily and a few pimples. Bottom growth continues to happen but not terribly noticeable. My smell seems to be changing. I have less overall body softness/fat. 

Alright pals! That’s pretty much it for this week. If things continue to go along slowly I may change my updates to monthly. I hope this post helps and I’m always open to questions. Keep being awesome!"		lb9iav	NonBinary	5	1.0	2021-02-02 23:15:27
Looking for more concrete information about X gender marker on documentation. Please help if you've got experience with it!	"I know there have been lots of posts about this, but none of them answered the particular questions I have about getting myself an X.

Specifically, I want to know if it's possible to get an X on my birth certificate and an F on things like my license and passport. The state I'm from doesn't allow X on licenses or other IDs (yet), and I'm worried about getting outed or given trouble if I'm in a not-so-chill place. I'm also incredibly indecisive (duh) and one minute I'm like ""since X is available, I might as well take it!"" and another I'm worried about my safety.

I also want to ask if anyone who identifies more on one side of the gender spectrum but still as nonbinary would feel insecure about getting an F or M on their docs even if X is an option. I know it's ridiculous, but I have this scenario in my head where, in the future, people will use the fact that I didn't get an X as a way to gatekeep me from ""actually being nonbinary."" It's absurd, I know, but it's just a thought and I want to know if others have thought it as well.

That's about all I can think to ask directly. I'd love for others to share their experiences as well, if anyone wants to!

Thanks, and Happy Nonbinary Day!"	"I have an X birth certificate and F driver’s license/passport. I was born in Oregon, which has X as a option, but now I live in Florida which does not. Has never caused any issues, especially since literally no one has ever asked to see my birth certificate.
In my country, you have to have surgery to change gender. #wokeaf. Lol
Again, Australia is behind the times.
For myself I won’t be getting an c and I know many other nb people who won’t as a matter of safety
It depends on what state or country you’re in. [Here’s a list](https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2019/02/nonbinary-intersex-11-u-s-states-issuing-third-gender-ids/) of the 11 (12) US states where you can get either birth certificate or driver’s license with an X (note that NH just added driver’s licenses with an X, which is not listed in that article). 

I’m gonna come back and link a post I made a couple days ago with my own thoughts on this in a minute.

Edit: here’s the post. https://www.reddit.com/r/NonBinary/comments/cc4pzt/nh_passes_law_to_allow_nonbinary_gender_on/
How does that work when you have to register your gender legally for insurance and stuff? Do you just put F as a default and nonbinary when an option?

Also, how did that work with your passport?
My state has it and all I've gotta do is fill out a form, I just want information from those who've chose it, y'know?
I just do everything “legal” with F since if I show ID it’s never my birth certificate. 

I had a passport before I changed my birth certificate, but I imagine it wouldn’t be an issue to get a passport with F on it if your drivers license / other ID says F

Thought I was genderfluid. But now? Warning this is long. So sorry :3	"This last year or the last two really have been a lot of self dissecting of myself. 
I spent years shadowed under trauma, bad relationships and my crap mental health. It had me pinned to the floor so hard I didn't know who I was or what I was. For reference 10 years ago I thought I was straight and cis!
Now I know I'm definitely pansexual but also Demisexual. I know I am NOT cis.
So what am I? Not an easy question. Initially I thought trans. Thought about it a lot. Tried to imagine living as a man. Part of me was finally so happy I acknowledged that side of myself instead of the usual ""im a terrible girl"" ""i dont know how to be a woman"". But the idea of being a man fulltime made me as sad as well. Just as living as a cis woman does. 

So it wasn't that... But there's definitely something here thats not... cis.

So what then? I've thought about gender roles and how honestly truely they are a load of crap. I've met cis women who were more manly then some men. They never Apologized or felt the need to explain it. I've met the most feminine men. More feminine then some women I know. Again some were unapologetic and just owned it. 
So Anyone, if they really want to, can do anything they like without having to give anyone a reason as to why.

Now the patriarchy benefits from the binary. Having slotted out roles and privileges for their two genders that benefits the one is definitelya power play. God forbid someone break free of that! I'm thinking of how my super religious grandparents and parents behaved. 
Just 🤮
Because I was AFAB I wasn't allowed to do anything ""manly"" well until both brothers left home and my dad was to lazy to do it himself lol. Then I was his third son 🤔🤦🏻‍♀️
 Turns out I am really good a lot of manly things. Turns out I dont really like ""traditionally"" feminine things. In my adult life I continued to do things that ""girls"" can't do.  Because fuck people and their stupid ideas of what I can and can not do. 
I'm more comfortable in a pair of steel toed boots throwing shit around or driving truck then I ever was in domestic roles. Did I get harassed by some men because of it? Yes. Did I also prove them wrong over and over again? Yes. 
That doesnt mean I am not in part a woman. I hate feminine clothes on me. They feel weird. Like I am naked. But I can still do amazing makeup and look sexy AF if I want to. I love my feminine features bit loathe how society has treated me due to them. In that way I find safety in my ""masculinity ""
Because vibes and body language can communicate a lot and Ive mastered the ""fuck around and find out vibe""

Honestly explains why closeted queer men love me... explains why my exs were into me haha. 

Anyways I settled on genderfluid but I'm debating that agian. Even though I feel like I swap between the two I am not actually swapping. One side is just more present? Its always there though. Like I am always me. Those traits may take turns stearing the boat but they are both captains. 
I also feel like a part of me thinks the whole thing is so stupid. Spend so much time wondering about it instead of just doing what I love ❤️  so maybe non-binary? 

 I am going forward regardless. Maybe without an air tight label.... As I always have with everything. Its not so cut and dry and thats ok. I'm used to that. 
Not knowing what flag or label to use doesn't change the fact that I'm anything but straight and cis. That feels good and Throwing it back in conservative Christian mens faces every chance I get makes my ""evil"" heart happy. In a long line of things that offend small minded ignorant plugs this is definitely my favorite! 
I'm embracing me! I'm doing Me! In my entirety, how I feel in the moment. I'll wear, act and live how I want. I'm not going to explain it to anyone but those that wanna know. I am not going to ask for forgiveness or permission. I don't need anyone to acknowledge it because I've lived 31 years with little to no acknowledgment in other areas of my life.  Like my ADHD (which Just got diagnosed) My autism and so many other mysteries of my mind and soul. 

I know who I am. I may not have a title for it but its awesome and I'm proud. 😊🖤"	"Heya Im happy for you too! As a person who just slapped the term non-binary on and called it a day, I also feel like it just allowed me more freedom. Like i haven't completely figured my gender feelings out, maybe i'll never figure it out, but I'm doing okay and pretty happy with myself right now as just a nonbinary person, gives me plenty of room to just shift and change and be what I want!

&#x200B;

My own perception of gender norms is like this: no matter what I do, I'm still me. I wear a dress, doesnt mean Im a woman. I wear a tie, doesnt mean I am a man. in the same way a woman who wears a tie isnt therefore a man, or a man that wears a dress isnt therefore a woman. Personally, I find that really more helpful to accepting parts and things that I enjoy but are aligned to my agab. 

Im rambling but all in all i guess i just wanna say Im happy for you and i relate to a lot of the stuff u wrote here! Best to you on your gendering journey!"	yqxvxb	NonBinary	5	1.0	2022-11-09 22:40:39
Help? I'm experiencing major dysphoria and want to make a change, or a few changes. what's the process like?	"Hello all, I'm a 22YO NB (they/them pronouns please), and I have recently gone through a major life change. I was not able to express myself at all for a long time, and now that I'm finally free, I've been having more euphoric moments and realizing I don't like how I look at all.

I was AFAB, but have come to the realization that I've been outed for years by palm readers and by friends. 

I know what it is about myself I want to change to feel more comfortable in myself. I've done one step (hairstyle change), but there are still a couple more on the list that I need done, but I'm trying to figure out how I can get them done in a way in which my insurance covers it completely.

I want to have top surgery. I want to be completely flat-chested. I hate my boobs and the fact people see them and think ""oh that's definitely a woman"". I'm NOT one. I don't want to be one.

Secondly, I'd love to go on T - just levels to further masculinize my body, not levels for transitioning. I hate that my body looks too feminine despite some masculine features I have naturally.

For reference, I am located in Kentucky, USA. I have a feeling that it will make it more difficult to find someone.

Those of you who are in my state, and have had this done, how did you go about it? I've been reading about doing this, but I'm not quite understanding what I need to do.

If you have any doctors to recommend, I'll only see female doctors or gay doctors for my personal safety due to a bad experience with a hetero male doctor. Thanks."		11iekrz	NonBinary	3	1.0	2023-03-04 21:58:50
Navigating a job offer when considering enby happiness/safety	"Hello all! I wanted others' perspectives on a major decision that will be coming up for me. I'm being offered a new job at a university in a small town in western North Carolina. It's perfect for me professionally: exactly what I hoped to be doing with my degree and my skills, a BIG pay increase, and much better professional development opportunities than what I currently have now.

The issue is, I'm not sure how I feel about moving as a non-binary person. I'll be moving from a mid-sized city in the North. My parents grew up in the South and I've visited many times (NC, TN, and GA), but of course that's different than living there. The workplace itself doesn't seem like it would be much of an issue gender-wise, or at least no more than what I'm facing now. It's a university town, so people are more liberal, and I feel prepared to handle the misgendering when it does happen. During the interview my potential bosses were very good about answering my questions about their ability to support queer employees: there are gender-neutral bathrooms in the building, I can be out at work, etc. 

I won't get this kind of economic opportunity in my current city, but I would miss my queer friends, my community, and a generally high level of gender understanding that I have here. And with the direction the US as a whole is turning, I'm getting increasingly worried for my physical safety. Does anyone have any advice for how to approach weighing the pros & cons? 

**TL;DR**: I'm considering taking a great job in a rural area, and am living fully out as an enby. It would be a big improvement in pay and the workplace seems supportive, but not so sure about the rest of my life. What factors should I consider before making this decision?"	"Well, from what you just said, it doesn't seem like there will be issues for you being nb there. If I were at your place, to mesure the pros and cons, I would go on a trip to this new city before thinking of accepting the job. Just to look around, have a first impression of the place and the people (well, I hope it's not too far from where you're currently at so that you can actually do it ^^'). Maybe ask around there if there's a queer community for the town or the region? I don't really know how it works in the US, but you can look online too
It sounds like you will be safe on campus, but worried about safety off campus. I personally wouldn't feel safe moving to NC at the moment, but I guess it also depends on the city/town. I would recommend researching local queer groups, communities, and outreach programs. I would get familiar with the political environment and see what is going to go down in the next few months/years as much as possible."	w9ja8v	NonBinary	3	0.81	2022-07-27 16:31:08
Anyone here work in the trades? Looking for some career advice	"Would love to hear from to hear from some transmasc afab people especially, or anyone who uses they/them pronouns. 

I'm thinking about completely switching gears on my chosen career path and going into the trades. I'm struggling in college even though I'm pursuing a degree that I'm highly interested in. I have little experience in the trades, but I've found that I really enjoy my current campus job in the scene shop and costume shop of the school's theatre department. I enjoy working with my hands and I'm doing something different each day, which keeps me from losing interest. I do well with hands on learning. I also know you can make a decent amount of money, and there is no shortage of job opportunities. This is attractive to me as the career I'm currently working towards is low pay and highly competitive.

The main thing I'm worried about with this potential career path is my safety as a transmasc nonbinary person who uses they/them pronouns. I know that the trades are heavily cis male dominated and I've heard a lot about toxicity, sexsism, homophobia and transphobia in the field. Being referred to with she/her pronouns makes me very uncomfortable, but that's what people use for me most of the time unless I make it apparent. This is mostly due to my voice. I am clocked as male more often at my summer job because the work shirt makes me look more masculine, but it usually only happens with people who haven't heard me speak. Though he/him pronouns aren't *my* pronouns, I usually don't mind them because it means I'm presenting masc enough for people to assign he/him pronouns to me.

The point is, I know that I will be depressed working in an environment where I'm closeted and consistently referred to with she/her pronouns. But I'm worried that it would be unsafe for me to be open about my identity if I go into the trades."		tjmv6f	NonBinary	3	1.0	2022-03-21 21:44:42
Help me, help my nibling	"Hey all! 
My nibling (formerly my niece) has just come out to me as non-binary.

I don't want a cheap one because their health and safety comes 1st and I've heard horror stories of incorrectly fitted binders and make shift binders and I DO NOT want that to happen to them.

Doctor's appointments...	"so, this is my semi-tossout, I used it before.

Mild TW (I think so I'm just gonna mention here) - doctor's visits, menstruation

okay, so for some context I was born AFAB, and a few months ago I came out to my family and friends as nonbinary and asexual. And its gone really really good, people are using my name and my pronouns and I'm really satisfied with all of that. 

First Issue: I'm seeing a gynecologist tomorrow for a pap test, and I'm very anxious. I've never had one before, because of my struggles, and it's causing a lot of dysphoria with me. For those who've had one before, can you offer some advice about how to relax before my appointment, and what to expect during my first one?

Second issue: I was controlling my cycle with birth control pills because I have heavy bleeding paired with irregular cycles, but they caused a conflict so I stopped taking them for my safety. I'm interested if anyone has a better, long-term option because of the extreme dysphoria that I feel about it. I don't need a contraceptive device, so much as I just need an anti-menstruation device. Does anyone have any suggestions (aside from the pill) that lightens my cycle and re-regulates it, or possibly something that can help me stop it fully? (I'm currently not a candidate for a tubal or hysterectomy.)

&#x200B;

TL;DR version - 

1. Does anyone have any tips on how to relax, before seeing a gynecologist for the first time, what to expect during a pap test, and what to expect during it?
2. Does anyone have an option that isn't The Pill, that can help with regulating and lightening my cycle/OR stop it completely?

&#x200B;

Thanks for reading this post, it's nauseatingly long, and any advice is really REALLY appreciated thank you!!!"	"1) Let the dr/nurse know you're not used to it/new to it. Ask them to go slowly and talk you through it. If they can't accommodate and make you feel comfortable, you can simply leave at any time and find a new dr. It's good to remember you're in control and remind yourself it'll be okay. If you don't feel good about things, let them know and leave. You can ask them to stop, slow down, etc as well.
My dr talks me through everything she's doing or about to do and checks up on me. She also lets me know before she touches me. Helps a ton! 
2) I'm getting my uterus removed for dysphoria reasons (Hysterectomy, laparoscopy). You still have a hormonal cycle after, but not the bleeding. Procedure is minimally invasive and recovery is short."	yuj1vg	NonBinary	3	1.0	2022-11-13 23:56:16
Gender confused rambling	"Hey all,

&#x200B;

Happy international non-binary day! Hope y'all are having a lovely day being your beautiful selves.

&#x200B;

This is gonna be something of a freeform ramble about some of the things which make me question my gender and some feelings I've not really expressed before, online or irl. I hope this post is allowed here.  Would love to hear from you if any of these feelings are familiar to you.

&#x200B;

CW for mild dysphoria and body dysmorphia.

&#x200B;

So first off, I'm pan, AMAB and currently present as cis male but am somewhat unsure of how I feel about that. I've never been particularly masculine in personality or appearance, but nor do I present as feminine enough to ever have been assumed to be anything other than a queer cis man. 

I don't think I've ever felt a particular sense of ""maleness"": as a child I much preferred to spend time cooking and gardening with my grandmother than participating in stereotypically masculine activities; I can remember that whilst playing games with friends in primary school where we would roleplay as characters from films such as LotR, I would frequently roleplay as a female character.

Moving to the present, I don't really experience much, if any, gender dysphoria. I sometimes feel a vague sense that I'd rather have been born in a female body, but it's typically fleeting and 90% of the time I'm pretty comfortable with having a male body. I do occassionally wear makeup (though not outside the safety of my own house) and sometimes feel that I'd prefer to present as more feminine or androgynous in public, but I'm too nervous to actually try it.

On occassion, I start to grow out my facial hair to see how it looks, but every time I've tried I've found a week or so in that it disgusts me and had to shave. However, I also have some pretty intense body dysmorphia and hate a lot of the way I look, so I have a hard time seperating whether this is out of some desire to not look masculine or just the dysmorphia. 

I've found that whenever I meet non-binary people irl, I have a sort of attraction to them -  not necessarily a sexual attraction, but more so an admiration, and perhaps even slight envy at times. 

I'm too nervous to talk to any trans or non-binary friends about these feelings because I don't want to be seen to appropriate their experience or claim an identity that isn't mine, and part of me feels like perhaps I am just a queer cis guy who's a little confused. 

&#x200B;

Now I'm not expecting anyone to tell me whether or not I'm non-binary and I know that gender is a pretty personal and subjective experience, but I'd love to hear your thoughts and if any of these sorts of feelings are echoed by anyone else on this sub. 

&#x200B;

Thanks for listening to my ramble and have a great day! <3"	"Have you considered the possibility of being gender-fluid? I might add it’s also entirely possible to be gender-fluid non-binary ;-) 

Gender-fluid, in case you’re not sure, is basically when your gender is fluid between (for example) male and female. Some days you might feel more feminine, others more masculine. Gender-fluid can also go between female and non-binary, male and non-binary, etc. It’s it just between male and female.

Im probably not very helpful, because I’m still new to this community and not super well versed in a lot of things yet, but I sincerely wish you the best, hon! You’ll figure this out in time, until then, try not to stress yourself about it💕
You sound quite a bit like me.....I would consider looking into agender identitys....
I have, yeah. I can relate to that quite a lot because it does seem quite variable. 

Thanks for your response, you are helpful! I'll try! I guess what's stressing me out at the moment is I'm scared to present as more feminine out of fear of being judged by cis people or being seen as a ""trender"" by my trans and enby pals. But I'll probably slowly start trying things out and see how I feel about it.

Thank you, wish you all the best too! <3
That’s a good idea! I think it’ll be one of those things that you have to get used to through experience and time, but you’ll get there, I believe in you! 

Take it step by step, and one day you’ll be alright<3"	cd4van	NonBinary	3	0.81	2019-07-14 16:22:04
How to tell parents I’m changing my legal name?	"Used this flair bc I guess this is ‘coming out’ although I’m confident in my identity and have known I’m NB for a long time. 

Anyway. So I’m an adult, and most of the advice I can find online about this is for minors trying to approach their parents about calling them a different name. It doesn’t really matter what my parents call me. I mean, obv I care, but I’m not interested in trying to convince them to call me a different name rn. 

What my trouble is is that I am trying to get started on the process of changing my legal name and people in my life, specifically my parents but other family as well, need to be aware of the change for like legal/safety reasons if nothing else. 

I’m not out to my parents as trans or nonbinary. I had a hell of a time when I came out to them as gay and I’m just so not interested in a repeat of that experience. My parents are both Roman Catholic and socially and politically conservative. I have no reason to think they would be accepting or understanding of me as a trans person. 

So, I have no idea how to tell them I’m changing my name. They’re going to want an explanation and I don’t want to lie. But I also am terrified of having to talk to them about being trans. And I don’t want them to feel like I’m “attacking” them or like I’ve lost my mind or I’m “confused” and being reckless or something. 

Fwiw, I have an NB cousin who also changed their legal name a few years ago. So maybe I can use them as a reference? Like “you know how cousin changed their name? I’m doing the same thing.” Idk. I’m also worried that they might think I’m like following my cousin’s “example” or something. Even though I am an adult capable of thinking for myself. And ftr knew I was NB before I knew my cousin was as well. 

Anyway I’m rambling. 

I don’t know how to approach the conversation. Should I call them on the phone? Should I wait until the next time I visit? Should I sit them down? Should I try to bring it up casually? Do I tell them both at the same time, or one and then the other? What the heck do I say? Please any advise is helpful. 

This going to be totally out of left field for them because like I said, they don’t even know I’m trans. I know they will have a negative reaction no matter what I do, so I’m just trying to mitigate that as much as possible without totally alienating them. I love my parents."		12pkgc8	NonBinary	3	1.0	2023-04-17 15:08:29
What helps you feel supported?	"Hi y'all. I have an interview with a potential new employee this week who specifies on their professional webpage that they identify as nonbinary. I feel comfortable sharing my own pronouns (she/her) and information about myself. My workplace has protective language in place to prevent discriminatory hiring and promotion or demotion practices. It also has protections from workplace harassment and threats against someone by a co-worker in place. It doesn't have anything enshrined in policy to outline what steps I'm allowed to take if the public is rude to this person (it's local government, so we have very little legal recourse to push back against a member of the public who harasses other members of the public, let alone someone who is just an asshole.) The protective policies we have are all fine and good, but strike me as the bare minimum. 
What has helped y'all feel your workplace is not only doing the minimum by protecting safety but is also up for doing the most to help foster a friendly atmosphere that supports professional growth?
If that's not been part of your experience, which I sadly anticipate is more likely to be the case based on how little legal protection is on the books, what's on your employer wishlist? 
I want this candidate to feel supported and safe even if our interactions don't move past the interview process, because we are part of the same sweet little community :) ."	"So in my workplace we have strict anti harassment rules that will and have gotten people fired. These do apply to gender identity as well. We've been given a course in what constitutes harassment of any kind. Not sure how they go about the process if someone is found to be in violation but normally there is an investigation and then action is taken of some sort. I find this to be super supportive even tho I do not share my personal life at work much so none know that I'm non-binary neither do most people in my circle.
Hey! I was actually part of a hiring committee for my organization, which is also federal, specifically about this!! So yes, definitely share your pronouns and ask for theirs if you can (we can't, technically, so if you also can't ask just like... Ya know, imply it). If you have gender neutral bathrooms maybe casually mention that if you give a tour of the space. If you have work place attire expectations, mentioning gender ambiguous options is a plus. Likewise mentioning any gender expression anti discrimination stuff you have. Finally, if they do use they/them pronouns it may be nice to find a way to use those pronouns - I use they/them and would be super impressed if this happened in an interview (again, it can be as simple as if you do get the chance to do a little your of the office, introduce them to another employee as just ""hey, this is ___, I'm just showing *them* around!"") 

Then, if they do feel comfortable talking about their gender/pronouns/expression, you can always ask something like, ""is there anything we can do to support you as a nonbinary employee?"" Or "" are their any specific questions you have as a nonbinary employee?"" Again ONLY if they already seem comfortable, but I know I'm super open about talking about my gender and would LOOOOOOVE to hear that :) 

This is what I can think of for now, but def if you have any questions don't hesitate to ask :)
Thank you this helps!
You're welcome!"	n418ct	NonBinary	3	1.0	2021-05-03 17:00:27
Going back from US to France for seeing family: should I shave?	"Hello,

So as the title say, I'm going back to France for the holidays. I have a French passport from pre-hormonal treatment and Female sex on it.
I now have a light goaty+mustache.

Do you all think it would be safer to just shave? Anyone has experience with a similar situation? 

And please, this is about safety. I don't want to go into talk of doing what should or should not be right etc. As much as I'll be annoyed to have to shave for my trip I much prefer that than being refused entry or whatever.

Thanks :)!"	"To avoid the hassle, I would. It might not matter, it might be fine, or it could be an issue, and frankly airports are shitty enough without extra hassle. It's not so much a safety thing, but unless you're otherwise *very* feminine, you could easily get a bit of ""alright why is this bloke trying to be a woman"" sort of thing.
En soi, je pense que personne ne t'empêchera d'entrer en France, par contre tu risques d'avoir des question gênantes et de devoir expliquer que tu es trans/NB et donc de potentiellement tomber sur une personne transphobe... À toi de voir quels risques tu es prêt'e à prendre de ce point de vue, du coup.
Courage !
Un'e adelphe français'e 😉


(Tf;dr (too French; didn't read) : I don't think you'll be refused entrance but you may have to explain that you're trans and thus face transphobia, so it's up to you to see if it's worth shaving or not)
I have a feminine looking body, but I also have facial hair. I let it grow out during quarantine. I went to a few restaurants when I got my vaccine and my facial hair got a lot of attention from the waiters. 

I realized I was developing anxiety so badly about it that I decided to go back to removing it. YMMV.
Yeah it's sad but I guess I'll just shave :/. Ugh transphobia/enbyphobia suckkks.
Ouai c'est toujours un peu juste compter sur la chance de tomber sur des agents correcte ou non :/. C'est la premiere fois que je rentre depuis ma transition et c'est le gros stress du coup lol.
Merci de ton point de vu!
Sad shaving gang 🤛 😭
Yeah, the sooner we get rid of gender markers the better.
C'est clair... :( Je comprends ! Éventuellement, tu peux t'inspirer de ce qu'avait proposé le Wiki Trans pour le Pass Sanitaire ( [ici](https://wikitrans.co/trans-et-pass-sanitaire/) ) avec un petit mot discret de ce genre, que tu peux mettre dans ton passeport ?"	rhzkps	NonBinary	3	1.0	2021-12-16 20:35:57
Does anyone else use different pronouns in different groups?	"I use she/they; she/her mostly to keep it simple, but I'm also cool with they/them. I'm the medic for a local furry convention. When I go by my badge name [my furry name], I like they/them better, but I'm still ok with she/her. It's the one time that I find I prefer they/them. Idk is that weird?


I understand that for some people it's about safety, but I'm wondering if anyone else has a different pronouns preference based on who you're around, not related to protecting yourself. Maybe I'm doing it subconsciously...? Love to hear some thoughts."	"Pronouns are just presentation choices, social constructs. All communication is context-dependent. If someone came up to me and said ""hey babe"" and I didn't know them, that would be very different from those same words being spoken by my partner. Pronouns are just another form of that. It's not only common but an obligate part of communication. Nothing weird about it.
yeah i don't know. ive never used my pronouns irl cause im scared but definetely my comfort level of pronouns change between when im being my wishful possibly more true self online vs the reality of having an appearance and physical interaction. like online its cool to be called he but irl i feel inadequate like theyre saying i dont look like my agab- i mean im not my agab, so i dont quite know why i think its just kinda insulting to feel that im too ugly to pass as my agab. weird shit.
Ah true. Makes me think of [the hanar](https://masseffect.fandom.com/wiki/Hanar) from Mass Effect...how they have the ""face name"" and ""soul name"". TIL I'm a genderless jellyfish-like creature that speaks in the 3rd person hahaha I love it!
Aw I'm sorry you feel that way. But remember you have the right to be called by the pronouns you feel most comfortable with! Good luck on your journey, friend. :)"	r6oqed	NonBinary	3	1.0	2021-12-01 20:46:33
"How to actually come out? And mixed feelings on coming out ""formally""/explicitly?"	"\[disclaimer, I'm a 24 y/o with no safety concerns whatsoever re: coming out and have reason to think my loved ones and colleagues will support me. This is more about how to do it than whether to\]

&#x200B;

**tl;dr: how do I come out as a non-binary queer person who avoids drawing attention to themselves or having uncomfortable conversations?** 

I still occasionally have doubts, but am pretty comfortable and confident being non-binary after years of questioning and a few months of serious self-reflection. I've been gradually changing my pronouns on bios, Zoom, etc. over the past year (from she/her to she/they to they/she to they/them), and I've spoken to a few friends and one sibling about it. But, unless I'm on a Zoom call with them where they see my pronouns, my wider friends, colleagues, classmates, etc. don't realize that I really prefer they/them and gender-neutral language. I also haven't spoken to my parents or most of my siblings about gender at all, but they know I'm queer.

For the sake of not being misgendered quite as often, I've been thinking about tweeting from my professional/public account explaining my pronouns and that I'm non-binary. But I also don't want to make this a big deal, and the whole ""coming out"" narrative feels not great? Like I never came out as cis and I shouldn't have to come out as trans? But I also can't expect people to know without saying anything? I've been presenting in ways that feel comfortable to me for a while (besides a major haircut scheduled for Friday!) so I don't really have a way to visually cue without saying something. 

Beyond Twitter, my family follows me on all other social media platforms, so I  should probably speak to them before coming out publicly elsewhere? But I don't know how to do that either? 

&#x200B;

Does anybody have advice on whether/how to come out both on social media/publicly and to family? Should I just bite the bullet? Tell a few more people and hope the rumor mill deals with it? Keep dropping subtle hints until eventually folks realize? 

&#x200B;

For reference, I ""came out"" as gay in college by telling a small group of friends and then just being gay and waiting for people to notice. By the time I told my parents and posted anything on social media, it was just so abundantly obvious that my formally coming out was just a confirmation. So that's the level of avoidance we're dealing with here :P"	"You sound to be in a similar position to me (although as an afab enby who prefers masc types I'd never had to do a ""coming out"" before)

I found a letter that someone else had written (probably from one of these subreddits) and adapted it to fit me better. Then I just went ahead and sent that in the family WhatsApp. My family were great about it and are trying their best to get my pronouns and stuff right (and it's the trying that matters to me)

So then I posted that same thing on Facebook, equally good responses

And then the next Monday I just sent a Skype message to my boss (who I play DnD with so he's closer to a friend really) saying I'm non-binary and asking how we should go about getting all my HR nonsense updated. Again amazingly positive response

Willing to share what I sent if you think it'd help
I have something that might work and is pretty funny in my opinion but you probably shouldn’t actually do unless you really want to. You could start talking or ranting about something to whoever you want to come out to and then in they middle you could slip in, “I’m non-binary” or something like that then keep talking. It would probably draw away from the fact until later after you’ve finished ranting about it. Also, in my experience with ranting, whoever is around will pretty much tune it out so there’s a chance they won’t hear you even if you do it. Again, you probably shouldn’t do this unless you really want to."	l05v0u	NonBinary	3	1.0	2021-01-18 22:46:26
"A poem I wrote about the word ""Trans"""	"""Come to our tent!"" I say,

""There are so many of us like you!

We have community and stories and safety""


""I won't fit"" you say

my smile falters


""Well sure you will, 

there's room enough for everyone

I understand if you don't want to come inside, 

but there's always a place for you""


""I won't fit"" you say again

I take a second to think


""Well look, here's a seat with your name on it,

you'll fit just fine! 

if you're happier out there that's totally cool

but we've made space all the same"" 

""I won't fit"" you repeat

I cast about


""Well, here's someone with a lot like you, 

there's a lot more where they came from

if you don't want to be here that's fine, 

but I promise you can fit if you want to""


""I won't fit"" you insist

so I leave you outside


and I wonder

is it really that you think you will not fit

or that you don't want to be in here with all us weirdos

and want a way to separate yourself from us


I hear you say, ""this isn't fair.

why can we have a tent that I fit into?

we should build a new tent"" 

(as I articulate several times, I think it's totally valid not to identify as trans, I just get frustrated by people who insist trans *cannot* apply to them)"		naem1d	NonBinary	3	0.72	2021-05-12 02:44:48
Confused about Gender - What is it?	"Hi, I am confused about the concept of gender. I think if I can understand the concept I will be better able to decide what actions to take socially and  transition-wise.

 I identify as genderqueer/nonbinary and less often gender non-conforming. I experience what I believe to be gender dysphoria. I have, since I was a child, said things that made people correct me and say ""You're a girl, you can't x"" for example, I would say ""I am a boy"" and adults would tell me that they would call my parents if I didn't stop saying that. I tried changing my name to a boy's name in 3rd grade, but without parent permission I was told I had to use my given name or be in trouble. I say all this to explain my experience of my gender. My experience of gender has been closely linked to my personality, and my dad could tell from when I was very young that I was atypical and guessed I would be gay. So he was very supportive when I came out as a lesbian in high school. 

In college my gender, women, and sexuality classes taught that gender was performative, socialized into children, and not linked to physical sex. So, here's my problem: 

If gender is performative and socialized, aka if we learn to be a gender, then my current status would be, I think, a woman because I don't have the money or safety to transition and I live my life as a ""typical woman"". 

If gender is an innate trait, and its based on feelings and drives to act in gender typical ways, then I am genderqueer. I often feel driven to act in very masculine ways to the point that when dressed as and trying to meet the standards of womanhood people still comment on my masculinity of personality.*(I am afab)

And, if gender is completely a construct, and doesn't exist besides what we are socialized to do -- then I am a gender nonconforming femme.

I want to add: I know myself. I know that I have social gender dysphoria. I know behaving in traditionally masculine ways makes me happy, and relieves my dysphoria. I know that I like my body, I enjoy it, and I can live in it happily. I just can't find the words to express who I am. I am hoping a better understanding of gender will help.

Main question: What is gender?
Sub-question: where does gender come from?


I should also mention my view of gender personally at the moment: everyone has a different, unique perspective of what their gender-hood means to them. Some people live and celebrate their gender-hood, others feel no connection to it  some don't think about it at all. I believe, that like yin and yang we all have masculine and feminine energies that mix uniquely to make us who we are. (Along with all sorts of duality energies, love vs anger, joy vs melancholy, etc. Each person has a combination of dual energies) I align more with my masculine energy, but just a bit more. I appreciate and value my femininity as well. I also appreciate and value the energies I hold that are non-gendered that often play a bigger role in my identity than gender does. I am a lover and an artist before I am a gender, per se. And yin yang duality is not ever binary, there's a dot of yin inside yang and a dot of yang inside yin. They are part of eachother, share comminalities, and comingle."	"I mean, I'm not sure that even scientists can answer that one. Contrapoints did a great breakdown on YouTube if you want to check that out. On a more practical day to day note, I see it as a person's sense of how right they feel with male or female applied to them. Some feel right with one or the other or both or neither. And everyone will be affected in some way by their sex (biological context) and how they are perceived (cultural context), for better or worse.
ALL OF THIS

I have been asking myself the same questions for months.  For a long time I was guilty for not understanding what 'masculine' and 'feminine' meant, I thought that there were common definitions  everyone knew and that I for some reason could not grasp. But the more I observe people's gender performances the more I understand what people mean when they say that gender is personally defined. All actions are genderless until we assign them a gender, and there is nothing necessarily wrong with gendering things. 

For my personal definition, I have to base it off of how I actually perform in the moment, what my actions and relationships mean to me.  I am also AFAB and when I think of who I am, socially, I feel masculine. What's been really helpful is to pay attention to how you carry yourself when you're with your good friends. When you feel complete joy, do you feel a gender? Paying attention to these things is how I came to enjoy thinking about gender (I used to get so dysphoric even considering my own relationship to gender).

A big source of dysphoria for me in the past was the simple fact that I didn't feel comfortable occupying the role of either male or female, and I thought that there was no way for me to push back against that since the world will still continue to operate on a binary system. But people break the rules all the time to make themselves more comfortable and we can do the same. We can build communities where we make space for people to perform in ways that bring them joy.

If gender were the 'role' you play in society, or any of the other things people usually say to try to describe what it is, I would have no gender. 
But when reading and learning of different genders, when emersed in other people anecdotes and reflecting on my own experiences, that just isn't right at all. I'm repulsed away from and pulled towards different facets of this weird, unknown part of the brain, through which I've determined I have something to do with the xenic, atrinary and male-ish parts of gender, but not much else. So no, I have no idea what gender actually is, nor do I think anyone else does.
Some feel right with one or the other or both or neither or something else entirely.
Wait, what do you mean by affected by sex? You don't mean everyone's gender is affected by their sex, do you? Binary trans people wouldn't even be able to exist if that were true.
What do you mean there's nothing wrong with gendering things? There's something horribly wrong with gendering things. Gendering things always leads to gendering people. If you assign something a gender, then you're saying every person who likes/does/looks like/has/etc etc the thing automatically has that gender or a connection to it, and that's misgendering. Which is disrespectful and can lead to dysphoria-and will most likely least to hurt feelings even if they don't have dysphoria. 
The ONLY things that should ever, ever be gendered are genders. Not mannerisms or clothes or names or personalities.
I'm confused by your response. If binary trans people weren't affected by their biological sex characteristics they wouldn't feel a need to change them.
I think this is a slippery slope fallacy. Things can be blue and the person who owns it doesn't  become blue by association. It's the same thing with  gender. Something I learned in therapy is you can't control anything but your reactions. I used to get distraught when I got misgendered but then I realized I can't control how others think of me so I just decided to not care about that. Why care what complete strangers think or say? If I did that it would prevent me from doing anything. So I like things typically gendered masculine and typically gendered feminine and anyone who has a problem with that is insignificant compared to the joy I feel being myself.
Your gender isn't affected by sex at all, BUT your feelings about your gender and your relationship with it can be.
Somehow I doubt that, although i dont doubt your environment probably has more impact, whereas the biological aspect is more of a disposition. For example there will be a biological disposition towards liking sterotypically girly or boyish things. Which, even in a genderless world, would still lead to some stereotypes long term."	bpuw4f	NonBinary	3	1.0	2019-05-17 18:30:55
Is it possible to have separate girl and guy modes or is it an unrealistic fantasy?	"This is a sort of crosspost with another one I made over on r/asktransgender [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/asktransgender/comments/p15r9b/i_think_ive_come_to_a_realization_but_i_dont_know/). I'm not sure if how non-binary compares with bigender, or if bigender is like under the non-binary umbrella. I'm posting here mainly because it's the larger sub. It is important to note that a sort of ""in-between"" gender is not what I am.

&#x200B;

Anyway, I think that if I could pick one superpower, it would be the ability to shapeshift.

&#x200B;

AMAB, 30 years old. During the course of gender questioning for the last 2 months, I've had a constant flip flop between feeling more like a girl and a guy. I think that I have established as a solid fact that I want to know what it's like to have a girl's body with everything that comes with it. But I haven't experienced any dysphoria to my knowledge and prior to a few months ago I was feeling perfectly happy with my life as it was and I'm still not sure whether I would feel comfortable actually \*living\* as a girl. My [first post](https://www.reddit.com/r/asktransgender/comments/nsxyy8/29_year_old_amab_just_started_to_seriously/) on the subject goes into more detail.

&#x200B;

A few days ago it hit me. Would I really need to give up guy me, even if I medically transitioned? Being AMAB, with the right clothes and hair it should theoretically still be possible to retain a boy-mode. It was at that moment that everything suddenly felt right. Nearly all the anxiety built up from questioning melted away. I stopped feeling fake and finally felt like myself again. I guess this might make me non-binary or bigender? I'm not really too concerned with the label though, to be honest.

&#x200B;

There are still doubts, of course. It might just be that I'm running away from my fears of transitioning instead of facing them. To maintain two modes almost feels too good to be true, to almost have the best of both worlds. But it's hard for me to understate just how much better I'm feeling for the first time in 2 months. It just feels like this is the right path forward, for now. And the best part is, this leaves open the possibility for changing my mind after more thinking and more therapy. Who knows? Partway into transition I could just decide to go all the way. I think this might be the biggest reason for my newfound calm, the idea that there are more possibilities as a sort of safety net. I'm not even sure HRT is right for me, as I have yet to determine if simply crossdressing would be enough (I'm leaning towards no, but I haven't tried yet so who knows).

&#x200B;

Also here's a shitty flowchart I made for the whole thing, probably inaccurate in at least one way but I'd love to know how.

[https://drive.google.com/file/d/1asoRPRwOdNecKbmusLQPS33-Vl7mPGuB/view?usp=sharing](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1asoRPRwOdNecKbmusLQPS33-Vl7mPGuB/view?usp=sharing)"	"You do not have to fully medically transition. You might want to look into non-binary microdosing HRT.

This is the approach that I’m looking at starting. 

I found this podcast particularly helpful:
https://exclusivelyinclusivepodcast.com/episodes/11-non-binary-pronouns-hormone-therapy/
Bigender does fall under the nonbinary umbrella. If you go back and forth between feeling like a man and feeling like a woman, that sounds like genderfluid (which also falls under the nonbinary umbrella). In the end, your label(s) are your decision and it's fine either way. 

Also there are lots of people that switch up their presentation, sometimes looking more feminine and sometimes looking more masculine. It's fine to do that. You can take hormones and still do that as well. It's completely up to you, and you don't have to necessarily give up any part of yourself.
Bigender doesn't fit solely and completely within either of the two traditional Western genders, and thus falls under the non-binary umbrella.

> it would be the ability to shapeshift

This is super common among non-binary folks, and especially among genderfluid folks. Have you considered genderfluid as a label to describe your experience? It means an internal experience of gender that changes over time. I am AMAB genderfluid on HRT, and I have boy and girl ""modes"".
I have heard and done some cursory research into that. I know a lot of them are particular about avoiding breasts entirely but in my case I probably would want them, just not too large to hid I guess?

Thanks for that link, I'll listen when I get home from work.
Hey! Same! I get super anxious sometimes when I feel that switch happen sharply. I’ll be shirtless and feel masc, but on a bra and feel girly. And have my brain just start freaking out about hrt. It’s hard to navigate!"	p1r7ys	NonBinary	3	1.0	2021-08-10 15:15:23
Being non-binary in a transphobic country (tw: transphobia)	"So I recently realized I'm non-binary and now I don't know what to do about it.  
I *could* come out and dress the way I want but I don't wanna risk being beaten up in the street (slight hyperbole but only slight).   
For context, my country doesn't exactly criminalize LGBTQIA+ people, but there's basically no laws for it either. The same-sex partnership law has been struggling to get approved for a couple of years now and the whole anti-LGBTQIA+ movement has been picking up a lot steam lately. I mean hell, at the last pride there had to be riot police present. And even then somebody got beaten up pretty bad, if I recall correctly.   
Actually, being beaten up for being in the wrong place at the wrong time isn't uncommon. And then the police laugh at you when you call them. Gotta love my country /s.  
Like that one time a guy walked into a bar with make-up on and got the living daylights beaten out of him. And the police basically said ""eh, your fault"".  
This also happened in the capital, which is the most ""tolerant"" place in the whole country.   
A place I do not live in. Instead, my place of residence is a small town where you get looked at weird for wearing pants that aren't jeans or the most boring colour of brown you've seen.   
What doesn't help the situation is that my gender expression definitely doesn't meet any kind of cishet norms. Like I legit want a beard and a dress. I wanna have a masculine body but be able to dress as feminine as I want. So I'm screwed.   
Another important note: I am currently incredibly depressed. Like proper depressed, with a diagnosis, three different meds and a psychologist. Depressed to the point that I can't work. Or study. Or do anything, really. So moving out to a different country won't be an option for like 10 years at least (I say 10 and not less because I'd not only need to get better but finish my studies, find a job, and earn enough to emigrate).   
So my big dilemma is: do I come out and risk my safety or stay closeted and risk my getting better mentally?  
Thanks"	"Hey friend, this sounds like a really tough situation and my heart goes out to you. Unfortunately it seems like being “out and proud” will be very dangerous for you. I think that if you can find even just One Person who you trust and know will keep your identity a secret it would help a lot. If you can create a private safe space for you to talk and dress/act/be like you really want to be it can help make the day to day discomfort of being closeted more bearable. Keep yourself as safe as you can while trying to carve out private ways, spaces, and moments to help affirm your identity.
It is hard for me to comment accurately because I don't know what country you are in or what it is like there, but I'll try.

There are usually certain types of people in any society who are allowed to be flamboyant. Musicians, actors, artists, etc. and there are certain archetype looks for those characters that often skirt gender norms. They are allowed to push boundaries that others are not.

So a strategy of trying to become identified as one of those types of people, and then slowly and confidently pushing the boundaries to where you can more fully express yourself might work.

And the other thing is to find situations where that kind of expression is appropriate. Perhaps a carnival day, pride parade, rock concert, anime convention, or other event where people get in costumes or scene-identifying gear. Picking something that is ""scene"" and still pushes the bounds you want to push might be accepted.

The other thing is, no matter what you do, do it well. Do it with style. Do it with confidence.

Bullies like to pick on the weak, and people who are unsure of themselves. If you are standing proud and are incredibly well put together, and don't respond hysterically to their taunts, they may turn their eye elsewhere...

It may not be as satisfying as doing everything you want as much as you want right away, but it gives you some amount of expression that may give you comfort.

My ""daily driver"" look, when I go out, is 100% 1980's Rock Star: Long blonde hair, tight shirt and pants with too many zippers on them, high-heeled boots, leather jacket, top hat. They are 100% women's clothes. I am crossdressed 100% of the time, and everybody accepts it. Everybody knows what a rock-star is. People ask me if I play guitar (I do!) Some people swear they have been to my shows (I'm certain they haven't!)  Never a bad reaction.

I wear the dresses and makeup at home, and to clubs, and shows, and pride events, doctor's appointments... but when I am out in them, I go all out and make sure the makeup is complete, the outfit is stylish, my hair is cute, and my voice is girly. I play the role to the hilt, and with complete confidence. I'm not here to be ""out""... I have legitimate business here! 

Obviously, your expression is different, but I think if you are careful about your strategy, you can find good ways to express yourself safely.

It starts with a commitment to personal style and pushing boundaries with confidence, and only gets better from there!"	uaq685	NonBinary	3	1.0	2022-04-24 08:26:50
do i need to find a new name?	even before realizing i was non-binary, i used a chosen name or a nickname (mostly for safety reasons) but my chosen name is a feminine name, it doesn't bother me though.Do i need to change to a gender neutral name?	"You don’t need to change your name if you don’t want to. I didn’t change my name myself even if I’m nonbinary. You can do what you want and what makes you feel comfortable.
You don’t *have* to do anything. If you’re comfortable with your name, that’s great! Don’t go through all of the social change and legal paperwork stuff if it isn’t something you really want to do. 

A name is just a name. It doesn’t define your identity. It’s only “feminine” because that’s the label society has assigned to it. There’s no reason it shouldn’t be your name just because you aren’t a woman.
Yer name ought to be whatever the fuck you want your name to be.
I have a chosen feminine name and I'm nonbinary. I'm completely happy with it too. Its at least less feminine than my dead name in my opinion.
thanks! it seems like everyone gets a new name and i don't want to
>It’s only “feminine” because that’s the label society has assigned to it.

Adding to that, a lot of names have changed from being associated with one gender to a different gender within the last 100 years.
Perfectly ok, dont worry. In general there is no checklist, everything is optional

How do you answer “m or f”?	"I am a transmasc individual, identify as non binary he/them. 

I often post in trans groups on whisper, and since I prefer to stay as anonymous as possible, due to my location, and safety, none of my info is filled out. People often ask within the first couple messages if I am M or F. I usually reply neither but that just ends in the other person being hostile and violent in many of the instances I’ve used that response. 

What would be a better reply to that question than saying neither? I apologize as I’m not super good with words or explaining things so I can try to explain a bit better if needed. Thank you in advance!"	"I use stupid things as «I’m your father, Luke» with my most feminine voice when it happens irl 🤷🏻‍♀️
""No thanks.""
Unless it's necessary, I just don't answer. If it is necessary, I go with my medical records.
""Negative, I am a meat popsicle.""
I am a human
I either don't answer it cause it isn't anybody in the world's business to know unless it's your doctor and that's usually asked in paper form so I write F for female but I might add in trans and on Estrodiol so they know what's running through my body. As for electronics forms that might not let you move on to the next question or page I put F I'm a Trans""Woman"" after all. If they have any questions later then someone must be real picky in thier HR department. Which most people don't unless your using a very masculine name or presenting strongly the opposite of what you put. Honestly never had anyone really say anything to me.
""I forgot""

""I will be abandoning this meat vessel shortly so the question is irrelevant.""

""Yes""

""No one knows certainly not me""
That’s absolutely amazing!! I oddly never get it in public though only online, but I’ll keep that one in my pocket just in case.
That’s a good one too!!!
Makes sense. I like to mess with people sometimes but it gets tiring after a while like why do you care? Why is it absolutely necessary for your survival to know
I KOVE THIS ONE
I just used this one!! Someone was like “are you m or f” I said “I’m a human…. Not a letter” 😂😂😂
I always put m on applications and such. My license and name have been changed already. It’s more the people online (such as whisper, because I have all my info blocked out. It doesn’t show my age, gender, or location. And people always try to ask like it’s their business and they need to know.
I absolutely love all of these. 🤣🤣🤣🤣
I saw this I'm an undertale meme because the player character is non binary and I loved it so much. I'm glad that you could use it.
Used it before I saw it haha. It popped in my head like wait why are you asking if I’m a letter? And only 2 choices???? Rude."	pe4tjb	NonBinary	3	1.0	2021-08-29 22:03:46
Feeling doubtful / need support	"I posted this on the testosterone subreddit and was faced with unhelpful comments and told to post here.
 I’ve been on T 10 months, still getting misgendered repeatedly (they/them).
The fact that society still sees me as someone I'm not, despite me being on T for so long and growing a mustache, being more hairier, and (somewhat) growing a beard.
I've also been harassed for simply peeing/existing way more. And it makes me angry, but also like maybe I should stop T. Now I do have an aesthetic goal on being T, and havent reached it yet. Im mainly tired of daily misgendering and harassment/threats to my safety. Would appreciate some support"	"First off the fact that you get discriminated against is terrible and I’m sorry you had to go through that . I don’t know your full story and I’m not gonna pretend I do but I would say stay on T simply for the fact that you don’t know exactly what lies ahead if you stay on T things could and probably will get better. Keep your head up it gets better. <3
thank you for your kind words. 

ive posted this to several places and unf have not gotten as much support as i need, which is incredibly isolating. how do you deal with misgendering? everytime i get misgendered it feels like im being stabbed. its not gotten better for 6 years.

How much should I alter my appearance so others “don’t talk about me”?	"For context, I’m going to my cousins wedding in Nebraska this summer. My extended family are all quite conservative, my parents are already telling me to not wear anything “crazy” so people “don’t talk about me.” Because it’s the “bride’s day” after all.

It’s not problem if people talk about me? I don’t know what to do. I’m not gonna do anything too crazy and risk my own safety, but I was thinking of some cute pants or flowy skirt, cute blouse, and maybe some light makeup.

Help?"	"People are going to talk about you no matter what you do. They would do so even if you were cis. So you might as well just do what makes you happy, and say to hell with everyone else.
Think Catra at the Princess Prom ::P  I think in actuality, I would say wear whatever makes you most comfortable.  If passing is important to you for this ceremony, then wear something that honors that.  You could wear Non-Binary flag colors, which should look nice for a summer wedding.
As another weirdo enby who looks odd and has others talk about them…

…the correct answer is not at all.
There's no way a single person can keep the entire extended family entertained for the whole day: they'll inevitably find *something* to talk about besides ""the bride."" Might as well be you and not some aspect of the ceremony or venue or anything else the couple plausibly had control over and might feel bad to hear slighted!
Just be yourself. Dress up nice since it's a wedding obviously, but don't focus on gender roles. Anything semi formal should be fine. As long as you're not wearing bright colors (or a white dress like the bride) you should be just fine. 😸 Hope that helps."	nqouhq	NonBinary	3	1.0	2021-06-02 15:45:57
Rant: In the community, but not.	I seriously cant tell if something is wrong with me or if its a feeling that others share. I (18 NB) have been out for a little over 2 years, during this time and even before i was out, I have been lurking on various NB and Trans groups and have never felt a connection. Almost like the feeling of being a part of a friendship group but you never really want to talk to them. Idk. I read through your struggles and your highlights and i cant help feel happy or upset with you. But there are many occasions where i see things and i cant help but cringe. I absolutely hate some of the ideals that the community has. I hate the sense of entitlement that some carry and the idea that the only reason something didn’t go your way was because you are trans It’s annoying seeing stuff like that (I am in no way talking about situations where your safety is of concern) merely the “oh they didn’t want to date me bc I’m trans” or “How dare you not want to date trans people thats transphobic” I don’t understand that way of thinking. So i guess what im trying to figure out is if im the only one who feels this way?	I don't think you are. Being part of a community by no means entails thinking the same as everyone else.	v9md2b	NonBinary	4	0.7	2022-06-11 01:09:03
Binder safety question	So I’m not quite sure what my gender is at the moment, likely somewhere in the non-binary category leaning feminine. I’m amab & I want full feminizing hrt. Basically I was wondering if using a binder would be safe during that or how it might effect things? If it’s initially unsafe then at what point would it be okay? It would be nice to be able to hide any chest development if I needed or wanted to, but I obviously want to be safe & healthy about stuff. I wouldn’t be too bothered if it’s not an option but idk where to get any of that info so If anyone could help me out that’d be neat. Hope this is the right place for this, sorry if I did a goof.	So there shouldn't be any issue however, I would be careful about measuring your chest regularly, maybe whenever you notice the new growth or once a month or something. Mainly so you can avoid using a too small binder.  If you are at high end of a size based on your chest than I would size up, so you don't have to buy a new one as quickly. Although if you buy from gc2b you might need to size up compared to your chest based on your shoulders. My  chest is a medium but my shoulders are a large for their sizing.	r4jm9z	NonBinary	2	1.0	2021-11-29 01:13:41

Advice/Experiences On Being Out As Trans/Queer At Work?	"tldr at bottom, sorry for the long post yall 

I recently am working again because I and my grandmother got our vaccinations and I needed income, so I'm back at the job I was at before the pandemic and lockdowns. I had come out as trans late 2019 and that I was getting top surgery in December to a handful of people there including the manager and all but one assistant manager. 

Since being off work for a year and becoming more comfortable with myself and my identities, I feel more comfortable being open about my trans identity and want to be open and visible for others who aren't. 

But honestly I have a lot of anxiety and I'm worrying about what I'll be asked if I'm more open and proud of being trans/queer. I'm going to be doing early food prepping shifts for the most part and I usually bring coffee with me because I don't have time to have it at home. My girlfriend got me a cute travel mug for my bday that says ""Gender:"" and has 3 checkbox options for male female, and queer, and queer is in purple and marked. I want to bring it and use that as a way to subtly be out. 

I expect people to ask questions about what that means among other things, but I just feel unprepared for negative/bad-faith questions. Like people asking things mockingly just to make me uncomfortable with being out. I don't think it'll get to me enough to where I'll stop being out, I guess I'm just seeking advice on how to handle awkward/negative interactions with people? I don't fear for my safety either, at most I'd be more worried that the manager would ask me to stop brining it if any of my coworkers made enough of a fuss. 

I feel close and comfortable with a good bit of my coworkers and the managers there, but I'm only recently back and work and they've hired new people earlier last year as well as some New New people this same week I came back. So I'm unsure about how all of them feel about lgbt, specifically trans people. My brother worked there before I did (and helped me get hired), and he was very openly gay and basically couldn't hide it, and so the general culture there is more open/accepting and there are other lgbt folk there, but it's mosty guys that are cishet teens/adolescents, and I'm in the south so I don't expect to go without a few less than positive interactions. 

tldr: i'd like some advice on how to handle negative interactions at work with cishet guys regarding being trans, or would just like to hear how anyone has had to deal with negative interactions at work or stories/experiences on being out as trans and/or queer. Much appreciated, I'm an anxious person, but I want to be as proud in public about being trans as I feel internally, and I want other queer and lgbt workers to know I'm safe and to just try to help create a better space for others there."	"> I don't think it'll get to me enough to where I'll stop being out

It sounds like *eventually* you're going to be open at work, so why not get it out of the way now?

Coming back after a long break can be a good opportunity to show up and just start being yourself.

You seem to have support and respect from your manager(s), so I'd expect the new hires to read the room and do the same. And if someone does start deliberately trying to make you uncomfortable, you've got more senior people you can ask for backup.

As for how to respond to bad-faith questions in the moment, would it fit your personality to just pretend the question was asked in good faith, and give an honest answer?

Or maybe for questions like “Aren't all nonbinary people just <whatever>” you could breezily reply with “Actually nope!”. And for questions like “But how can you be neither?” you could shrug and say “Like this. I just am.” It's not your job to educate everyone about being nonbinary, especially if they don't want to listen.

The personalised mug sounds like a smart way to do it — it's clear, but without making a big fuss.
Thank you for this! I think it'd be normal for me to pretend it wasn't in bad faith, I wouldn't want the situation to get worse or more awkward so I'm kind of imagining myself giving a surface-level answer but not completely brushing them off. I'd definitely want to answer/educate people that are genuinely curious and might also be questioning their gender, but I definitely don't plan on trying to educate people that I'm sure aren't actually interested in learning about it, or are coming to me to just try to make me uncomfortable or mock me for it. 

And thank you, i really like the mug and honestly I'm just glad I feel comfortable enough to start bringing it. 

I actually had a prep shift today and brought it, and I'm very glad I did and I absolutely plan to bring it more. I was told by someone I'm out to there (and is a very safe person and a manager) that another worker/assistant manager saw it and asked if it was hers, she said no, he said something about it being on some gay shit. So that's cool ig, I think I would rather him say it to me so I can try to engage more vs him just going and making comments and not really knowing what he's really commenting on, if that makese sense. I think whats more sad is that I'm not surprised by who it was that. 

I did make this post bc i was basically expecting bs like that, so i really do appreciate your comment, you got me thinking more about how I would generally respond to bad faith/awkward situations. I know i wont fully know how to deal with xyz situation until it happens, but it feels better to be somewhat prepared for how to respond. Again, thank you!
Glad I could help! :)"	mt5op5	NonBinary	2	1.0	2021-04-18 03:59:52
Changing gender marker on IDs after top surgery?	"Hi! I had top surgery last August and have been thinking about whether it's worth it to change my gender marker to M (In my state, there's no nonbinary option. I don't think IDs should have gender markers at all but that's an altogether separate discussion!)

The reason for this is because while I feel like the way I pass depends day to day, due to my flat chest it's much easier to ""prove"" I'm a dude (for safety's sake). Especially when I travel to different (more conservative) places, it feels like a factor that protects me if that makes sense? I'm also able to use the men's bathrooms and locker rooms when I go swimming since top surgery. But when I'm not swimming, I tend to use women's bathrooms in more ""liberal"" areas.

I don't identify as a dude so it's not for gender dysphoria reasons (although I generally would mind an M on my IDs less than an F). Even if an ""X"" gender option were available in my state, I would hesitate to get it changed to it because that would essentially be outing me as trans to any law enforcement/authorities which is not ideal.

Since I already had top surgery, getting it changed wouldn't be too much of a problem. But I'm wondering if it's worth it.

Did any of you change your gender markers? If so, how was the process and how do you feel about it?"	"I'm going to change mine to an m because I pass more as a dude, I'm considering entering my career as a dude, and I'm planning on traveling to a very transphobic country. Nonbinary marks on IDs aren't a thing in my state but I wouldn't want to get it anyway because, in the wise words of some twitter user, ""why would you want cops to know you are trans""."	o6046c	NonBinary	2	1.0	2021-06-22 23:24:40
I was thinking	"In the bath rather than the shower, so it's not a shower thought.

Right now I'm in the midst of lots of stuff, spinning plates, mostly people I need to look out for, and it's a lot of brain work.

I've had no downtime for months, and I've noticed that I need to feel more Sally than usual when life is like this.

I feel aggreived in a way, because I want to be me on my own terms, but I wonder sometimes if feeling that I want to express myself more is some kind of safety valve.

Does that sound mad?"	"Do you give yourself pampering or other treatment that would be more clear and beneficial without gendering? Sometimes we seek out stress and activity to avoid facing the hollow nature of our self care. Other times, coercive gendering creates revulsion and exacerbates latent gender disconnects.
Not really, there isn't an opportunity. 

I'm more likely to go online and buy a load of make up and clothes that I'll never get round to wearing.

My vintage Playtex collection is a step up from trainspotting I suppose.

Hiding From my parents	"Hi everyone! I’m AFAB and am thinking about microdosing on t. I need to hide it from my parents for my own safety. I’m also thinking about getting top surgery, again, hiding from my parents and just putting silicone breast gels in a bra if I’m ever around them. I don’t plan on transitioning to the point of passing and I will most likely go off t after a year, but just wanted to see if any of y’all had experience with this. 

I know the best thing to do is come out, but I unfortunately can’t. I live in a different state than my parents and only go home like three times a year for a short period of time. 

Thanks!"	"If you see them infrequently, it's likely they'll notice at least something. Over time the fat on your face will shift and at least make you look a little different, even if not to the point of passing. Top surgery with breastforms you could maybe get away with.

I obviously don't know exactly what your situation is, but I'd be hesitant to start HRT or get surgery if you're not prepared for the possibility of family finding out eventually."	mpkif6	NonBinary	2	1.0	2021-04-12 18:50:18
how to describe why i want to bind - help with wording	"-firstly, there’s not one way to look nonbinary. nonbinary people don’t owe anyone androgyny. express yourself in whatever way makes you feel comfortable 

so i would appreciate help putting my feelings into words please. i’m hoping that hearing from more perspectives will help me explain to my friend why i want trans tape. also context, i’m neurodivergent and i find describing emotions into words challenging. 

-also would appreciate safety advice for wearing and removing trans tape. or safer alternatives to a binder. 

so i’m a gender non-conforming human , and for me that means sometimes i love my chest not being flat. it gives me joy to have outfits that show off my boobs. other times, i wish my chest was flat. sometimes i wish i could remove them like a mr. potato head and put them back when i want. 

it swings back and forth. so i don’t feel like top surgery is right for me personally at this time. also i have some health conditions and then there’s also financial reasons that it’s not feasible for me anyways. 

so i guess i’m looking for people to share their experiences and advice. thank you much"	"I think what you said about sometimes feeling joy about your chest and other times wishing it was flat makes perfect sense. I’m not sure why you have to explain why you want to bind/tape to your friend but maybe try comparing it to something they do to change their appearance. People often find it easier to understand things if you make it relatable for them (even if it’s not completely equivalent). As an example, if they wear makeup often try explaining that the same way they like to change their appearance with makeup sometimes, you like to change yours by binding. 

About binding safely, there’s lots of resources online! Especially for how to apply trans tape it’s useful to have visual instructions so have a look on YouTube. Try to watch/read from multiple sources and compare the information. Good luck :)
I also desire the Mr. Potato Head boobs
oh yeah for clarification, i don’t have to give them a reason. we were just having a chill discussion about our own experiences and i didn’t know how to put my feelings into words

yeah i’ve looked at those videos. what has me concerned are the reviews with photos of people getting rashes or damage.

edit:

perhaps they just weren’t removing the trans tape properly. i’m just unsure of how to find out what’s going on with that without risking injury.

I have a question for the non binary trans femmes of the sub. How did you know you were an enby?	"Ok, so I'm an autistic, closeted trans femme and I have no fucking clue if I'm a non binary trans girl or just a non op. Like, in a lot of senses, I relate more so to femboys than cis girls, but does that mean I'm non binary, or just proof that I have severe trust issues and am a tad bit obsessed w my dick. Also, there's the fact that I would be dysphoric if I didn't have a dick. Like, I'd love to experience having a vagina for a day or two, hell, having a vagina a few days a month would be fucking rad. 

Also, I very much envy hot femboys and girls w more of a rectangular figure. I have no desire to have an hourglass body, so much so that I'm scared to wear corsets and waiste trainers bc I'm afraid they might give me an hourglass shape. Like, ik that gender identity is not the same as gender expression, but I would much rather be androgynously feminine than traditionally feminine like beauty pageant winners and whatnot. For me, I desire to be cis passing, not bc dysphoria, but for safety. I have hella anxiety and trust issues and I adamantly do not like sticking out. I enjoy being in the background.

In the same way that gender expression doesn't equal gender identity, ik that's even more so true w sexual orientation, but hear me out. So I've realized that I am more attracted to gender expression than gender identity, but I feel just as gay thinking about being w a femboy as I do a fellow trans femme. Also, the more I've come to discover myself, the more the term lesbian feels incongruent. Like, it's kinda weird bc learning about femme lesbians helped me realize I'm trans.

On a final note, while I do like to call myself a trans girl, terms like femboy and catboy don't make me dysphoric at all. Hell, I actually prefer to be called a catboy bc I feel like being called a cat girl implies that I have a vagina, which is something I 100% do not want. 

Apologies for my horrendous writing style and using like and also to start half of my sentences. Feel free to ask me questions, I just really want to know if I'm non binary or not. Like, I kinda feel like I am, but I kinda feel like a fraud doing so.

Advice for my partner on pronouns (I’m not out everywhere)	I just started using my correct pronouns last year, and I use them only with friends and chosen family, not with bio family or work. My partner of 18 years is struggling to get my “new” pronouns right in contexts where I am out, and one of his concerns is switching between different contexts. I’ve tried to be clear where I am not out, so I don’t think that is the issue, more the habit and essentially “code switching”. I do plan to be more clear that if he’s going to make mistakes, I’d rather he use my birth pronouns in places where I’m out, than that he use my correct pronouns where I am not out. But do y’all have any advice for us other than that? Like, it’s hard enough learning new pronouns for someone, and he’s definitely trying hard, but also the part where he can’t use them *all* the time for my comfort — and safety (emotional if not physical).		m7gx05	NonBinary	2	1.0	2021-03-18 02:22:26
Newby has questions	"After spending most of the year fighting to get on T I finally got a doctor to agree to give me the lowest micro dose. It's lower than I'd like but safety is important so I have questions. Perfectly comfortable using needles BTW as it's not the only subQ medication I use 
1. I'm doing subQ injections and I'm not sure if the pharmacy gave me the right syringe. What size syringe is best for extraction?
2. I'm planning on traveling by car for the holidays and while I'm away I'll need to do a shot once. Can I prefill the syringe and attach the correct needle before leaving, instead of bringing everything with me? I know I still will need to ensure there aren't any bubbles but I'm hoping to cut time. I doubt I'll have enough time and my family isn't supportive. It will be NYE day 
3. What is the fastest way to get rid of the bubbles? I've tried tapping and snapping but bubbles don't move too fast especially since it's thick and sticky. On average, how long does it take you from extraction, ensuring bubbles are gone and injecting? Think it took 20- 25 minutes"	"1. You can use whatever size syringe as long as your dose is marked on it

2. No. For cleanliness/ sterility reasons pre filling a syringe and especially attaching a needle to it is a very bad idea

3. I was told at my shot training appointment that I could just push the bubbles back into the vial. What I was told to do is fill the syringe with air to what my dose is and inject it into the vial (above the level of the liquid). Then I pull back on the plunger, getting a decent amount into the syringe. There will be bubbles but then you can push them back in and check the level. Add or subtract as much as you need, pull it out and attach the needle you inject with (I assume it's a different size since you do subq).

How do I come out and use neopronouns	"(Notes for safety:  MAJOR CONTENT WARNING! I talk about being publicly outed, not in graphic details but mentioned also this was supposed to be an ask, it didn’t work that way)

The short version of this whole rant: help tiny autistic enby doesn’t know how to come out because trauma from being publicly outed has left em incapable of bringing eirself to come out again even though eh know eh are physically, financially, emotionally and mentally safe this time. So eh are asking as nicely as eh can that someone please tell em a good none terrifying way of telling eir close friends eh want to use eh/em/eir pronouns and that eh are completely nonbinary.

The longer version: This might just be my internalised enbyphobia but like.... while I’m usually mostly comfortable even if not 100% with He/Him and They/Them pronouns I do have a extremely strong connection to eh/em/eir pronouns and Gods what I would do if everyone used those pronouns to refer to me, but I’m a coward who’s currently to scared to even come out completely (even though basically everyone either knows or suspects and I’ve kinda subtly been trying to come out for almost 9 years now but I’ve been publicly known as trans for 6 because yae when you get publicly outed as the wrong identity , going mute for a month and then only talking to 4 people for the next year once you can talk again is not the right response but like at least they were close right mate? Right?. Like so much went wrong and was so bad when I was outed, and I won’t go into specifics but how am I supposed to come out when A, I’ve been publicly out for years as trans because I thought couldn’t take that back once everyone believed it, and B I go mute and chock up for hours anytime I try to come out to any new person other than the ones who do know? 

Only a few people are actually like 100% factually aware that I am nonbinary, and by a few I mean 3 there’s 3 people who explicitly know, and they use they/them for me most of the time, but I’m so scared to ask them to use a neopronoun set for me, they aren’t enbyphobic, hell two are queer, one of the queer ones being nonbinary herself (it’s a she day), and the other has a pansexual demigirl fiancé, I know theyd respect it and stand with me when I eventually come out completely, but how do I actually like explain it to them, like how do I explain how it works and why this is what I want because I know I don’t owe it to them but I love these people and I want to be able to ask and explain why but every time I go to do so I cut myself off, and go mute for a few hours because I’m terrified for no good reason.

Really I just want advice on how I can safely come out to more people, and like calm the anxiety that comes with coming out without shutting down completely (something I do far to often) and I really do want to know how to bring up neopronouns because it’s just not something we ever talk about, all the enby people I know in real life use she, he, and/or they pronouns and none of them ever talk about neopronouns... and yes I am a nonbinary asking a nonbinary subreddit how to come out at nonbinary because I’m terrified of coming out to other nonbinary people (I mean also cis and binary trans folks too but a rather large little group of enbirs are in this group) as nonbinary don’t judge me."	"Can you communicate better in writing? I have a milder version of what you talk about, finding it hard to talk about emotional things verbally, but writing gives me a bit of space to plan out what I'm going to say and I can choose not to read the response for a while if I'm not ready to know.
Best of luck xx
I'm so sorry.

I can't help.

I feel the need to say.

Us enby autistics need to watch out for eachother.

If you want you can reach out to me when ever you want or Feel the need to.

Also I might DM you
Also it will probably help to include examples of how to use your pronouns, as most people haven't heard them in everyday usage
Thank you so much, it means a lot to see someone being so nice seriously thank you
Yeah I might write them a letter or email about it that’s actually I really good idea thank you love!"	kuahii	NonBinary	2	1.0	2021-01-10 08:06:14
AMAB NB going off and on E?	So I'm fairly fluid and go through periods where I'm all about taking the E (no blockers) and then periods where I just stop entirely. Been struggling to find any resources or research on the effects or safety of going off and on. Not looking for medical advice or anything, just wondering if anyone has seen any studies or resources on that I could check out, or have similar experience?		1226t37	NonBinary	2	1.0	2023-03-26 01:29:40
Sadly day for me	I got a $50 dollar gift card to target and my first thought was “Yay! I can finally get a binder without my mom knowing” only to find out that they don’t sell them. I know that I only have a year before I go to college but I’m terrified that I will have to stay in state bc if I do that means I will be closeted for the next 4 years. I’m tired of wearing clothes I hate and I want a binder so fucking bad but even with the free ones, they can’t guarantee when it’ll get here and I can’t take that safety risk. I’m just so overwhelmed so dysphoric and I know it’ll get better one day but it’s thought today.	"I know u aren’t asking for advice, but do you have any friends nearby who’d let you ship to their house? That’s how I got mine, I pretended to “hang out” with them at their place and just picked up the binder in their room ;) I’ve also heard people ship it to friends and do trade offs at parks or something lol
I would definitely do this if I had friends hahaha"	nltp42	NonBinary	2	1.0	2021-05-26 22:52:05
50 mg once a day.	"Hi Everyone.

A 51 yr. old amab here who started hrt therapy about 3 months a go.
My Endo. prescribed 50 mg. once a day, and .025 transdermal Estro. patches once a week. This is really because i told him i want to go slow with therapy for safety reasons.
I have been on Spiro. but not on Estro. yet. I read a bit more on Estro and read about blood clot risk. Even though risk is low, it scared me. 
Could anyone that may be on Estro. patches explain their experience with it?

Thank you!"		y5s8vf	NonBinary	2	1.0	2022-10-16 21:20:08
Tips for looking masc while wearing a dress?	"(Using a throwaway for safety reasons)

I'm currently not out to anyone rn, but I have to wear a dress for my upcoming quinceañera, and it's honestly been really stressful. I tried finding resources to help with this situation, but I haven't found any, and I feel alone.

Thankfully the quinceañera isn't too formal, so I can probably wear a more casual dress. I'm planning to wear black boots and probably a jean jacket with a purple dress (I haven't picked it yet) for a more gothic style. 

Has anyone gone through a similar situation? Do y'all have any tips?

Thanks in advance, and I luv y'all <3"	"Idk about quincañeras or what's appropriate to your family, but things I might do if it were me (I'm a NB AFAB who likes to present/dress masc):

* choose a dark, solid color like dark blue.
* get a dress with a minimalist feel to it, avoiding glitter, ribbons, flowers, etc.
* boots
* a masc jacket or blazer can be worn with it
* make sure the dress is kind of loose and comfortable (I'd be doing that anyway, even if I preferred feminine clothing)

I would also avoid something too sexy, but that's just me. I hate that dresses are so often designed to accentuate the female body for the male gaze. Why don't they design these things for the bodily comfort of the person wearing them?

My prom dress was kind of sparkly and showy but bc it was gold and black I didn't feel too feminine. And I enjoy this other short, basic navy blue dress I wear to weddings.
Thank you sm, this was really helpful <3"	q7r4jc	NonBinary	2	1.0	2021-10-14 03:10:17
Gift ideas!	"Hello! Christmas is coming up and I'm making my annual list of friend presents. One of my best friends is non-binary in an unsupportive environment. It's important to note that their safety is not at risk - more like a small town that barely has a LGBT population, let alone anyone non-binary.  Unfortunately, I live in another state and only see them every so often. They don't have reliable access to transportation, so I'd prefer my gift to be something I can mail. 

Is there anything you all wished you were given that would have supported you in your non-binary journey? Something that would have helped make your lives easier, or made you feel loved/accepted? For their birthday I sent them the book ""Gender Failure"" (I found it on this sub), which I read beforehand and wrote up a letter on my thoughts and favorite parts. They really appreciated that! I'm leaning towards sending them a new binder and some masculine clothes, since they have enough feminine stuff.

Any thoughts? Thanks in advance!"	"A gift card to their favorite clothing store would be nice. I really love that you sent a letter of your thoughts along with the book—that’s a very engaging and sweet way of “upping the ante” on books-as-gifts.

I love the book SuperBetter—it’s not transition specific, but it’s definitely applicable. It’s a scientific exploration of the science of video games and positive psychology, from one of the world’s first PHDs in the science of video games.

I’ve been using the ideas in this book to pursue medical transition, but I’ve also had it in my back pocket to help me quit smoking, escape from abuse and start over financially, and legally change my name. Basically, I think anybody facing a major challenge will get a lot out of this book (this is true for challenges that they’ve chosen, or those they’ve had thrown at them).

Thanks for asking your question here—you seem like a wonderful friend 😊
Oh my goodness thank you for the book recommendation!! That sounds awesome, and I'll be looking into it for myself too haha.

When they first came out as non-binary I realized that I had a decent amount of exposure to the experiences that homosexual people go through (media exposure, books, memoirs, history lessons, etc.). But I was absolutely lacking in non-binary knowledge, which I felt was unacceptable. Obviously I have no real idea what they're going through because it's not my personal journey - but the amount of effort it takes to learn more about the issues my best friend is facing is so miniscule in comparison to the massive effort it took for them to reach this stage of self-understanding!"	a2qc50	NonBinary	2	0.67	2018-12-03 16:41:14
Ah, an old classic... What box to check on forms?	"I'm applying for an updated social security card and new passport after a name change, and they both require you check either Male or Female... but I'm really neither/either any way you slice it.

I'm AFAB but have had top surgery and a hysto, took T for 4 years and am always assumed male despite looking generally androgynous. Since I'm not male, don't want to be seen as such, and 'female' from a doctor's perspective, I feel more inclined to check F. But then that could cause issues with looking how I do and having a male-assumed name... and I think my insurance has me as M as well. Right now I'm leaning more towards F since that at least has some medical/historical credibility, but I really don't know. Either way feels like a safety issue or unwarranted bad feels for the sake of not drawing attention.


Feeling really stuck, has anyone been through this or have advice?"	"it's probably safer to check M if that's what people assume you are. having mismatched can cause issues (and SS and stuff like that isn't really for medical reasons anyway)
I have a slightly different dilemma, wherein I changed my name to a male-assumed one long ago, pre-T. Now (about 1.5 yrs in) I'm quite androgynous but expect that to also shift to 100% male-passing by the time my passport renewal comes up in 1.5 years (which has to be done, I live overseas). From what I've read, a doctor's letter confirming your 'finished' transition is necessary for changing a passport gender marker. I haven't had any surgery and don't think I will by the time the renewal rolls around, which makes me very reluctant to change it to M then. I used to think I would definitely change it if I were in your post-op situation, until I read someone's perspective that they will never change it to M because they don't want to ever end up in a men's prison, now I'm not so sure.   
To be honest, I have traveled on my F passport when I was starting to be read as male more consistently after a few months in on T, and my experiences make me think no one looks that closely at the gender marker anyways (unless you're in the U.S. with the body scanners, I guess?). At this time I had booked a female dorm in a hostel (in Asia) and when I tried to check in, the receptionist thought I had made a mistake, until he looked very closely at my gender marker and apologized.  
The only time I have ever really had a problem with things 'not matching' was being pre-T and trying to enter Ukraine where my name is VERY male gendered. The unfriendly immigration officer at a remote border crossing asked me if I was male or female, and if I was female, why did I have that name? In the end, my middle name is very female-assumed there, so she let me in. What I'm trying to get at here is that if your name and appearance match, I don't think anyone is going to be looking too closely at your marker if you're just traveling. If in the future you're going overseas to work and need a medical check to get a work visa (and will then be using that country's national health insurance), it's another situation (depending on how liberal the country/your sponsor is). In that scenario personally I'd rather just go with the M and let people think I'm a binary man unless I care to tell them otherwise."	jgtag1	NonBinary	2	1.0	2020-10-23 18:53:23
Anyone get the record of their name change sealed?	"I know [in New Jersey](https://www.jdsupra.com/legalnews/good-cause-to-seal-name-change-8930041/) a trans man got the record of his name change sealed without any documentation of specific threats to his safety, but I'm in NY and therefore can't lean on his precedent in our courts or use the same argument he did. If I'm out as nonbinary I can't say I want to go stealth, but ""it feels like the most ultimate humiliation to hear it"" is not a great argument about my actual safety. Has anyone here gotten the record of their name change sealed without some other threat to their safety?"		10voxg4	NonBinary	2	1.0	2023-02-07 01:46:13
Being trans / nb while looking for employment!	"I am wondering what y’all do being nb and looking for a new job. Do y’all mention your pronouns on your resume / in the interview process or mention that once you’re hired (if at all)? 

Are you closeted at work? 

I know being open at work is a personal and a safety concern for some, and a lot do not have the privilege to be fully out. 

I am looking for a new job and I feel like when I mention my pronouns (they/he) in the interview, it is received negatively."	"I'm genderqueer. I went to my interview with a button up shirt and vest and slacks. I panicked during the interview and didn't tell the interviewer my preferred name. So everyone calls me by my legal name. I'm hoping to change that.

There is a lot changing where I work. The uniforms are being changed and my boss is going to retire. 

We have gendered uniforms for people who work for the front. Blouses and slacks for women;  button up shirts and vests for men. But I work in the back (I'm the only full-time employee who works in the back.) I have not been specifically told the uniforms change affects me. 

Assuming the uniform changes affect me, I'm going to ask for a man's uniforms. When I meet the new boss, I plan to introduce myself as Stevie. 

Although I don't care about pronouns, I'm hoping that once I get a man's uniform, people will use male honerifics for me.
Im out to some people at both the places I work. It's not super relevant to my work at all as we dont have gender specific uniforms (or uniforms for that matter). I tell people when it's relevant to the situation. 
Im lucky to work in two progressive, openminded places. At both Ive been around for long enough that the senior people know I do my job well.
Im not afraid to tell anyone, just believe that it's irrelevant most of the time
I did the interview without mentioning anything, but as soon as I was hired I asked to be called by my preferred name and pronouns. I work at a college so I figured they'd be accepting since they work with a diverse population. I told everyone and wear a pin with my pronouns almost every day, but I still get misgendered so much, especially by certain coworkers. Good luck with whatever you do!
I suppose it depends on the job, expectations, how confident you are, how ""differently"" you present. I'm not in much of a position to risk discrimination from a prospective employer, so in the closet for the most part.
If you live somewhere more progressive, including pronouns and a preferred name could be worth a shot. I live in the south so places like school or work aren’t always the best place to be out. But it’s whatever is safest for you"	na3bty	NonBinary	2	0.75	2021-05-11 18:04:32
I Wish I was More Androgynous	"I'm AFAB and newly exploring what it really means for me to be nonbinary. I'm a student paramedic, and I'm desperately trying to finish my field placement so I can finally graduate. I've already decided once I finish, I'm going to start the process toward top surgery (as if I wasn't already motivated enough to graduate lol).


I start a new placement on Thursday. It's not super important to me that my preceptors [the paramedics I work under] know I'm nonbinary, but at the same time it is...? I present female and use she/her pronouns out of ease. Pronouns don't bother me. It doesn't bother me to be addressed as a woman; I just add a little asterisk beside it in my head.



I wish A) I was confident enough to walk in day 1 and go ""Hi I'm Remi-Rix. My pronouns are she/they."" Which is the direction we seem to be going: name+pronouns when introducing yourself. [Let's normalize this shit!] Or B) I looked more androgynous so my preceptors would be (hopefully) more compelled to ask my pronouns.



It's not a safety thing; I'm in Canada, and EMS seems to attract a lot of us LGBTQ+ homies, so I reckon it would be well accepted in a ""ok cool, let's go save some lives"" kinda way. Why do I feel so compelled for it to be known I'm not cis-het? It feels ~*sigh*~ kinda privileged that I constantly out myself through humour


I outed myself as queer at my last placement [and it was totally ok]. It led to a very awkward talk from my well-meaning preceptor. It was ""its all good"" but it had a ""don't ask/don't tell"" vibe to it. My former preceptor is good guy. He was so careful with his word choice; it was honestly really sweet in an out-of-touch-but-supportive-dad way.


The preceptor/student relationship is weird. It's a professional one, but you're with them more than your actual family. I'll be spending 250 hours in a tin box with these people. It's harder to ~not~ get to know someone in this profession.


There's nothing wrong with being cis-het. Why should I care if they perceive me as such? *internal gay panic*"		p1nmv9	NonBinary	1	1.0	2021-08-10 11:52:50
Safety concerns (am I being paranoid?) and how to transition name at work	Hi! I’ve been thinking about changing my legal name and gender marker to reflect me as non-binary. For those of you who have done it, have you faced discrimination and safety issues because of it? And, separately, how did you make the change at work? (I’ve worked at this place a long time and they’re used to calling me by my birth name, using my birth pronouns, and seeing me as the facade I’ve put up, except for recently when I just started being me with how I dress, although I haven’t asked anyone to use a different name or pronouns yet.) I’m just really conflicted between wanting to live freely as myself and facing discrimination and weirdness if I do. Changing my name and gender marker will force people to see me differently and I struggle with negative reactions. Please help! Need advice.		wjwwnp	NonBinary	1	1.0	2022-08-09 07:25:59
Help me with picking a binder!! This is critical!!	"Hi so i’m nonbinary/transmasc and my desire to get a binder has just been increasing lately. I had heard good things about gc2b and i was already settled on the decision that i would order from them, but then i read that their quality sucks nowadays and the sizing is off!! :d

I don’t know where i should order now. I wanted a racerback binder for multiple reasons, and i can’t really afford anything pricier than that (gc2b racerback binder is 45€ i think). 

I’m a minor and closeted for my own safety (🥲) so i can’t really just try out different ones and return the ones that don’t fit. I’d have to order one and just hope that it’s gonna be a fit the first time.

I have also heard that there are binders on amazon? Are they any good? Would you recommend them?

Do you think i could buy a gc2b binder even though their quality has gone down? i’m an a cup and pretty flat with just a sports bra on so the binder wont be under stress."	"TomboyX is also a pretty good company. 

Saved this post a little while ago for this exact reason: https://www.reddit.com/r/lgbt/comments/z77um9/how\_to\_wear\_a\_binder\_safely\_a\_comprehensive\_guide/
Underworks is the best I've tried. Their packaging is also very nondiscript and they sell all sorts of  stuff, including compression sports bras and shapewear as well as binders in case anyone in your family gets nosy or something. I don't recommend buying from Amazon because if you manage to find something safe on there, they might send you something else anyway because of the way their sorting system sucks
I ordered one form an Asian company on Amazon and it was a good one for the first time. Actually ordered a second one because I lost much weight. Wasn’t too expensive as well (I think with shipping it was 32€)… so there are some and if you take care of it, it can last!

First binder advice for a big-tittied enby??	I'm AFAB, I want to get a binder but don't know where to start. I took my measurements today and according to the sizing chart on the website I was looking at, my shoulders are a small, and my bust is a 3XL.... I'm worried that my chest is too large for a binder to be much use. I also saw that safe/good websites don't accept returns. I've been reading up on safety but don't know how that works with sizing/large bust sizes. I'm hoping someone out there has some similar experience and could give me some advice. I've started to think about reduction/top surgery as well, so any insight to that would be appreciated as well. 💕	I’m huge and have had no luck finding binders or any of that. You might consider looking into a corset or wearing 2 bras. I can’t afford $10k for a reduction, my insurance doesn’t cover them for any reason, so I’m kinda stuck with them for now. I don’t want to completely get rid of my boobs since my husband would be pretty sad if I did, but it would be nice to be much smaller.	q1m8lf	NonBinary	1	1.0	2021-10-05 03:16:41
Fear of Changing Name?	The name I go by is just a shortened version of my birth name, which is sort of my safety blanket to fall back on in case someone I don't want having sensitive information finds out I'm queer. How do you deal with the fear of others figuring out your identity based on a name change? I know plenty of cis people do change their names	"For me I personally don't care of people know I'm a transfeminine genderfluid enby. My name was changed to Artemis(Art or Artie for short) and more people seem to connect me to Artemis Fowl, Artemus Gordon than to Artemis Black(Harry Potter character) or the Greek goddes Artemis. My advice is if you want to change your name do so and own it.

Ps I'm not trying to be rude, I'm just a bit blunt and tired of people trying to deny others of who they are.
Thank you for your input. And, that is such a pretty name! I name all of my pets after Greek gods and goddesses :)"	s7iyux	NonBinary	1	0.67	2022-01-19 05:50:06
Binder AND shapewear experience?	I've been thrifting the past few weeks to shift my wardrobe closer to how I want to present, and this morning I went to Goodwill to find some shorts. They had zero women's shorts (I know; it's probably too early), but I did find several men's shorts to try on. I found a few I liked EXCEPT that they really emphasized all of the things I absolutely hate about my tummy area. So I ended up going home feeling a bit defeated. I'm thinking about getting some shapewear, but I'm unsure about wearing it with a binder/compression top, mostly from a safety/breathing standpoint. Does anyone have experience wearing both? If so, did you feel fine? Miserable? Ready to take it off 5 minutes later? (Also, if anyone has suggestions for good shapewear, I'm all ears!)	"I haven't tried both yet, but I wear shapewear for cosplay a lot. When you are looking for shapewear, remember to go by your shirt size and if you have issues breathing in it alone, chances are that it's too small. You'll feel like a stuffed sausage, but as long as you can breathe normally, that's all that matters!
Are you doing half or full tank binders? Because the full tank ones should squish your belly a bit too (that's why I don't it wear half ones)
I’m just doing a really snug sports bra at the moment, but looking into the half compression tops, mostly because I don’t always need tummy compression, and I get really hot really quickly in layers. But that’s good to know about the full ones, thanks! Back to researching!"	118buxq	NonBinary	1	1.0	2023-02-21 18:08:14

Feeling weird about changing names	"(burner account for safety reasons)

So I'm feeling very ambiguous about my name(s) lately and would love to hear from others who've felt the same.

Ever since I was a baby no one has ever called me by my full birth name. Everyone's always called me by a cute femme nickname. Then several months ago I started trying a more masc/neutral nickname. But now no matter WHAT name I give, I always feel weird and bad after and immediately wish I'd given the other one lol. I like my femme nickname but sometimes (especially with strangers and colleagues) it makes me feel small and weak, like a little girl instead of the empowered, professional, nonbinary adult I am/want to be. I like my masc nickname but it still doesn't really feel like ""me"" and hearing it from people who know me intimately, or who've used my femme nickname all my life, makes me feel so sad and cringey.

I don't like my full legal name so I was hoping to use the more masc nickname in professional contexts instead since it feels more professional and adult to me than the femme nickname, but now I'm having doubts. I'm going through a lot of change (getting close to turning 30 which is a construct but also real, changing careers etc) so I'm not sure if this is just a confusing time in general, or if I'm on some level feeling pressure to start my new career/new decade with a shiny new name. Or is it just internalized patriarchal, cisnormative b/s that makes me feel like I can't be ""professional,"" ""adult,"" or ""nonbinary"" enough with a cutesy femme nickname?

Anyone else felt weird and complicated about changing your name? What did you do/did the new name ever stick/how long did it take?

All yall's kindness and wisdom is appreciated :)"		m24p9u	NonBinary	1	0.67	2021-03-10 18:29:01
Question about piercing safety	Hi, I’m not sure if i should post this in a piercing subreddit or not but I was wondering if it is safe for me to be chest binding for 6-8 hours at a time, once or twice a week with piercings? I use the TomboyX binder.	"I assume you mean nipple piercings because I don't see how any other piercing would affect binding.

I have piercing in both of my nipples and I wear a binder periodically when I'm not using tape. I don't think piercings affect binding that much, other than making nipples a stick out a bit more (at least for me it does). I've had the piercings before the binder, so I can't really compare, but I'd think piercings make nipples more prone to chafing from the binder. I've found that using nipple covers or just plasters over nipples helps prevent that
Thank u! My friends have suggested covers to me. Is there any specific ones you’d recommend? or will just any nipple coverage do
I just use plasters and it has been fine, so I'd assume any nipple cover will do.
Sick I’ll check some out, thank u"	11hp92u	NonBinary	1	1.0	2023-03-04 04:19:57
questioning nonbinary kid has questions	"[ kind of a long post, buckle up ]
hello everyone,, i’m quite new to reddit as a whole but i figured i’d ask!! my name is rainer/laurie and i’m 15-18 (not specifying for safety) and afab. 
i’ve been questioning my gender starting january of 2021 and it has been a long four months. i believe i also questioned 2-3 years ago from some diary entries but i severely repressed myself when i switched schools so i cant quite remember lol
anyways, here’s the thing, i’m quite sure i’m not cis. i’ve really been connecting with the term nonbinary recently after finally letting myself use it and accepting i’m not a woman. i have found myself loving he/him and they/them pronouns on myself but i haven’t told many yet. i’m also okay with she/her but using my birth set of pronouns and being okay with it makes me feel like i’m faking everything. i think i mainly just use she/her and am relatively okay with it because it’s what i’m used to but idk.
i’m rambling at this point but i just feel lost and confused about myself. also i didn’t proof read this at all sorry if there’s any typos <3"	"Awesome! It sounds like you've got some good ideas about who you are and what presentation choices you're comfortable with. So.... what can we help you with? What are your questions?
i feel like that because i still am relatively okay with using she/her that i’m faking it. i know some  people use all pronouns and that’s super cool but i feel like when i do it i’m faking being nonbinary,, idk man ://
Non-binary people can use she/her pronouns. Non-binary people, like everyone else, can use any pronouns they feel comfortable with. There's no requirement that you give up she/her in order to use the non-binary label.

Non-binary is just a word. You don't have to pass a test and get a license to use it like you do a car. There are no police waiting to arrest you for calling yourself nb when you're ""not non-binary enough."" There is no ""faking it"" to worry about, because it's literally just a word, nothing more.

Your experience of gender is unique to you. All non-binary is is a word you can use to *describe* that experience. Since it's your experience, you can use literally any words you wish to describe it.

What's the most successful explanation you've given when someone asks you about being an enby and what nonbinary means?	"So, I've had to describe my gender identity before to folks and I've had people ask me questions, which i am beyond used to at this point. But my boyfriend and i have decided that it's about damn time i come out to his parents as enby and he comes out as bi. However, because of the situation he's currently in, im gonna be the one coming out first (which is fine, i actually don't mind because i barely know his folks so there isn't any threat to my safety in that regard). His parents are very christian, have next to no exposure to trans folks (let alone enbies), and tend to be very centrist in their views. Usually i wouldn't give a shit if they approved or not, but because my boyfriend isn't out yet, i need to tiptoe around a few questions that i know for a fact they're going to have while also try to discreetly carve a safe path for him to take. 

All of this is to ask: what's the best way you have described how you knew you were non-binary? I'm sure my experience is gonna be different from yours and whoever else's, but i need backups for when i run out of rope. Any other questions i can think of are easily answerable for me because I've had to answer it a thousand times. But that one is always tough for me, for some reason. Because just saying ""idk, i just am"" apparently isn't enough for most cis people."		mrpspr	NonBinary	1	1.0	2021-04-15 22:31:52
Want to get a binder, so i have a few qns!	"What are some rules/safety precautions when getting a binder?

I've only heard of not using it when doing excersises like sports or running like that, and can't wear for more than a certain amount of time. did i miss out anything?
 
pls recommend some good binder brands/shops :)

also pls add important things i should know about binders/when wearing them !!! thank you <3"	"Ease yourself into wearing it. Start with 30 minutes and add from there. Don't wear it over 8 hours and don't exercise in it. Avoid ones with clasps/closures (they can mess up your ribs) and listen to your body. It's not gonna be comfortable but it shouldn't hurt. If it hurts take it off!


I generally recommend underworks. Spectrum looks like a good brand and I've heard good things but they're out of my budget. Gc2b used to be the go to but they've always run small and I've been hearing that they've been having quality issues. Keep in mind that these are all online, I've never heard of a physical store that sells binders (besides when target sold some of the glorified sports bras from tomboyx during pride month and then got rid of them)"	you69q	NonBinary	1	0.67	2022-11-07 17:36:31
How do you deal with forms?	How do you deal with forms that use sex/gender interchangeably? Prescription medications require your Sex Assigned at Birth for the pharmacy to check for drug interactions and safety concerns. If you have commercial insurance, then they'll check your Gender on file, usually provided by your employer that only provides male/female options, not a non-binary 3rd option. What do transgender and non-binary patients do?	"When possible, address your specific circumstance to the provider directly. When that's not an option, check the box you feel is the least likely to wind up with you having medication that could kill you. Either way, lobby your insurance company, employer, elected officials and anyone else who will listen that these forms need to be more inclusive because sex isn't a binary, it isn't static, and it certainly isn't the same thing as gender.
I usually use my agab, just bc it's easier than trying to explain what's up with my gender. Sometimes, like with the hospital I use, they have options for trans patients to give their gender and preferred pronouns.
It depends on what it's for. If it's insurance stuff or doctors that will need to know what kind of anatomy they're dealing with, I go with my agab. When I go to Walgreens for a covid test I usually alternate. I also make a point to find out who I can complain to about it
I'm with the others. use agab when it matters for things like health. Otherwise, flip a coin. If they don't understand that gender <> sex, that's their problem. Pick whatever suits you best at the time."	trs0en	NonBinary	0	0.5	2022-03-29 22:48:21
